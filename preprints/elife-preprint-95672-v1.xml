<title>Abstract</title><p>Astrocytes derive from different lineages and play a critical role in neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI). Whether selective eliminating these main origins of astrocytes in lumbar enlargement could attenuate SCI-induced neuropathic pain remains unclear. In this study, astrocytes in lumbar enlargement were lineage traced, targeted and selectively eliminated through transgenic mice injected with an adeno-associated virus vector and diphtheria toxin. Pain-related behaviors were measured with an electronic von Frey apparatus and a cold/hot plate after SCI. RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, molecular experiment and immunohistochemistry were used to explore the potential mechanisms after astrocyte elimination. Through lineage tracing, we concluded the resident astrocytes but not ependymal cells were the main origins of astrocytes-induced neuropathic pain. SCI induced mice to obtain significant pain symptoms and astrocyte activation in lumbar enlargement. Selective resident astrocytes elimination in lumbar enlargement could attenuate neuropathic pain and activate microglia. Interestingly, the type I interferons (IFNs) signal was significantly activated after astrocytes elimination, and the most activated Gene Ontology terms and pathways were associated with the type I IFNs signal which was mainly activated in microglia and further verified in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, different concentrations of interferon and Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist could activate the type I IFNs signal in microglia. Our results elucidate that selectively eliminating resident astrocytes attenuated neuropathic pain associated with type I IFNs signal activation in microglia. Targeting type I IFNs signal is proven to be an effective strategy for neuropathic pain treatment after SCI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause sensorimotor deficits and autonomic changes, and approximately 65% of SCI patients suffer chronic, severe neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Henwood and Ellis, 2004</xref>). Long-term unrelieved pain will hinder the patient’s rehabilitation training, delay functional recovery, and seriously affect the patient’s physical and mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Henwood and Ellis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Masri and Keller, 2012</xref>). Unfortunately, the effect of current treatments for neuropathic pain is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dworkin et al., 2003</xref>). Exploring an effective treatment for neuropathic pain is a major clinical challenge. Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cell in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dozio and Sanchez, 2018</xref>). Accumulating studies have shown that astrocytes play a key role in the induction and maintenance of persistent pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). Cytokines and chemokines produced by astrocytes can powerfully modulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in pain circuits, leading to central sensitization, and a transition from acute to chronic neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ji et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ji <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kawasaki et al., 2008</xref>). Inhibiting the proliferation of spinal astrocytes or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression could reduce neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ji <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tsuda et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Astrocytes are mainly derived from resident astrocytes, NG2 progenitor and ependymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnabé-Heider et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sofroniew, 2009</xref>). SCI leads to massive proliferation of resident astrocytes, which are the most abundant and mainly located around the scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnabé-Heider <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sabelstrom et al., 2014</xref>). Ependyma is regarded as the main source of endogenous neural stem cells, which widely migrate to injury area and generate the majority of neuroprotective astrocytes after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnabé-Heider <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Meletis et al., 2008</xref>). However, we found that only a small number of ependymal cells could proliferate and migrate to the lesion score after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ren <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). NG2 cells, also known as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, were previously considered to be the component of glial scar after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Church et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hackett and Lee, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hesp et al., 2015</xref>). While, reports about their functions are still controversial, partly because there are several cell types that up-regulate proteoglycan NG2 after SCI, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, pericytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nishiyama et al., 2005</xref>). Until now, there is limited data on the main origins of astrocytes-induced neuropathic pain after SCI and whether selectively target these astrocytes could attenuate neuropathic pain is still unclear.</p>
<p>Cervical and thoracic SCI often induce below-level neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gwak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shiao and Lee-Kubli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Vierck, 2020</xref>), partly through activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ono et al., 2020</xref>). The expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in lumbar enlargement was closely associated with below-level neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Honjoh et al., 2019</xref>). Mainly because the ascending tracts and superficial dorsal horn (SDH) in lumbar enlargement are closely associated with proprioception and pain signal processing of the lower limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Watson, 2012</xref>). Thus, targeting the astrocytes in lumbar enlargement may improve neuropathic pain after cervical or thoracic SCI.</p>
<p>In this study, we constructed a C57/BL6 mouse neuropathic pain model with spinal cord contusion at thoracic level 10 (T10). Pain behaviors were measured by an electronic von Frey apparatus and a cold/hot plate. Transgenic mice and lineage tracing were used to determine the main origins of astrocytes-induced neuropathic pain after SCI. To investigate if eliminating these astrocytes in lumbar enlargement could attenuate neuropathic pain after SCI, we used the transgenic mice, adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector and diphtheria toxin (DT). We identified a previously undescribed improvement effects of targeting these astrocytes on neuropathic pain. Combining with RNA sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, immunohistochemistry, molecular experiment and cultured microglial cells, we further explore the potential mechanisms of pain relief after selective astrocytes elimination.</p>

<title>Resident astrocytes but not ependymal cells were the main origins of astrocytes-induced neuropathic pain after SCI</title>
<p>The construction strategies of transgenic mice were described in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>. The brain slices from C57BL/6-Foxj1<italic><sup>em1(GFP-CreERT2-polyA)Smoc</sup></italic> mice showed that choroids plexus in both fourth ventricle and lateral ventricle had been labeled by reporter gene EGFP (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). However, EGFP positive cells were not found in central canal of spinal cord under normal condition (data not shown), indicating that ependymal cells may not be activated. Therefore, C57BL/6-Foxj1<italic><sup>em1(GFP-CreERT2-polyA)Smoc</sup></italic> mice were used to establish contusion SCI models and examine the activation and differentiation of ependymal cells. As we reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ren <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>), we found ependymal cells did not transform to astrocytes in the lesion area (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). S100 family protein p11 (S100A10) is previously regarded as a marker of neuroprotective astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>), but not unique and expressed by various cell types (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1A-C</bold>). Instead, ependymal cells were observed to produce offspring of Tuj1 positive neurons, Oligo2 negative and S100A10 positive cells in epicenter (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref></bold>). Totally, ependymal cells did not transform to astrocytes as well as Oligo2 positive oligodendrocytes. Therefore, the resident astrocytes but not ependymal cells were the main origins of astrocytes-induced neuropathic pain after SCI.</p>

<title>Using transgenic mice and AAV vectors could selectively target resident astrocytes in lumbar enlargement</title>
<p>The experiment flowchart was described in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>. Compared with the sham group, the SCI group showed increased astrocytes activation (GFAP expression) in ventral spinothalamic tracts (VST, 65.08 ± 2.25 vs. 52.71 ± 1.02), SDH (59.62 ± 2.21 vs. 49.05 ± 1.30, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and Supplementary Figure 2A</bold>), dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSC, 81.64 ± 3.63 vs. 51.69 ± 1.22), gracile fasciculi (GR, 58.37 ± 1.89 vs. 49.63 ± 0.83) and ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSC, 75.73 ± 2.21 vs. 50.88 ± 1.29). Thus, astrocytes activation in the lumbar enlargement is associated with neuropathic pain after SCI. AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre with a minimal GFAP promoter was used to selectively target resident astrocytes of <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>em1(CAG-LSL-tdTomato-2A-DTR)Smoc</sup></italic> mice. AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre (1:3 dilution, ≥ 0.33E+13 V.G/ml) was injected into the spinal cord of mice (n=3, <bold>Supplementary Figure 2B</bold>). Two weeks after AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre injection, immunofluorescence staining showed that a large number of astrocytes were labelled (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2B</bold>). Meanwhile, almost no tdTomato-positive cells were found in NEUN-positive neurons or Oligo2-positive oligodendrocytes (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2B</bold> and unshown data). To explore the optimal virus concentration, different dilutions including 1:10 (≥1E+12 V.G/ml), 1:100 (≥1E+11 V.G/ml), 1:250 (≥0.4E+11 V.G/ml), 1:500 (≥0.2E+11 V.G/ml), 1:1000 (≥1E+10 V.G/ml) and 1:10000 (≥1E+9 V.G/ml), were set for injection. Immunofluorescence results of spinal cord tissue and slices revealed that the dilution of 1:100 (≥1E+11 V.G/ml) was the optimal intervention concentration for concentrations below 1:100 can hardly target astrocytes (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2B</bold> and unshown data). Then AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre (≥1E+11 V.G/ml) was injected into <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>em1(CAG-LSL-tdTomato-2A-DTR)Smoc</sup></italic> mice 2 weeks before T10 contusion. We found that the labeled resident astrocytes were mainly located in the dorsal side of lumbar enlargement (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). It was also found that the labeled astrocytes by AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre accounted for 39.03 ± 1.97% astrocytes in dorsal side of SDH (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). All labeled astrocytes in SCI+AAV+DT group were eliminated after DT injection (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>) and the expression of GFAP was significantly decreased in dorsal side after resident astrocytes elimination (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Pain-related behaviors were measured with an electronic von Frey apparatus and a cold/hot plate, including mechanical allodynia, thermal and cold hyperalgesia. The pain test was carried out as described in the experiment flowchart (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). After contusion, the mice showed a complete hindlimb paralysis and weight loss, and these effects gradually recovered (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref></bold>). We found that the 5 g impactor and 6.25 mm height contusion could induce mice to obtain obvious pain symptoms (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-F</xref></bold>). Mechanical allodynia (reflected by paw withdrawal threshold) occurred at 14 dpi (day post injury, left hindlimb cut-offs vs. baseline; right hindlimb cut-offs vs. baseline), peaked at 28 dpi and sustained until 43 dpi (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref></bold>). Cold hyperalgesia (reflected by paw withdrawal frequency) and thermal hyperalgesia (reflected by paw withdrawal latency) also occurred at 14 dpi, peaked at 43 dpi (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref></bold>).

<p>A total of 36 mice with neuropathic pain were randomly selected to receive diphtheria toxin (DT) injection on 31, 32 and 34 dpi (male= 18, female= 18, SCI+AAV+DT group), and the 36 mice left were classified as control group (male= 18, female= 18, SCI+AAV group). Then pain tests were carried out on 35 dpi after DT injection. We observed that motor function (BMS score) and weight did not change significantly in mice of SCI+AAV+DT group after selective resident astrocytes elimination in the lumbar enlargement (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref></bold>). Mechanical allodynia of the left hindlimb attenuated after selective astrocytes elimination at 35 dpi (first day after astrocytes elimination, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). The pain attenuation effects peaked at 41 dpi (seventh day after astrocytes elimination, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). The mechanical allodynia of the right hindlimb was relieved after selective astrocytes elimination at 38 dpi (fourth day after astrocytes elimination), and the pain attenuation effects peaked at 41 dpi (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). The attenuation of both cold and thermal pain occurred at 38 dpi, and the pain attenuation effects peaked at 41 dpi (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref></bold>). To further determine the effect of selective astrocytes elimination on hindlimb pain, we measured the pain parameters on left and right hindlimbs, and observed no obvious difference between them (data not shown). Furthermore, we explored the effect of sex on neuropathic pain, and observed no significant differences between male and female mice (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3A-H</bold>). In addition, we examined the effect of DT injection alone on neuropathic pain of wild-type mice after contusion. The contusion models were constructed as mentioned above. We observed that pain response was similar in wild-type mice with or without DT injection (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4A</bold>).</p>

<title>Selective resident astrocytes elimination activated the type I IFNs signal in lumbar enlargement</title>
<p>To explore the potential mechanisms of pain attenuation after selective resident astrocytes elimination, RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis were conducted. RNA-seq analysis revealed that there were few DEGs between the sham group and sham AAV group (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4C</bold>). Between SCI+AAV group and sham AAV group, 1872 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in SCI+AAV group, including 1654 upregulated and 218 downregulated genes, as shown in volcano map (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4D</bold>). The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the abundance of DEGs enriched in several biological processes, which were associated with immune responses including immune system processes, inflammatory responses and innate immune responses (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4E-F</bold>). Compared with SCI+AAV group, the SCI+AAV+DT group (astrocytes elimination group) had 1120 DEGs, including 688 upregulated and 432 downregulated genes. We observed that the upregulated DEGs after selective resident astrocytes elimination were mainly enriched in regulating interferons (IFNs) production and signal transduction of type I IFNs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Owens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rothhammer et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>Although various cells in the central nervous system can synthesize and secrete interferons, microglia are resident immune cells and are believed to be the main source of IFN-β within the central nervous system during inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Owens <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Reinert and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Reinert et al., 2016</xref>) identified microglia as the primary producers of type I IFNs. We also found that ISG15 and IRF7 were co-located with the microglial marker IBA1 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). Thus, ISG15 and IRF7 were mainly expressed by microglia. To further confirmed the expression of type I IFNs signaling factors were derived from microglia, the cultured and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-activated microglia were used. Compared with the results for the control microglia (without LPS stimulation), the RT-PCR results revealed that 0.2 μg/mL LPS mainly activated pro-inflammatory microglia, including the pro-inflammatory microglial markers TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref></bold>). Anti-inflammatory microglial markers, including IL-4, TGF-β, IL-10, and Arg-1, were not significantly increased (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref></bold>). Additionally, RT-PCR results showed the upregulated mRNA expression of type I IFNs signaling critical genes in LPS-activated microglia, including <italic>STING1, STAT2, STAT1, ISG15, IRF9,</italic> and <italic>IRF3</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref></bold>).

<p>In order to further verify the activation of type I IFNs signal in microglia, we used different concentrations of interferon agonist (Ploy:IC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Khorooshi et al., 2015</xref>) and STING agonist (ADU-S100 and DMXAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Li et al., 2023</xref>) to stimulate microglia at 12 and 24 hours.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Astrogliosis is induced early in neuropathic pain models and sustained for exceptionally long durations, which covers both the acute-to-chronic pain transition and the maintenance phase of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ji <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). Cytokines and chemokines produced by astrocytes can powerfully modulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in pain circuits, leading to central sensitization, and a transition from acute to chronic neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ji <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ji <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kawasaki <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Recently, Kohro et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kohro et al., 2020</xref>) identified an SDH-localized Hes5+ astrocytes population that gated descending noradrenergic control of mechanosensory behaviour via α1A adrenergic receptors (α1A-Ars). Inhibition of locus coeruleus noradrenergic signal transduction to Hes5 + astrocytes could effectively prevent mechanical hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kohro <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). In this work, we observed that astrocytes activation increased in the lumbar enlargement of mice with SCI-induced pain, including the three largest ascending tracts and the SDH. These findings further highlight the importance of astrocytes in processing pain signals and targeting astrocytes may improve neuropathic pain after SCI.</p>
<p>Resident astrocytes maintain stable under normal physiological state and rarely proliferates. SCI leads to massive proliferation of resident astrocytes especially in lesion area and re-express the neural progenitor cell markers, which are the most abundant and mainly located around the scar forming a region complementary to cells derived from ependymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnabé-Heider <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sabelstrom <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Ependyma is regarded as the main source of endogenous neural stem cells, which widely migrate to injury area and generate the majority of neuroprotective astrocytes after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barnabé-Heider <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Meletis <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). However, we found that only a small number of ependymal cells could proliferate and migrate to the lesion score after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ren <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). Through transgenic mice and lineage tracing, we examined the differentiation of ependymal cells and found that ependymal cells did not produce a large number of astrocytes. Instead, ependymal cells differentiated to Tuj1 positive neurons in epicenter. NG2 cells were previously considered to be the component of glial scar after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Church <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hackett and Lee, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hesp <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). However, reports about their functions are still controversial, partly because there are many cell types that up regulate proteoglycan NG2 in the scar and lesion core after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nishiyama <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Totally, through lineage tracing, this study determined that the resident astrocytes but not ependymal cells were the main origins of astrocytes-induced neuropathic pain after SCI.</p>
<p>One of our novel findings was that selective resident astrocytes elimination in the lumbar enlargement could attenuate neuropathic pain after SCI. Previously, there were limited data on the association between local astrocytes depletion and neuropathic pain attenuation. We tried to target astrocytes in the spinal cord by using GFAP-Cre; <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>em1(CAG-LSL-tdTomato-2A-DTR)Smoc</sup></italic> mice, but we identified that the mice were not suitable for labelling astrocytes (<bold>Supplementary Figure 5</bold>). The most reliable mouse strain for targeting astrocytes in vivo is Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). To selectively and locally target astrocytes in spinal cord, instead, selective astrocytes elimination in lumbar enlargement was performed by AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre mediated local astrocytes transduction and DT injection. Several previous studies have reported astrocytes elimination in animal experiments. Through transgenical method, a previous study found that domain-specific depletion of astrocytes in dorsal spinal cord showed atrophy, reduction in the total number of astrocytes, loss of neuropil, and congested neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). However, they did not observe increased inflammation, gliosis, or blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tsai <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). They speculated that remaining astrocytes were sufficient for structural maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tsai <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). In contrast, domain-specific depletion of astrocytes in ventral spinal cord resulted in abnormal motor neuron synaptogenesis, which was not rescued by immigration of astrocytes from adjoining regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tsai <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). With transgenically targeted DTR and AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre injection, one another study found that DT-mediated ablation of chronic astrocytic scar could significantly prevent axon regrowth after severe SCI of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). Two other studies also found that astrocytes elimination of the whole body impaired redox homeostasis and triggered neuronal loss in the central nervous system, accompanied by myelin sheath loss and motor function impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allnoch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schreiner et al., 2015</xref>). Meanwhile, local astrocytes depletion through local DT injection did not affect astrocytes in other sites as shown in their supplemental information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schreiner <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Our results also showed that selective resident astrocytes elimination in the lumbar enlargement does not have a significant impact on weight and motor function.</p>
<p>We also found the transcripts of pro-inflammatory microglial marker genes elevated and microglia could activate after selective resident astrocytes elimination. As the resident macrophages in the spinal cord, microglia play critical roles in the progress of neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Salter and Stevens, 2017</xref>). However, the role of microglia in chronic inflammatory pain is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). A previous study reported that P2×4 knockout mice exhibit unaltered inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tsuda et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, Cx3cr1 knockout mice exhibit reduced inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Staniland et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, Tansley S <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tansley et al., 2022</xref>) found that after peripheral nerve injury, microglia will degrade the extracellular matrix structure (neuronal peripheral network, PNN) in lamina I of the spinal dorsal horn, enhance the activity of projection neurons, and induce pain related behaviors. By comparison, Kohno <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kohno et al., 2022</xref>) described a spinal cord–resident pool of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia that emerges during pain maintenance and contributes to the resolution of neuropathic pain in mice. Interesting, previous evidence indicated that direct activation of astrocytes using an optogenetic approach induces microglial reactivity and pain hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nam et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, microglia act as diverse roles in a pain development and resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sideris-Lampretsas and Malcangio, 2022</xref>). Sex differences in the involvement of microglia in mediating chronic pain have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sorge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Taves et al., 2016</xref>). We also explored the effect of sex on neuropathic pain, and observed no significant differences between male and female mice. Thus, there were inconsistent association between sexes and neuropathic pain after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dominguez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mapplebeck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McFarlane et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we also observed that the onset of cold/thermal hypersensitivity were delayed than mechanical allodynia, which may be related to the different processing of different types of pain signals.</p>
<p>Our study showed that among the most significant DEGs after selective resident astrocytes elimination were the genes involved in regulating type I IFNs production, and the signal transduction of type I IFNs was significantly upregulated. Molecular experiment results also found the mRNA expression of genes associated with the type I IFNs signal increased after selective astrocytes elimination. It has been verified that type I IFNs signal can significantly reduce sensory neuron activation and pain level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Donnelly <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Mice with type I IFNs signal deficiency were more sensitive to pain stimuli and had more obvious activation of intense sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Donnelly <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). Thus, we suspected that type I IFNs signal might be involved in the association between selective resident astrocytes elimination and neuropathic pain attenuation. Although interferons could derive from various cells, myeloid-lineage cells, microglia are resident immune cells in the central nervous system and are believed to be the main source of IFN-β within the CNS during inflammatory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Owens <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). Reinert and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Reinert <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>) identified microglia as the primary producers of type I IFNs, and the expression of cGAS and Sting1 were enriched in microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chin, 2019</xref>). The association between selective astrocytes elimination, type I IFNs signal and microglia activation remains unclear. Considering that the death or ablation of numerous cell types in CNS including oligodendrocyte could spark activation of microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gritsch et al., 2014</xref>), more studies were needed to explore the effect of microglia activation on the association between astrocytes elimination and neuropathic pain attenuation.</p>
<p>There are also some limitations in this work. Although we determined that the selective resident elimination could significantly attenuate neuropathic pain, astrocyte elimination is difficult to achieve in clinical practice. Instead, we provided a strategy to potentially target and activate type I IFNs signal to improve pain after SCI. Additionally, astrocytes elimination may cause many pathophysiological changes in addition to activating type I IFNs signal, the observed effect may be a side effect of the elimination of astrocytes. For our work did not identify whether diphtheria toxin-induced cell apoptosis leads to the activation of the type I IFNs signaling pathway in microglia and is not induced only by astrocyte-specific clearance. Our experiments in cell culture induced by LPS were partly to give a possible mechanist explanation, the optimal methods should be performed in primary microglia obtained from SCI+AAV group or SCI+AAV+DT group and compare to shame operated one.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Above all, we determined that resident astrocytes but not ependymal cells are the main origins of astrocytes participate in neuropathic pain after SCI. The selective resident elimination in lumbar enlargement could significantly attenuate neuropathic pain, and the mechanisms were partly associated with type I IFNs signal activation in microglia (as the schematic diagram shown in <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>). Therefore, targeted intervention on type I IFNs signal may be an effective strategy for neuropathic pain treatment after SCI.</p>

<p>(<bold>A</bold>), astrocytes in lumbar enlargement were targeted and selectively eliminated through transgenic mice injected with an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre) and diphtheria toxin. Selective astrocyte elimination in lumbar enlargement could attenuate neuropathic pain after SCI, which were associated with type I IFNs signal and microglia activation. (<bold>B</bold>), the production of type I IFNs. Type I IFNs production is mainly caused by the contact of innate immune cells (mainly macrophages, microglia and astrocyte in CNS) surface or internal receptors (RIG-I receptor IFIH1/MDA5, cGAS, etc.) with virus specific antigenic substances (DNA, RNA), then through intracellular signal molecule transmission (<italic>STING, TBK, IKK</italic>, etc.), and finally activate the transcription factor IRF3/7 to promote the expression of type I IFNs, including IFN-α and IFN-β. (<bold>C</bold>), the signal transduction of type I IFNs. Type I IFNs bind to the same two membrane spanning polypeptide chains type I IFNs receptor 1/2 (IFNAR1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Borden <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Owens <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) and lead to cross phosphorylation and activation of Tyk2/JaK1. Activation of Tyk2 and JAK1 phosphorylate STAT1/2 to form a heterodimer, which then translocate to the nucleus and associate with IRF9 to further form the heterotrimeric transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 (ISGF3). Finally, ISGF3 translocate to the nucleus and bind to specific IFN-response elements (ISREs) to control the expression of IFNs-stimulated genes (ISGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rothhammer <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>), including <italic>ISG15, MX1, OAS1, OAS2, IFIT1, ZBP1</italic>.</p></caption>

<p>The experimental procedures were designed to minimize the number of animals used as well as animal suffering. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and associated guidelines, EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments, and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Tongji University School of Medicine (SYXK2019-0005). All transgenic and non-transgenic mice used were derived from in house breeding colonies maintained on C57/BL6 backgrounds. Mice were housed on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle and had food and water available ad libitum. The room temperature and humidity were appropriate. All behavioral testing was performed between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm. Transgenic mice were purchased from the Model Organisms Centre, Shanghai and the Jackson Laboratory.

<title>Spinal cord contusion model and motor function test</title>
<p>Thoracic spinal cord contusion, a widely used SCI model for neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kramer et al., 2017</xref>), and the MASCIS Impactor Model III (W.M. Keck Center for Collaborative Neuroscience, Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, USA) were applied in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Duan et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, mice were weighed and deeply anaesthetized with isoflurane evaporated in a gas mixture containing 70% N<sub>2</sub>O and 30% O<sub>2</sub> through a nose mask. The back skin was shaved and cleaned with 75% alcohol. A laminectomy at T10 was performed to remove the part of the vertebra overlying the spinal cord, exposing a circle of dura through an operating microscope (Zeiss, Germany) and rodent stereotaxic apparatus (RWD Life Science Co.,Ltd, Shenzhen, China). The spinal column was stabilized using lateral clamps over the lateral processes at T9 and T11. Contusion was performed at T10 with a 5 g impactor and 6.25 mm height with a force of about 60kdyn, which could cause a moderate injury as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), and then the wound was sutured. Mice had received natural illumination to keep warm before and after the surgery. The following symbols were indicators of a successful contusion model: (1) the impact point was located in the middle of T10, (2) paralysis of both hindlimbs occurred after awakening, (3) the cut-offs of mechanical pain were lower than their baselines. Unsuccessful models were excluded in the following experiment and analysis. Sham mice underwent laminectomy but not contusion. Urine was manually expressed from the bladders of the injured mice twice per day until autonomous urination recovered. Hindlimb motor function was tested in an open field chamber on days 0, 1 and 3 after SCI and weekly for up to 6 weeks. The Basso Mouse Scale (BMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Basso et al., 2006</xref>) was applied to quantify motor function by two investigators blinded to the genotypes and group assignments.</p>

<title>Measurement of mechanical sensitivity with an electronic von Frey apparatus</title>
<p>The mechanical allodynia of the hindlimbs was measured by the electronic von Frey apparatus (IITC Life Sciences, Woodland Hills, CA) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cunha et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Martinov et al., 2013</xref>), which is a sensitive, objective and quantitative measurement tool for mechanical sensitivity in rodent models with pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cunha <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Martinov <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The electronic von Frey apparatus has a pressure-meter which consisted of a hand-held force transducer fitted with a 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup> polypropylene tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cunha <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). When positive response appeared, the intensity of the stimulus was automatically recorded. Our investigators were proficiency trained in advance to use the polypropylene tip vertically to the central of plantar. Briefly, mice were placed on a wire mesh platform in individual Plexiglas cubicles and allowed to acclimate to the Plexiglas restraint and testing room for 30 minutes. Before testing, the mice were quiet without exploratory behaviors or defecation, and not resting on their paws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cunha <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). The average interstimulus interval was 2 minutes. Polypropylene tip was applied a vertical and gradual increase force to the plantar surface of the left and right hindlimbs for 3-4 seconds, or until a positive response appeared. Behaviours that were considered positive responses to the filament included brisk paw withdrawal, flinching, hunching of the back, licking of the stimulated area, and escape responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). All animals underwent 2 trials (5 measurements/trial) at 24 and 48 hours before contusion to calculate the average plantar paw withdrawal threshold of both hindlimbs at baseline. The measurement of post-contusion withdrawal thresholds was performed in a blinded fashion by two independent investigators at 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after contusion. These timepoints were chosen for the nociceptive assays to calculate BMS scores was to avoid the issue of motor impairment for reflex-based assays, and these mice could maintain a standing posture from 2 weeks after contusion on.</p>

<title>Analgesia test for thresholds of cold and thermal pain</title>
<p>Cold and hot plate (Cat# YSL-21; Shanghai Yuyan Instruments Co., Ltd.

Cold and thermal pain tests of the hindlimbs were conducted one day after mechanical allodynia measurement. Before testing, mice were also transferred into the testing room to acclimate to the environment for 30 minutes. The temperatures of 0°C (cold stimulus) and 50°C (hot stimulus) were used to measure the thresholds for noxious heat and cold, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). To avoid tissue injury, temperatures of 0°C (cold stimulus) for 5 minutes and 50°C (hot stimulus) for 30 seconds were set as the cut-off points. The positive response included licking, jumping or hind paw withdrawal. The paw withdrawal latency (for hot stimuli) and paw withdrawal frequency (for cold stimuli) of positive responses were recorded. For hot stimuli, the paw withdrawal latency means the period from touching the hot plate to the emergence of positive response. For cold stimuli, the paw withdrawal frequency means the number of nociceptive responses observed in 5 minutes on cold plate. The tests were carried out 24 hours before contusion and 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 weeks after contusion. The analgesia test for thresholds of cold and thermal pain were conducted by two investigators blinded to the groups and experimental conditions.</p>

<title>AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre and DT injection</title>
<p>In this study, AAV2/5 with the GfaABC1D promoter (AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre) was used to target Cre recombinase expression exclusively in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). The 681 bp GFAP promoter, GfaABC1D, was derived from the 2.2kb human GFAP promoter gfa2. Importantly, the GfaABC1D promoter is about twice as active as gfa2 with smaller size, which is better suited to viral vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). The expression of cargo genes under the GfaABC1D promoter in astrocytes is highly efficient and specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Previous study reported that AAV2/5 predominantly labeled astrocytes, displaying robust co-localization of reporter gene (eGFP) with the astrocytic marker, GFAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Ortinski et al., 2010</xref>). The AAV2/5 vector with a minimal GFAP promoter (AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre) has been regarded as the most reliable viral approach and widely used to target astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yu <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre was purchased from Shanghai Taitool Bioscience Co., Ltd. (Cat# S0611-5, ≥1E+13 V.G/ml). AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre was injected into <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>em1(CAG-LSL--tdTomato-2A-DTR)Smoc</sup></italic>mice of SCI+AAV group and SCI+AAV+DT group 2 weeks before T10 contusion, and into mice of sham AAV group 2 weeks before T10 laminectomy. Sham group mice underwent L4-5 laminectomy but not AAV. Briefly, after precise location of L4-5 spinal cord as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rigaud et al., 2008</xref>), the back skin was shaved and cleaned with 75% alcohol. A laminectomy was performed at L4-5 as described above. AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre was injected into the both sides of dorsal median of the lumbar enlargement (0.5 mm lateral to midline with a depth of 0.6 mm, 0.4 μL per side, ≥1E+11 V.G/ml in sterile saline), with a Hamilton 33-gauge (33 G) microinjection needle at a speed of 0.2 μL/min. After injection, the needle was held for 5 minutes to avoid liquid reflux. Overall, no obvious tissue injury of spinal cord, no motor and sensory function impairment of hindlimbs were observed during the following two weeks. Spinal cord tissue fluorescence images were taken and handled with a Fluorescence-labeled Organism Bioimaging Instrument (FOBI, Neoscience Ltd., Suwon City, Rep. of Korea) after AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Cre injection.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis</title>
<p>To further evaluate the role of selective astrocytes elimination in gene expression regulation and pain attenuation mechanisms, RNA-seq was used to examine the transcriptomes of lumbar enlargement tissues in sham group (n = 3), sham AAV group (n = 3), SCI+AAV group (n = 3), and SCI+AAV+DT group (n = 3). Previous findings revealed the sex-dependent difference in neuropathic pain after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fiore et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Stewart et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the lumbar enlargement tissues of female mice were selected for RNA-seq experiment. Briefly, mice were euthanized after terminal anaesthesia by pentobarbital overdose. Spinal cord tissue was dissected from lumbar enlargements (L4-5) at 1 week after selective astrocytes elimination, with a dissecting microscope, and 2 mm segments were harvested and marked. A total of 12 samples were sent to the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) Company (Shenzhen, China) in solid carbon dioxide for further RNA-seq analysis, and sequencing was performed on a DNBSEQ platform at BGI Company. Bioinformatics analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, was carried out with the online platform Dr. Tom (BGI Company). Only genes with transcripts per million (TPM) &gt; 1 were analyzed. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the DEGseq method and screened with the criteria of q value ≤ 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub>FC ≥ 0.6, where FC represents the fold change. False discovery rate (FDR) method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons to generate q-values in RNA-seq study. The normalized enrichment score (NES) was utilized to select the most activated and inactivated GO terms and pathways. The sequence and sample data have been deposited in the NCBI database under Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with Bioproject identification number PRJNA847704 (Accession number: SRR19611667 - SRR19611678).

<p>Immunofluorescence staining procedures were conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ren <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). After post-fixation and cryoprotection, a dissected 6 mm segment of spinal cord centred around the injury epicentre, or a 2 mm segment of the lumbar enlargement (L4-5), was coronally sectioned at 12 µm thickness and thaw-mounted onto Superfrost Plus slides (Citotest Labware Manufacturing Co., Ltd.). The primary antibodies used were as follows: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, Cat# ab4674, Abcam, 1:500), Neuronal nuclear antigen (NEUN, Cat# ab190565, Abcam, 1:500), Tubulin beta III (Tuj1, Cat# MAB1637, Millipore, 1:500), Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1, Cat# 016-20001, Wako, 1:500), Oligodendrocyte Transcription Factor 2 (Olig2, Cat# AF2418, R&amp;D system, 1:500), S100 Calcium Binding Protein A10 (S100A10, Cat#11250-1-AP, Protein Tech, 1:250), Interferon-stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15, Cat# sc-166755, Santa Cruz, 1:50), Interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7, Cat# sc-74471, Santa Cruz, 1:50), Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1, Cat# ab109461, Abcam, 1:150),. The secondary antibodies were Alexa® Fluor 488 (Cat# abs20019A, Absin, 1:500), Alexa® Fluor 488 (Cat# A-32814, Invitrogen, 1:500), Alexa® Fluor 488 (Cat# A-32766, Invitrogen, 1:500), Alexa® Fluor 555 (Cat# A-32773, Invitrogen, 1:500), Alexa® Fluor 594 (Cat# ab150176, Abcam, 1:500), and Alexa® Fluor 647 (Cat# A-32795, Invitrogen, 1:500). The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Cat# C1002, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology), and fluorescence images were taken by confocal microscopy (LSM 700, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Image acquisition was performed with ZEN 2.3 (blue edition, Carl Zeiss), and micrographs were assembled using Adobe Illustrator CC 2018. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Watson, 2012</xref>), we selected four regions in the lumbar enlargement to analyze in the immunohistochemistry images, including three largest ascending tracts and SDH. The three largest ascending tracts were (1) the gracile and cuneate fasciculi (GR and CU, respectively); (2) the lateral, dorsolateral and ventral spinothalamic tracts (LST, DLST, and VST, respectively); and (3) the dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts (DSC and VSC, respectively). These tracts are closely associated with proprioception and sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Watson, 2012</xref>). For immunofluorescence analysis of lumbar enlargement, three sections were randomly selected to delineate the three tracts and SDH (3 areas per tract/SDH), then the 160 μm × 160 μm images were exported as single channel images through ZEN 2.3 (blue edition). Lesion area covered the lesion core, rostral and caudal injured spinal cords with a distance of 500 μm from lesion core, respectively. A total of three sections (8 areas of rostral and 8 of caudal injured spinal cords per section) were randomly selected per mice. Then the 160 μm × 160 μm images were exported by ZEN 2.3 (blue edition). Image-J software with customized macros was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of proteins including the GFAP, Tuj1, IBA1, ISG15, IRF7 and STAT1 in the images mentioned above.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study the authors demonstrated that ablation of astrocytes in lumbar spinal cord not only reduced neuropathic pain but also caused microglia activation. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and bioinformatics revealed an activation of STING/type I IFNs signal pathway in spinal cord microglia after astrocyte ablation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings are novel and interesting and provide new insights into astrocyte-microglia interaction in neuropathic pain. This study may also offer a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of debilitating neuropathic pain in patients with SCI.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More details are needed to justify the sample size, statistics, and sex of animals.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript, Zhao et al. have carried out a thorough examination of the effects of targeted ablation of resident astrocytes on behavior, cellular responses, and gene expression after spinal cord injury. Employing transgenic mice models alongside pharmacogenetic techniques, the authors have successfully achieved the selective removal of these resident astrocytes. This intervention led to a notable reduction in neuropathic pain and induced a shift in microglial cell reactivation states within the spinal cord, significantly altering transcriptome profiles predominantly associated with interferon (IFN) signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings presented add considerable value to the current understanding of the role of astrocyte elimination in neuropathic pain, offering convincing evidence that supports existing hypotheses and valuable insights into the interactions between astrocytes and microglial cells, likely through IFN-mediated mechanisms. This contribution is highly relevant and suggests that further exploration in this direction could yield meaningful results.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The methodology and evidence underpinning the study are solid, yet some areas would benefit from further clarification, particularly concerning methodological details and the choice of statistical analyses. Additionally, the manuscript's organization and clarity could be improved, as certain figures and schematics appear inconsistent or misleading.</p>
