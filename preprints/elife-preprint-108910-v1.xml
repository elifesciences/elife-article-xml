<abstract><p>Although it is well-established that stem cells maintain tissue homeostasis while tumors disrupt it, the mechanisms by which tumors influence the development of nearby stem cells remain poorly understood. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries as a model system, here we discovered that <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors inhibit the differentiation of neighboring wild-type germline stem cells (GSCs). Mechanistically, these tumor cells mimic the stem cell niche by secreting the BMP ligands Dpp and Gbb, but at reduced levels, resulting in moderate BMP signaling activation in adjacent GSCs. Such BMP signaling activation is sufficient to repress <italic>bam</italic> transcription, thereby blocking GSC differentiation. To our knowledge, this is the first example that tumors can functionally mimic a stem cell niche to inhibit the differentiation of neighboring wild-type stem cells. Similar regulatory paradigms may operate in mammalian tissues, including humans, during tumorigenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The homeostasis of many tissues in our bodies is maintained by adult stem cells, but this balance can be disrupted by tumor cells. What occurs when tumorigenesis intersects with stem cell development? To address this question, a mosaic-analysis model system is essential, where wild-type stem cells develop alongside tumor cells. <italic>Drosophila</italic> offers an exceptional model for such studies, as it allows for the efficient generation of mosaic clones through various established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Germani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries, germline stem cells (GSCs) play a crucial role in sustaining normal oogenesis and maintaining fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fuller and Spradling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lin, 1997</xref>). These GSCs reside in a specialized microenvironment known as the stem cell niche (hereafter referred to as niche) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Xie and Spradling, 2000</xref>). Typically, a GSC undergoes asymmetric division, generating two distinct daughter cells: one remains in the niche to self-renew as a GSC, while the other, called a cystoblast, exits the niche and initiates differentiation. During the differentiation process, each cystoblast performs exactly four rounds of mitotic division with incomplete cytokinesis to produce16 interconnected cystocytes, forming a germline cyst. In each germline cyst, only one germ cell is destined to become the oocyte, while the remaining 15 differentiate into nurse cells that support the development of the oocyte (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fuller and Spradling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lin, 1997</xref>). The principal niche signals are bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligands, including Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Glass bottom boat (Gbb), which are secreted predominantly by cap cells, the major somatic niche cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen and McKearin, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Xie and Spradling, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2000</xref>). These ligands activate BMP signaling in GSCs, leading to the transcriptional repression of <italic>bag of marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>), a key gene that promotes differentiation. In contrast, BMP signaling is inactive in cystoblasts, allowing Bam to be expressed and drive their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen and McKearin, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Song et al., 2004</xref>). Bam carries out this function in collaboration with its partner, Benign gonial cell neoplasm (Bgcn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ohlstein et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<p>GSCs mutant for <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> fail to differentiate and instead hyper-proliferate, forming a well-established <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline tumor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lavoie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">McKearin and Spradling, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Niki and Mahowald, 2003</xref>). Notably, these germline tumor cells competitively displace wild-type GSCs from the niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Jin et al., 2008</xref>). The resulting displacement creates a microenvironment where wild-type GSCs are surrounded by tumor cells, providing an excellent model system to study stem cell behavior in tumor neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors inhibit the differentiation of neighboring wild-type GSCs by functionally mimicking the stem cell niche. This mechanism may be conserved in mammals, including humans, during tumorigenesis, where malignant cells could similarly disrupt normal stem cell development.</p>

<title>Germline tumors inhibit the differentiation of neighboring wild-type GSCs</title>
<p>Using the <italic>nos&gt;FLP/FRT</italic> or <italic>hs-FLP/FRT</italic> methods we previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>), we generated <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline clones in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref>). Surprisingly, we found that many wild-type germ cells located outside the niche retained a GSC-like single-germ-cell (SGC) morphology, even when encapsulated within egg chambers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1C, D</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1</italic></xref>). Under normal conditions, GSCs that exit the niche differentiate into interconnected germline cysts, where germ cells are linked rather than remaining as individual, isolated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fuller and Spradling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Xie and Spradling, 2000</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the SGC phenotype is an artifact caused by GFP expression, we repeated the experiments using RFP and arm-lacZ as alternative mosaic-analysis markers. Consistent results were observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1E, F</italic></xref>), confirming that the phenotype is not attributable to GFP.</p>
<p>To further confirm that these SGCs exhibit GSC-like characteristics, we conducted anti-α-Spectrin immunofluorescent staining, a method that labels a germline-specific organelle known as the spectrosome in GSCs and cystoblasts, and the fusome in cystocytes. GSCs perform complete cell division, whereas cystocytes undergo incomplete cytokinesis, remaining interconnected through fusomes and ring canals. Consequently, spectrosomes appear as dot-like structures, while fusomes exhibit branched morphologies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lin et al., 1994</xref>). To accurately capture the three-dimensional (3D) architecture of spectrosomes and fusomes, we acquired z-stack images using confocal microscopy. Strikingly, these SGCs displayed dot-like spectrosomes, closely resembling those observed in wild-type GSCs and <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant GSC-like tumor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1H, I</italic></xref>). We also considered the possibility that SGCs might arise through the dedifferentiation of the cystocytes in germline cysts surrounded by germline tumors. If this were the case, such cystocytes would initially undergo complete cell division, leaving behind midbodies as markers of the late cytokinesis stage. When visualized by anti-α-Spectrin immunofluorescence, midbody appears as a central sphere that is slightly connected to two larger flanking structures, resembling a variant of nunchucks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mathieu et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, in our analyses of over 50 germline cysts surrounded by <italic>bam</italic> mutant germline tumors, none contained midbodies, suggesting that dedifferentiation is unlikely to be the primary mechanism responsible for the SGC phenotype. Together, these findings indicate that <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors inhibit the differentiation of neighboring wild-type GSCs.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>The inhibition of differentiation in SGCs relies on the lack of Bam expression</title>
<p>Given that Bam is the key factor promoting GSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ohlstein and McKearin, 1997</xref>), we were very curious about the expression of Bam in SGCs. At first, we assessed Bam protein levels using immunofluorescent staining with an anti-BamC antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>). Strikingly, none of the SGCs examined (n &gt; 100) were BamC-positive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref>). Then, we analyzed <italic>bam</italic> transcription levels using a <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen and McKearin, 2003b</xref>). Under normal conditions, 100% of GSCs within the niche (n = 153) were GFP-negative, while 98% of cystoblasts (n = 106) were GFP-positive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2B, C</italic></xref>), confirming that <italic>bam</italic> transcription is associated with the initiation of GSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>). Notably, 74% of SGCs (n = 132) were GFP-negative, while the remaining 26% were GFP-positive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2B, C</italic></xref>). This suggests that SGCs can be categorized into two distinct groups: those resembling GSCs (GSC-like) and those resembling cystoblasts (cystoblast-like). The cystoblast-like SGCs may have already initiated their differentiation program toward becoming cystocytes. Since <italic>bam</italic> transcription initiates in cystoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">McKearin and Spradling, 1990</xref>) but Bam proteins accumulate predominantly in cystocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>), the Bam protein levels in these cystoblast-like SGCs are likely below the detection threshold at this early stage.</p>

<p>Next, we asked whether ectopic expression of Bam can drive SGCs to differentiate. To address this, we established two experimental scenarios: one with the <italic>hs-bam</italic> element and one without as the control. In the <italic>hs-bam</italic> scenario (<italic>with hs-bam</italic>), GFP-positive germ cells are wild-type (carrying <italic>hs-bam</italic>), while GFP-negative cells are <italic>bam<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (lacking <italic>hs-bam</italic>). In the control scenario (<italic>without hs-bam</italic>), GFP-positive cells are wild-type, and GFP-negative cells are <italic>bam<sup>−/−</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>, see genotypes in Source data 1). To quantify the SGC phenotype, we calculated the percentage of SGCs relative to the total number of SGCs and germline cysts, considering the out-of-niche germ cells that are either fully enclosed by germline tumors (e.g., the right SGC in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1I</italic></xref> and the marked germline cyst in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2G</italic></xref>) or in contact with wild-type germ cells or somatic cells on just one side (e.g., the left SGC in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1I</italic></xref> and the outlined germline cyst in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref>). Although the SGC phenotype was detectable after fly eclosion, we quantified it in 14-day-old flies to ensure robust germline tumor growth, improving quantification efficiency. To induce ectopic Bam expression, 12-day-old female flies were subjected to heatshock treatment, which involved heating at 37°C for two hours, twice daily with a 6-hour interval, and over two consecutive days. In the absence of heatshock treatment, the percentage of SGCs in ovaries of both genotypes showed no significant difference at either 12 or 14 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2E-H</italic></xref>), indicating that the <italic>hs-bam</italic> element alone, without heatshock, does not affect the phenotype. However, following heatshock treatment, the percentage of SGCs in ovaries with <italic>hs-bam</italic> was markedly reduced compared to those without <italic>hs-bam</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2E-H</italic></xref>), suggesting that ectopic Bam expression can drive SGCs to differentiate. Collectively, these results support that the differentiation defects of SGCs are due to the lack of Bam expression.</p>

<title>SGCs retain moderate BMP signaling activation</title>
<p>Within the niche, BMP signaling functions to repress <italic>bam</italic> transcription to inhibit GSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen and McKearin, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Song et al., 2004</xref>). To investigate BMP signaling activation in SGCs, we employed immunofluorescent staining for pMad, a well-characterized marker of BMP signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kai and Spradling, 2003</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed undetectable pMad levels in all SGCs examined (n &gt; 100) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3A, B</italic></xref>). To investigate this further, we examined the activity of <italic>Dad</italic>-lacZ, a highly sensitive BMP signaling reporter known to be activated not only in GSCs but also in cystoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kai and Spradling, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Song et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, 73% of SGCs were lacZ-positive (n = 107), a proportion lower than that of GSCs within the niche, which showed 100% lacZ positivity (n = 122) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3C, D</italic></xref>). Furthermore, when comparing <italic>Dad</italic>-lacZ expression levels exclusively in lacZ-positive cells, we found that SGCs exhibited significantly lower expression levels than GSCs within the niche (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3C, E</italic></xref>). These findings indicate that BMP signaling is activated in SGCs but at lower levels than those in GSCs within the niche.</p>

<p>Beyond maintaining <italic>Drosophila</italic> female GSCs in the niche, BMP signaling also promotes their division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Xie and Spradling, 1998</xref>). Since the activation levels of BMP signaling in SGCs were lower than those in GSCs within the niche, we hypothesized that SGCs would exhibit slower proliferation rates than GSCs. To test this hypothesis, we performed BrdU incorporation assays. The results revealed that only 4.5% of SGCs were BrdU-positive (n = 1034), a significantly lower proportion than the 7.8% observed in GSCs within the niche (n = 1337) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3F-H</italic></xref>). These findings further corroborate the reduced activation of BMP signaling in SGCs relative to GSCs.</p>

<title>Germline tumors secret Dpp and Gbb</title>
<p>The next question we sought to address was which cells surrounding SGCs secrete BMP ligands, such as Dpp and Gbb. Guided by the Occam’s Razor principle, we focused on <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumor cells, as the SGC phenotype is dependent on their presence. Initial attempts to detect expression of these two ligand genes using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization proved unsuccessful. We therefore employed an established <italic>dpp</italic>-lacZ (<italic>P4</italic>-lacZ) reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Li et al., 2016</xref>) to monitor Dpp expression.

<title>Dpp and Gbb secreted by germline tumors are required to inhibit SGC differentiation</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated whether Dpp and Gbb secreted by germline tumors are required to inhibit SGC differentiation. Using a previously established double-mutant mosaic-analysis strategy for two genes on different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>), we generated <italic>dpp bam</italic> or <italic>gbb bam</italic> double-mutant germline clones using two <italic>dpp</italic> mutant alleles, <italic>dpp<sup>d6</sup></italic>, <italic>dpp<sup>d12</sup></italic>, and one <italic>gbb</italic> allele, <italic>gbb<sup>1</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6A, B</italic></xref>, see genotypes in Source data 1). Heterozygotes in any of these alleles did not affect GSC maintenance, germ cell differentiation, and female fly fertility (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6—figure supplement 1</italic></xref>). However, both <italic>dpp bam</italic> and <italic>gbb bam</italic> double-mutant germline tumor cells exhibited reduced proliferation rates compared to <italic>bam</italic> single-mutant controls (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6—figure supplement 2</italic></xref>), indicating that autocrine BMP signaling promotes <italic>bam</italic> mutant tumor growth. As mentioned earlier, our evaluation focused on germ cells that have exited the niche and are surrounded by germline tumors to quantify the SGC phenotype. However, this raises the question of whether the extent of tumor encirclement (i.e., being surrounded by more or fewer tumor cells) influences the phenotype. To investigate this, we compared the SGC phenotype in bigger and smaller <italic>bam</italic> mutant germline tumors. Using confocal microscopy, we analyzed 70 germaria containing <italic>bam</italic> mutant germline clones that met our criteria for SGC phenotype quantification. For each <italic>bam</italic> mutant germline clone, we scanned and measured its maximal 2D cross-sectional area as a proxy for its 3D size. The 35 bigger and 35 smaller clones were categorized as ‘bigger’ and ‘smaller’ tumors, respectively. Strikingly, we observed no significant difference in the SGC phenotype between these two groups of tumors (<xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6—figure supplement 3</italic></xref>), suggesting that direct contact between tumorous and wild-type germ cells, rather than tumor size, is the primary determinant of this phenotype.</p>

<p>The results above demonstrate that comparing the severity of the SGC phenotype is feasible between germ cells surrounded by smaller <italic>dpp bam</italic> or <italic>gbb bam</italic> double-mutant germline tumors and those surrounded by larger <italic>bam</italic> single-mutant germline tumors.

Thus, we concluded that the BMP ligands from directly-contacting germline tumor cells mediate the dominant inhibition of SGC differentiation. This amazingly parallels the mechanism observed in normal stem cell niche, where only germ cells in direct contact with cap cells are maintained as GSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen and McKearin, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Xie and Spradling, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study reveals that <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries secrete lower levels of BMP ligands Dpp and Gbb than cap cells, resulting in moderate BMP signaling activation in adjacent wild-type GSCs (called SGCs in this study). Such BMP signaling activation is sufficient to repress <italic>bam</italic> transcription, thereby blocking SGC differentiation (see our working model in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref>). Strikingly, this mechanism closely recapitulates the normal niche signaling program mediated by cap cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen and McKearin, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Xie and Spradling, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2000</xref>). To our knowledge, this represents the first evidence that tumor cells can functionally mimic a stem cell niche to arrest neighboring wild-type stem cells in an undifferentiated state.</p>

<p><italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors consist of GSC-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lavoie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>), which are expected to resemble SGCs. However, out-of-niche <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumor cells did not activate BMP signaling to the same extent as SGCs, as evidenced by much lower <italic>Dad</italic>-lacZ expression in GFP-negative <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant tumor cells than in neighboring GFP-positive SGCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref>). Consistent with this, while only 26% of SGCs expressed <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP, most of out-of-niche <italic>bam</italic> mutant germline tumor cells were <italic>bamP</italic>-GFP-positive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2B, C</italic></xref>), further supporting reduced BMP signaling in these tumor cells relative to SGCs. These findings suggest that SGCs are more responsive to BMP signals secreted by germline tumors than the tumors themselves. Future studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>One interesting finding is that <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors secrete lower levels of BMP ligands than cap cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5A-C</italic></xref>). This aligns with earlier microarray data showing that purified <italic>Drosophila</italic> female GSCs express minimal Dpp and Gbb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kai et al., 2005</xref>). However, our work reveals that such BMP levels in germline tumors are functionally critical to suppress SGC differentiation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref>). Unlike normal GSCs, which receive unidirectional BMP ligands from cap cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen and McKearin, 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Xie and Spradling, 2000</xref>), SGCs are often fully surrounded by <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors. This spatial advantage likely enables tumors to inhibit SGC differentiation efficiently without matching the high BMP output of cap cells. Moreover, since BMP signaling is known to both inhibit normal GSC differentiation and promote their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Xie and Spradling, 1998</xref>), it should similarly stimulate SGC expansion, which is detrimental for <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors. We propose that these tumor cells finely regulate BMP secretion to balance these opposing demands: maintaining differentiation blockade of SGCs while avoiding stimulation of their excessive proliferation.</p>
<p>A well-established principle in oncology is that tumor aggressiveness correlates with poor differentiation, with less-differentiated tumors exhibiting enhanced transformative capacity and metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Jogi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lytle et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries, <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors consist of GSC-like cells that may resemble these poorly differentiated human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lavoie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">McKearin and Ohlstein, 1995</xref>). This similarity raises the possibility that stem cell-like human tumors may similarly inhibit the differentiation of adjacent wild-type stem cells. By blocking differentiation, such tumors could deplete terminally differentiated cell populations, potentially exacerbating patient mortality. This mechanism may contribute to the heightened lethality of poorly differentiated tumors. Further investigation is needed to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The differentiation of a single GSC into a 16-cell germline cyst, comprising 15 polyploid nurse cells and one developing oocyte, represents a substantial metabolic investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fuller and Spradling, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lin, 1997</xref>). We propose that <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>bgcn</italic> mutant germline tumors block this process to divert nutrients toward their own uncontrolled growth. This phenomenon could have broad implications, as many human tissues and organs (intestine, muscle, skin, blood system, male germline, etc.) similarly depend on adult stem cells for homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gehart and Clevers, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sousa-Victor et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Spradling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Wilkinson et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, these stem cell-dependent tissues and organs are frequent sites of tumorigenesis, raising the possibility that human cancers may similarly impair neighboring stem cell differentiation to optimize nutrient allocation for malignant growth. A key limitation of our study is that the evidence is derived solely from <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline. Future work should explore whether similar regulatory paradigms operate in mammalian tissues during tumorigenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This preprint from Shaowei Zhao and colleagues presents results that suggest tumorous germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila ovary mimic the ovarian stem cell niche and inhibit the differentiation of neighboring non-mutant GSC-like cells. The authors use FRT-mediated clonal analysis driven by a germline-specific gene (nos-Gal4, UASp-flp) to induce GSC-like cells mutant for bam or bam's co-factor bgcn. Bam-mutant or bgcn-mutant germ cells produce tumors in the stem cell compartment (the germarium) of the ovary (Figure 1). These tumors contain non-mutant cells - termed SGC for single-germ cells. 75% of SGCs do not exhibit signs of differentiation (as assessed by bamP-GFP) (Figure 2). The authors demonstrate that block in differentiation in SGC is a result of suppression of bam expression (Figure 2). They present data suggesting that in 73% of SGCs, BMP signaling is low (assessed by dad-lacZ) (Figure 3) and proliferation is less in SGCs vs GSCs. They present genetic evidence that mutations in BMP pathway receptors and transcription factors suppress some of the non-autonomous effects exhibited by SGCs within bam-mutant tumors (Figure 4). They show data that bam-mutant cells secrete Dpp, but this data is not compelling (see below) (Figure 5). They provide genetic data that loss of BMP ligands (dpp and gbb) suppresses the appearance of SGCs in bam-mutant tumors (Figure 6). Taken together, their data support a model in which bam-mutant GSC-like cells produce BMPs that act on non-mutant cells (i.e., SGCs) to prevent their differentiation, similar to what is seen in the ovarian stem cell niche.

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Use of an excellent and established model for tumorous cells in a stem cell microenvironment.</p>
<p>(2) Powerful genetics allow them to test various factors in the tumorous vs non-tumorous cells.</p>
<p>(3) Appropriate use of quantification and statistics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) What is the frequency of SGCs in nos&gt;flp; bam-mutant tumors? For example, are they seen in every germarium, or in some germaria, etc, or in a few germaria?</p>
<p>(2) Does the breakdown in clonality vary when they induce hs-flp clones in adults as opposed to in larvae/pupae?</p>
<p>(3) Approximately 20-25% of SGCs are bam+, dad-LacZ+. Firstly, how do the authors explain this? Secondly, of the 70-75% of SGCs that have no/low BMP signaling, the authors should perform additional characterization using markers that are expressed in GSCs (i.e., Sex lethal and nanos).</p>
<p>(4) All experiments except Figure 1I (where a single germarium with no quantification) were performed with nos-Gal4, UASp-flp. Have the authors performed any of the phenotypic characterizations (i.e., figures other than Figure 1) with hs-flp?</p>
<p>(5) Does the number of SGCs change with the age of the female? The experiments were all performed in 14-day-old adult females. What happens when they look at a young female (like 2-day-old). I assume that the nos&gt;flp is working in larval and pupal stages, and so the phenotype should be present in young females. Why did the authors choose this later age? For example, is the phenotype more robust in older females? Or do you see more SGCs at later time points?</p>
<p>(6) Can the authors distinguish one copy of GFP versus 2 copies of GFP in germ cells of the ovary? This is not possible in the Drosophila testis. I ask because this could impact the clonal analyses diagrammed in Figure 4A and 4G and in 6A and B. Additionally, in most of the figures, the GFP is saturated, so it is not possible to discern one vs two copies of GFP.</p>
<p>(7) More evidence is needed to support the claim of elevated Dpp levels in bam or bgcn mutant tumors. The current results with the dpp-lacZ enhancer trap in Figure 5A, B are not convincing. First, why is the dpp-lacZ so much brighter in the mosaic analysis (A) than in the no-clone analysis (B)? It is expected that the level of dpp-lacZ in cap cells should be invariant between ovaries, and yet LacZ is very faint in Figure 5B. I think that if the settings in A matched those in B, the apparent expression of dpp-lacZ in the tumor would be much lower and likely not statistically significant. Second, they should use RNA in situ hybridization with a sensitive technique like hybridization chain reactions (HCR) - an approach that has worked well in numerous Drosophila tissues, including the ovary.</p>
<p>(8) In Figure 6, the authors report results obtained with the bamBG allele. Do they obtain similar data with another bam allele (i.e., bamdelta86)?</p>

<p>While the study by Zhang et al. provides valuable insights into how germline tumors can non-autonomously suppress the differentiation of neighboring wild-type germline stem cells (GSCs), several conceptual and technical issues limit the strength of the conclusions.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) Naming of SGCs is confusing. In line 68, the authors state that &quot;many wild-type germ cells located outside the niche retained a GSC-like single-germ-cell (SGC) morphology.&quot; However, bam or bgcn mutant GSCs are also referred to as &quot;SGCs,&quot; which creates confusion when reading the text and interpreting the figures. The authors should clarify the terminology used to distinguish between wild-type SGCs and tumor (bam/bgcn mutant) SGCs, and apply consistent naming throughout the manuscript and figure legends.</p>
<p>a) The same confusion appears in Figure 2. It is unclear whether the analyzed SGCs are wild-type or bam mutant cells. If the SGCs analyzed are Bam mutants, then the lack of Bam expression and failure to differentiate would be expected and not informative. However, if the SGCs are wild-type GSCs located outside the niche, then the observation would suggest that Bam expression is silenced in these wild-type cells, which is a significant finding. The authors should clarify the genotype of the SGCs analyzed in Figure 2C, as this information is not currently provided.</p>
<p>b) In Figures 4B and 4E, the analysis of SGC composition is confusing. In the control germaria (bam mutant mosaic), the authors label GFP⁺ SGCs as &quot;wild-type,&quot; which makes interpretation unclear. Note, this is completely different from their earlier definition shown in line 68.</p>
<p>c) Additionally, bam⁺/⁻ GSCs (the first bar in Figure 4E) should appear GFP⁺ and Red⁺ (i.e., yellow). It would be helpful if the authors could indicate these bam⁺/⁻ germ cells directly in the image and clarify the corresponding color representation in the main text. In Figure 2A, although a color code is shown, the legend does not explain it clearly, nor does it specify the identity of bam⁺/⁻ cells alone. Figure 4F has the same issue, and in this graph, the color does not match Figure 4A.</p>
<p>(2) The frequencies of bam or bgcn mutant mosaic germaria carrying [wild-type] SGCs or wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes, as well as the average number of wild-type SGCs per germarium and the number of days after heat shock for the representative images, are not provided when Figure 1 is first introduced. Since this is the first time the authors describe these phenotypes, including these details is essential. Without this information, it is difficult for readers to follow and evaluate the presented observations.</p>
<p>(3) Without the information mentioned in point 2, it causes problems when reading through the section regarding [wild-type] SGCs induced by impairment of differentiation or dedifferentiation. In lines 90-97, the authors use the presence of midbodies between cystocytes as a criterion to determine whether the wild-type GSCs surrounded by tumor GSCs arise through dedifferentiation. However, the cited study (Mathieu et al., 2022) reports that midbodies can be detected between two germ cells within a cyst carrying a branched fusome upon USP8 loss.</p>
<p>a) Are wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes present in the bam mutant mosaic germaria? What is the proportion of germaria containing wild-type SGCs versus those containing wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes?</p>
<p>b) If all bam mutant mosaic germaria carry only wild-type GSCs outside the niche and no germaria contain wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes, then examining midbodies as an indicator of dedifferentiation may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>c) If, however, some germaria do contain wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes, the authors should provide representative images and quantify their proportion.</p>
<p>d) In line 95, although the authors state that 50 germ cell cysts were analyzed for the presence of midbodies, it would be more informative to specify how many germaria these cysts were derived from and how many biological replicates were examined.</p>
<p>(4) Note that both bam mutant GSCs and wild-type SGCs can undergo division to generate midbodies (double cells), as shown in Figure 4H. Therefore, the current description of the midbody analysis is confusing. The authors should clarify which cell types were examined and explain how midbodies were interpreted in distinguishing between cell division and differentiation.</p>
<p>(5) The data in Figure 5 showing Dpp expression in bam mutant tumorous GSCs are not convincing. The Dpp-lacZ signal appears broadly distributed throughout the germarium, including in escort cells. To support the claim more clearly, the authors should present corresponding images for Figures 5D and 5E, in which dpp expression was knocked down in the germ cells of bam or bgcn mutant mosaic germaria. Showing these images would help clarify the localization and specificity of Dpp-lacZ expression relative to the tumorous GSCs.</p>
<p>(6) While Figure 6 provides genetic evidence that bam mutant tumorous GSCs produce Dpp to inhibit the differentiation of wild-type SGCs, it should be noted that these analyses were performed in a dpp⁺/⁻ background. To strengthen the conclusion, the authors should include appropriate controls showing [dpp⁺/⁻; bam⁺/⁻] SGCs and [dpp⁺/⁻; bam⁺/⁻] germ cell cysts without heat shock (as referenced in Figures 6F and 6I).</p>
<p>(7) Previous studies have reported that bam mutant germ cells cause blunted escort cell protrusions (e.g., Kirilly et al., Development, 2011), which are known to contribute to germ cell differentiation (e.g., Chen et al., Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022). The authors should include these findings in the Discussion to provide a broader context and to acknowledge how alterations in escort cell morphology may further influence differentiation defects in their model.</p>
<p>(8) Since fusome morphology is an important readout of SGCs vs differentiation. All the clonal analysis should have fusome staining.</p>
<p>(9) Figure arrangement. It is somewhat difficult to identify the figure panels cited in the text due to the current panel arrangement.</p>
<p>(10) The number of biological replicates and germaria analyzed should be clearly stated somewhere in the manuscript-ideally in the Methods section or figure legends. Providing this information is essential for assessing data reliability and reproducibility.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang et al. investigated how germline tumors influence the development of neighboring wild-type (WT) germline stem cells (GSC) in the Drosophila ovary. They report that germline tumors inhibit the differentiation of neighboring WT GSCs by arresting them in an undifferentiated state, resulting from reduced expression of the differentiation-promoting factor Bam. They find that these tumor cells produce low levels of the niche-associated signaling molecules Dpp and Gbb, which suppress bam expression and consequently inhibit the differentiation of neighboring WT GSCs non-cell-autonomously. Based on these findings, the authors propose that germline tumors mimic the niche to suppress the differentiation of the neighboring stem cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study addresses an important biological question concerning the interaction between germline tumor cells and WT germline stem cells in the Drosophila ovary. If the findings are substantiated, they could provide valuable insights applicable to other stem cell systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Previous work from Xie's lab demonstrated that bam and bgcn mutant GSCs can outcompete WT GSCs for niche occupancy. Furthermore, a large body of literature has established that the interactions between escort cells (ECs) and GSC daughters are essential for proper and timely germline differentiation (the differentiation niche). Disruption of these interactions leads to arrest of germline cell differentiation in a status with weak BMP signaling activation and low bam expression, a phenotype virtually identical to what is reported here.</p>
<p>Thus, it remains unclear whether the observed phenotype reflects &quot;direct inhibition by tumor cells&quot; or &quot;arrested differentiation due to the loss of the differentiation niche&quot;. Because most data were collected at a very late stage (more than 10 days after clonal induction), when tumor cells already dominate the germarium, this question cannot be solved. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the authors could conduct a time-course analysis to examine the onset of the WT GSC-like single-germ-cell (SGC) phenotype and determine whether early-stage tumor clones with a few tumor cells can suppress the differentiation of neighboring WT GSCs with only a few tumor cells present. If tumor cells indeed produce Dpp and Gbb (as proposed here) to inhibit the differentiation of neighboring germline cells, a small cluster or probably even a single tumor cell generated at an early stage might prevent the differentiation of their neighboring germ cells.</p>
<p>The key evidence supporting the claim that tumor cells produce Gpp and Gbb comes from Figures 5 and 6, which suggest that tumor-derived dpp and gbb are required for this inhibition. However, interpretation of these data requires caution.</p>
<p>In Figure 5, the authors use dpp-lacZ to support the claim that dpp is upregulated in tumor cells (Figure 5A and 5B). However, the background expression in somatic cells (ECs and pre-follicular cells) differs noticeably between these panels. In Figure 5A, dpp-lacZ expression in somatic cells in 5A is clearly higher than in 5B, and the expression level in tumor cells appears comparable to that in somatic cells (dpp-lacZ single channel). Similarly, in Figure 5B, dpp-lacZ expression in germline cells is also comparable to that in somatic cells. Providing clear evidence of upregulated dpp and gbb expression in tumor cells (for example, through single-molecular RNA in situ) would be essential.</p>
<p>Most tumor data present in this study were collected from the bam[86] null allele, whereas the data in Figure 6 were derived from a weaker bam[BG] allele. This bam[BG] allele is not molecularly defined and shows some genetic interaction with dpp mutants. As shown in Figure 6E, removal of dpp from homozygous bam[BG] mutant leads to germline differentiation (evidenced by a branched fusome connecting several cystocytes, located at the right side of the white arrowhead). In Figure 6D, fusome is likely present in some GFP-negative bam[BG]/bam[BG] cells. To strengthen their claim that the tumor produces Dpp and Gbb to inhibit WT germline cell differentiation, the authors should repeat these experiments using the bam[86] null allele.</p>
<p>It is well established that the stem niche provides multiple functional supports for maintaining resident stem cells, including physical anchorage and signaling regulation. In Drosophila, several signaling molecules produced by the niche have been identified, each with a distinct function - some promoting stemness, while others regulate differentiation. Expression of Dpp and Gbb alone does not substantiate the claim that these tumor cells have acquired the niche-like property. To support their assertion that these tumors mimic the niche, the authors should provide additional evidence showing that these tumor cells also express other niche-associated markers. Alternatively, they could revise the manuscript title to more accurately reflect their findings.</p>
<p>In the Method section, the authors need to provide details on how dpp-lacZ expression levels were quantified and normalized.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This preprint from Shaowei Zhao and colleagues presents results that suggest tumorous germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila ovary mimic the ovarian stem cell niche and inhibit the differentiation of neighboring non-mutant GSC-like cells. The authors use FRT-mediated clonal analysis driven by a germline-specific gene (nos-Gal4, UASp-flp) to induce GSC-like cells mutant for bam or bam's cofactor bgcn. Bam-mutant or bgcn-mutant germ cells produce tumors in the stem cell compartment (the germarium) of the ovary (Figure 1). These tumors contain non-mutant cells - termed SGC for single-germ cells. 75% of SGCs do not exhibit signs of differentiation (as assessed by bamP-GFP) (Figure 2). The authors demonstrate that block in differentiation in SGC is a result of suppression of bam expression (Figure 2). They present data suggesting that in 73% of SGCs, BMP signaling is low (assessed by dad-lacZ) (Figure 3) and proliferation is less in SGCs vs GSCs. They present genetic evidence that mutations in BMP pathway receptors and transcription factors suppress some of the non-autonomous effects exhibited by SGCs within bam-mutant tumors (Figure 4). They show data that bam-mutant cells secrete Dpp, but this data is not compelling (see below) (Figure 5). They provide genetic data that loss of BMP ligands (dpp and gbb) suppresses the appearance of SGCs in bam-mutant tumors (Figure 6). Taken together, their data support a model in which bam-mutant GSC-like cells produce BMPs that act on nonmutant cells (i.e., SGCs) to prevent their differentiation, similar to what is seen in the ovarian stem cell niche.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great question. Because the SGC phenotype depends on the presence of germline tumor clones, our quantification was restricted to germaria that contained them.These quantification data (&quot;SGCs and/or germline cysts per germarium with germline clones&quot;) will be presented in the revised Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Does the breakdown in clonality vary when they induce hs-flp clones in adults as opposed to in larvae/pupae?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our initial attempts to induce ovarian hs-flp germline clones by heat-shocking adult flies were unsuccessful, with very few clones being observed. Therefore, we shifted our approach to an earlier developmental stage. Successful induction was achieved by subjecting late-L3/early-pupal animals to a twice-daily heatshock at 37°C for 6 consecutive days (2 hours per session with a 6-hour interval, see Lines 325-329) (Zhao et al., 2018).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Approximately 20-25% of SGCs are bam+, dad-LacZ+. Firstly, how do the authors explain this? Secondly, of the 70-75% of SGCs that have no/low BMP signaling, the authors should perform additional characterization using markers that are expressed in GSCs (i.e., Sex lethal and nanos).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These 20-25% of SGCs are bamP-GFP<sup>+</sup> dad-lacZ-, not bam<sup>+</sup> dad-lacZ<sup>+</sup> (see Figure 2C and 3D). They would be cystoblast-like cells that may have initiated a differentiation program toward forming germline cysts (see Lines 109-117). The 70-75% of SGCs that have low BMP signaling exhibit GSC-like properties, including: 1) dot-like spectrosomes; 2) dad-lacZ positivity; 3) absence of bamP-GFP expression. While additional markers would be beneficial, we think that this combination of properties is sufficient to classify these cells as GSC-like.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) All experiments except Figure 1I (where a single germarium with no quantification) were performed with nos-Gal4, UASp-flp. Have the authors performed any of the phenotypic characterizations (i.e., figures other than Figure 1) with hs-flp?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we initially identified the SGC phenotype through hs-flp-mediated mosaic analysis of bam or bgcn mutant in ovaries. However, as noted in our response to Weakness (2), this approach was very labor-intensive. Therefore, we switched to using the more convenient nos::flp system for subsequent experiments. To our observation, there was no difference in the SGC phenotype between these two approaches, confirming that the nos::flp system is a valid and more practical alternative for its study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Does the number of SGCs change with the age of the female? The experiments were all performed in 14-day-old adult females. What happens when they look at a young female (like 2-day-old). I assume that the nos&gt;flp is working in larval and pupal stages, and so the phenotype should be present in young females. Why did the authors choose this later age? For example, is the phenotype more robust in older females? Or do you see more SGCs at later time points?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These are very good questions. Such time-course analysis data will be provided in revised Figure 1. The SGC phenotype depends on the presence of bam or bgcn mutant germline clones. Germaria from 14-day-old flies contained bigger and more such clones than those from younger flies. This age-dependent increase in clone size and frequency significantly enhanced the efficiency of our quantification (see Lines 129-131).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Can the authors distinguish one copy of GFP versus 2 copies of GFP in germ cells of the ovary? This is not possible in the Drosophila testis. I ask because this could impact the clonal analyses diagrammed in Figure 4A and 4G and in 6A and B. Additionally, in most of the figures, the GFP is saturated, so it is not possible to discern one vs two copies of GFP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate this comment. It was also difficult for us to distinguish 1 and 2 copies of GFP in the Drosophila ovary. In Figure 4A-F, to resolve this problem, we used a triplecolor system, in which red germ cells (RFP<sup>+/+</sup> GFP<sup>-/-</sup>) are bam mutant, yellow germ cells (RFP<sup>+/-</sup> GFP<sup>+/-</sup>) are wild-type, and green germ cells (RFP<sup>-/-</sup> GFP<sup>+/+</sup>) are punt or med mutant. In Figure 4G-J, we quantified the SGC phenotype only in black germ cells (GFP<sup>-/-</sup>), which are wild-type (control) or mad mutant.  In Figure 6, we quantified the SGC phenotype only in green germ cells (both GFP<sup>+/+</sup> and GFP<sup>+/-</sup>), all of which are wild-type.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) More evidence is needed to support the claim of elevated Dpp levels in bam or bgcn mutant tumors. The current results with the dpp-lacZ enhancer trap in Figure 5A, B are not convincing. First, why is the dpp-lacZ so much brighter in the mosaic analysis (A) than in the no-clone analysis (B)? It is expected that the level of dpplacZ in cap cells should be invariant between ovaries, and yet LacZ is very faint in Figure 5B. I think that if the settings in A matched those in B, the apparent expression of dpp-lacZ in the tumor would be much lower and likely not statistically significant. Second, they should use RNA in situ hybridization with a sensitive technique like hybridization chain reactions (HCR) - an approach that has worked well in numerous Drosophila tissues, including the ovary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this critical comment. The settings of immunofluorescent staining and confocal parameters in Figure 5A were the same as those in 5B. To our observation, the level of dpp-lacZ in cap cells was variable across germaria, even within the same ovary, as quantified in Figure 5C. We will provide RNA in situ hybridization data to further strengthen the conclusion that bam or bgcn mutant germline tumors secret BMP ligands.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Figure 6, the authors report results obtained with the bamBG allele. Do they obtain similar data with another bam allele (i.e., bamdelta86)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No. Given that bam<sup>BG</sup> was functionally indistinguishable from bam<sup>Δ86</sup> in inducing the SGC phenotype (compare Figure 6F, I with Figure 6-figure supplement 3C), we believe that repeating these experiments with bam<sup>Δ86</sup> would be redundant and would not alter the key conclusion of our study. Thanks for the understanding!</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>While the study by Zhang et al. provides valuable insights into how germline tumors can non-autonomously suppress the differentiation of neighboring wild-type germline stem cells (GSCs), several conceptual and technical issues limit the strength of the conclusions.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) Naming of SGCs is confusing. In line 68, the authors state that &quot;many wild-type germ cells located outside the niche retained a GSC-like single-germ-cell (SGC) morphology.&quot; However, bam or bgcn mutant GSCs are also referred to as &quot;SGCs,&quot; which creates confusion when reading the text and interpreting the figures. The authors should clarify the terminology used to distinguish between wild-type SGCs and tumor (bam/bgcn mutant) SGCs, and apply consistent naming throughout the manuscript and figure legends.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion. In our manuscript, the term &quot;SGC&quot; is reserved specifically for wild-type germ cells that maintain a GSC-like morphology outside the niche. bam or bgcn mutant germ cells are referred to as GSC-like tumor cells (Lines 87-88), not SGCs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(a) The same confusion appears in Figure 2. It is unclear whether the analyzed SGCs are wild-type or bam mutant cells. If the SGCs analyzed are Bam mutants, then the lack of Bam expression and failure to differentiate would be expected and not informative. However, if the SGCs are wild-type GSCs located outside the niche, then the observation would suggest that Bam expression is silenced in these wildtype cells, which is a significant finding. The authors should clarify the genotype of the SGCs analyzed in Figure 2C, as this information is not currently provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The SGCs analyzed in Figure 2A-C are wild-type, GSC-like cells located outside the niche. They were generated using the same genetic strategy depicted in Figures 1C and 1E (with the schematic in Figure 1B). The complete genotypes for all experiments are available in</p>
<p>Source data 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) In Figures 4B and 4E, the analysis of SGC composition is confusing. In the control germaria (bam mutant mosaic), the authors label GFP⁺ SGCs as &quot;wild-type,&quot; which makes interpretation unclear. Note, this is completely different from their earlier definition shown in line 68.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The strategy to generate SGCs in Figure 4B-F (with the schematic in Figure 4A) is completely different from that in Figure 1C-F, H, and I (with the schematic in Figure 1B). In Figure 4B-F, we needed to distinguish punt<sup>-/-</sup> (or med<sup>-/-</sup>) with punt<sup>+/-</sup> (or med<sup>+/-</sup>) germ cells. As noted in our response to Reviewer #1’s Weakness (6), it was difficult for us to distinguish 1 and 2 copies of GFP in the Drosophila ovary. Therefore, we chose to use the triple-color system to distinguish these germ cells in Figure 4B-F (see genotypes in Source data 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) Additionally, bam⁺/⁻ GSCs (the first bar in Figure 4E) should appear GFP⁺ and Red⁺ (i.e., yellow). It would be helpful if the authors could indicate these bam⁺/⁻ germ cells directly in the image and clarify the corresponding color representation in the main text. In Figure 2A, although a color code is shown, the legend does not explain it clearly, nor does it specify the identity of bam⁺/⁻ cells alone. Figure 4F has the same issue, and in this graph, the color does not match Figure 4A.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The color-to-genotype relationships for the schematics in Figures 2A and 4E are provided in Figures 1B and 4A, respectively. Due to the high density of germ cells, it is impractical to label each genotype directly in the images. In contrast to Figure 4E, the colors in Figure 4F do not represent genotypes; instead, blue denotes the percentage of SGCs, and red denotes the percentage of germline cysts, as indicated below the bar chart.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The frequencies of bam or bgcn mutant mosaic germaria carrying [wild-type] SGCs or wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes, as well as the average number of wild-type SGCs per germarium and the number of days after heat shock for the representative images, are not provided when Figure 1 is first introduced. Since this is the first time the authors describe these phenotypes, including these details is essential. Without this information, it is difficult for readers to follow and evaluate the presented observations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this constructive suggestion. We will include such quantification data in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Without the information mentioned in point 2, it causes problems when reading through the section regarding [wild-type] SGCs induced by impairment of differentiation or dedifferentiation. In lines 90-97, the authors use the presence of midbodies between cystocytes as a criterion to determine whether the wild-type GSCs surrounded by tumor GSCs arise through dedifferentiation. However, the cited study (Mathieu et al., 2022) reports that midbodies can be detected between two germ cells within a cyst carrying a branched fusome upon USP8 loss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unlike wild-type cystocytes, which undergo incomplete cytokinesis and lack midbodies, those with USP8 loss undergo complete cell division, with the presence of midbodies (white arrow, Figure 1F’ from Mathieu et al., 2022) as a marker of the late cytokinesis stage (Mathieu et al., 2022).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(a) Are wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes present in the bam mutant mosaic germaria? What is the proportion of germaria containing wild-type SGCs versus those containing wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes?</p>
<p>(b) If all bam mutant mosaic germaria carry only wild-type GSCs outside the niche and no germaria contain wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes, then examining midbodies as an indicator of dedifferentiation may not be appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate this critical comment. bam mutant mosaic germaria indeed contained wild-type germline cysts, as evidenced by an SGC frequency of ~70%, rather than 100% (see Figures 2H, 4F, 4J, 6F, 6I, and Figure 6-figure supplement 3C). Since the SGC phenotype depends on the presence of bam or bgcn mutant germline tumors, we quantified it as “the percentage of SGCs relative to the total number of SGCs and germline cysts that are surrounded by germline tumors” (see Lines 124-129). Quantifying the SGC phenotype as &quot;the percentage of germaria with SGCs&quot; would be imprecise. This is because the presence and number of SGCs were highly variable among germaria with bam mutant germline clones, and a small number of germaria entirely lacked these clones. We will provide the data of &quot;SGCs and/or germline cysts per germarium with germline clones&quot; in revised Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) If, however, some germaria do contain wild-type germ cell cysts with branched fusomes, the authors should provide representative images and quantify their proportion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Such representative germaria are shown in Figure 2G, 3B, 3C, 6D, 6E, and 6H. The percentage of germline cysts can be calculated by “100% - SGC%”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(d) In line 95, although the authors state that 50 germ cell cysts were analyzed for the presence of midbodies, it would be more informative to specify how many germaria these cysts were derived from and how many biological replicates were examined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted in our response to points a) and b) above, the germ cells surrounded by germline tumors, rather than germarial numbers, are more precise for analyzing the phenotype. For this experiment, we examined &gt;50 such germline cysts via confocal microscopy. As the analysis was performed on a defined cellular population, this sample size should be sufficient to support our conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Note that both bam mutant GSCs and wild-type SGCs can undergo division to generate midbodies (double cells), as shown in Figure 4H. Therefore, the current description of the midbody analysis is confusing. The authors should clarify which cell types were examined and explain how midbodies were interpreted in distinguishing between cell division and differentiation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assayed for the presence of midbodies or not specifically within the germline cysts surrounded by bam mutant tumors, not within the tumors themselves (Lines 94-95). As detailed in Lines 88-97, the absence of midbodies was used as a key criterion to exclude the possibility of dedifferentiation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The data in Figure 5 showing Dpp expression in bam mutant tumorous GSCs are not convincing. The Dpp-lacZ signal appears broadly distributed throughout the germarium, including in escort cells. To support the claim more clearly, the authors should present corresponding images for Figures 5D and 5E, in which dpp expression was knocked down in the germ cells of bam or bgcn mutant mosaic germaria. Showing these images would help clarify the localization and specificity of Dpp-lacZ expression relative to the tumorous GSCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate this comment. RNA in situ hybridization data will be provided to further strengthen the conclusion that bam or bgcn mutant germline tumors secret BMP ligands.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) While Figure 6 provides genetic evidence that bam mutant tumorous GSCs produce Dpp to inhibit the differentiation of wild-type SGCs, it should be noted that these analyses were performed in a dpp⁺/⁻ background. To strengthen the conclusion, the authors should include appropriate controls showing [dpp⁺/⁻; bam⁺/⁻] SGCs and [dpp⁺/⁻; bam⁺/⁻] germ cell cysts without heat shock (as referenced in Figures 6F and 6I).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Schematic cartoons in Figure 6A and 6B demonstrate that these analyses were performed in a dpp<sup>+/-</sup> background. Figure 6-figure supplement 1 indicates that dpp<sup>+/-</sup> or gbb<sup>+/-</sup> does not affect GSC maintenance, germ cell differentiation, and female fly fertility. Figure 6C is the control for 6D and 6E, and 6G is the control for 6H, with quantification in 6F and 6I.  We used nos::flp, not the heat shock method, to induce germline clones in these experiments (see genotypes in Source data 1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Previous studies have reported that bam mutant germ cells cause blunted escort cell protrusions (e.g., Kirilly et al., Development, 2011), which are known to contribute to germ cell differentiation (e.g., Chen et al., Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022). The authors should include these findings in the Discussion to provide a broader context and to acknowledge how alterations in escort cell morphology may further influence differentiation defects in their model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for teaching us! Such discussion will be included in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Since fusome morphology is an important readout of SGCs vs differentiation. All the clonal analysis should have fusome staining.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>SGC is readily distinguishable from multi-cellular germline cyst based on morphology. In some clonal analysis experiments, fusome staining was not feasible due to technical limitations such as channel saturation or antibody incompatibility. Thanks for the understanding!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Figure arrangement. It is somewhat difficult to identify the figure panels cited in the text due to the current panel arrangement.</p>

<p>The figure panels were arranged to optimize space while ensuring that related panels are grouped in close proximity for logical comparison. We would be happy to consider any specific suggestions for an alternative layout that could improve clarity. Thanks!</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang et al. investigated how germline tumors influence the development of neighboring wild-type (WT) germline stem cells (GSC) in the Drosophila ovary. They report that germline tumors inhibit the differentiation of neighboring WT GSCs by arresting them in an undifferentiated state, resulting from reduced expression of the differentiation-promoting factor Bam. They find that these tumor cells produce low levels of the niche-associated signaling molecules Dpp and Gbb, which suppress bam expression and consequently inhibit the differentiation of neighboring WT GSCs non-cell-autonomously. Based on these findings, the authors propose that germline tumors mimic the niche to suppress the differentiation of the neighboring stem cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study addresses an important biological question concerning the interaction between germline tumor cells and WT germline stem cells in the Drosophila ovary. If the findings are substantiated, they could provide valuable insights applicable to other stem cell systems.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate these comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Previous work from Xie's lab demonstrated that bam and bgcn mutant GSCs can outcompete WT GSCs for niche occupancy. Furthermore, a large body of literature has established that the interactions between escort cells (ECs) and GSC daughters are essential for proper and timely germline differentiation (the differentiation niche). Disruption of these interactions leads to arrest of germline cell differentiation in a status with weak BMP signaling activation and low bam expression, a phenotype virtually identical to what is reported here. Thus, it remains unclear whether the observed phenotype reflects &quot;direct inhibition by tumor cells&quot; or &quot;arrested differentiation due to the loss of the differentiation niche&quot;. Because most data were collected at a very late stage (more than 10 days after clonal induction), when tumor cells already dominate the germarium, this question cannot be solved. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the authors could conduct a time-course analysis to examine the onset of the WT GSC-like singlegerm-cell (SGC) phenotype and determine whether early-stage tumor clones with a few tumor cells can suppress the differentiation of neighboring WT GSCs with only a few tumor cells present. If tumor cells indeed produce Dpp and Gbb (as proposed here) to inhibit the differentiation of neighboring germline cells, a small cluster or probably even a single tumor cell generated at an early stage might prevent the differentiation of their neighboring germ cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this critical comment. Such time-course analysis data will be provided in revised Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The key evidence supporting the claim that tumor cells produce Gpp and Gbb comes from Figures 5 and 6, which suggest that tumor-derived dpp and gbb are required for this inhibition. However, interpretation of these data requires caution. In Figure 5, the authors use dpp-lacZ to support the claim that dpp is upregulated in tumor cells (Figure 5A and 5B). However, the background expression in somatic cells (ECs and pre-follicular cells) differs noticeably between these panels. In Figure 5A, dpp-lacZ expression in somatic cells in 5A is clearly higher than in 5B, and the expression level in tumor cells appears comparable to that in somatic cells (dpplacZ single channel). Similarly, in Figure 5B, dpp-lacZ expression in germline cells is also comparable to that in somatic cells. Providing clear evidence of upregulated dpp and gbb expression in tumor cells (for example, through single-molecular RNA in situ) would be essential.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate this critical comment. In our data, the expression of dpp-lacZ in cap cells was variable across germaria, even within the same ovary, as quantified in Figure 5C. The images in Figures 5A and 5B were selected as representative examples of positive signaling. To directly address the reviewer's point and strengthen our conclusion, we will perform RNA in situ hybridization data in the revised manuscript to visualize the expression of BMP ligands within the bam or bgcn mutant germline tumor cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Most tumor data present in this study were collected from the bam[86] null allele, whereas the data in Figure 6 were derived from a weaker bam[BG] allele. This bam[BG] allele is not molecularly defined and shows some genetic interaction with dpp mutants. As shown in Figure 6E, removal of dpp from homozygous bam[BG] mutant leads to germline differentiation (evidenced by a branched fusome connecting several cystocytes, located at the right side of the white arrowhead). In Figure 6D, fusome is likely present in some GFP-negative bam[BG]/bam[BG] cells. To strengthen their claim that the tumor produces Dpp and Gbb to inhibit WT germline cell differentiation, the authors should repeat these experiments using the bam[86] null allele.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although a structure resembling a &quot;branched fusome&quot; is visible in Figure 6E (right of the white arrowhead), it is an artifact resulting from the cytoplasm of GFP-positive follicle cells, which also stain for α-Spectrin, projecting between germ cells of different clones (see the merged image). In both our previous (Zhang et al., 2023) and current studies, bam<sup>BG</sup> was functionally indistinguishable from bam<sup>Δ86</sup> in its ability to block GSC differentiation and induce the SGC phenotype (compare Figure 6F, I with Figure 6-figure supplement 3C). Given this, we believe that repeating the extensive experiments in Figure 6 with the bam<sup>Δ86</sup> allele would be scientifically redundant and would not change the key conclusion of our study. We thank the reviewer for their consideration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is well established that the stem niche provides multiple functional supports for maintaining resident stem cells, including physical anchorage and signaling regulation. In Drosophila, several signaling molecules produced by the niche have been identified, each with a distinct function - some promoting stemness, while others regulate differentiation. Expression of Dpp and Gbb alone does not substantiate the claim that these tumor cells have acquired the niche-like property. To support their assertion that these tumors mimic the niche, the authors should provide additional evidence showing that these tumor cells also express other niche-associated markers. Alternatively, they could revise the manuscript title to more accurately reflect their findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dpp and Gbb are the key niche signals from cap cells for maintaining GSC stemness. Our work demonstrates that germline tumors can specifically mimic this signaling function, not the full suite of cap cell properties, to create a non-cell-autonomous differentiation block. The current title “Tumors mimic the niche to inhibit neighboring stem cell differentiation” reflects this precise concept: a partial, functional mimicry of the niche's most relevant activity in this context. We feel it is an appropriate and compelling summary of our main conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the Method section, the authors need to provide details on how dpp-lacZ expression levels were quantified and normalized.</p>
