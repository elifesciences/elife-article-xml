<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> biovar <italic>anthracis</italic> (<italic>Bcbva</italic>) is an atypical anthrax-causing bacterium, inflicting wildlife fatalities across African rainforest ecosystems. The pathogen’s virulence in one of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzee, together with human serological evidence, suggests <italic>Bcbva</italic> is zoonotic. While classical <italic>B. anthracis</italic>-induced anthrax has been described to affect the central nervous system at a progressive disease-state, the neuroinfectiology of <italic>Bcbva</italic> is yet unknown. Here we characterised the pathogen’s neuro-invasiveness via gross pathological assessment, ultra-high resolution quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and histological analysis on four brains, which were extracted from naturally deceased wild chimpanzees in Taï National Park, Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p>Based on macroscopically evident pial vessel congestion and haemorrhages as well as cortical siderosis detected via MRI, we concluded that <italic>Bcbva</italic> induced meningitis analogous to <italic>B. anthracis</italic>. Further, histological visualisation of bacteria and leukocytes in the subarachnoid space evidenced the bacterium’s capability to breach the arachnoid barrier. <italic>Bcbva</italic> was detected in the brain parenchyma of all four cases. This indicates a higher ability to transgress the glia limitans and therefore exhibits a higher neuroinvasiveness compared to <italic>B. anthracis</italic> that predominantly stays confined to the meninges. Heightened glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression but little morphological gliosis suggest a rapid disease progression leading to host-death within hours to a few days after central nervous system invasion.</p>
<p>Overall our results reveal <italic>Bcbva</italic>’s ability to breach blood-brain barriers which results in a pronounced neuropathogenicity. <italic>Bcbva</italic> causes extensive damage to the meninges and the brain parenchyma, as well as rapid and massive digestion of brain extracellular matrix in chimpanzees and potentially so in humans in case of zoonotic spillover.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recent COVID-19 pandemic has showcased the significant socio-economic costs caused by neuropathogenic effects of zoonotic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Understanding the neuropathological mechanisms of these diseases before outbreaks is crucial for the development of therapies and diagnostics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This presents a challenge, as common laboratory animals do not always serve as ideal models for the complexity of the large human brain. Hierin, we demonstrate that unique insights into the neuroinfectiology of a likely zoonotic disease can be gained by studying naturally deceased wild chimpanzees in an opportunistic, ethical approach.</p>
<p>It was unexpected when in the early 2000s deaths of wild chimpanzees in the dense west African rainforest of Taï National Park were attributed to anthrax<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, as this lethal, bacterial, zoonotic disease usually affects ungulates in savannahs or other open landscapes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Genetic investigations revealed that the bacterium found in these chimpanzees was phylogenetically distinct to the monophyletic <italic>B. anthracis</italic> lineage, which thus far had been believed to be the only agent capable of inducing anthrax<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The newly discovered pathogen was more closely related to <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> strains – bacteria usually associated with food poisoning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. New anthrax-inducing strain was termed <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> biovar <italic>anthracis</italic> (<italic>Bcbva</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Since its discovery, <italic>Bcbva</italic> has been associated with wildlife fatalities across west and central African rainforests, distinct from the ecological niche and geographical distribution of <italic>B. anthracis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. It predominantly affects primates, including apes and old world monkeys, followed by forest antelopes and accounts for up to 40% of the observed wildlife mortality locally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>On a molecular level, <italic>B. anthracis</italic> and <italic>Bcbva</italic> share highly syntenic virulence plasmids, decisive for both bacteria’s pathogenicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The larger of these plasmids, pXO1 (182 kilobase pairs (kbp)) encodes for the anthrax toxin complex responsible for disrupting the host’s innate immune response, while the smaller plasmid, pXO2 (96 kbp) encodes a poly-γ-D-glutamic acid capsule operon, shielding vegetative bacteria from phagocytes and antibody binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although no confirmed human <italic>Bcbva</italic>-case has been reported yet, <italic>Bcbva</italic>’s capability to elicit lethal infections in our closest living relatives, paired with human serological evidence, strongly vouch for <italic>Bcbva</italic>’s zoonotic character<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> .</p>
<p><italic>B. anthracis</italic> morbidity in humans is predominantly of zoonotic origin, induced by contact with spore-contaminated animal products. Therefore, bushmeat poses a serious potential source of human <italic>Bcbva</italic> infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In addition to zoonotic infections, <italic>B. anthracis</italic> has become notorious for its misuse in biological warfare and bioterrorism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>B. anthracis</italic> is known to be neuroinvasive and meningitis is a common severe complication of systemic anthrax<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a clear negative prognostic factor for human survival and mortality rates are close to 100 % in spite of aggressive medical therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The brief, rapidly progressing course of disease is characterised by nausea, emesis, severe headache, meningeal signs, seizures and other neurological deficits shortly prior to death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) regularly presents haemorrhagic with a marked leukocytosis and bacterial infiltration. MRI findings include leptomeningeal enhancement, vasogenic oedema<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, abscessation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, multiple infarction and foremost haemorrhages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In general, the inflammatory pattern in the CNS analogous to other affected organs, is of a predominantly haemorrhagic character. In severe cases, a diffusely crimson coloured brain surface is revealed upon <italic>postmortem</italic> examination which has been metaphorically coined “cardinal’s cap”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus far, nothing was known about the neurovirulence of <italic>Bcbva</italic> in its natural hosts and particularly in humans. We addressed this knowledge gap by analysing four brains extracted from wild chimpanzees that died of <italic>Bcbva</italic>-induced anthrax in Taï National Park. Chimpanzees are one of humans’ closest living relatives providing the best model to study <italic>Bcbva</italic>’s neuroinfectology in the case of zoonotic spillover. In the late 1950s, chimpanzees were used as a primate animal model for inhalational anthrax infection in experiments with intended multiple aerosol infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Fortunately, the progress in animal welfare in laboratory research has recently restricted the use of great apes in invasive medical research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, which is banned by an ever growing number of scientific organisations worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. As brain specimens in our study were obtained occasionally after the chimpanzees’ natural deaths, providing an ethical approach to study the pathogen’s neurovirulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The analyses reveal the bacterium’s pronounced neuroinvasiveness, enabling it to disrupt blood-brain barriers with subsequent propagation in the meninges and brain parenchyma as well as severe effects on brain tissue integrity.</p>

<title>Cases</title>
<p>Four wild chimpanzee (<italic>Pan troglodytes verus</italic>) brains, with confirmed fatal <italic>Bcbva</italic> infections, from Taï National Park (Taï NP, Côte d’Ivoire) were examined, along with one control specimen from Tacugama Chimpanzee Sanctuary (Sierra Leone), which died after an intra-group attack. Details on age, sex, and <italic>postmortem</italic> interval before fixation (PMI) are displayed in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref> and summarised below. Our research is conducted according to standards specified by the Max Planck Society’s Ethics Committee (04.08.2014). Our <italic>postmortem</italic> brain extraction methods are noninvasive in the sense that they do not harm the living animal.</p>

<title>Behaviour</title>
<p>Chimpanzees in Taï NP are the subjects of behavioural research conducted within the <underline>Taï</underline> <underline>Chimpanzee Project</underline> (TCP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Habituated chimpanzees in Taï NP are followed daily by a research team, and their behaviour and health status are systematically documented within ongoing health monitoring with continuous presence of a field veterinarian as an integral part of TCP.</p>

<title>Necropsy</title>
<p><italic>Postmortem</italic> examinations were a part of the ongoing wildlife health monitoring programme established in 2001<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> aiming to understand and monitor the drivers of wildlife mortality, especially zoonotic diseases relevant for species conservation and public health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>Postmortem</italic> tissue sampling was performed exclusively by trained veterinarians following strict biosafety protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The carcasses were solely approached wearing protective equipment consisting of rubber boots, a Tyvek® coverall, three pairs of gloves, protective arm sleeves, an FFP3 mask and a face shield/goggles. All single-use equipment utilised during the necropsy was enclosed in at least two layers of trash bags and was subsequently burnt. Reusable material and sample containers were decontaminated at a hygiene barrier using bleach with a sodium hypochlorite concentration of 1%. Brain extractions were performed utilising a battery-operated oscillating saw (KUGEL medical) and the complete organ was immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Tissue samples for molecular biology diagnostics were placed into cryo tubes (Simport) and stored in liquid nitrogen. After export to Germany, the brains were transferred into a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4 solution with 0.1% sodium azide for long-term storage at 4°C. For the complete detailed sampling protocol please refer to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The meninges were removed prior to the start of the consequent investigations due to requirements of a different project.</p>

<title>PCR Diagnostics</title>
<p>DNA for PCR-based diagnostics was extracted from tissue samples with the Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen©), following the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The PCR master mix was prepared utilising Platinum™Taq DNA Polymerase and DNA-free reagents (Invitrogen), along with primer-pairs targeting three <italic>Bcbva</italic> markers (one for each virulence plasmid and one chromosomal) and a corresponding, fluorophore-labelled TaqMan probe for real-time detection (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Five µl or a maximum of 200 ng/µl of template DNA was added per well, and the assay was run on an AriaMx Real-time PCR System (Agilent). The cycle conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 34 s. Each sample was tested in duplicate, and duplicate negative template controls and standard dilutions were included. The amplification data were analysed with the Agilent AriaMx v. 1.7 software.</p>

<title>Bacterial culture</title>
<p>Spleen tissue samples were cultured on R&amp;F® <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>/<italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> Chromogenic Plating Medium (R &amp; F Products©) via dilution streaking and single colonies were picked after 14 h of incubation. Bacterial DNA was extracted utilising the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (QIAGEN©) with the manufacturer’s recommended protocol for gram positive bacteria. The DNA concentrations of extracts were quantified with the help of Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and 1 ng of genomic DNA was used for constructing sequencing libraries with the NexteraXT Kit (Illumina). MagSi-NGS<sup>PREP</sup> Plus Beads (Steinbrenner Laborsysteme GmbH) were employed for PCR clean-up with a volume ratio of 0.7 (beads/amplified library) and freshly prepared 80% ethanol. Libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 2000 platform using the P2 reagents (Illumina).</p>
<p>Previously published <italic>Bcbva</italic> whole-genome sequence data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> were downloaded from the sequence read archive (SRA) and converted to the fastq format with the SRA toolkit v. 2.22.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d3">
<title>Bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>Basecalling and demultiplexing of the newly sequenced chimpanzee isolates was performed via bcl2fastq v. 2.19.0.316. Resulting fastq data were quality assessed and adapter trimmed with fastp v.0.20.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Genetic variants were called using the snippy pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> with default parameters and variants were annotated by means of SnpEff v.5.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. A SNP-alignment was extracted via snp-sites v. 2.5.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and a suitable DNA-evolution model for phylogenetic inference was chosen utilising modeltest-ng v.0.1.7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The chromosomal <italic>Bcbva</italic> phylogenetic tree was built in a maximum likelihood framework using RAxML-NG v.1.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, starting from 20 random and 20 parsimony trees. The best scoring ML tree was resampled with 500 bootstrap replicates to calculate transfer bootstrap expectancy (TBE) branch support values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The resulting tree was imported into RStudio<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> via the treeio package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and visualised via ggtree<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Macroscopic neuropathological changes caused by <italic>Bcbva</italic> we accessed used ultra-high resolution quantitative MRI (qMRI), providing microstructural information about tissue pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. We obtained maps of three qMR parameters: magnetisation transfer saturation (MTsat) reflecting tissue macromolecular content, longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) reflecting myelin and iron content, effective transverse relaxation rate R2* strongly sensitive to tissue iron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>QMRI imaging was performed on a human whole-body 7T MRI scanner (Terra, Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen), using a 32 channel radio-frequency (RF) transmit-receive human head coil (Nova Medical, Wilmington, MA). For MRI investigations the brains were embedded in the MRI-invisible liquid Fomblin (Solvay). QMRI was performed using a multi-parametric mapping method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Scanning parameters are provided in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and in Supplementary Materials. The quantitative maps of R1, MTsat and R2* with isotropic resolution of 300 µm were obtained using the open source hMRI toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, adapted for the analysis of ultra-high resolution <italic>postmortem</italic> images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The brains were cut into 15 mm thick coronal slabs and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS pH 7.4 with 0.1% sodium azide. Sections of 30 µm thickness were cut on a cryomicrotome (Microm HM430 with freezing unit Microm KS34, Thermo Scientific) and mounted on coated glass slides, air dried and rehydrated before further processing. Consecutive sections were stained using the haematoxylin and eosin (H/E) and Nissl stain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> for bacteria visualisation, Perls’s stain with diaminobenzidine enhancement for iron visualisation, and a modified Moeller, Rakette stain and the classical Gram-stains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> for detection of endospores.</p>
<p>All immunohistochemical stains were performed on free floating sections, which were treated with 2% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 60% methanol for 30 min to reduce endogene peroxidase activity, followed by a blocking step with a solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% donkey serum. Sections were incubated for 24 or 48 h at 4°C with the primary antibodies (see <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref> for the list of all used materials). After incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and for 1 h with ExtrAvidin-Peroxidase, the immunoreaction was detected through a diaminobenzidine reaction (partially with nickel enhancement) under visual control. Sections were counterstained with the Nissl stain. The sections were coverslipped with Entellan (Merck) and imaged with Zeiss AxioScan.Z1 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany).</p>

<title>Histological quantification</title>
<p>The degree of <italic>Bcbva</italic> invasion in Nissl-stained sections was assessed semi-quantitatively by one rater (CJ). The bacterial load in the section of each case was rated on the five level scale according to categories: “very sparse”, “sparse”, “moderate”, “dense”, “very dense”.</p>
<p>To assess <italic>Bcbva</italic>’s impact on parenchymal tissue integrity, perineuronal nets (PNNs) were stained via anti-aggrecan immunohistochemistry. PNNs are a specialised form of neuronal extracellular matrix (ECM) showing a mesh-like arrangement of proteins and sugar molecules ensheathing certain neurons, with aggrecan being a key component of healthy neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. The number of PNN-ensheathed neurons was quantified by counting the number of anti-aggrecan antibody-labelled neurons per mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> in all cases (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) by one rater (KR), blinded to the experimental conditions. The same cortical area (primary visual cortex, analogue of Brodmann Area 17) was analysed in all cases to account for known variation of density and cortical distribution of PNNs between cortical areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Counts were performed on a Zeiss AxioScan.Z1 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using Zen Blue software 3.6 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Relevant cortical regions were delineated at low magnification and three frames were placed in a systematic-consecutive fashion in the delineated regions. Neurons within each frame (250 x 2500 µm) were counted at higher magnification (20x, NA 0.8, ∼350nm). Three sections and six frames per case were investigated. The number of PNNs was converted to numerical density per mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>.</p>

<p><italic>Bcbva</italic> load was quantified on consecutive Nissl sections. Percentual area coverage with <italic>Bcbva</italic> was estimated using AI software module Intellesis Zen Blue 3.6.

<p>We compared PNN density between each infected case and healthy control using unpaired two-sided t-tests for samples with different variance, comparing six frames of <italic>Bcbva</italic>-cases with the six samples from control brain, correcting for multiple comparisons (four comparisons corresponding to four cases) using the family-wise-error correction method.</p>
<p>The area measures were used to estimate the total density of <italic>Bcbva</italic> in bacteria per mm³ of brain tissue, by assuming non-overlapping bacteria and estimating the area covered by one bacteria to be about 6 µm<sup>2</sup>, based on the average bacterial length and width of 1 µm and 6 µm respectively.</p>

<title>Gross pathology indicates inflammatory meningeal involvement</title>
<p>Included in this study were four complete chimpanzee brains, sampled between December 2018 and March 2020 (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Tissue samples from these individuals were incidentally found to be PCR-positive for all three <italic>Bcbva</italic> markers.</p>
<p>The necropsy on the young adult female case 1 (14±3 y) from an unhabituated group was conducted on 12th of December 2018 and, since it was an unknown individual, no prior behavioural history was available. The chimpanzee was assessed to have died less than 24 h prior to the necropsy as assessed via fly larvae infestation and <italic>rigor mortis</italic> status. The body was bloated and hyperaemic. Haemorrhagic lungs were the major findings on gross pathology.</p>
<p>Case 2 (1.7 y), a male infant, died suddenly on 5th of April 2019 without prior clinical signs up to the last observation 1.5 h before death and the brain was extracted 24 h after death. The main macroscopic findings included severe, haemorrhagic pneumonia and a congested liver, as well as a mild haemorrhagic meningitis with congested meningeal vessels, multifocal meningeal haemorrhages (up to 10 mm in diameter, see inset of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref> for an example) and oedematous brain tissue.</p>

<p>The two remaining specimens stem from case 3 (16 y) and case 4 (15 y), two socially bonded adult males. Case 3 was found freshly dead near his nesting site on the morning of 11th of March 2020 and the brain was extracted within 16 h after death. He was previously in good general condition without exhibiting any signs of disease when last observed five days prior to death. Case 4 interacted with case 3’s corpse on 11th of March 2020, repeatedly biting it and eventually creating a large, deep lesion in the throat area (∼25 x 20 cm). On 12th and 13th of March, he was more subdued, producing no panthoots or drums, and on the 13th he was resting much more than normal. On the 14th of March he separated from the group in the morning and was resting on his back approximately 70% of the time; his breathing and eating behaviour was evaluated as normal. He was found dead under his nesting-site on the morning of 15th of March and the brain was extracted within 12 h after death. Both cases 3 and 4 exhibited a severe haemorrhagic pneumonia on <italic>post mortem</italic> examination.</p>
<p>No gross brain pathology was reported in the necropsy records of case 1,3, and 4. However, based on photographs taken during brain fixation, the brains of cases 1 and 3 exhibited clearly injected and congested pial vessels, which corresponds to the gross-pathological findings of case 2 (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Further, haemorrhages in the caudal part of the frontal lobe bilateral to the longitudinal fissure (10 x 10 mm) were still apparent in the meninges of case 1. These findings indicate inflammatory meningeal involvement to varying degrees.</p>

<title>Whole-genome phylogenies and SNP-analysis reveal genetically representative <italic>Bcbva</italic> strains</title>
<p><italic>Bcbva</italic> was successfully cultured from tissue samples of cases 3 and 4 and whole-genome sequences exceeding a 200X depth of coverage were generated. The isolates exhibited identical SNP profiles, indicating that the chimpanzee deaths were epidemiologically linked. It is possible that both chimpanzees were exposed to a common infection source, or that case 4 became infected while interacting with case 3’s carcass. Compared to the <italic>Bcbva</italic> reference genome (GCF_000143605.1), which likewise stems from Taï NP, the isolates exhibited 69 SNPs and fell well within the known diversity of Taï NP isolates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Sixty-eight of those SNPs were chromosomal, whereas one was identified on the virulence plasmid pXO2. Among the 48 SNPs located in protein coding sequences, 38 were non-synonymous, resulting in four occasions in an early stop codon (SNP <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). However, none of the SNPs were located in the virulence-defining pathogenicity islands of pXO1 and pXO2. Thus the isolates’ phylogenetic placements and SNP-profiles provide no evidence of altered (neuro)pathogenicity within these strains, indicating that they are representative for <italic>Bcbva</italic>’s neuroinvasive capabilities.</p>

<title><italic>Bcbva</italic> induces superficial cortical siderosis and lytic lesions as revealed by qMRI</title>
<p>Maps of qMRI parameters R2*, R1 and MTsat for all cases with <italic>Bcbva</italic> infection demonstrated clear differences compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Infected brains exhibited lytic lesions in white and grey matter. These lytic lesions, visible in all MRI contrasts, were probably the result of <italic>Bcbva</italic>-induced heterolysis. In three cases (case 1, 3 and 4), lytic processes additionally resulted in inhomogeneity of quantitative R1 maps with a hyperintense brain periphery and a hypointense brain centre. Therefore, the observed gradient of R1 likely reflects the disintegration of brain macromolecules such as lipids, proteins and ECM, caused by inhomogeneous fixation or by heterolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Similar gradients of tissue integrity are often observed in immersion-fixed large brains (i.e. human brains)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. The fact that the gradient was more pronounced for <italic>Bcbva</italic>-infected brains as compared to the control may indicate that infection contributes to enhanced heterolysis.</p>

<caption><p>Quantitative MRI of chimpanzee brains from four confirmed cases of <italic>Bcbva</italic> infection (four lower rows) compared to a brain of a control individual (upper row). Three quantitative MRI parameters [magnetisation transfer saturation (MTsat), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*)], presented in three columns, are sensitive to the tissue microstructure such as macromolecular and iron content. The signs of heterolytic damage in deep white matter (white arrows) and on the brain surface (yellow arrows) are visible in MTsat and R1 maps. The heterolytic lesions were most prominent in the cases with a higher intraparenchymal bacterial load (case 1 and case 2, see following sections and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), forming large liquid-filled cavities. R2* maps show a hyperintense rim near the brain surface (blue arrows), indicating iron leaked into the tissue, putatively due to meningeal haemorrhage and superficial cortical siderosis, confirmed by Perls’s stain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></caption>

<p>In three cases (cases 1, 3 and 4), ultra-high resolution R2* maps showed a hyperintense double-banded rim in the cortex running parallel to the brain surface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), found to be most severe in case 3, with less intensity in cases 1 and 4. The enhanced values of iron-sensitive qMRI parameter R2* suggest elevated iron in the double-banded structure as a potential contrast source. The histological Perls’s stain for iron confirmed this suggestion, showing a double band of elevated iron content corresponding in shape and location to the hyperintensity in R2* images (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The iron appears finely dispersed and is not associated with specific histological structures or cell types. The bands were not visible in the unstained sections and affected only the outer parts of the brains. Their spatial distribution rather resembled the front of iron-rich compounds penetrating into the tissue from the outer surface. These abnormal iron levels and atypical distributions on the brain surface may point to superficial bleedings releasing labile iron, which then penetrated into the brain. Indeed, similar double-banded structures in the R2* maps are commonly interpreted as a sign of meningeal bleeding inducing cortical siderosis in in vivo MRI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>

The pigmented granules are already visible in the unstained sections. The presence of the granules points to <italic>Bcbva</italic>-induced meningeal haemorrhages consistent with the gross pathology and analogous to <italic>B. anthracis</italic>’ haemorrhagic meningitis in humans. Similar findings were reported in human cases with cerebral amyloid angiopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.

<title><italic>Bcbva</italic> penetrates into the brain parenchyma</title>
<p><italic>Bcbva</italic> was effectively visualised and studied in brain tissue sections using the standard Nissl stain (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). For validation, we compared consecutive sections from the severely affected case 1, dyed using (i) Nissl stain (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig 2a</xref>), (ii) haematoxylin and eosin (H/E) stain (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>), a commonly used technique in histopathology, and (iii) immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2c</xref>) employing a rabbit anti-Bacillus anthracis protein (whole cell protein) antibody. The bacteria were clearly visible with all three methods, as approximately 6 µm long and 1 µm thick elongated chains that were primarily straight and occasionally twisted. The Nissl stain exhibited superior contrast compared to H/E, showed high correspondence to immunohistochemistry and was therefore used for the investigation of all remaining cases. Nissl staining has the additional advantage of providing detailed information on cortical cytoarchitecture and separation between white and grey matter.</p>
<p>In all examined brain sections from the four cases, <italic>Bcbva</italic> bacteria were observed in both intra- and extravascular spaces. The bacterial load varied significantly between cases and brain regions (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The qualitative estimates of bacterial load performed between cases and areas showed high correspondence to the quantitative estimates of bacterial density in occipital cortex by AI data analysis (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), demonstrating the validity of the qualitative analysis. Among the cases one brain exhibited a severe (case 1) bacterial load, one brain showed a moderate level (case 2) and two brains displayed a mild overall bacterial load (case 3 and case 4).</p>

These insights were only facilitated by a multidisciplinary and multimodal approach and the unique and ethically sustainable sampling of high quality brain specimens under challenging field conditions in the Taï NP, requiring continuous behavioural observation of habituated chimpanzee groups and the presence of on-site veterinarians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We observed direct and indirect evidence for meningitis, analogous to <italic>B. anthracis</italic>-induced anthrax in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that <italic>Bcbva</italic> penetrated the brain parenchyma shortly before death, resulting in the degradation of brain tissue and digestion of neuronal extracellular matrix (ECM) in all four cases. This is in contrast to <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, which, despite causing severe meningitis, rarely invades the deeper brain tissue of either humans and NHP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Thus, based on our results, we can conclude that <italic>Bcbva</italic> may be more neuroinvasive in terms of parenchymal invasion, compared to its more extensively studied cousin.</p>
<p>Genetical analysis for two out of four studied cases did not reveal any virulence-altering mutations, indicating that their ability to cause CNS disease is representative for <italic>Bcbva</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Blood-brain-barrier breaches resulting in meningeal and parenchymal bacterial spread</title>
<p>We showed that <italic>Bcbva</italic> is able to breach the blood-barriers, which normally hinder dissemination of bacteria into CNS compartments. These entail the blood-brain barrier formed by the neurovascular unit (NVU), preventing pathogen dissemination into the brain tissue at the parenchymal vessel interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers at the meningeal vessels (arachnoid barrier) as well as at the choroid plexus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that classical <italic>B. anthracis</italic> successfully penetrates the blood-cerebrospinal-fluid barrier and thrives within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as evidenced by the presence of abundant bacilli distending the subarachnoid space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Similarly, our observations indicated the presence of <italic>Bcbva</italic>-induced meningitis in all four investigated cases. In case 1, direct histological examination revealed the presence of bacilli and leukocytes within pia mater residues (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a, b, c</xref>). This microscopic evidence was supported by macroscopic observations of congested pial vessels and meningeal haemorrhages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Additionally, cortical siderosis, detected using qMRI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), suggested the occurrence of meningeal haemorrhage (Charidimou et al. 2020; Shams et al. 2016; van Veluw et al. 2020). We note that direct investigation of pia mater was only possible on fragments of pia mater, since it was removed before MRI scans for other projects.</p>
<p>Analogous to <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, <italic>Bcbva</italic> likely overcomes the cerebrospinal fluid barrier with the help of anthrax toxin mediated vascular damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, as well as the proteolytic activity of InhA1, cleaving zonula occludens-1 proteins and thus degrading tight junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Additionally, the virulence factor AtxA has been shown to play a crucial role in CNS invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite massive meningeal involvement, <italic>B. anthracis</italic> bacilli are rarely visualised within the adjacent brain parenchyma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and if so, they are predominantly found in perivascular spaces rather than in the neuropil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Consequently, some authors concluded that <italic>B. anthracis</italic> causes meningitis rather than encephalitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, which is similar to other extracellular neuroinvasive bacteria like <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In contrast, <italic>Bcbva</italic> was observed within the brain parenchyma in all four cases (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), indicating a greater ability to transgress the glia limitans, which is formed by astrocyte endfeet plus their associated basal lamina and constitutes as a secondary barrier to bacterial invasion of the neuropil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. The factors that enable <italic>Bcbva</italic> to invade the brain parenchyma so effectively require further investigation. One potential contributing trait is <italic>Bcbva’</italic>s flagellar motility, as opposed to the non-motile <italic>B. anthracis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The observation of highest bacterial density in layer 1 of the cerebral cortex suggests parenchymal infiltration predominantly from the subarachnoid space. But additional invasion via parenchymal vessels was detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h, i</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Extracellular matrix degradation</title>
<p>Upon invasion, <italic>Bcbva</italic> extensively degrades CNS-tissue as evidenced macroscopically by the lytic cavities visible in quantitative MRI maps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and confirmed by histology, as well as on a finer structural level by the digestion of perineuronal nets (PNNs) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). PNNs form a mesh-like structure around neurons composed of ECM components like hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and link proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and are likely cleaved by <italic>Bcbva’s</italic> protease secretion. The secretome of <italic>Bcbva</italic> and <italic>B. anthracis</italic> were shown to be largely congruent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, and for the latter a major portion of secreted proteins are proteases, foremost the two-neutral zinc metalloproteases InhA and Npr599<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. InhA exhibits a low substrate specificity, cleaving a variety of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and acts as multifactorial pathogenic factor aiding with tissue degradation, breaking barriers and interfering with immune functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Propagation in Tissue</title>
<p>This degradation of the extracellular matrix plausibly shapes <italic>Bcbva’s</italic> within tissue spread, resulting in parallel, periaxonal bacilli propagation patterns within the white matter, and a more dispersed growth pattern in the cerebral cortex (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Additionally to intraparenchymal multiplication in straight chains, also twisted cell morphologies have been observed. This growth form has been described in-vitro on culture media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> and its occurrence in vivo may help in etiological diagnostic assessment.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Timeline of Invasion</title>
<p>The absence of an obvious structural gliosis is remarkable and provides valuable insights into the timeline of bacterial brain invasion. Normally, when the CNS is subjected to an inflammatory stimulus, both astrocytes and microglia are activated, characterised by cellular restructuring. Astrocytes become hypertrophic and their processes extend, while microglia undergo a transition from a resting (ramified) morphology to an amoeboid one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. The observed multifocal cortical and perivascular increase in GFAP levels suggests an early stage astrocyte activation, since GFAP gene expression can increase as early as 1 hour after an inflammatory stimulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. However, cellular restructuring takes longer to manifest. In a mouse model of traumatic brain injury, for example, hypertrophic astrocytes were only visible 3 days after the initial inflammatory insult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The same applies to microglia responses which usually require hours to days to fully develop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Therefore, the lack of structural gliosis argues for a rapid death of the chimpanzees following CNS invasion, likely within less than 48 hours.</p>
<p>This timeline is supported by little intraparenchymal leukocyte recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>, although in the residual of the meninges and the vessels leucocytes were visualised (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 a,b,i</xref>). Combined with the observation of greater intravasal than extravasal bacterial load (except for case 1), this suggests initial bloodborne subarachnoid pathogen spread with secondary parenchymal propagation across the glia limitans. <italic>Bcbva</italic> multiplies rapidly, comparable to <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, which features doubling times of 30-60 minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>, reached at a late infection stage once the host immune system has been overwhelmed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. This explains the excessive pathogen load (above all in case 1) despite a per-acute course of disease.</p>
<p>The variation in bacterial density observed in different cases might be attributed to various factors. These include differences in the individual host’s immune status and susceptibility to <italic>Bcbva</italic>, as well as the initial infection dose and/or the extent of bacterial propagation after death and before fixation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f">
<title>Clinical symptoms</title>
<p>The observed sudden chimpanzee deaths are comparable to human <italic>B. anthracis</italic> cases with CNS involvement, in which 75% of the patients die within 24 hours after initial presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. It is challenging to determine the exact onset of clinical signs from behavioural observations in chimpanzees as wild animals typically conceal weakness as long as possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. Although not observed for the presented cases, other <italic>Bcbva</italic>-infected chimpanzees have been reported dying in a ventral position holding their heads, suggesting severe headache (unpublished observations from TCP health monitoring programme by FL). This is consistent with <italic>B. anthracis</italic> involving the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Behavioural observations prior to death were available in two investigated cases (2 and 4), with absence of clinical signs in the young individual (2) 1.5 hours prior to its sudden death and progressively altered behaviour for case 4 with sleepiness, isolation from the group and increased resting periods in the preceding two days. These clinical signs might be partially accounted for by involvement of the CNS but are by no means specific.</p>

<title>Implications for human spillover and treatment</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that a human <italic>Bcbva</italic> infection would likely lead to meningitis and encephalitis after bacteremic spread with a very poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the precise rate at which infections progress to a systemic and septicemic state remains uncertain. One study revealed a 10 % seropositivity for <italic>Bcbva</italic> antibodies among people residing near Taï NP, suggesting frequent non-lethal infections. In contrast, a separate study conducted on wildlife found limited seropositivity, implying a high lethality associated with <italic>Bcbva</italic> infections given its significance as a driver of wildlife mortality. A human <italic>Bcbva</italic> case involving the CNS would entail management analogous to a <italic>B. anthracis</italic> meningitis case including intravenous fluoroquinolone administration and one or more agents with good CNS penetration (e.g. rifampicin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. As opposed to <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, penicillin is not advised as central African <italic>Bcbva</italic> isolates may be resistant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Early initiation of treatment is critical as produced toxins sustain detrimental effects even after bacteria have been cleared, especially since antibody-based therapeutics (e.g. raxibacumab) cannot neutralise already internalised toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Etiologic disease diagnosis and especially early diagnosis are challenging in rural African regions, since general health care infrastructure is usually poor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Therefore, especially in regions with bushmeat consumption, local public health sensitisation and diagnostic training pose the first critical steps towards the mitigation of potential human zoonotic <italic>Bcbva</italic> mortality. Further it highlights the importance of effective disease surveillance in wildlife to detect heightened risk of spillover early-on in the context of a One Health approach.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One of the study’s major strengths, the opportunistic, ethical sampling approach, intrinsically comes with limitations such as the lack of standardised infection doses and <italic>postmortem</italic> intervals. <italic>Bcbva</italic> is facultatively anaerobic and may multiply even after animal death. This might have influenced the bacterial density and tissue integrity. Still, the core statement regarding pronounced <italic>Bcbva</italic> neuroinvasiveness remains unaffected. Indeed, the initialised inflammatory GFAP response indicated <italic>premortem</italic> penetration into the parenchyma. The absence of secondary, opportunistic bacteria in all cases showed that <italic>postmortem</italic> time before fixation was not sufficient for massive <italic>postmortem</italic> bacterial invasion. The fact that the blood-brain barrier remains intact for a certain period even after death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> makes <italic>postmortem</italic> bacterial propagation and growth in brain tissue unlikely. Another limitation is the lack of meningeal tissue, resulting in a lack of detailed histological assessment of meningeal involvement. Therefore we relied on gross pathology and indirect signs of siderosis to infer the presence of meningitis. Further studies, including histological analysis of the larger meninges samples, are needed to confirm our findings.</p>

<p>Quantitative maps of MRI parameters were obtained using a multi-parametric mapping method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. A multi-echo 3D gradient echo sequence with an isotropic resolution of 300 μm (matrix: 432 x 378 x 288; readout bandwidth of 331 Hz/pixel; repetition time TR = 70 ms; 12 equidistant echoes with echo time TE1-12=3.63ms-41.7 ms with a bipolar gradient readout, △TE = 3.56 ms) was acquired using three different sets of parameters for proton-density-weighted (PD<sub>W</sub>), magnetisation-transfer-weighted (MT<sub>W</sub>) and longitudinal relaxation time-weighted (T1<sub>W</sub>) images. PDW- and MTW-images were acquired using excitation flip angles (FA) of 18°, the T1<sub>W</sub> image was acquired with FA=84°. Gaussian MT saturation pulse was applied at 3 kHz offset-off resonance frequency and FA=700°. Radio frequency (RF) excitation transmit (B1<sup>+</sup>) field maps were acquired using a simultaneous spin and simulated echo measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> with an isotropic resolution of 4 mm, with parallel imaging acceleration factor 2 in both phase encoding directions. Maps of the static magnetic field (B<sub>0</sub>) were acquired with the isotropic resolution of 2 mm and following acquisition parameters: TR = 1020 ms, TE = 10 and 11.02 ms, FA = 20°. To correct RF receive bias (B1<sup>-</sup>) field low resolution (2.1 mm) T1<sub>W</sub> images were acquired with the 32-channel receive coil vs the image acquired with the RF transmit element used also for receive.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Gräßle et al. provide a series of four post-mortem cases of chimpanzees with PCR-proven Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis (Bcbva), who reportedly died of this infection. One control case is also provided. Compelling post-mortem Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the highest technical standards are presented. Last, the authors provide some histopathology of the brains aiming at showing the neuroinfective potential of Bcbva.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The merits of this study are highly acknowledged. This reviewer deems it very important to implement the latest methodology in such veterinary observational studies, in order to investigate what is going on in wildlife regarding zoonoses. The scans of five whole post-mortem chimpanzee brains with exquisite MRI technology (extremely good scan quality) represent such an implementation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions from the necropsies are, unfortunately, on weak grounds:</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that all 4 infected individuals have suffered from meningitis. However, I do not see evidence for that, neither in the gross macroscopical images provided in Figure 1. The authors claim congestion of superficial veins, at least in cases 1-3, and interpret this as pointing towards meningitis. I do not see major superficial vein congestion in any of the cases. Furthermore, vessel congestion here would rather indicate brain swelling and subsequent inhibition of venous blood outflow from the skull, which would relate to brain edema. Bacterial meningitis would itself display as clouding of the meninges, while the meninges presented in all 4 cases are perfectly translucent and gracile.</p>
<p>(2) The authors show a bacterial overgrowth, of brains, which was most severe in cases 1 and 2, less so in case 3, and least in case 4 (Table 1). This correlates very well with post-mortem intervals (Supplementary Table 1). The amount of bacteria is remarkable, while there is practically no brain inflammation, only moderate microglia activation. Also, the authors do not convincingly prove the proposed meningitis at the histological level, since Figure 6 does not show it in a convincing manner. Also, moderate superficial gliosis shown in Figure 6 g+h is for me not evidence of meningitis. I would expect masses of granulocytes and lymphocytes, given the amount of bacteria shown.</p>
<p>(3) The pattern of bacterial invasion, i.e. first confined to vessels as in case 4 with short post-mortem interval, and then overgrowing the brain with practically no glial or inflammatory reaction, is very typical of post-mortem putrefication. It is conceivable that the chimpanzees had severe bacteremia, which, after death, quickly led to bacterial invasion into the brain parenchyma. While authors state the post-mortem intervals in hours, they do not state whether bodies were immediately cooled after death.</p>
<p>(4) I find it difficult to see evidence of superficial siderosis in any of the images. In particular, case 2 in Figure 1 does not convincingly display leptomeningeal hemorrhage. Dark granules, e.g. shown in Figure 4 e, are very typical of so-called formalin pigment. If that would be hemosiderin or some other form of iron, it would be expected that it displays much stronger in the DAB-enhanced perls stain (Figure 4 c).</p>

<p>In &quot;Neuroinfectiology of an atypical anthrax-causing pathogen in wild chimpanzees&quot; Tobias et.al. provide a detailed histologic characterization of B.cereus biovar anthracis in the brain of four wild chimpanzees in comparison to an uninfected age-matched chimp. The authors present a combination of special stains, radiography (MRI), bacterial culture, and immunohistochemistry including some quantitative image analysis to support the assessment of the neuropathogenicity of Bcbva. However, the study has major limitations that detract from the conclusions presented regarding the neurovirulence of this strain. Namely, there is a near complete lack of traditional histopathological and radiographic interpretation by qualified experts in which to frame the detailed tissue studies. The authors mention that facultative anaerobes are capable of post-mortem replication. Pathologists use comprehensive pathological assessments to determine the extent of disease caused by the primary infection, none of which is mentioned in this study (spleen, heart, lungs), which makes it difficult to determine if the findings in the brain align with the rest of the post-mortem assessment. If these were not included due to severe post-mortem autolysis, it heightens the risk of post-mortem bacterial replication in the CNS. The most important limitation is the fact that the meninges were removed and were not available for assessment therefore any comparisons with existing data on neuropathogenicity of B. anthracis is not possible. An advantage of the study is the inclusion of the control age-matched chimp, but the controls are not shown for many of the IHC and special stains - limiting interpretations. In general, the article is difficult to follow with the figures since many panels are only discussed and interpreted in the figure legends and not the text. In some cases, the results are overly technical with limited clinical insight which makes the article less easy to interpret next to human clinical reports.</p>

<p>We are thankful to the expert reviewers and the editorial team for their assessment of our manuscript and valuable comments, which will help us to improve our manuscript. While Reviewer #1 appreciated the comprehensive assessment using advanced methods, Reviewer #2 asked for an extension of traditional neuropathological and neuroradiological assessments. Both reviewers identified limitations of the study like the inability to provide direct histopathological evidence for meningitis due to missing meninges tissue, resulting in the conclusions being based on indirect evidence. The reviewers raised concerns about potential post mortem penetration of bacteria into the brain parenchyma. Reviewer #1 also questioned the evidence for cortical siderosis based on the intensity of histological stains.</p>
<p>We agree with both reviewers and the editorial comment that a traditional neuropathological assessment of meningeal status would have strongly boosted the study's conclusions. Please note that the opportunistic sampling approach after a wild animal’s “natural” death, which is the only ethical method to study infection biology in great apes, is intrinsically accompanied by some limitations such as the lack of standardized post mortem intervals or incomplete sampling. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will complement the advanced MRI and histology already presented by extended traditional neuroradiological and neuropathological assessments as recommended by Reviewer #2, including a report on the status of other organs. However, it is important to note that the interpretation of post mortem MRI of brain material collected in the field differs substantially from conventional in vivo MRI and requires tailored analysis and interpretation. Below we comment on three aspects addressed by reviewers:</p>
<p>* Missing meninges *: The meninges and associated vessels had to be removed to reduce blood-related artifacts in previously performed MRI measurements. We are aware that this poses a major limitation of this study, and thus rely on the evidence derived from the material at hand. Neuropathological assessment is in agreement with the reviewer's comments that no overt acute bacterial meningitis with e.g. turbid appearance, purulent exudates or frank hemorrhages is apparent in the macroscopic inspection of the presented material. However, the macroscopic changes should be evaluated in the light of the brief time interval between bacterial colonization and death. Meningeal bacterial invasion was visualized on a few meningeal residues we found in case 1, proofing the invasion of the subarachnoid space. Based on the reviewer's suggestions, the microscopic neuropathological evaluation will be expanded with the aim to identify further regions with meningeal residues to include more regions to 1) reduce potential sampling bias and 2) to better characterize the leptomeningeal infiltrates focusing on early inflammatory markers.</p>
<p>
However, an extensive assessment of the histopathological inflammatory status must be clarified in future studies on specimens with remaining meninges.</p>
<p>*Putrefaction/Post mortem bacterial proliferation*:</p>
<p>
Reviewers raised important points by remarking  that the tissue alterations could be due to putrefaction/post mortem effects. Classical bacterial putrefaction is unlikely, since no mixed flora of opportunistic bacteria was detected, suggesting that time before fixation was sufficient to prevent secondary bacterial invasion in the presented specimens. Moreover, it has been shown that for the post mortem interval of &lt;24 hours bacterial invasion of the brain is rare even at higher temperatures (Ith et al 2011, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.1623">https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.1623</ext-link>). The possibility of post mortem tissue propagation of Bcbva must be considered, since there is a lack of experimental data on the pathogen’s growth after host death, which has been discussed by us in the &quot;Limitations&quot; section in the original manuscript. Although it seems plausible that post mortem multiplication in the brain does occur to a certain extent, several observations suggest that this is not the only mechanism at play in the presented cases. We observed early  microglial activation and astrogliosis indicating a beginning inflammatory reaction in the brain parenchyma. Taken together, the data presented suggest a short time interval between bacterial colonization and death. Under this premise, further analyses for the revision of the manuscript will more closely investigate pathological in vivo tissue alterations.</p>
<p>*Siderosis* Signs of cortical siderosis were evident in the MRI images of all adult cases (1, 3, and 4), appearing as a hyperintense rim in quantitative R2* maps, indicating substantially elevated levels of iron on the brain surface. These findings were confirmed by Perls’s stain for iron. Such rims in R2* are a typical sign of cortical iron deposition due to siderosis, as observed in conditions like angiopathies. Meningeal bleedings are the most probable source of the elevated iron levels in the cortex. Importantly, such signs were never observed in the post mortem brains of chimpanzees not infected with Anthrax (about 30 cases analyzed so far). Reviewer #1 noted that the intensity of the Perls’s stain seemed too low for siderosis. However, this intensity can vary depending on staining procedure and may be lower for the acute and short disease course of Bcbva-induced Anthrax compared to the chronic human cases Reviewer #1 may be referring to. Taken together, we believe that the evidence of cortical siderosis is compelling, speaking in favor of pre mortem meningeal hemorrhage.</p>
<p>In summary, in the revised version of the manuscript, we plan to: (1) add a traditional neuroradiological assessment of all scans; (2) present an extended traditional neuropathological assessment of all cases; (3) report results on the status of early inflammatory markers; and (4) discuss the limitations of the study in more detail.</p>
