<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Radical cure of <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> malaria must include elimination of quiescent ‘hypnozoite’ forms in the liver; however, the only FDA-approved treatments are contraindicated in many vulnerable populations. To identify new drugs and drug targets for hypnozoites, we screened the Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) library and a collection of epigenetic inhibitors against <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages. From both libraries, we identified inhibitors targeting epigenetics pathways as selectively active against <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> hypnozoites. These include DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors as well as several inhibitors targeting histone post-translational modifications. Immunofluorescence staining of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver forms showed strong nuclear 5-methylcystosine signal, indicating liver stage parasite DNA is methylated. Using bisulfite sequencing, we mapped genomic DNA methylation in sporozoites, revealing DNA methylation signals in most coding genes. We also demonstrated that methylation level in proximal promoter regions as well as in the first exon of the genes may affect, at least partially, gene expression in <italic>P. vivax</italic>. The importance of selective inhibitors targeting epigenetic features on hypnozoites was validated using MMV019721, an acetyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor that affects histone acetylation and was previously reported as active against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stages. In summary, our data indicate that several epigenetic mechanisms are likely modulating hypnozoite formation or persistence and provide an avenue for the discovery and development of improved radical cure antimalarials.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Of the six species of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> that cause malaria in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> is the most globally widespread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Vivax malaria now accounts for the most malaria episodes in countries with successful falciparum malaria control programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Controlling vivax malaria is complicated by the ability of <italic>P. vivax</italic> sporozoites, the infectious stage inoculated by mosquitoes, to invade hepatocytes and become quiescent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. These quiescent ‘hypnozoites’ persist, undetectable, for months or even years before resuming growth and initiating a ‘relapse’ blood stage infection, leading to subsequent transmission back to mosquitoes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. New evidence suggests this transmission is expedited and silent as <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver merozoites can immediately form gametocytes instead of first having to establish an asexual stage blood infection, such as is the case for <italic>P. falciparum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Clinically, a compound with radical cure efficacy is one that removes all parasites from the patient, including hypnozoites in the liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Hypnozoites are refractory to all antimalarials except the 8-aminoquinolines, which were first identified over 70 years ago using low-throughput screening in avian malaria models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Primaquine was the first 8-aminoquinoline widely-used for radical cure, however, efficacy is contingent on a large total dose administered in a 7-14 regimen, leading to adherence problems and infrequent use in malaria control programs of endemic countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Tafenoquine-chloroquine was developed from primaquine as an improved single-dose for radical cure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, but a recent clinical trial shows tafenoquine lacks efficacy when co-administered with the common antimalarial dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, calling into question tafenoquine’s suitability in areas of high chloroquine resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, 8-aminoquinolines cannot be administered to pregnant women or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient individuals and are ineffective in persons with specific cytochrome P450 genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. For these reasons, the discovery and development of new chemical classes with radical cure activity are needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Modern drug discovery typically relies on phenotypic screening and protein target identification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. For malaria, this approach ensures hits are acting on parasite targets and enables rational drug design, leading to several promising novel classes of antimalarials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, due to lower cost and higher feasibility, current high throughput screening for new antimalarials focuses almost entirely on blood or liver schizonts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. High throughput antimalarial screening with a target chemo-profile for killing hypnozoites has only recently been made possible with the introduction of cell-based phenotypic screening platforms featuring a monolayer of hepatocytes infected with sporozoites, a portion of which go on to form hypnozoites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. While the first hypnozonticidal hits from these platforms are just now being reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, protein target identification approaches for hypnozonticidal drug discovery are in their infancy as the transcriptome of hypnozoites has only recently been reported and robust methods for genetic manipulation of <italic>P. vivax</italic> are still underdeveloped<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To address the lack of radical cure drug leads and targets, we used our advanced <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stage platform to first screen the Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This library consists of approximately 12,000 developmental, approved, and discontinued drugs with the expectation that the repurposing of compounds with some optimization or regulatory success could expedite the decade-long path drugs typically progress through from discovery to licensure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. To accomplish this screen, we assembled an international collaboration with laboratories in malaria-endemic countries whereby vivax-malaria patient blood was collected and fed to mosquitoes to produce sporozoites for infecting primary human hepatocytes (PHH) in screening assays performed on-site. Interestingly, two structurally related compounds used for treating hypertension, hydralazine and cadralazine, were found effective at killing hypnozoites. Because these inhibitors have been shown to modulate DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we pursued and confirmed the existence of methyl-cytosine modifications in <italic>P. vivax</italic> sporozoite and liver stages. Having found in the ReFRAME screen a class of hits targeting an epigenetic pathway, we decided to confirm the importance of epigenetics in <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites and screened an additional commercial epigenetic inhibitor library using an improved version of our screening platform. Hypnozoites were found to be susceptible to several classes of epigenetic inhibitors, including six distinct histone deacetylase inhibitors and two inhibitors targeting histone methylation. To further assess the importance of histone acetylation in <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages, we tested inhibitors previously reported to be directly acting on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> acetyl-CoA synthetase, thereby modulating the pool of acetyl-CoA available for histone acetylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We found MMV019721 selectively kills <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> hypnozoites, implicating acetyl-CoA synthetase is an additional hypnozonticidal drug target. This work demonstrates that in lieu of traditional molecular biology methods, our screening platforms identify multiple, druggable epigenetic pathways in hypnozoites and adds to the growing body of evidence that epigenetic features underpin biology in <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> sporozoite and liver stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Chemical biology approaches have shown that hypnozoites become insensitive to most legacy antimalarials after 5 days in culture, indicating they must mature following hepatocyte infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Hypnozoite maturation was also noted in recent single-cell transcriptomic analyses of <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages, which demonstrate distinct population clusters of maturing and quiescent hypnozoites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Importantly, discovery and development of hit compounds with radical cure activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, which includes elimination of hypnozoites in the liver of malaria patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, requires screening against mature hypnozoites <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. While our 8-day <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stage platform, in which sporozoites are infected into primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and then allowed to mature for 5 days before being treated with test compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, has been used for screening small libraries against mature hypnozoites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, the size of the ReFRAME library (12,823 compounds tested at 10 μM) presented a logistical challenge. We anticipated that dozens of <italic>P. vivax</italic> cases, each with a unique genetic background, would be needed to produce the sporozoites required to screen the 40 microtiter plates containing the library. To preclude the complex process of regular international shipments of infected mosquitoes, the <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stage platform was successfully adapted and set up in research labs in two distinct malaria endemic areas, the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU) in Thailand and the Institute Pasteur of Cambodia (IPC). The screening library was also divided between both sites to enable concurrent progress; ultimately 36 <italic>P. vivax</italic> cases from either site were needed to complete the primary screen over the course of 18 months (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Some hits exhibited moderate selectivity and potency, with pEC<sub>50</sub>’s ranging from 5.42-7.07 (pEC<sub>50</sub> is the inverse log of potency in M concentration, e.g. pEC<sub>50</sub> 3 = 1 mM, pEC<sub>50</sub> 6 = 1 μM, and pEC<sub>50</sub> 9 = 1 nM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). Colforsin daropate, rhodamine 123, and poziotinib are used to treat cancer and have known human targets, indicating that the targeted host pathways may be critical for hypnozoite persistence. As an example, poziotinib inhibits HER2, a tyrosine protein kinase associated with the downregulation of apoptosis and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We recently reported that host apoptotic pathways are downregulated in <italic>P. vivax-</italic>infected hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Poziotinib could therefore act by upregulating apoptotic pathways in infected host cells. MS-0735, an analog of our previously reported hypnozonticidal hit, MMV018983<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, is a ribonucleotide-reductase (RNR) inhibitor and used as an antiviral. The apparent need for nonreplicating hypnozoites to produce deoxyribonucleosides for DNA synthesis is peculiar. However, it has been reported that RNR is also critical for DNA damage repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, is important for maintaining cancel cell dormancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, and is expressed in <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver schizonts and hypnozoites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We also rediscovered previously-reported hypnozonticidal compounds included in the library, including the ionophore narasin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and the 8-aminoquinoline plasmocid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>From our analysis of primary screen activity, we noted several hydrazinophthalazine vasodilators were potentially active (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). We selected 72 compounds for confirmation of activity against hypnozoites in a dose-response format, including 10 hydrazinophthalazine analogs. These compounds were counter-screened for additional antimalarial activity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stages and <italic>P. berghei</italic> liver schizonts. They were also tested for cytotoxicity against HEK293T and HepG2 human cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref>). We confirmed that three hydrazinophthalazines analogs--cadralazine, pildralazine, and hydralazine--were active against mature hypnozoites, with cadralazine displaying the best combination of potency (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 6.33 ± 0.33), maximal inhibition near 100%, and selectivity over PHH (&gt; 21 fold), HEK293T (&gt; 85 fold), and HepG2 (&gt; 79 fold) cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1, B-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref>). Hydralazine, which was FDA-approved in 1953, is currently one of the world’s most-prescribed antihypertensives, and on the WHO list of essential medicines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Cadralazine, which was developed in the 1980’s as an improvement over hydralazine, was abandoned due to side effects and only licensed in Italy and Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Hydrazinophthalazines have been shown to inhibit human DNA methyltransferases (DNMT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and hydralazine has also been recently used to study potential DNA methylation patterns in the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual blood stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Similar to our previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, these hydrazinophthalazines were inactive when tested against <italic>P. berghei</italic> liver schizonts and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual blood stages, suggesting that hypnozoite quiescence may be biologically distinct from developing schizonts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. While hydrazinophthalazines may act on infected hepatocytes and not directly on the parasite, their distinct selectivity suggests that their effect is likely on a host or parasite pathways and not simply due to cytotoxicity in the host cell. Hydralazine and cadralazine were not identified as potential hits in any of the 112 bioassay screens of the ReFRAME published to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, suggesting these compounds specifically target <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages and not promiscuously active compounds.</p>
<p>Methods for the robust culture of <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites were only recently reported, leading to several new reports on hypnozoite biology and radical cure drug discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Consequentially, some hypnozoite-specific discoveries appear to be platform-specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Select hits were shared with the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), where the activity and potency of cadralazine (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 6.09 ± 0.45), hydralazine (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 6.20), and poziotinib (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 6.17) were independently confirmed in a similar 8-day <italic>P. vivax</italic> screening platform using a <italic>P. vivax</italic> case from southern Thailand. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3A</xref>). Independent confirmation of these hits indicates their activities are not merely platform-specific and are, rather, more broadly descriptive of hypnozoite chemo-sensitivity.</p>
<p>Following our screening and hit confirmation, we investigated the potency, <italic>in vivo</italic> stability, and tolerability profile of our confirmed hits and chose cadralazine and hydralazine for repurposing as radical cure antimalarials. Currently, the gold-standard model for preclinical assessment of <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-relapse efficacy is rhesus macaques infected with <italic>Plasmodium cynomolgi</italic>, a zoonotic, relapsing species closely related to <italic>P. vivax</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Because we found cadralazine substantially more potent against hypnozoites than hydralazine, it was selected for a rhesus macaque pharmacokinetic study in which plasma levels were measured over 24 h following an oral dose of 1 mg/kg, which was calculated to be well-tolerated, and 30 mg/kg, which was calculated to likely cause drug-induced hypotension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The 30 mg/kg dose resulted in maximum plasma concentration of 13.7 μg/mL (or 48.2 μM) and half-life of 2.19 ± 0.24 h, which was sufficient to cover the <italic>in vitro</italic> EC<sub>90</sub> for several hours without noticeable side effects. (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). As another prerequisite for <italic>in vivo</italic> validation, we next sought to confirm and measure the potency of cadralazine and other ReFRAME hits against <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> B strain hypnozoites <italic>in vitro</italic> using an 8-day assay featuring primary simian hepatocytes (PSH) at NITD. While poziotinib was active against <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> hypnozoites when tested two of three different PSH donor lots (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 5.67 and 5.95), hydralazine and cadralazine were found inactive when tested in all three different PSH donor lots (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3B</xref>). This negative result was later confirmed in an 8-day, simianized version of the platform at the University of Georgia (UGA) using the <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> Rossan strain infected into two different PSH lots (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Altogether these data highlight potential difference between <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> and challenge the gold-standard model for preclinical assessment of <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-relapse efficacy is rhesus macaques.</p>

<title>Synergy between cadralazine and 5-azacytidine</title>
<p>As molecular tools to validate drug target in <italic>P. vivax</italic> are limited, we further confirmed the possible mechanism of action of hydrazinophthalazines using drug combination studies to assess synergy, additivity or antagonsim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We used 5-azacytidine, a known DNA methyltransferase inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, to investigate its effects on cadralazine treatment. When tested alone in dose-response from 50 μM, 5-azacytidine had no effect on hypnozoites. However, when added to cadralazine in fixed ratio combinations ranging from 8:1 to 1:8, 5-azacytdine increased the potency of cadralazine by ∼2 fold across several combinations in two independent experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>). The most potent effect was detected using a 2:1 fixed ratio of cadralazine:5-azacytidine, resulting to an equivalent EC<sub>50</sub> decrease from 470 nM to 216 nM.</p>

<p>To further confirmed that cadralazine interacts with <italic>P. vivax</italic> target(s), we aimed to detect and quantify DNA methylation in the <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> genomes. Previous studies had identified the presence of low level 5-methylcytosine (5mC), 5-hydroxmethylcystosine (5hmC), and 5hmC-like marks throughout the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>.

We found clear evidence of 5mC, but not 5hmC, in both schizonts and hypnozoites, morphologically consistent with the presence of 5mC in the parasite’s nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>-<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). To segregate signals coming from the host hepatic nuclei, we used automated high content imaging analysis on hundreds of individual <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stage parasites as an unbiased approach for quantifying 5mC signal within parasites. Image masks were generated to quantify the area of 5mC or 5hmC stain within each parasite (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>). The values were then plotted as stain area per hypnozoite or per schizont (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). While some evidence of 5hmC-positive forms did appear from this analysis, the net 5hmC area per parasite was found significantly lower when compared to 5mC signals (Kurskal-Wallis tests, for hypnozoites <italic>H</italic>(7) = 194.3, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.0001, for schizonts <italic>H</italic>(7) = 88.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt;.0001).

While we detected 5mC and DNMT activity in <italic>Plasmodium-</italic>enriched samples with these approaches, possible contamination by the mosquito’s microbiota could not be excluded (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15A-B</xref>). We next analyzed DNA methylation loci at single-nucleotide resolution using bisulfite sequencing of 3×10<sup>7</sup> <italic>P. vivax</italic> sporozoites, generated from three different cases, as well as 3×10<sup>7</sup> <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> sporozoites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A-B</xref>). A total of 161 and 147 million high-quality reads were sequenced for <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> samples, respectively (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11C</xref>). The average 5mC level detected across all cytosines was 0.49% and 0.39% for <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>, respectively. These percentages are comparable to the 0.58% methylation level detected in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, but likely underestimate methylated loci considering the coverage we achieved (see methods).</p>
<p>We then monitored the distribution of detected 5mC along the <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> chromosomes (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figs. S12</xref>-<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>) and observed a stable methylation level throughout the genomes, including in telomeric and sub-telomeric regions. We further examined the context of genome-wide methylations and, similar to what we previously observed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, methylation was detected as asymmetrical, with CHH (where H can be any nucleotide but G) at 69.5% and 70.5%, CG at 16% and 15.7%, and CHG at 14.3% and 13.64%, for <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). We then measured the proportion of 5mC in the various compartments of gene bodies (exons, the introns, promoters, and terminators) as well as strand-specificity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D-E</xref>). We observed a slightly increased distribution of 5mC in promoters and exons compared to the intronic region, as well as in the template versus non-template strand, in <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>. These results were consistent with previous data obtained in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Such a strand specificity of DNA methylation patterns can affect the affinity of the RNA polymerase II and impact transcription, thus we compared methylation levels to previously-report transcriptomic data from <italic>P. vivax</italic> sporozoites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The 5mC levels in 5’ flanking regions, gene bodies, and 3’flanking regions were placed into five bins and compared to mRNA abundance, revealing an inverse relationship between methylation and mRNA abundance in the proximal promoter regions and the beginning of the gene bodies, with highly-expressed genes appearing hypomethylated and weakly-expressed genes hypermethylated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). These results suggest that methylation level in proximal promoter regions as well as in the first exon of the genes may affect, at least partially, gene expression in malaria parasites. While these data will need to be further validated and linked to hypnozoite formation at a single-cell level, we have determined that 5mC is present at a low level in <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> sporozoites and could control liver stage development and hypnozoite quiescence.</p>

<title>Assay improvements and epigenetic inhibitor library screen</title>
<p>The success of the original screening platform protocol and secondary confirmation of several of our initial hits provided us an invaluable opportunity to develop an improved radical cure screening assay. The current iterations of our screening platform rely on high-content analysis of parasitophorous vacuole staining of the forms that persist up to the assay endpoint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. During the course of the ReFRAME primary screen we found the day 8 endpoint was sufficient for some hit compounds to act. However, other compounds like the 8-aminoquinolines exhibit a ‘delayed death’ phenotype, which leads to a false-negative result<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. We therefore extended the assay by 4 days to allow attenuated forms to be cleared from the culture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Also, as our screening assays were performed with multiple lots of PHH and PSH, we detected some lot-specific results, including small differences in activity of poziotinib and our monensin control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>, <xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">S14A</xref>), possibly due to compound instability in the presence of hepatic metabolism. We therefore tested the metabolism inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole (1-ABT) in culture media to minimize the effect of lot-specific hepatic metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. We used a cytochrome P450 functional assay specific to CYP3A4 and determined that 100 μM of 1-ABT was sufficient to completely reduce CYP3A4 activity in both basal and rifampicin-induced PHH (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15A-B</xref>). This effect was further confirmed and quantified by mass spectrometry after 1 h of treatment at 100 μM 1-ABT. We not only detected a 75% decrease in CYP3A4 activity, but also a more than 60% reduction of CYP2B6 and CYP2E1 activity along with lesser effects on CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6 (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Fig. S15C</xref>). These changes were incorporated into our original 8-day protocol to design an improved 12-day assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> that we then validated by re-testing 12 ReFRAME hits. The modified assay did not drastically affect the potency of most hits (<xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Fig. S16A</xref>), but confirmed hypnozonticidal activity for poziotinib (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 6.05), which had only been previously confirmed in <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> assays performed at NITD only (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>, <xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">S16B</xref>). This assay was then use in all followup experiments.</p>
<p>To further confirm the importance of epigenetics in hypnozoites biology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> we obtained a commercially-available library containing 773 compounds targeting various inhibitors of epigenetic enzymes or pathways. These compounds were tested at 10 μM against <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages at both SMRU and IPC sites (<xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">Fig. S17A</xref>). We confirmed our initial hits in dose-response assays resulting in selective hypnozonticidal potency for 11 compounds targeting five different epigenetic mechanisms (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tab. 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">Fig. S17B</xref>). This includes the histone deacetylase inhibitors panobinostat (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 6.98 ± 0.18), AR42 (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 6.11 ± 0.24), abexinostat (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 5.48 ± 0.00), givinostat (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 5.35 ± 0.45), practinostat (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 5.32 ± 0.13), and raddeanin A (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 5.95 ± 0.00). Histone methyltransferase inhibitor hits included MI2 (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 5.48 ± 0.00), a compound that targets the interaction between menin (a global regulator of gene expression), and MLL (a DNA-binding protein that methylates histone H3 lysine 4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>), and cyproheptadine (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 5.24 ± 0.34), which targets the SET-domain-containing lysine methyltransferase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. These results corroborate our hypothesis that epigenetic pathways regulate hypnozoites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Other hits, including 666-15 (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 5.88 ± 0.12), an inhibitor of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, and cerdulatinib (pEC<sub>50</sub> = 5.33 ± 0.20), a kinase inhibitor, suggest that signaling pathways may also be important for quiescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Having identified several histone deacetylase inhibitors as directly or indirectly active on hypnozoites, we screened compounds previously reported as inhibitors of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), with downstream effects on histone acetylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We found that one compound, MMV019721, was selectively active on mature <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tab. 1</xref>). Given the evidence MMV019721 is directly targeting <italic>P. falciparum</italic> ACS, this result suggests ACS also is a hypnozonticidal drug target. While the molecular techniques needed to confirm the direct interaction of MMV019721 and ACS in <italic>P. vivax</italic> are currently underdeveloped, our data supplement recent reports describing epigenetics as important regulators in <italic>P. vivax and P. cynomolgi</italic> at different stage of the parasite life cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein we demonstrate several significant advances that progress radical cure antimalarial drug discovery and development, including the first report of screening a medium-sized (&gt;10,000) compound library against mature hypnozoites as well as detection of novel hits with mechanisms unrelated to that of 8-aminoquinolines. Identification of these hits was made possible following the establishment of a complex logistical operation in which the sporozoites used for screening were produced by feeding <italic>P. vivax</italic>-infected blood from malaria patient isolates to mosquito colonies at malaria research institutes in two countries in Southeast Asia. Our international collaboration overcame several logistical hurdles to obtain positive Z’ scores for most screening plates. Hits were also confirmed via dose-response, indicating that expanded screening directed against <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages is likely to produce more hypnozoite-specific hits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, 5, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A-B</xref>, <xref rid="figs17" ref-type="fig">S17</xref>).</p>
<p>The only class of FDA-approved compounds for radical cure, the 8-aminoquinolines, were not discovered from <italic>in vitro</italic> drug screening. Instead, they were discovered using animal models, including the <italic>P. cynomolgi-</italic>infected rhesus macaque system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The 8-aminoquionlines function through generation of reactive oxygen species affecting both the host and parasite, and lack a distinct parasite target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. As such, this work represents one of the first applications of a radical cure development pipeline to begin with <italic>in vitro</italic> screening against <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites and end with attempted confirmation using <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> radical cure models. While our screen generated positive results against <italic>P. vivax,</italic> we found mixed results against <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> hypnozoites <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3B</xref>). While further studies will be needed to confirm that target(s) of our hits are parasite-or host-directed and may influence parasite survival, our data show there is sufficient diversity in gene expression, structural biology, or mechanisms of hepatic quiescence between <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites that some newly identified hits may be species-specific. While this result could also be attributed to differential metabolism in human and monkey hepatocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, the rhesus macaque radical cure model is currently considered as an important prerequisite for continued drug development, including efficacy testing in controlled human infections. The role of this model in the radical cure drug development cascade may need to be reevaluated as some compounds identified as promising for the radical cure of <italic>P. vivax</italic> may be abandoned too quickly due to the lack of activity against <italic>P. cynomolgi.</italic> This result highlights the need for further development and validation of <italic>P. vivax</italic>-specific animal models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. As a whole this report adds to the broader discussion surrounding the successes and challenges of drug repurposing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. While direct repositioning of a known drug as a safe treatment for a new indication is the ideal outcome, it can serve as advanced starting points for further optimization and has still the potential for reducing the time and cost involved in developing an efficacious therapy.</p>
<p>In addition to the identification of promising new hits and direction, we also confirmed that epigenetic control of pathogenic dormancy via DNA methylation is a pathway that could be potentially targeted by future antimalarials. This pathway has already been described for several disease agents capable of dormancy, including cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> and tuberculosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. DNA methylation has also been validated as controlling critical processes in plants, which share evolutionary traits with <italic>Plasmodium</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. DNA methylation in the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic> was first described in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, and has been associated with gene expression, transcriptional elongation and parasite growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Previous experiment have shown that hydralazine can directly inhibits DNA methylation in nuclear extracts of blood stage parasites but also inhibit a recombinant functional fragment of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> DNMT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. We pursued several biomolecular approaches to confirm that cadralazine may also interact with <italic>P. vivax</italic> DNMT in liver stage parasites. Due to technical limitations, we used a two-drug combination study in which the known DNMT inhibitor 5-azacytidine potentiated cadralazine against <italic>P. vivax</italic> hypnozoites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>). While we continue to develop new protocols and confirm the direct interaction of cadralazine with <italic>P. vivax</italic>, we successfully confirmed 5mC marks in <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> liver stage parasites using both immunofluorescence and whole genome bisulfite sequencing assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p>
<p>The current model of hypnozoite quiescence suggests RNA binding proteins (RBPs) drive hypnozoite formation by preventing translation of target mRNAs associated with schizogony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In this model, histone acetylation results in euchromatin at the loci of RBPs, resulting in their expression and ongoing quiescence. Hypothetically, HDAC inhibitors would favor quiescence while a treatment that decreases histone acetylation would favor schizongony. This model somewhat contrasts with our present finding that HDAC inhibitors and the ACS inhibitor MMV019721 successfully kill hypnozoites <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tab. 1</xref>). It is, however, likely that the identified RBPs are part of broader gene networks which, when perturbed by sudden modulation of epigenetic feature such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, results in a lethal level of dysregulation. While we still need to develop <italic>P. vivax</italic> transgenic lines to successful study hypnozoite biology and further validate potential drug targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, the chemical probes that we described in this report could be used in combination with single-cell technology to more precisely perturb hypnozoites and refine our understanding of epigenetic pathways regulating hypnozoite formation and survival.</p>

<title>ReFRAME library description and plating</title>
<p>The ReFRAME library was curated by assembling a list of developmental and FDA-approved chemistry from three databases (GVK Excelra GoStar, Clarivate Integrity, and Citeline Pharmaprojects). The original library consisted of 36 384-well plates (ReF01-ReF36, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) containing 11,871 test compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While the original library was being screened, an additional set of four 384-well plates (ReF38-ReF41, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) were added to the library, totaling 12,823 test compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Source plates were made from the master library at Calibr at Scripps Research such that 3-5 μL of 10 mM solution was added to each well of a sterile, conical-bottom 384-well plate (Greiner Bio-One cat 784261). Most compounds were diluted in DMSO, however, a subset was diluted in water due to limited DMSO solubility. Plates were sealed and shipped on dry ice to SMRU and IPC and stored at −20 °C prior to use. Column 24 of each plate was filled with 5 μL DMSO to serve as negative control wells. Control compounds included 1 mM monensin (positive control for hypnozoite and schizont activity), 1 mM the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase inhibitor (PI4Ki) KDU691 or MMV390048 (positive control for schizont activity), 1 mM atovaquone (negative control for radical cure activity) and 10 mM tafenoquine (clinically relevant control for hypnozoite activity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>ReFRAME primary screen against <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stages</title>
<p>The complete, step-by-step protocol for the <italic>P. vivax</italic> liver stage assay is published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. In summary, two days after assay plates (Greiner Bio-One cat 781956) were seeded with PHH, sporozoites were dissected from mosquito salivary glands and allowed to infect cultures. The ReFRAME library was screened using the original, 8-day radical cure assay, in which developing liver schizonts and mature, PI4Ki-insensitive hypnozoites were treated on days 5-7 post-infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. On treatment days, a pintool was used to transfer 40 nL of compounds from the source plates to the assay plates. A single PHH lot, UBV, was first used for screening, however, once all available cryovials were used, screening was completed with lot BGW (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Screening was initiated at SMRU until a second screening site was established at IPC, where all unfinished source plates were shipped and assayed. Some plates were assayed more than once in order to obtain a single run with a sufficient Z’ factor of &gt; 0.0 or two moderate-quality runs allowing for identification of reproducibly-active wells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>).

<p>Primary screening data were imported into Genedata Screener, Version 15.0.1-Standard and normalized to DMSO (neutral) and inhibitor (monensin) control-treated wells (neutral controls minus inhibitors). For four plates where the monensin control failed due to solubility issues combined with PHH lot variability (<xref rid="figs14" ref-type="fig">Fig. S14</xref>), data were normalized using the Robust Z-Score method, which calculates for each well the Robust Z-Score (number of standard deviations off the median) based on the statistics of the compound wells per plate. Genedata multiplicative pattern correction was applied to adjust for plate edge effects. Sixty-two most active (≥ 67% normalized inhibition of hypnozoite numbers) and non-toxic (≤ 40% host cell toxicity) compounds and 10 hydrazinophthalazines were selected for reconfirmation in an 8-point 1:3 dose response following the 8-day protocol with PHH lot BGW using a dose-response of monensin and nigericin as redundant positive controls. Once hydralazine and cadralazine were identified as reconfirmed hits, commercially available batches of powder were obtained (budralazine, Chemcruz cat sc-504334 batch D3019, cadralazine, Chemcruz cat sc-500641 batch B2417, and hydralazine, Selleckchem cat s2562 batch S256202) and used for additional reconfirmation runs using the same 8-day protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantification of 5mC, 5hmC and 2’-deoxyguanosine (dG) in genomic DNA by LC-MS/MS/MS</title>
<p>Parasite pellets were lysed with 100 µl lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.1, 20 mM EDTA, 400 mM NaCl, 1% SDS and 20 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 55 <sup>0</sup>C overnight. Saturated solution of NaCl (0.5X volume of reaction mixture) was subsequently added to the digestion mixture and incubated at 55 °C for another 15 min. The samples were centrifuged at 14500 RCF for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant removed to a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge, genomic DNA (gDNA) was then precipitated with 2X volume of 100% chilled ethanol and resuspended in 95 μL water. Samples were then treated with 3 μL of 10 mg/mL RNase A and 2 μL of 25 units/μL RNase T1 and incubated overnight at 37 °C. gDNA was then extracted by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol solution, precipitated again with 100% chilled ethanol, and washed with 70% ethanol. The gDNA pellets were then dissolved in nuclease-free water. One μg of gDNA was enzymatically digested into mononucleosides using nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase. Enzymes in the digestion mixture were removed by chloroform extraction. The resulting aqueous layer was dried by using a SpeedVac and the dried residues were subsequently reconstituted in doubly distilled water. Approximately 5 ng of the DNA digestion mixture was injected for LC-MS/MS/MS analyses for quantifications of 5mC, 5hmC and dG. An LTQ XL linear ion-trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano electrospray ionization source and coupled with an EASY-nLC II system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for the LC-MS/MS/MS experiments. The amounts of 5mC, 5hmC and dG (in moles) in the nucleoside mixtures were calculated from area ratios of peaks found in the selected-ion chromatograms for the analytes over their corresponding isotope-labeled standards, the amounts of the labeled standards added (in moles), and the calibration curves. The final levels of 5mC and 5hmC, in terms of percentages of dG, were calculated by comparing the moles of 5mC and 5hmC relative to those of dG.</p>

<title>DNA methylation analysis</title>
<p>Four sets of reads for <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic> were analyzed. Read qualities were checked with FastQC v0.11.8. FastQC indicated the presence of adapter contamination and overrepresented k-mers. As a result, (1) the first 9-14 base pairs were trimmed and (2) reads with overrepresented k-mers were discarded (see <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11C</xref> for summary statistics after the cleaning step). Reads were mapped against the corresponding reference genomes downloaded from PlasmoDB (namely, PlasmoDB-48_Pfalciparum3D7, PlasmoDB-48_PcynomolgiB and PlasmoDB-48_PvivaxP01) using Bismark v0.22.2 with default parameters. To determine the bisulfite conversion rate, reads were also mapped against the lambda phage (see <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11C</xref> for the conversion rate). Alignment files for the replicates were merged together using Samtools v1.9. Read methylation levels were obtained using Bismark v0.22.2 with default parameters (see <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11C</xref>).</p>
<p>A cytosine in the genome was considered methylated if (1) the number of reads covering that cytosine was higher than a given threshold (10 for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, 5 for <italic>P. vivax</italic> and 3 for <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>) and (2) the ratio of methylated reads over all reads covering a cytosine was higher than a given threshold (we chose 0.1 for this second threshold). Genome-wide cytosine density and methylated cytosine density in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref> were calculated in 1 kbp non-overlapping sliding windows using a custom script (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/salehsereshki/pyMalaria">https://github.com/salehsereshki/pyMalaria</ext-link>). The distribution of CG, CHG, CHH methylation in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref> were obtained by computing the number of methylated cytosines in each context over all the methylated cytosines. For the methylation analyses in genes in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, (1) 500 bp flanking regions and gene body were split into five bins, (2) methylation levels were averaged across all the genes using a custom script (available at the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/salehsereshki/pyMalaria">https://github.com/salehsereshki/pyMalaria</ext-link>).

<title>Immunofluorescent staining of 5mC and 5hmC in <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood stage parasites</title>
<p>An immunofluorescent staining approach has been used to detect both 5mC and 5hmC in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stage parasites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, thus we sought to confirm these marks in <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood stages. <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood samples were collected between 2017 and 2019 by active and passive case detection from individuals residing in Mondulkiri, Eastern Cambodia. The presence of <italic>P. vivax</italic> was determined using an RDT (CareStartTM Malaria Pf/pan RDTs, Accessbio) or microscopy and monoinfections were confirmed by RT-PCR using species-specific primers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Venous blood used was collected in lithium heparin tubes and immediately processed on-site in a mobile laboratory. Leukocytes were depleted using NWF filters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. The leukocyte depleted parasitized red blood cells were cryopreserved using glycerolyte 57 solution (Baxter) and immediately stored in liquid nitrogen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Blood isolates were thawed by addition of 12%, then 1.6%, and then 0.9% (w/v) NaCl solution followed by heparin treatment for 10 min at 37 °C. Blood stage parasites were then purified from thawed isolates using a KCl-Percoll density gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> followed by a wash with RPMI and two washes with 1X PBS. Parasites were then fixed with 3% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.01% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 1X PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. After fixation, blood stage parasites were permeabilized, denatured, neutralized, quenched, and blocked as described above. Staining for 5mC and 5hmC was carried out as described above except the primary and secondary antibodies were diluted to 1 μg/mL instead of 10 μg/mL. Parasites were stained with 10 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 for 30 min at room temperature and then washed twice with 1X PBS after staining. Parasites were mounted on a coverslip and imaged with a 100X objective on a Leica DM250. While we did detect 5mC and 5hmC methylation in residual human white blood cells, we could not confirm positive 5mC or 5hmC staining in <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood stage parasites from these isolates (<xref rid="figs18" ref-type="fig">Fig. S18</xref>). These negative results could be due to one or more factors. First, while <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stage cultures can reach parasitemias above 10%, <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood stages cannot be propagated <italic>in vitro</italic> and the parasitemia of isolates is typically just above the level of detection. Second, <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood stage isolates were cryopreserved before staining and the stability of DNA methylation after cryopreservation is unknown. Third, the hydrochloric acid treatment needed to denature chromatin during the stain protocol causes red cells to aggregate, thereby making finding and imaging <italic>P. vivax</italic> blood stages difficult.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Plasmodium vivax can persist in the liver of infected individuals in the form of dormant hypnozoites, which cause malaria relapses and are resistant to most current antimalarial drugs. This highlights the need to develop new drugs active against hypnozoites that could be used for radical cure. Here, the authors capitalize on an in vitro culture system based on primary human hepatocytes infected with P. vivax sporozoites to screen libraries of repurposed molecules and compounds acting on epigenetic pathways. They identified a number of hits, including hydrazinophthalazine analogs. They propose that some of these compounds may act on epigenetic pathways potentially involved in parasite quiescence. To provide some support to this hypothesis, they document DNA methylation of parasite DNA based on 5-methylcytosine immunostaining, mass spectrometry, and bisulfite sequencing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-The drug screen itself represents a huge amount of work and, given the complexity of the experimental model, is a tour de force.</p>
<p>
-The screening was performed in two different laboratories, with a third laboratory being involved in the confirmation of some of the hits, providing strong support that the results were reproducible.</p>
<p>
-The screening of repurposing libraries is highly relevant to accelerate the development of new radical cure strategies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-The manuscript is composed of two main parts, the drug screening itself and the description of DNA methylation in Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages. Unfortunately, these two parts are loosely connected. First, there is no evidence that the identified hits kill hypnozoites via epigenetic mechanisms. The hit compounds almost all act on schizonts in addition to hypnozoites, therefore it is unlikely that they target quiescence-specific pathways. At least one compound, colforsin, seems to selectively act on hypnozoites, but this observation still requires confirmation. Second, while the description of DNA methylation is per se interesting, its role in quiescence is not directly addressed here. Again, this is clearly not a specific feature of hypnozoites as it is also observed in P. vivax and P. cynomolgi hepatic schizonts and in P. falciparum blood stages. Therefore, the link between DNA methylation and hypnozoite formation is unclear. In addition, DNA methylation in sporozoites may not reflect epigenetic regulation occurring in the subsequent liver stages.</p>
<p>-The mode of action of the hit compounds remains unknown. In particular, it is not clear whether the drugs act on the parasite or on the host cell. Merely counting host cell nuclei to evaluate the toxicity of the compounds is probably acceptable for the screen but may not be sufficient to rule out an effect on the host cell. A more thorough characterization of the toxicity of the selected hit compounds is required.</p>
<p>-There is no convincing explanation for the differences observed between P. vivax and P. cynomolgi. The authors question the relevance of the simian model but the discrepancy could also be due to the P. vivax in vitro platform they used.</p>
<p>-Many experiments were performed only once, not only during the screen (where most compounds were apparently tested in a single well) but also in other experiments. The quality of the data would be increased with more replication.</p>
<p>-While the extended assay (12 days versus 8 days) represents an improvement of the screen, the relevance of adding inhibitors of core cytochrome activity is less clear, as under these conditions the culture system deviates from physiological conditions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, inhibitors of the P. vivax liver stages are identified from the Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem (ReFRAME) library as well as a 773-member collection of epigenetic inhibitors. This study led to the discovery that epigenetics pathway inhibitors are selectively active against P. vivax and P. cynomolgi hypnozoites. Several inhibitors of histone post-translational modifications were found among the hits and genomic DNA methylation mapping revealed the modification on most genes. Experiments were completed to show that the level of methylation upstream of the gene (promoter or first exon) may impact gene expression. With the limited number of small molecules that act against hypnozoites, this work is critically important for future drug leads. Additionally, the authors gleaned biological insights from their molecules to advance the current understanding of essential molecular processes during this elusive parasite stage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-This is a tremendously impactful study that assesses molecules for the ability to inhibit Plasmodium hypnozoites. The comparison of various species is especially relevant for probing biological processes and advancing drug leads.</p>
<p>-The SI is wonderfully organized and includes relevant data/details. These results will inspire numerous studies beyond the current work.</p>

<p>Although this work represents a massive screening effort to find new drugs targeting P. vivax hypnozoites, the authors should balance their statement that they identified targetable epigenetic pathways in hypnozoites.</p>
<p>• They should emphasize the potential role of the host cell in the presentation of the results and the discussion, as it is known that other pathogens modify the epigenome of the host cell (i.e. toxoplasma, HIV) to prevent cell division. Also, hydrazinophtalazines target multiple pathways (notably modulation of calcium flux) and have been shown to inhibit DNA-methyl transferase 1 which is lacking in Plasmodium.</p>
<p>• In a drug repurposing approach, the parasite target might also be different than the human target.</p>
<p>• The authors state that host-cell apoptotic pathways are downregulated in P. vivax infected cells (p. 5 line 162). Maybe the HDAC inhibitors and DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors are reactivating these pathways, leading to parasite death, rather than targeting parasites directly.</p>
<p>It would make the interpretation of the results easier if the authors used EC50 in µM rather than pEC50 in tables and main text. It is easy to calculate when it is a single-digit number but more complicated with multiple digits.</p>
<p>Authors mention hypnozoite-specific effects but in most cases, compounds are as potent on hypnozoite and schizonts. They should rather use &quot;liver stage specific&quot; to refer to increased activity against hypnozoites and schizonts compared to the host cell. The same comment applies to line 351 when referring to MMV019721. Following the same idea, it is a bit far-fetched to call MMV019721 &quot;specific&quot; when the highest concentration tested for cytotoxicity is less than twice the EC50 obtained against hypnozoites and schizonts.</p>
<p>Page 5 lines 187-189, the authors state &quot;...hydrazinophtalazines were inactive when tested against P. berghei liver schizonts and P. falciparum asexual blood stages, suggesting that hypnozoite quiescence may be biologically distinct from developing schizonts&quot;. The data provided in Figure 1B show that these hydrazinophtalazines are as potent in P. vivax schizonts than in P. vivax hypnozoites, so the distinct activity seems to be Plasmodium species specific and/or host-cell specific (primary human hepatocytes rather than cell lines for P. berghei) rather than hypnozoite vs schizont specific.</p>
<p>Why choose to focus on cadralazine if abandoned due to side effects? Also, why test the pharmacokinetics in monkeys? As it was a marketed drug, were no data available in humans?</p>
<p>In the counterscreen mentioned on page 6, the authors should mention that the activity of poziotinib in P. berghei and P. cynomolgi is equivalent to cell toxicity, so likely not due to parasite specificity.</p>
<p>To improve the clarity and flow of the manuscript, could the authors make a recapitulative table/figure for all the data obtained for poziotinib and hydrazinophtalazines in the different assays (8-days vs 12-days) and laboratory settings rather than separate tables in main and supplementary figures. Maybe also reorder the results section notably moving the 12-day assay before the DNA methylation part.</p>
<p>The isobologram plot shows an additive effect rather than a synergistic effect between cadralazine and 5-azacytidine, please modify the paragraph title accordingly. Please put the same axis scale for both fractional EC50 in the isobologram graph (Figure 2A).</p>
<p>Concerning the immunofluorescence detection of 5mC and 5hmC, the authors should be careful with their conclusions. The Hoechst signal of the parasites is indistinguishable because of the high signal given by the hepatocyte nuclei. The signal obtained with the anti-5hmC in hepatocyte nuclei is higher than with the anti-5mC, thus if a low signal is obtained in hypnozoites and schizonts, it might be difficult to dissociate from the background. In blood stages (Figure S18), the best to obtain a good signal is to lyse the red blood cell using saponin, before fixation and HCl treatment.</p>
<p>To conclude that 5mC marks are the predominate DNA methylation mark in both P. falciparum and P. vivax, authors should also mention that they compare different stages of the life cycle, that might have different methylation levels.</p>
<p>Also, the authors conclude that &quot;[...] 5mC is present at low level in P. vivax and P. cynomolgi sporozoites and could control liver stage development and hypnozoite quiescence&quot;. Based on the data shown here, nothing, except presence the of 5mC marks, supports that DNA methylation could be implicated in liver stage development or hypnozoite quiescence.</p>
<p>How many DNA-methyltransferase inhibitors were present in the epigenetic library? Out of those, none were identified as hits, maybe the hydrazinophtalazines effect is not linked to DNMT inhibition but another target pathway of these molecules like calcium transport?</p>
<p>The authors state (line 344): &quot;These results corroborate our hypothesis that epigenetic pathways regulate hypnozoites&quot;. This conclusion should be changed to &quot;[...] that epigenetic pathways are involved in P. vivax liver stage survival&quot; because:</p>
<p>
• The epigenetic inhibitors described here are as active on hypnozoite than liver schizonts.</p>
<p>
• Again, we cannot rule out that the host cell plays a role in this effect and that the compound may not act directly on the parasite.</p>
<p>The same comment applies to the quote in lines 394 to 396. There is no proof in the results presented here that DNA methylation plays any role in the effect of hydrazinophtalazines in the anti-plasmodial activity obtained in the assay.</p>
