<title>Abstract</title><p>The lysosomal damage response is important for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Although the mechanisms underlying the repair and autophagic elimination of damaged lysosomes have been elucidated, the early signal transduction pathways and genes induced in response to lysosomal damage remain elusive. We performed transcriptome and proteome analyses and found that the TAB–TAK1– IKK–NF-κB axis is activated by K63-linked ubiquitin chains that accumulate on damaged lysosomes. This activates the expression of various transcription factors and cytokines that promote anti-apoptosis and intercellular signaling. The findings highlight the crucial role of ubiquitin-regulated signal transduction and gene expression in cell survival and cell–cell communication in response to lysosomal damage. The results suggest that the ubiquitin system is not only involved in the removal of damaged lysosomes by lysophagy, but also functions in the activation of cellular signaling for cell survival.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lysosomes are the primary degradative organelles and play a pivotal role in maintaining cellular and tissue homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Lysosomal dysfunction is associated with various diseases, underscoring the crucial role of lysosomal integrity and its quality control in human health<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Lysosomes are susceptible to damage by many sources, both internal and external to the cell, which results in the permeabilization and rupture of lysosomal membranes. Crystals, amyloids, pathogens, lipids, lysosomal toxic drugs, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are among the stressors that can damage lysosomal membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The release of enzymes and protons from the lumen of damaged lysosomes induces oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death, which is deleterious to cells and tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. The accumulation of damaged lysosomes is thus an important factor involved in the development of aging-related diseases and other conditions such as crystalline nephropathy, neurodegenerative, and infectious diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To overcome lysosomal damage and restore lysosomal functionality, cells have developed a set of response pathways that is collectively referred to as the lysosomal damage response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. It has been reported that signal mediators, such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), exert the signal transduction in the lysosomal damage response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The quality control mechanisms for damaged lysosomes include repair, elimination, and regeneration. Lysosomal membrane damage triggers the recruitment of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) to repair the damaged membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Current studies have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-lysosome lipid transfer is crucial for lysosomal membrane repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, stress granules (SGs) have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the repair process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. When the damage is extensive and repair is not feasible, the damaged lysosome undergoes autophagic elimination in a process known as lysophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In lysophagy, lysosomal membrane permeabilization leads to extensive ubiquitination of exposed proteins. This triggers the recruitment of ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptors, which activates autophagy to sequester and degrade damaged lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Protein ubiquitination is an important form of post-translational modification that is comparable to protein phosphorylation. Protein ubiquitination in lysophagy occurs through the formation of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains (K63 ubiquitin chains)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Substrate ubiquitination in damaged lysosomes is catalyzed by the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2QL1 and several ubiquitin E3 ligases, including TRIM16, CUL1–SKP1–FBXO27, and CUL4A– DDB1–WDFY1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome- and autophagy-related gene expression, is activated during the repair and elimination of damaged lysosomes, which results in the regeneration of lysosomes as part of the lysosomal damage response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Under unstimulated conditions, TFEB is phosphorylated by lysosome-associated mTORC1 and binds to 14–3–3 proteins, resulting in the cytoplasmic retention of TFEB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, lysosomal permeabilization causes the dissociation of mTORC1 from lysosomes, which leads to the dephosphorylation of TFEB and its translocation to the nucleus to activate the expression of lysosome- and autophagy-related genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The elimination of damaged lysosomes through lysophagy requires a period of more than half a day, during which the cell is vulnerable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. It is therefore assumed that there are cellular mechanisms that cooperate with lysophagy to maintain cellular health in the lysosomal damage response. In previous work, we demonstrated that K63 ubiquitin chains, which accumulate on dysfunctional endosomes, induce cytokine production by modulating gene expression in a TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein (TAB) dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. K63 ubiquitin chains also accumulate in damaged lysosomes, which serves as an initiating signal for lysophagy. This prompted us to investigate whether gene expression is induced by ubiquitin-mediated activation of the TAB–TAK1 pathway in the lysosomal damage response, as observed in the endosomal stress response. The transcriptome of cells exposed to lysosomal damaging agents for 30 min has been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>; however, genome-wide gene expression patterns associated with the lysosomal damage response remain unclear. In this study, we performed transcriptome and proteome analyses to comprehensively examine the regulation of gene expression in the lysosomal damage response and to identify the underlying signal transduction pathways. We found that accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains in damaged lysosomes activates the TAB– TAK1–IKK–NF-κB pathway, which in turn induces the expression of various transcription factors and cytokines. We elucidated the critical role of the TAB–TAK1–IKK–NF-κB pathway in cell survival and intercellular signal transduction. Collectively, the findings suggest the existence of a universal response mechanism against the intracellular accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains.</p>

<title>Lysosomal damage has a global impact on the transcriptome and proteome</title>
<p>To comprehensively investigate the changes in gene expression caused by lysosomal damage, we performed transcriptome analysis and compared mRNA expression between cells treated with L-Leucyl–L-Leucine methyl ester (LLOMe), a well-characterized inducer of lysosomal damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, and control cells. We used RPE-1 cells, which are commonly used in aging research. Transcriptome data revealed substantial alterations in gene expression in response to lysosomal damage. We identified &gt;1,000 genes (946 upregulated and 164 downregulated genes from &gt;13,000 transcripts with Log<sub>2</sub> fold change (FC) &gt;|1| and <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05) that exhibited significant changes at 2 h after LLOMe treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Proteome analysis was performed to determine the correlation between proteomic changes and the observed alterations in the transcriptome. The analysis identified 86 upregulated and 60 downregulated proteins (of &gt;10,000 proteins with Log<sub>2</sub> FC &gt;|1| and <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). There was a modest correlation between the significant upregulation at the RNA level and that at the protein level, with a correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic>) of 0.5899 from 302 data points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). The representative targets interleukin-1 β (IL1β), IL6, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), and the proto-oncogenes c-Jun (JUN) and c-Fos (FOS) were upregulated at both the RNA and protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A, B</xref>). This indicates that alterations in the transcriptome were, at least in part, responsible for those observed in the proteome. Genes showing significant upregulation in the transcriptome and proteome analyses were subjected to gene enrichment analysis using the Gene Ontology Molecular Function (GOMF) reference dataset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, E</xref>). The results showed that these genes were primarily enriched in transcription factors and cytokines (labeled in red and blue, respectively, in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Analysis using a Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) hallmark gene set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, a phenotypic reference dataset, indicated that genes upregulated at both the RNA and protein levels were involved in biological regulatory processes including the inflammatory response and apoptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). It is noteworthy that the transcription factor prediction using the DoRothEA regulon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> identified the p65 (RELA) and p105 (NFKB1) subunits of the NF-κB family as the primary transcription factors regulating gene expression in the lysosomal damage response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). This suggests that NF-κB activation is involved in the regulation of gene expression in the lysosomal damage response. The upregulation of IL1β, IL6, IRF1, JUN, and FOS at the protein level was confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<p>Taken together, the results suggest that in the lysosomal damage response, the proteome is remodeled according to alterations in the transcriptome; this remodeling is mediated primarily through NF-κB and involves many transcription factors and cytokines, which may potentially lead to the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>).</p>

<title>Lysosomal damage activates TAK1 in a ubiquitin- and TAB-dependent manner</title>
<p>Lysosomal membrane damage exposes glycoproteins, such as LAMP2. Cytosolic galectin proteins, including Galectin-3 (Gal-3), are recruited to the lysosomal membrane by recognizing beta-galactoside-containing glycans on exposed proteins. These exposed lysosomal proteins are extensively ubiquitinated by ubiquitin ligases, resulting in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins within damaged lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. An endosomal stress response mechanism was recently described whereby K63 ubiquitin chains accumulate on dysfunctional endosomes, activating TAK1 in a TAB-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. TAB2 and TAB3 (a paralog of TAB2) function as ubiquitin decoders that specifically recognize K63 ubiquitin chains via the C-terminal Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The finding that TAB binding to unanchored K63 ubiquitin chains is sufficient to activate TAK1 in vitro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> suggests that the conjugation of K63 ubiquitin chains to bulky substrates on endosomes is sufficient to facilitate TAB-dependent TAK1 activation. This prompted us to investigate whether the accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains in other regions of the cytoplasm also results in TAK1 activation. TAK1 controls the function of the p62/sequestosome, an autophagy receptor, and TAB2 undergoes TRIM38-mediated lysosomal degradation in response to lysosomal damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, whether TAK1 is activated in a TAB-dependent manner and the role of the TAB–TAK1 signaling pathway in the lysosomal damage response remain unanswered questions.</p>
<p>To determine whether the TAB–TAK1 signaling pathway is activated in response to lysosomal damage, we initially examined the subcellular localization of TAB2 and TAK1. The recruitment of Gal-3 and K63 ubiquitin chains to damaged lysosomes was confirmed in RPE-1 cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). The co-localization of TAB2 and TAK1 with K63 ubiquitin chains at damaged lysosomes was observed 5 min after LLOMe treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The signals of LAMP1, a lysosomal marker protein, were enhanced, and LAMP1-positive puncta were increased in size in RPE-1 cells treated with LLOMe. It is plausible that this phenomenon reflects the morphological alterations in lysosomes under our experimental conditions, possibly due to lysosomal membrane damage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref>). Immunoblotting analysis showed that the accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains in the cell was accompanied by an increase in active phosphorylated TAK1, which was first detected 5 min after LLOMe treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). TFEB isolated from cells treated with LLOMe exhibited a downshift on the gel, which is a characteristic of TFEB activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This indicates that a lysosomal damage response was activated under these experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). TAK1 activation was abolished by the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme inhibitor TAK-243 and depletion of TAB2 and TAB3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>). These results suggest that TAK1 is activated in a ubiquitin- and TAB-dependent manner in the lysosomal damage response. To further explore the potential involvement of K63 ubiquitination in TAK1 activation, we performed an add-back experiment using siRNA-resistant TAB2 WT and mutants incapable of binding to K63 ubiquitin chains, dNZF and E685A. The NZF domain of TAB2 is well- characterized to specifically associate with K63 ubiquitin chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We investigated whether the add-back of TAB2 mutants rescues the activation of TAK1 in TAB2-depleted cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). TAB2 WT, but not dNZF and E685A, restored TAK1 activation in response to lysosomal damage, suggesting that the specific interaction of TAB proteins and K63 ubiquitin chains is a key mechanism to activate TAK1. Unexpectedly, the treatment of an E1 inhibitor TAK-243 that abolished the lysosomal accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains did not inhibit the recruitment of TAB2 to damaged lysosomes, suggesting that the recruitment of TAB proteins to damaged lysosomes is independent of the association with K63 ubiquitin chains (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). Collectively, it is postulated that TAB proteins require the interaction with K63 ubiquitin chains for TAK1 activation, but not for recruitment to damaged lysosomes. We next examined whether other lysosomal damage inducers, Glycyl-L-phenylalanine 2-naphthylamide (GPN) and DC661, also activate TAK1. It has been shown that GPN and DC661 induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization through hyperosmotic stress and lipid peroxidation in lysosomes, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In cells treated with GPN and DC661, K63 ubiquitin chains were accumulated, possibly due to a defect in the endo-lysosome machinery (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C, D</xref>). However, the lysosomal accumulation of Gal- 3 was significantly lower than that observed in cells treated with LLOMe, suggesting that GPN and DC661 did not induce severe lysosomal membrane permeabilization (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C, D</xref>). Under these conditions, the phosphorylation of TAK1 was not observed (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>). These findings indicate that the exposure of K63 ubiquitin chains within the cytosol following severe lysosomal membrane permeabilization functions as an initial trigger for TAB-mediated TAK1 activation in the lysosomal damage response.</p>

<title>The TAB–TAK1 pathway plays a pivotal role in the induction of cytokines and transcription factors in the lysosomal damage response</title>
<p>To gain further insight into the involvement of the TAB–TAK1 pathway in the regulation of gene expression associated with the lysosomal damage response, an additional transcriptome analysis was performed on TAB- and TAK1-depleted cells treated with LLOMe for 2 h. The genes upregulated in response to lysosomal damage were classified into six distinct clusters within the dataset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Clusters 4 and 5 comprised genes that are expressed in a TAB- and TAK1-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Most of the genes upregulated in a TAB- and TAK1-dependent manner showed overlapping expression patterns (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A, B</xref>); these genes were enriched for cytokines and growth factors, and their functions were linked to inflammatory responses and apoptosis, as shown in the gene enrichment analysis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C, D</xref>). Transcription factor prediction based on the DoRothEA regulon indicated that genes in cluster 4, whose expression was inhibited by depletion of TAB and TAK1, were targets of the NF-κB family, including RelA, NFKB1, and c-Rel (REL) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The NF-κB family members were identified as the primary transcription factors regulating gene expression in the lysosomal damage response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). This indicates that the TAB–TAK1 pathway serves as a primary axis for the activation of NF-κB in the lysosomal damage response, thereby inducing target gene expression. Cytokines and growth factors were enriched in cluster 4, and transcription factors were enriched in cluster 5, in which gene expression was partially suppressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, E</xref>). Regulators of the inflammatory response and apoptotic functions were commonly enriched in clusters 4 and 5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The results of immunoblotting showed that the protein expression of IL1β, IL6, IRF1, homeobox protein Nkx-3.1 (NKX3.1), and JUN was consistent with the TAB- and TAK1-mediated gene expression. Conversely, depletion of TAB and TAK1 did not affect the expression of FOS at both the mRNA and protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and S3E). Furthermore, the downshift of TFEB, which indicates the activation of TFEB, was not affected by depletion of TAB and TAK1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). This suggests that TFEB activation is independent of the TAB–TAK1 pathway in the lysosomal damage response.</p>

<title>The K63 Ub–TAB–TAK1–IKK–NF-κB pathway is activated in the lysosomal damage response</title>
<p>To elucidate the downstream cascade of the TAB–TAK1 signaling pathway in the early response to lysosomal damage, we performed proteome and phosphoproteome analyses using the TAK1 inhibitor HS-276 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, S4A). The phosphoproteome analysis showed that the phosphorylation levels of stress-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), specifically p38α (MAPK14, pT180/pY182) and JNK3 (MAPK10, pY223), as well as MK2 (MAPKAPK2, pT334), a downstream target of MAPKs, increased in response to lysosomal damage, and this increase was dependent on TAK1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B, C</xref>). Phosphorylation of T180/Y182 in p38α and Y223 in JNK3 activates the kinase function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The TAK1-dependent phosphorylation of Y223 in JNK3 in the lysosomal damage response was consistent with a previous report that lysosome rupture activates the TAK1–JNK pathway in THP-1 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Additionally, T334 of MK2 is a primary site of phosphorylation by MAPKs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that lysosomal damage induces TAK1-dependent activation of MAPKs. Proteome analysis showed that the inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBα) undergoes TAK1-dependent degradation 30 min after LLOMe treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). The inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) complex, which comprises IKKα, β, and γ, functions downstream of TAK1 and phosphorylates IκBα, thereby inducing its degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Similarly, in response to ubiquitin-mediated endosomal stress, the NF-κB pathway is activated in an IKK-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The degradation of IκBα is a hallmark phenomenon upstream of NF-kB activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, which is primarily triggered by IKK- mediated phosphorylation. This leads to the hypothesis that the IKK complex activated by the TAB–TAK1 pathway promotes the phosphorylation of IκBα, which leads to its degradation and NF-κB activation in the lysosomal damage response.</p>

<p>We therefore sought to characterize the kinase cascade that is activated in the lysosomal damage response. We confirmed the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). We also found that MAPKs and IKK were activated concomitant with a notable phosphorylation of IKK, JNK, and p38, and a relatively minimal phosphorylation of ERK (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The increase in the phosphorylation levels of IKK, JNK, p38, and IκBα occurred in a ubiquitin-dependent manner, as the induction was abolished by TAK-243 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Depletion of TAB, TAK1, and IKK suppressed IκBα phosphorylation, and the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 was TAB- and TAK1-dependent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). These findings indicate that the phosphorylation of IκBα is induced in a TAB–TAK1–IKK pathway-dependent manner. Additionally, it can be postulated that MAPKs, including JNK and p38, are activated by the TAB–TAK1 pathway.</p>
<p>TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a putative NF-κB regulator, has been reported to be activated in the lysosomal damage response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We examined whether TBK1 coordinately functions with the TAB-TAK1 pathway to facilitate NF-κB activation. Consistent with the previous report, TBK1 was activated in response to LLOMe treatment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D</xref>). Depletion of TAB and TAK1 led to a slight reduction in the activation of TBK1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E</xref>). The TBK1 inhibitor BX-795 did not affect TAK1 activation but abolished the phosphorylation of IKK and IκBα (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4F</xref>). With regard to the ubiquitination in the lysosomal damage response, the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC)-mediated M1 ubiquitination has been implicated in NF-κB activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. To explore the functional link between K63 and M1 ubiquitination, we examined the effects of LUBAC depletion on the TAB-TAK1 pathway and the subsequent NF-κB activation. Depletion of RNF31 (also known as HOIP), a component of LUBAC, exhibited no or minimal effects on TAK1 activation, but abolished the phosphorylation of IKK and IκBα (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4G</xref>). These findings suggest that TBK1 and LUBAC are indispensable for NF-κB activation in the lysosomal damage response.</p>
<p>The IKK complex, which is activated by the TAB–TAK1 pathway in response to lysosomal damage, has been shown to induce the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, potentially leading to the activation of NF-κB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Furthermore, TBK1 and LUBAC were required for NF-κB activation, but not for TAK1 activation, indicating that TBK1 and LUBAC function downstream of or parallel to the TAB-TAK1 pathway.</p>

<p>Gene enrichment data based on the results of transcriptome and proteome analyses indicated that TAB–TAK1 pathway-dependent gene expression plays a role in the regulation of apoptosis and the inflammatory response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and S3D). We thus examined the impact of the K63 Ub–TAB–TAK1–IKK–NF-κB pathway on these cellular functions. Lysosomal damage for 8 h did not induce apoptosis; however, inhibition of ubiquitination by TAK-243 dramatically induced apoptosis in HeLa and RPE-1 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E, S5A</xref>). This indicates that ubiquitination is essential for cell survival in the lysosomal damage response. Similarly, inhibition of TAK1 by HS-276 and depletion of TAB, TAK1, and IKKs following lysosomal damage for 24 h promoted apoptosis in HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-G</xref>). TAK1 inhibition induced apoptosis in RPE-1 cells to a lesser extent compared to HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, E, S5A</xref>). In addition, the inhibition of JNK by JNK-IN-8 promoted apoptosis following lysosomal damage for 12 h, which is a later time point than TAK-243 and HS-276 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the K63 Ub–TAB–TAK1 pathway coordinately exerts anti-apoptotic effects through the downstream effectors such as IKK and JNK in response to lysosomal damage, thereby promoting cell survival.</p>
<p>We further investigated the potential autocrine/paracrine-like effects of cytokines such as IL1β and IL6, which are expected to be secreted outside the cells due to their upregulation in the lysosomal damage response. IL6 activates the JAK–STAT pathway, which is accompanied by the phosphorylation of STAT3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Stimulation of untreated cells with conditioned media (CM) from lysosome-damaged cells resulted in the phosphorylation of STAT3, which indicates kinase activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). These results suggest that the lysosomal damage response activates intercellular signaling involving the JAK–STAT pathway. Furthermore, the capacity to activate this intercellular signaling was decreased by depletion of TAB, TAK1, and IKKs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I, J</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, comprehensive analyses of the transcriptome and proteome demonstrated that lysosomal damage causes substantial alterations in gene expression, leading to proteome remodeling. Furthermore, we identified the signal transduction pathway mediating this response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains in damaged lysosomes activates the TAB–TAK1–IKK–NF-κB pathway, which induces the expression of various transcription factors and cytokines.

<p>Prior to this study, our understanding of the lysosomal damage response was largely limited to the processes of repair and elimination of damaged lysosomes, as well as the activation and function of TFEB in lysosomal regeneration. Recent findings highlighting the role of stress granule formation in the lysosomal damage response suggest that additional pathways are involved in this process beyond what was previously anticipated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the complete picture remains to be elucidated. This study provides new information on the regulation of gene expression and signal transduction in the lysosomal damage response that offers a novel perspective for future research.</p>
<p>Aberrations in the lysosomal damage response are relevant to the pathogenesis of various age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. In the context of pathology, inflammation, which is associated with numerous diseases, is linked to lysosomes. The inflammatory response is not only regulated by lysosomal function, but also triggered by lysosomal damage, and observed in lysosomal storage diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The NLRP3 inflammasome induces an inflammatory response upon lysosomal damage by increasing cytokine processing at the protein level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. The ubiquitin-regulated gene expression of pro- inflammatory cytokines such as IL1β and IL6 may be involved in the induction of inflammation in the lysosomal damage response, in addition to the regulation at the stage of precursor processing. The present data on the regulation of gene expression by ubiquitin- mediated signal transduction may help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases associated with lysosome dysfunction.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated a pivotal role of the ubiquitin system in regulating gene expression in the lysosomal damage response, which extends its function beyond that in lysophagy initiation. We found that activation of the TAB–TAK1–IKK–NF-κB pathway, potentially by the accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains in damaged lysosomes, and the subsequent induction of gene expression are crucial for cell survival and cell–cell communication in cultured cells. Further analysis is required to determine the impact of this action on disease pathogenesis and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis in organisms.</p>
<p>While we mainly focused on the TAB–TAK1–IKK–NF-κB pathway in this study, it should be noted that TAK1 also activates AMPK, subsequently promoting lysophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. AMPK activation by TAK1 may also contribute to NF-κB activation or distinct gene regulation. We found that TBK1 is required for NF-κB activation. In considering signal mediators such as AMPK and TBK1, it is postulated that cell homeostasis is cooperatively controlled by a set of regulators in the lysosomal damage response. A recent study demonstrated that linear ubiquitin chains formed by LUBAC and deubiquitinated by OTULIN activate NF-κB in the lysosomal damage response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. We have confirmed that LUBAC is essential for NF-κB activation under our experimental conditions. It is well- documented that LUBAC-catalyzed M1 ubiquitin chains recruit IKK subunits and transduce the signaling to downstream mediators in the canonical pathway. Therefore, we hypothesized that K63 ubiquitin chains in damage lysosomes initially activate the TAB– TAK1 pathway and trigger LUBAC-mediated M1 ubiquitination. We further postulate that M1 ubiquitination subsequently recruits the IKK complex to damaged lysosomes. Consequently, activated TAK1 phosphorylates IKK subunits, leading to NF-kB activation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Apart from the lysosomal damage response, activated STING at the Golgi also leads to NF-κB activation through LUBAC-mediated formation of linear ubiquitin chains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. In addition, the IKK complex is recruited to damaged mitochondria, potentially through its association with accumulated ubiquitin chains, and activates NF-κB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Although the involvement of the TAB–TAK1 pathway was not examined in these studies, a common mechanism underlying NF-κB activation induced by the accumulation of ubiquitin on damaged or stressed organelles may serve as a unifying determinant. Taken together with our previous findings that the accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains in dysfunctional endosomes induces cytokine expression via the TAB–TAK1 pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, the present results suggest the existence of a universal response to the intracellular accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains resulting from fluctuations in the cellular environment, including organelle stress. This universal response would entail the activation of NF-κB and the modulation of downstream target gene expression for the regulation of cellular functions that maintain homeostasis.</p>

<p>RPE-1 cells were lysed in 5% SDS lysis buffer [5% SDS and 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 90114), followed by sonication with an ultrasonication probe. Cell lysates were reduced and alkylated with 4.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A39255) for 30 min at 55°C and 10 mM iodoacetamide (IAA, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A39271) for 15 min at room temperature (RT). Subsequently, 30 µg of cell lysates were loaded onto S-Trap micro columns (ProtiFi, C02- micro); trypsin and lysyl-endopeptidase (Lys-C) solution (1:10 w/w, Thermo Fisher Scientific, A41009) was added and incubated for 16 h at 37°C. The eluted peptides were dried in a vacuum concentrator and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Aliquots containing 500 ng of peptides from each sample were loaded onto a Vanquish Neo UHPLC system-connected Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were separated on an analytical column (C18, 1.7 µm particle size × 75 µm diameter × 600 mm, IonOpticks, AUR3-60075C18) heated at 55°C in a column oven (Sonation, PRSO-C2) with a constant flow rate of 250 nL/min. The peptides were eluted with a 0–40% acetonitrile gradient over 120 min. Peptide ionization was performed using the Nanospray Flex Ion Source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer was operated in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode using a full scan (m/z range of 380–985, nominal resolution of 60,000, and target value of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> ions) followed by DIA-MS scans (fixed collision energy of 30%, isolation width of 10 m/z with an overlapping of 1 m/z, nominal resolution of 15,000, and target value of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> ions).</p>

<title>DIA-MS data processing and visualization</title>
<p>The MS raw files were searched against the human UniProt reference proteome (Uniprot ID: UP000005640, reviewed, canonical, 20,563 entries) in library-free mode using DIA- NN software (version 1.9.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The parameters that differed from the default settings were as follows: variable modifications, oxidation of methionine and acetylation of the peptide N-terminus; precursor m/z range, 380–985. Following processing with DIA-NN, the exported data were subjected to imputation using Perseus software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The default setting was used, assuming that missing values represent low protein abundance. In this case, missing values were replaced by random numbers drawn from a normal distribution across the entire matrix. Gene enrichment tests and clustering were performed using the RNAseqChef software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, and heatmaps were generated using the Morpheus platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/</ext-link>).

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.1.0). All statistical information is provided in the figure legends. First, the sample distribution was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. In the absence of formal testing, datasets with small sample sizes were assumed to have a normal distribution. The unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test was used to determine statistical significance when comparing unpaired two independent groups with normal distribution and no significant difference in standard deviation (SD). For multiple comparisons involving more than two unpaired groups with normal distribution, an ordinary one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used. In all instances, statistical significance was evaluated with a 95% confidence interval, and a <italic>P</italic> value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lysosomal damage is commonly found in many diseases including normal aging and age-related disease. However, the transcriptional programs activated by lysosomal damage has not been thoroughly characterized. This study aims to investigate lysosome damage-induced major transcriptional responses and the underlying signaling basis. The authors have convincingly shown that lysosomal damage activates a ubiquitination-dependent signaling axis involving TAB, TAK1, and IKK, which culminate in the activation of NF-kB and subsequent transcriptional upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and pro-survival genes. Overall, the major aims of this study are successfully achieved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is well-conceived and strictly executed, leading to clear and well-supported conclusions. Through unbiased transcriptomics and proteomics screens, the authors identifies NF-kB as a major transcriptional program activated upon lysosome damage. TAK1 activation by lysosome damage-induced ubiquitination is found to be essential for NF-kB activation and MAP kinase signaling. The transcriptional and proteomic changes are shown to be largely driven by TAK1 signaling. Finally, the TAK1-IKK signaling is shown to provide resistance to apoptosis during lysosomal damage response. The main signaling axis of this pathway has been convincingly demonstrated.</p>
<p>Overall, this study identifies major transcriptional responses following lysosomal damage through unbiased approaches. It is important to consider the impact of these pathways in disease settings where lysosomal integrity is compromised.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Endo et al. investigate the novel role of ubiquitin response upon lysosomal damage in activating cellular signaling for cell survival. The authors provide a comprehensive transcriptome and proteome analysis of aging-related cells experiencing lysosomal damage, identifying transcription factors involved in transcriptome and proteome remodeling with a focus on the NF-κB signaling pathway. They further characterized the K63-ubiquitin-TAB-TAK1-NF-κB signaling axis in controlling gene expression, inflammatory responses, and apoptotic processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In the aging-related model, the authors provide a comprehensive transcriptome and characterize the K63-ubiquitin-TAB-TAK1-NF-κB signaling axis. Through compelling experiments and advanced tools, they elucidate its critical role in controlling gene expression, inflammatory responses, and apoptotic processes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study lacks deeper connections with previous research, particularly:</p>
<p>• The established role of TAB-TAK1 in AMPK activation during lysosomal damage</p>
<p>• The potential significance of TBK1 in NF-κB signaling pathways</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have successfully addressed all the raised questions and the manuscript is now significantly improved.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The response to lysosomal damage is a fast-moving and timely field. Besides repair and degradation pathways, increasing interest has been focusing on damaged-induced signaling. The authors conducted both transcriptomics and proteomics to characterize the cellular response to lysosomal damage. They identify a signaling pathway leading to activation of NFkappaB. Based on this and supported by Western blot and microscopy data, the authors nicely show that TAB2/3 and TAK1 are activated at damaged lysosomes and kick off the pathway to alter gene expression, which induces cytokines and protect from cell death. TAB2/3 activation is proposed to occur through K63 ubiquitin chain formation. Generally, this is a careful and well conducted study that nicely delineates the pathway under lysosomal stress. The &quot;omics&quot; data serves a valuable resource for the field. More work should be invested into how TAB2/3 are activated at the damaged lysosomes, also to increase novelty in light of previous reports.</p>

<p>Generally, this is a careful and well-conducted study that nicely delineates how the NFkB pathway is activated under lysosomal stress and modulates cell behavior. The &quot;omics&quot; data serves as a valuable resource for the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While activation of TAB2/3 by K63-linked Ub chains is convincing, more work needs to be done on how they are recruited by distinct damage types to probe relevance for different pathophysiological conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed much of my criticism. Specifically, they have put (with new experiments) the data on the TAB2/3-TAK1 pathway in perspective to the previously reported LUBAC-mediated activation of NFkB. They also addressed the question about the significance of K63-linked chains for TAB2/3 activation with new complementation experiments (a K63-specific NZF mutant failed to rescue).</p>
<p>The third point (types of damage as triggers) raises more questions, though. The authors find that, in contrast to LLOMe, GPN or DC661-induced damage does not activate TAK1 (consistent with lower damage levels). However, the authors still observe K63 ubiquitylation. This goes along with their finding that TAB2 is recruited in the absence of any ubiquitylation (blocked by TAK-243). It argues that TAB2 is recruited by an unknown cue (that may be damage-specific) and then activated by K63. The authors need to clarify whether TAB2 is or is not recruited in the GPN/DC661 conditions (in which K63 occurs, but TAK1 is not activated). The point about the effects of other damage types was also raised by reviewer #1 and should be solved. The fact that TAB2 is recruited independently of K63 should also be visualized in the model. The manuscript will then be an important contribution to the field.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lysosomal damage is commonly found in many diseases including normal aging and age-related disease. However, the transcriptional programs activated by lysosomal damage have not been thoroughly characterized. This study aimed to investigate lysosome damage-induced major transcriptional responses and the underlying signaling basis. The authors have convincingly shown that lysosomal damage activates a ubiquitination-dependent signaling axis involving TAB, TAK1, and IKK, which culminates in the activation of NF-kB and subsequent transcriptional upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and pro-survival genes. Overall, the major aims of this study were successfully achieved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is well-conceived and strictly executed, leading to clear and well-supported conclusions. Through unbiased transcriptomics and proteomics screens, the authors identified NF-kB as a major transcriptional program activated upon lysosome damage. TAK1 activation by lysosome damage-induced ubiquitination was found to be essential for NF-kB activation and MAP kinase signaling. The transcriptional and proteomic changes were shown to be largely driven by TAK1 signaling. Finally, the TAK1-IKK signaling was shown to provide resistance to apoptosis during lysosomal damage response. The main signaling axis of this pathway was convincingly demonstrated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One weakness was the claim of K63-linked ubiquitination in lysosomal damage-induced NF-kB activation. While it was clear that K63 ubiquitin chains were present on damaged lysosomes, no evidence was shown in the current study to demonstrate the specific requirement of K63 ubiquitin chains in the signaling axis being studied. Clarifying the roles of K63-linked versus other types of ubiquitin chains in lysosomal damage-induced NF-kB activation may improve the mechanistic insights and overall impact of this study.</p>
<p>Another weakness was that the main conclusions of this study were all dependent on an artificial lysosomal damage agent. It will be beneficial to confirm key findings in other contexts involving lysosomal damage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank Reviewer #1 for the positive and constructive comments on our study. For a main concern regarding the molecular mechanism by which TAB proteins are activated in response to lysosomal damage, we have added the experimental results to support that the lysosomal accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains serves as a trigger to activate the TAB-TAK1 pathway. We also investigated and discussed the role of LUBAC-mediated M1 ubiquitin chains in NF-kB activation and the effects of other lysosomal-damaging compounds.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Endo et al. investigate the novel role of ubiquitin response upon lysosomal damage in activating cellular signaling for cell survival. The authors provide a comprehensive transcriptome and proteome analysis of aging-related cells experiencing lysosomal damage, identifying transcription factors involved in transcriptome and proteome remodeling with a focus on the NF-κB signaling pathway. They further characterized the K63-ubiquitin-TAB-TAK1-NF-κB signaling axis in controlling gene expression, inflammatory responses, and apoptotic processes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In the aging-related model, the authors provide a comprehensive transcriptome and characterize the K63-ubiquitin-TAB-TAK1-NF-κB signaling axis. Through compelling experiments and advanced tools, they elucidate its critical role in controlling gene expression, inflammatory responses, and apoptotic processes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study lacks deeper connections with previous research, particularly:</p>
<p>• The established role of TAB-TAK1 in AMPK activation during lysosomal damage</p>
<p>• The potential significance of TBK1 in NF-κB signaling pathways</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank Reviewer #2 for the helpful comments on our study. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the signaling pathways involved in the lysosomal damage response, we investigated additional related signal mediators, such as TBK1 and LUBAC. The citations related to AMPK have been incorporated.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The response to lysosomal damage is a fast-moving and timely field. Besides repair and degradation pathways, increasing interest has been focusing on damaged-induced signaling. The authors conducted both transcriptomics and proteomics to characterize the cellular response to lysosomal damage. They identify a signaling pathway leading to activation of NFkappaB. Based on this and supported by Western blot and microscopy data, the authors nicely show that TAB2/3 and TAK1 are activated at damaged lysosomes and kick off the pathway to alter gene expression, which induces cytokines and protect from cell death. TAB2/3 activation is proposed to occur through K63 ubiquitin chain formation. Generally, this is a careful and well conducted study that nicely delineates the pathway under lysosomal stress. The &quot;omics&quot; data serves as a valuable resource for the field. More work should be invested into how TAB2/3 are activated at the damaged lysosomes, also to increase novelty in light of previous reports.</p>

<p>We would like to thank Reviewer #3 for the valuable comments on our study. We have added the experimental results to address two concerns raised by Reviewer #3. Please see the response to “Reviewer #3 (Public review): Suggestions:”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) A recent paper claims that NFkappaB is activated by Otulin/M1 chains upon lysosome damage through TBK1 (PMID: 39744815). In contrast, Endo et al. nicely show that ubiquitylation is needed (shown by TAK-243) for NFkB activation but only have correlative data to link it specifically to K63 chains. On page 15, line 11, the authors even argue a &quot;potential&quot; involvement of K63. This point should be better dealt with. Can the authors specifically block K63 formation? K63R overexpression or swapping would be one way. Is the K63 ligase ITCH involved (PMID: 38503285) or any other NEDD4-like ligase? This could be compared to LUBAC inhibition. Also, the point needs to be dealt with more controversially in the discussion as these are alternative claims (M1 vs K63, TAB vs TBK1).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is well-characterized that the NZF domain of TAB proteins preferentially associates with K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Therefore, we performed the add-back experiment using siRNA-resistant TAB2 WT and mutants incapable of binding to K63-linked ubiquitin chains, dNZF and E685A, to elucidate the requirement of K63 ubiquitin chains for TAK1 activation. We investigated whether the add-back of TAB2 mutants rescues the activation of TAK1 in TAB2-depleted cells (Fig. 2E). TAB2 WT, but not dNZF and E685A, rescued TAK1 activation in response to LLOMe, suggesting that the specific interaction of TAB proteins and K63 ubiquitin chains is a key mechanism to activate TAK1. We also found that the treatment of an E1 inhibitor TAK-243 effectively prevented the lysosomal accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains, but TAB2 was recruited to damaged lysosomes (Fig. S2B). This suggests that the recruitment of TAB proteins to damaged lysosomes is independent of the association with K63 ubiquitin chains. Collectively, it is postulated that TAB proteins require interaction with K63 ubiquitin chains for TAK1 activation, but not for recruitment to damaged lysosomes. We have added the sentences (p9, lines 7-20, and p10, lines 8-10).</p>
<p>Next, we confirmed that LUBAC functions are essential for NF-kB activation in the lysosomal damage response. RNF31/HOIP is a component of LUBAC that catalyzes M1 ubiquitination. The depletion of RNF31 showed no significant effects on TAK1 activation, but abolished IKK activation (Fig. S4G). It is well-characterized that LUBAC-mediated M1 ubiquitin chains recruit IKK subunits and transduce the signaling to downstream in the canonical pathway. We assume that K63 ubiquitin chains in damaged lysosomes initially activate TAB-TAK1 and trigger LUBAC-mediated M1 ubiquitination, and subsequently, M1 ubiquitination functions to recruit the IKK complex. Consequently, activated TAK1 phosphorylates IKK subunits in damaged lysosomes, leading to NF-kB activation. We also examined whether TBK1 is involved in the activation of NF-kB. TBK1 was phosphorylated upon LLOMe, and depletion of TAB and TAK1 resulted in a slight reduction of TBK1 phosphorylation (Fig. S4D, E). The treatment of a TBK1 inhibitor BX-795 exhibited no or little effects on TAK1 activation, but abolished phosphorylation of IKK and IkBa (Fig. S4F). These suggest that TBK1 is required for the activation of NF-kB. We have added the sentences (p13, line 13-p14, line 10).</p>
<p>As mentioned by Reviewer #3, it is important to identify the E3 ligase responsible for K63 ubiquitination in the lysosomal damage response. We have been aiming to identify such E3 ligase(s). However, depletions of ITCH and other E3 ligases that have been tested exhibited no or little effects on K63 ubiquitination and TAK1 activation.  We would like to explore E3 ligase(s) in future study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It would be interesting to know what the trigger is that induces the pathway. Lipid perturbation by LLOMe is a good model, but does activation also occur with GPN (osmotic swelling) or lipid peroxidation (oxidative stress) that may be more broadly relevant in a pathophysiological way? Moreover, what damage threshold is needed? Does loss of protons suffice? Can activation be induced with a Ca2+ agonist in the absence of damage?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To further clarify the initial trigger that induces TAB-TAK1 activation coupled with lysosomal damage, we examined other damage sources, GPN and DC661, which induce hyperosmotic stress and lipid peroxidation in lysosomes, respectively, thereby resulting in lysosomal membrane damage. Under our experimental conditions, the treatment of these compounds did not result in significant accumulation of Gal-3, indicating a reduced level of lysosomal membrane permeabilization compared with LLOMe (Fig. S2C, D), and no or little TAK1 activation was observed (Fig. S2E). TAB proteins require their association with K63 ubiquitin chains for TAK1 activation. It is therefore postulated that the severe lysosomal membrane permeabilization that triggers the formation and cytosolic exposure of K63 ubiquitin chains may be a determinant of TAB-TAK1 activation. In our future work, we would like to examine broad stimulation of lysosomal damage and further elucidate the initial mechanism of TAB-TAK1 activation. We have added the sentences (p9, line 21-p10, line 7).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors nicely define JNK and p38 activation. This should be emphasized more, possibly also in the abstract, as it may contribute to the claim of increased survival fitness.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We further tested whether the inhibition of JNK affects the anti-apoptotic effect (Fig. S5B). The inhibition of JNK resulted in an increase in the cleaved caspase-3. This suggests that the anti-apoptotic action in the lysosomal damage response requires JNK as well as IKK. We have added the sentences in results to emphasize the pivotal role of stress-induced MAPKs (p15, lines 7-11).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Although the ubiquitination-TAB-TAK1-IKK axis was previously characterized in other contexts, specific evidence supporting lysosomal recruitment of these components by ubiquitination during lysosome damage would be beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We found that the treatment of an E1 inhibitor TAK-243 abolished the lysosomal accumulation of K63 ubiquitin chains, but TAB2 and TAK1 were recruited to damaged lysosomes (Fig. S2B). This suggests that the recruitment of TAB proteins to damaged lysosomes is independent of the association with K63-linked ubiquitin chains. Next, we investigated whether the add-back of TAB2 mutants incapable of binding K63 ubiquitin chains rescues the activation of TAK1 in TAB2-depleted cells (Fig. 2E). K63 ubiquitin binding of TAB2 was essential for TAK1 activation in response to LLOMe. Taken together, it is suggested that TAB proteins require their interaction with K63 ubiquitin chains for TAK1 activation, but not for recruitment to damaged lysosomes. We have added the sentences (p9, lines 7-20, and p10, lines 8-10). Please also see the response to “Reviewer #3 (Public review): Suggestions:”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The activation of p38 and JNK by lysosomal damage does not fit well into the main conclusions of the paper, since IKK knockdown was sufficient to block cellular resistance to apoptosis (caspase cleavage in Fig. 5f). Are p38 and JNK also important for cell survival during lysosomal damage?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We found that the inhibition of JNK resulted in an increase in the cleaved caspase-3, suggesting that the anti-apoptotic action in the lysosomal damage response requires both IKK and JNK (Fig. S5B). We have added the sentences (p15, lines 7-11).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Cell death tests are recommended to support the conclusions related to apoptosis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by Reviewer #1, we performed the cell death assay using propidium iodide (PI) and confirmed that HeLa cells co-treated with LLOMe and TAK-243 or HS-276 exhibited increased cell death (Fig. 5E). This indicates a direct correlation between the degree of caspase-3 cleavage and cell death, possibly apoptosis.</p>
