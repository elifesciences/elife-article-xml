<title>Abstract</title><p>Soil salinity is one of the major threats to agricultural productivity worldwide. Salt stress exposure alters root and shoot growth rates, thereby affecting overall plant performance. While past studies have extensively documented the effect of salt stress on root elongation and shoot development separately, here we take an innovative approach by examining the coordination of root and shoot growth under salt stress conditions. Utilizing a newly developed tool for quantifying the root:shoot ratio in agar-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, we found that salt stress results in a loss of coordination between root and shoot growth rates. We identify a specific gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), and characterize one of these genes as Salt Root:shoot Ratio Regulator Gene (SR3G). Further analysis elucidates the role of SR3G as a negative regulator of salt stress tolerance, revealing its function in regulating shoot growth, root suberization, and sodium accumulation. We further characterize that <italic>SR3G</italic> expression is modulated by <italic>WRKY75</italic> transcription factor, known as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance. Finally, we show that the salt stress sensitivity of <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant is completely diminished when it is combined with <italic>sr3g</italic> mutation. Together, our results demonstrate that utilizing root:shoot ratio as an architectural feature leads to the discovery of new stress resilience gene. The study’s innovative approach and findings not only contribute to our understanding of plant stress tolerance mechanisms but also open new avenues for genetic and agronomic strategies to enhance crop environmental resilience.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Salt stress is predominant in the dryland areas where evaporation rate exceeds water input, resulting in increased accumulation of salts in the upper soil layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abrol, Yadav, and Massoud 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fischer et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Richards 1969</xref>). Dryland areas of South America, southern and western Australia, Mexico, southwest United States, and South Africa were previously identified as primary hotspots for soil salinization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hassani, Azapagic, and Shokri 2021</xref>). As fresh water becomes scarcer, understanding the mechanisms of salt stress resilience becomes of paramount importance in the context of global agricultural productivity and sustainability.</p>
<p>Salt stress detrimentally affects plant growth and development, decreasing the activity of the meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">West, Inzé, and Beemster 2004</xref>). Studies utilizing main root elongation as an indicator of salt tolerance have led to identification of many crucial components of salt stress signaling and tolerance, including genes involved in salt-overly sensitive signaling (SOS) pathway, jasmonate, ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glycophytes and halophytes alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wu, Ding, and Zhu 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Valenzuela et al. 2016</xref>; Yunfei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hu et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Geng et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fu et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Şekerci et al. 2023</xref>). Additionally, negative halotropism response, that describes a directional growth of main root away from the salt gradient, was used to identify a wide range of molecular components regulating the auxin redistribution and cell-wall remodeling, to actively avoid high salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Galvan-Ampudia et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Deolu-Ajayi et al. 2019</xref>; B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yu et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Korver et al. 2020</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zou et al. 2022</xref>). The development of lateral roots is affected by salinity, and the differential effect on main and lateral roots within specific genotype can result in substantial reprogramming of root system architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2017</xref>). The shoot development is impacted by salt stress, as the salt impacts the plant transpiration and photosynthetic efficiency instantaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Awlia et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Julkowska et al. 2016</xref>). Many forward genetic studies were highly successful in associating natural variation in root and shoot growth with underlying genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awlia et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Julkowska et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2017</xref>). However, these studies typically focus on either above or below ground tissue.</p>
<p>The coordination of root and shoot growth rate is an important aspect of seedling establishment, and becomes even more critical under abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Karcher et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Xu et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al. 2022</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bacher et al. 2022</xref>). The importance of increased root:shoot ratio, maximizing water scavenging while limiting transpiration, is well studied under drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asch et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Karcher et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Uga et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chen et al. 2022</xref>). However, the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio is yet to be described, and its contribution to salt stress remains unknown. Here, we developed a tool to quantify root:shoot ratio from agar-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, and re-analyzed the natural diversity panel of Arabidopsis exposed to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julkowska et al. 2017</xref>). We have observed that while salt stress does not elicit a clear response in root:shoot ratio, it results in loss of coordination of root and shoot growth rates. The locus associated with salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio consisted of a gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with majority of SNPs clustering into one specific gene (At3g50160), that we named as Salt Root:shoot Ratio Regulator Gene (SR3G). Further characterization of SR3G revealed its function as a negative regulator of salt stress resilience, through regulation of root suberization, shoot growth, and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation. We found WRKY75 transcription factor, a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance, acts upstream of SR3G, binding directly to the SR3G promoter in yeast. While <italic>sr3g</italic> and <italic>wrky75</italic> mutants showed contrasting salt stress response, the double mutants of <italic>sr3g/wrky75</italic> displayed reduced sensitivity to salt stress.</p>

<title>Screening HapMap population for the increase in root and shoot size</title>
<p>The images collected within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julkowska et al. 2017</xref>) were re-analyzed in this manuscript to examine salt-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio for the data presented here. 360 accessions of the Arabidopsis HapMap population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Weigel and Mott 2009</xref>) were screened over 7 experimental batches, using 4 biological replicates per genotype per condition. The seeds were surface sterilized, incubated in sterile MQ water at 4°C for 48 h, and germinated on media containing ½ Murashige-Skoog, 0.5% sucrose, 0.1% MES buffer, pH 5.8 (KOH) and 1% Dashin agar. The 4-day-old seedlings were subsequently transferred to media additionally supplemented with 0, 75 or 125 mM NaCl. The plates were scanned every 2nd day using a flat-bed scanner for 8 consecutive days.</p>
<p>The collected images were analyzed for green and white pixels, corresponding to the projected surface of the shoot and root, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ronellsicat/PlantSeg">https://github.com/ronellsicat/PlantSeg</ext-link>). A Matlab-based tool was developed and used to simplify and speed up the segmentation and analysis pipeline. For automatic segmentation, the tool uses a combination of image operations (histogram equalization), thresholding on different color spaces (e.g., RGB, YCbCr, Lab, HSV), and binary image processing (boundary and islands removal). For analysis, the tool uses connected components analysis to extract the plants (combined roots and shoots) and can guide the user to find possible mistakes which can be manually corrected via the user interface. After segmentation, the number of pixels for roots and shoots are counted and recorded automatically. More details are provided in the publicly available repository for the tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ronellsicat/PlantSeg">https://github.com/ronellsicat/PlantSeg</ext-link>). The collected images and corresponding data acquired from them using the tool can be accessed at Zenodo Repository (experimental batch 1: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272155">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272155</ext-link>; experimental batch 2: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272344">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272344</ext-link>; experimental batch 3: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272647">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272647</ext-link>; experimental batch 4: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7271841">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7271841</ext-link>; experimental batch 5: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272139">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7272139</ext-link>; experimental batch 6: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7273936">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7273936</ext-link>; experimental batch 7: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7273937">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7273937</ext-link>; quantified data: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7268673">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7268673</ext-link>). The tool’s precision was evaluated by growing the Col-0 seedlings on agar plates, analyzing their root and shoot projected area on the final day using the tool, and correlating it with the recorded fresh and dry weight of the seedlings (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). The collected data from the HapMap panel was analyzed using R for potential outliers (samples identified to be more than 3x standard deviation from the mean of each genotype within each condition), and the genotype-specific mean was calculated using the stats package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Team et al. 2018</xref>). The overall increase in root and shoot area was investigated for differences between control and salt stress conditions (<bold>Fig. S2</bold>). The root and shoot growth were estimated by fitting a linear function for a log-transformed projected root or shoot area over the non-transformed timeline of the experiment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rpubs.com/mjulkowska/HapMap-root-shoot-data">https://rpubs.com/mjulkowska/HapMap-root-shoot-data</ext-link>). The data were subsequently used to explore differences between the experimental batches and the standard deviations within individual accessions. The genotypes above 3 standard deviations from the population’s mean were excluded from further analysis. The salt tolerance index (STI) was calculated for root and shoot growth by dividing the average trait value at salt stress by the genotype-specific average at control conditions (<bold>Fig. S3</bold>). The correlations between individual traits were examined using the genotypic mean (<bold>Fig. S4</bold>). All quantitative data for root and shoot growth was visualized using ggplot2, corrplot and ggpubr packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kassambara, n.d.</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wilke 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wei and Simko 2017</xref>). For all measured traits, we estimated broad sense heritability (H<sup>2</sup>) using the MVApp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Julkowska et al. 2018</xref>) (<bold>Table S1</bold>). The data used as an input for GWAS can be found in <bold>Table S2</bold>.</p>

The GWAS was conducted as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awlia et al. 2021</xref>), initially using 250 k SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Horton et al. 2012</xref>) and subsequently using 4 M SNPs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://1001genomes.org">1001genomes.org</ext-link>). The GWAS associations were evaluated for minor allele count (MAC) and association strength above the Bonferroni threshold with -log10(p-value/#SNPs), calculated for each sub-population of SNPs above threshold MAC (<bold>Table S3</bold>, Bonf.threshold.MAC.specific). The GWAS data was processed for associations with all SNPs used to generate Manhattan and QQ-plots (R notebook for processing GWAS data: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rpubs.com/mjulkowska/GWAS-root-shoot-Arabidopsis-salt-250kSNPs">https://rpubs.com/mjulkowska/GWAS-root-shoot-Arabidopsis-salt-250kSNPs</ext-link>). Additionally, we prioritized the genetic loci where multiple SNPs were associated with individual traits, or multiple traits were associated with one genetic locus. Our final selection yielded 14 associations with traits measured under control conditions, while 9 and 23 associations were specific to traits measured under 75 and 125 mM NaCl, respectively (<bold>Table S3</bold>).

<title>Haplotype analysis</title>
<p>For the most promising candidate loci (<bold>Table S4</bold>), we have identified the gene open reading frames that were located within the linkage-disequilibrium of the associated SNPs. The protein-coding genes were subsequently used for haplotype analysis. All the SNPs located within the gene coding region were used to perform a haplotype analysis.

<title>Phylogenetic and positive selection analysis of SR3G orthologs</title>
<p>Identified orthologs were translated into amino acid, then aligned by MUSCLE. Alignments were carefully validated by manual correction. Briefly, diverged insertions were trimmed, shifted frames were adjusted, and conserved regions after translation were retained for phylogeny reconstruction. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the RAxML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stamatakis 2014</xref>) plug-in within Geneious (Geneious Prime 2022.1.1) with the GAMMA-GTR nucleotide model, rapid bootstrapping with a parsimony search, and 100 bootstraps. The distribution of <italic>SR3G</italic> and other DUF247 orthologs, root lengths for each branch, were visualized by software Geneious Prime.</p>
<p>To characterize any potential positive selection that might exist along certain branches of the inferred phylogeny, including SR3G and its orthologs, we performed a branch-site model A test on branches leading to SR3G, and branches leading to the clade containing SR3G and its closet orthologs using PAML4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang 2007</xref>) as performed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Beilstein et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nelson et al. 2014</xref>). Specific branches are denoted as ω0, ω1, ω2, ω3, and ω-rest). In the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>): we assigned a substitution rate (ω = dN/dS) along with 0 &lt; ω &lt; 1 or ω = 1 to all branches (represented by H<sub>0</sub>: ω0 = ω1 = ω2 = ω3 = ω-rest). The alternative hypotheses (HAs) here allow the differential selections been applied to respective branch(es). Specifically, the five alternative hypotheses are listed here: H<sub>1</sub>: ω -rest branches = ω0 = ω3 = ω1 ≠ ω2, H<sub>2</sub>: ω -rest branches = ω0 = ω1 = ω2 ≠ ω3, H<sub>3</sub>: ω -rest branches = ω0 ≠ ω1 ≠ ω2 ≠ ω3, H<sub>4</sub>: ω -rest branches ≠ ω0 ≠ ω1 ≠ ω2 ≠ ω3, H<sub>sep</sub>: each branch has its unique ω value. To test these hypotheses, we further validate or reject alternative hypotheses by conducting a Chi-square test based on likelihood scores (Ln-L score) derived from the respective branch-site model A tests (Chi-square test cutoff: P &lt; 0.05).</p>

<title>Natural variation in salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio</title>
<p>To investigate salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we developed a custom tool that quantifies green and white pixels, corresponding to shoot and root of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on agar plates (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). The projected area of root and shoot showed high correlation with root and shoot fresh weight (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>), indicating that projected root and shoot area can be used as an accurate proxy to non-destructively measure the increase in root and shoot biomass from the images of seedlings grown on agar plates.</p>

<p>Using our custom tool, we re-analyzed the data consisting of 360 Arabidopsis accessions grown on plates supplemented with 0, 75, and 125 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julkowska et al. 2017</xref>), for salt stress-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, Fig. S2</bold>). The growth of root and shoot for each plant was estimated using the exponential function. Salt stress-induced reduction in growth rate was observed to be dose-dependent for both root and shoot (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref></bold>). In general, the root growth was more sensitive to salt stress compared to shoot growth, with the population-wide relative growth rates reduced to a fraction of 0.67 and 0.41 of the growth rates observed at control for 75 and 125 mM NaCl, respectively. In comparison, the growth rates of the shoot were reduced to 0.71 and 0.43 of the control in 75 and 125 mM NaCl treatments, respectively (<bold>Fig. S3</bold>). While the mean value of root:shoot growth rate did not change upon salt stress treatment, the variance in the root:shoot ratio expanded with the increasing concentrations of salt (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). These results suggest that while root and shoot growth are well coordinated under non-stress conditions, salt stress exposure results in loss of coordination of organ growth across Arabidopsis accessions. No significant correlation was found between the root:shoot growth ratio and total seedling size (<bold>Fig. S4, S5</bold>), indicating that the relationship between coordination of root and shoot growth and salt tolerance during the early seedling establishment is complex.</p>

<title>Identification of genetic components underlying salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio</title>
<p>To identify genetic components underlying salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we used the collected data as an input for GWAS. The associations were evaluated based on the p-value, the number of SNPs within the locus, and the number of traits associated with individual loci. As Bonferroni threshold differs depending on the minor allele count (MAC) considered, we identified significant associations based on a Bonferroni threshold for each subpopulation of SNPs based on MAC (<bold>Table S3</bold>). The initial GWAS was performed using 250 k SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Horton et al. 2012</xref>), and led to the identification of 14 significantly associated loci, of which 3 and 7 loci were associated with traits measured at 75 or 125 mM NaCl treatments, respectively. We identified one salt specific association on chromosome 2 (<bold>Fig. S6</bold>), where two SNPs were identified within AT2G27300 encoding NAC-domain containing transcription factor (NTL8). Additionally, salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio and shoot:total seedling area were associated with SNPs on chromosome 3, where 2 significantly associated SNPs were flanking AT3G22430, encoding an unknown gene encoding a domain of unknown function (<bold>Fig. S7</bold>). To further prioritize the selection of candidate genes for further validation study, we repeated GWAS using 4 M SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1001 Genomes Consortium. Electronic address: <email>magnus.nordborg@gmi.oeaw.ac.at</email> and 1001 Genomes Consortium 2016</xref>). Increased SNP density GWAS revealed 32 additional loci, with only one significantly associated locus being picked up by both 250k and 4M SNPs GWAS (locus 30, <bold>Table S3</bold>). We further prioritized the identified associations based on the number of significantly associated SNPs, minor allele count (MAC), and number of traits associated with each locus, and identified three loci of major interest (<bold>Table S4</bold>). The region within linkage disequilibrium (LD) of the significantly associated SNPs was investigated for the sequence divergence and open reading frames (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Fig. S8, Fig. S9</bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Out of identified associations, locus 30 stood out as it consisted of nine SNPs associated with p-value above the Bonferroni threshold, and was associated with both root:shoot and shoot:total seedling area at 6 and 8 days after transfer of the seedling to 125 mM NaCl (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, Fig. S8, Table S4</bold>). The significantly associated SNPs were located in and around the gene coding region of AT3G50160, which encodes a domain of unknown function 247 (DUF247). We investigated the region for sequence divergence, and found that the region contained not only a high degree of sequence diversity but also potential structural variants (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). To identify allelic variation underlying the initial associations, we performed haplotype analysis, where accessions with shared SNP pattern within the protein-coding part of AT3G50160 were grouped into individual haplotype-groups (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). Each unique haplotype, represented by at least three accessions, was subsequently studied for differences in observed phenotypes. We observed that Haplotype 1, represented by 46 accessions including Col-0, was significantly different from Haplotype 11, represented by 11 accessions including Blh-1, in shoot-per-total seedling area at 6 days after transfer to 125 mM NaCl (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>), as well as shoot growth rate and relative shoot growth rate at 125 mM NaCl (<bold>Fig. S9</bold>). Upon further investigation and sequencing of AT3G50160 in both Col-0 and Blh-1 accessions, we discovered that the Blh-1 allele carries a large insertion at 644 nucleotides downstream from the ATG of AT3G50160, followed by multiple other sequence variations (<bold>Fig. S10</bold>). The first insertion leads to a premature STOP-codon within the DUF247 domain after Gly-215 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, Fig. S11</bold>), resulting in a truncated protein that still carries a nuclear localization signal and coiled-coil domain, but is missing a major part of the calcium-binding domain and a predicted transmembrane domain (<bold>Fig. S12</bold>). As there are other DUF247s within the locus associated with salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we decided to name the gene containing majority of the associated SNPs (At3g50160) as Salt Root:shoot Ratio Regulator Gene (SR3G). Together, these results suggest that the allelic variation in SR3G protein sequence might underlie the observed differences in root:shoot ratio under salt stress conditions.</p>

<title>Evolutionary context of SR3G locus reveals its origin in local genome duplication</title>
<p>SR3G sits in what appears to be a tandemly duplicated array of DUF247s along Arabidopsis chromosome 3. The genome-wide identification of SR3G included eight DUF247 paralogs, AT3G50120, AT3G50130, AT3G50140, AT3G50150, AT3G50170, AT3G50180, AT3G50190, and AT3G50200. Reciprocal best BLAST within CoGe’s BLAST tool of these nine DUF247 paralogs against the genomes of seven other Brassicaceae (see <bold>Table S5</bold>) revealed a total of 50 potential orthologs used for downstream analysis. While the copy number of DUF247 loci are similar across the examined species, the noted exceptions are those with recent whole genome duplication events (<italic>Brassica rapa</italic> and <italic>Camelina sativa</italic>). Given these data, it appears that DUF247 loci are commonly tandemly duplicated, although the eight paralogs observed in Arabidopsis represents an extreme case for this gene family.</p>
<p>To examine conservation within the predicted DUF247 functional domains, we generated an amino-acid based multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE. All of the identified DUF247 proteins contained the DUF247 domain near the center of the translated sequence. While partial deletions were identified outside of the DUF247 domain at the C-terminus of a few DUF247s, such as <italic>CARHR159180</italic>, <italic>Csa09g052970</italic>, and <italic>Bra01902</italic>, in general the DUF247 domains were highly conserved across Brassicaceae. The amino acid sequences spanning the “coiled-coil domain” (Amino acid position: Met153-Lys173), putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding domain (Amino acid position: Gly210-Phe372), and super polar fragment (Amino acid position: Ser301-Ile320) were further selected for phylogenetic reconstruction (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). The resulting phylogeny demonstrated that SR3G is sister to a clade containing AT3G50150 and representatives from <italic>C. sativa</italic>, <italic>Capsella rubella,</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, with representative DUF247s from <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>Eutrema salsugineum</italic> serving as a monophyletic outgroup. These data support a hypothesis where SR3G is a recent duplicate (likely A/C Clade specific; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Forsythe, Nelson, and Beilstein 2020</xref>)) of AT3G50150 and that representative SR3G sequences in <italic>C. sativa</italic>, <italic>C. rubella</italic>, and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> have been lost.</p>

<p>Given the specific retention of AT3G50150 in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, we next tested whether this locus is experiencing selection. To test this assumption, we grouped the branches leading to SR3G into four groups (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>: ω0, ω1, ω2, and ω-rest) and then performed a branch-site model A hypothesis test. In our null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>), we hypothesized that all branches have the same selection pressure (H<sub>0</sub>: ω -rest branches = ω0 = ω3 = ω1 = ω2). For our alternative hypothesis, we created five different ω groups to cover scenarios where specific branches may be experiencing selection (See Methods). Based on our analysis, the branch leading to SR3G is experiencing selection (likelihood score = 20625.5, Chi-square derived P value; P = 0.00418). Interestingly, no other branches appeared to be experiencing selection. To pinpoint specific amino acids within SR3G under selection, we performed the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) test, identifying three sites with a posterior probability &gt; 0.90, including 124C (P = 0.992), 206A (P = 0.951), and 209A (P = 0.988).

<title>SR3G relocates from plasma membrane to nucleus/cytosol after removal of its transmembrane domain</title>
<p>SR3G protein is predicted to contain a nuclear localization signal (Lys15-Ala19), a coiled-coil domain (Met153-Lys173), a Ca2<sup>+</sup> binding pocket (Gly210-Phe372), and a trans-membrane domain (Pro469-Thr503) (<bold>Fig. S15</bold>). We generated constitutive expression constructs of full-length <italic>SR3G</italic> gene CDS, and a combination of individual domains (refer to as A, B, and AB domains) to identify their subcellular localization (<bold>Fig. S15</bold>). Fragment A comprised a nuclear localization signal, a coiled-coil domain, and the initial segment of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding pocket, encompassing seven amino acids. Fragment B encompassed the remaining segment of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding pocket. Fragment C only included the transmembrane domain. All constructs contained N-terminal fusion of mVenus. The individual constructs were used in transient expression assay in tobacco leaves. Our result showed that full-length SR3G localizes to the plasma membrane (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>) as its signal overlapped with FM4-64, the plasma membrane marker (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). The SR3G fragments from which the transmembrane domain was excluded—namely fragments A, B, and AB— exhibited localization in both the nucleus and cytosol, resembling the pattern observed with free-GFP localization (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-F</xref></bold>). It is noteworthy that while the signal from fragment A was directed to both the cytosol and nucleus, its intensity was notably stronger in the nucleus (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>), aligning with the prediction that it contains the nuclear localization signal. Together, these findings indicate that the positioning of SR3G within the plasma membrane is due to the transmembrane domain encoded within the fragment C, and its removal could potentially release the protein into both the nucleus and cytosol.</p>

Among these two mutant lines, <italic>SR3G</italic> expression was significantly reduced in the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant compared to Col-0 (<bold>Fig. S16B</bold>), indicating the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> is a knockdown mutant. We did not observe any differences in <italic>SR3G</italic> transcript abundance between <italic>sr3g-4</italic> and Col-0 (<bold>Fig. S16B</bold>). Moreover, we examined the transcript abundance of the closely related gene (i.e., <italic>DUF247-150, At3g50150</italic>) in the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant, and found no significant difference. In the case that <italic>DUF247-150</italic> would act redundantly to <italic>SR3G</italic>, we would expect that the expression of <italic>DUF247-150</italic> would be increased in <italic>SR3G</italic> knockdown mutant. As this is not the case, these results further contribute to the evidence that <italic>SR3G</italic> and <italic>DUF247-150</italic> are not acting redundantly (<bold>Fig. S16C</bold>).</p>
<p>Two T-DNA insertion lines were subsequently studied for salt-induced alterations in root architecture (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Fig. S17 and S18</bold>).

<p>As Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion from the shoot is one of the main mechanisms of salt tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Munns and Tester 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Møller et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julkowska et al. 2017</xref>), we further investigated the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in ion exclusion using plate-grown seedlings. We used root and shoot samples collected for Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant to examine Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> accumulation using ICP-AES at 14 days after exposure to salt stress. While salt stress increased Na<sup>+</sup> and decreased K<sup>+</sup> in all studied samples (<bold>Fig. S17</bold>), we observed no significant differences between Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> accumulations and their corresponding ratio (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>). These results suggest that <italic>SR3G</italic> plays a role in root development under the salt, but does not affect ion accumulation at early developmental stages.</p>
<p>To evaluate the effects of other closely related DUF247 genes on root development, we have investigated the T-DNA insertion lines targeting the neighboring DUF247 genes (AT3G50120, AT3G50130, AT3G50140, AT3G50150, AT3G50170, AT3G50180, AT3G50190, AT3G50200), and RNAi lines targeting one or more DUF247s within the interval (<bold>Table S4, Fig. S19-S23</bold>). For the screened T-DNA insertion lines (<bold>Fig. S19-20</bold>), we have not observed consistent changes in main or lateral root development in either control or salt stress conditions across alleles targeting the same gene. The only exception was <italic>DUF247-200</italic> encoded by AT3G50200, where two out of three studied T-DNA insertion alleles exhibited increased salt tolerance index for main root growth rate (<bold>Fig. S20</bold>).</p>
<p>For the screened RNAi lines (<bold>Table S4, Fig. S21-S23</bold>), we observed the most interesting root architecture phenotypes in lines targeting the neighboring genes of the <italic>SR3G</italic> (RNAi line #04, targeting AT3G50150, RNAi line #16 targeting AT3G50130, <italic>SR3G</italic>, and AT3G50170, and RNAi line #19 targeting AT3G50130, AT3G50140, AT3G50150, <italic>SR3G</italic>, AT3G50170, AT3G50180, and AT3G50190). Three out of five screened independent transformation lines from RNAi line #04 showed a decreased relative main root length (Salt / Control, CSHL #4 B2a, D4a, and G1d), whereas two lines showed a decrease in relative lateral root number (CSHL #4 D4a and F1b), and one line showed decreased lateral root length at 75 mM NaCl (CSHL #4 D4a <bold>Fig. S21-23</bold>). Two out of two independent transformants for RNAi line #16 showed a decreased relative main root length and increased lateral root number at 75 mM NaCl (CSHL #16 A2c and B1a, <bold>Fig. S21-23</bold>). In three of the four screened independent transformants of line #19 we observed an increased lateral root length at 75 mM NaCl (CSHL #19 F1a, I3c, and L1c <bold>Fig. S21-23</bold>). We did not observe strong reduction in lateral root development across RNAi lines targeting two closely related DUF247 genes (i.e., RNAi line #22, targeting AT3G50150 and <italic>SR3G</italic>), as in the single mutant (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, Fig. S21</bold>). The above results further support that these two genes do not act redundantly in the context of lateral root development.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>SR3G</italic> results in increased salt tolerance in soil</title>
<p>To investigate <italic>SR3G’s</italic> contribution to salt stress tolerance beyond seedling stage and agar plate conditions, we evaluated the performance of Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant in soil. We exposed the soil-grown plants to salt stress and imaged the rosette size every 30 minutes for two weeks using the automated imaging platform (L. ’ang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yu et al. 2023</xref>). As salt-induced changes depend on the developmental stage at which the stress is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julkowska et al. 2017</xref>), we examined the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> exposed to salt stress at 2 or 3 weeks after germination, corresponding to early and late vegetative stages.

No significant difference was observed between Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant under control conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref></bold>), indicating that <italic>SR3G</italic> does not play a role in plant development under non-stress condition.

<p>To investigate the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in the maintenance of cellular integrity during salt stress, we evaluated the salt-induced changes in cell membrane integrity by measuring ion leakage in the leaf discs at the end of the experiment (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>). While ion leakage increased significantly in Col-0 under early salt stress conditions, no salt-induced change was observed for <italic>sr3g-5</italic> compared to control condition (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>). Although the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant exhibited increased ion leakage in response to late salt stress, this phenomenon may be more closely associated with the onset of senescence rather than direct exposure to salt stress (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We further explored the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in ion exclusion by quantifying the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions in the rosette at the end of the experiment (4-weeks-old plants). We observed a reduced accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutants compared to Col-0 for plants exposed to salt stress at an earlier timepoint (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref></bold>). No significant differences in Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation was observed between the Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> at the late salt stress regime (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref></bold>).

<title><italic>sr3g</italic> mutant displays enhanced root suberization</title>
<p>As <italic>SR3G</italic> limits shoot growth, promotes cell damage and sodium translocation into shoot (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>), and is expressed in the most inner layers of the root (i.e., stele, <bold>Fig. S13</bold>), we hypothesized that <italic>SR3G</italic> plays a role in the regulation of suberization within the Casparian strips located in the endodermis, the layer adjacent to the stele. Salt stress exposure increases root suberization, thereby limiting Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the transpiration stream and accumulation in the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Baxter et al. 2009</xref>). We examined root suberization patterns in Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> under non-stress and salt stress conditions. Root suberization was visualized using lipophilic stain Fluorol Yellow (FY), and staining intensity was examined under a confocal microscope. Additionally, we examined the developmental transition in root suberization through imaging four regions along the main root (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref></bold>). Visually, we observed that roots of <italic>sr3g-5</italic> were more suberized compared to Col-0 under both control and salt stress conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref></bold>).

Only in root section four, the level of suberization significantly decreased in <italic>sr3g-5</italic> compared to Col-0 (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref></bold>). In plants exposed to salt stress, we observed a non-significant difference between <italic>sr3g-5</italic> and Col-0 throughout the four sections, although, in section one which is the root tip proximal, <italic>sr3g-5</italic> showed more suberization compared to Col-0 (section 1, <bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref></bold>).

Here, we developed a tool that allows a non-destructive quantification of root and shoot projected area of the seedlings grown on agar plates (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). This new tool allows us to efficiently describe changes in biomass accumulation and stress-induced alterations in root and shoot growth. Although the method is restricted to small plants and early developmental stages, it provides valuable insight into stress responses. The application of this tool to an Arabidopsis natural diversity panel revealed that salt stress exposure results in loss of coordination between root and shoot growth (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>), rather than a clear directional change, as in the case of drought. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of changes in root:shoot ratio. The developed tool for quantifying root and shoot size in plate-grown Arabidopsis has the potential to significantly advance research by enabling developmental and stress studies, focusing on coordination of root and shoot development during seedling establishment. Facilitating detailed comparisons of root:shoot ratios, this tool can aid in formulating new hypotheses about the mechanisms contributing to seedling vigor and stress tolerance.</p>
<p>The natural variation in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio revealed a clear association with SNPs on chromosome 3 within <italic>SR3G</italic>, that is situated within a region containing eight other <italic>DUF247</italic> genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). SR3G was previously associated with self-incompatibility in grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lian et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Crain et al. 2020</xref>), as well as with lesions and dwarfism in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kondou et al. 2013</xref>) through constitutive activation of defense responses. However, the <italic>SR3G</italic> associated with constitutive defense response was AT3G60470 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kondou et al. 2013</xref>), which is located outside the interval associated with salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Because we did not observe any consistent phenotypes in the T-DNA insertion lines of <italic>DUF247s</italic> neighboring the <italic>SR3G</italic> (<bold>Fig. S19-20</bold>), we examined the RNAi lines targeting multiple <italic>DUF247s</italic> including <italic>SR3G</italic> (<bold>Fig. S21-23</bold>). Our root system architecture analyses revealed no redundancy between <italic>SR3G</italic> and other DUF247s, and the reduced lateral root development in double mutants of RNAi lines simply mimics the phenotype of <italic>sr3g-5</italic> single mutant (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, Fig. S21</bold>). Further, we demonstrated that only <italic>SR3G</italic> is regulated by <italic>WRKY75</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B-E</xref></bold>). As these genes are result of tandem duplication, they are expected to accumulate a lot of variation in the cis-regulatory regions. Therefore, differential regulation of two closely related genes can be expected by the accumulated variation within the promoter region.</p>
<p>The results acquired in this study provide multiple layers of evidence that support the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> as a negative regulator of salt stress response in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function <italic>SR3G</italic> maintained higher shoot growth rate and larger rosette area when exposed to salt stress in the soil (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref></bold>), probably due to reduced Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref></bold>), which in turn resulted in lower rates of cellular damage (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref></bold>). This increased salt tolerance feature can be explained by the increased root suberization (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>) as suberin-deficient mutants show susceptibility to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barberon et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Ursache et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shukla et al. 2021</xref>). For example, Arabidopsis <italic>CYP86A1/HORST</italic> (At5g58860) encodes a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme that is responsible for catalyzing fatty acid ω-hydroxylation. It plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of aliphatic suberin, particularly expressed in the root endodermis. Knock-out mutations of <italic>CYP86A1/HORST</italic> result in a substantial decrease of approximately 60% in total root suberin (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Li et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Höfer et al. 2008</xref>). Consequently, the diminished aliphatic suberin content in the roots of <italic>cyp86a1</italic> mutants leads to increased permeability to water and solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ranathunge and Schreiber 2011</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>SR3G</italic> expression is enhanced by salt stress (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref>, Fig. S13</bold>), specifically in the root stele (<bold>Fig. S13B</bold>). The root stele encompasses vascular bundles, procambium and pericycle, which gives rise to the secondary growth and lateral root primordia respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Birnbaum et al. 2003</xref>). The stele is central to the systemic transport of water, minerals, and nutrients within the plant (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Li et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ramachandran et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zarebanadkouki et al. 2019</xref>), and to the exclusion of salt ions from the transpiration stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Møller et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The deposition of hydrophobic residues of lignin and suberin in the Casparian strips poses a significant barrier to apoplastic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Foster and Miklavcic 2017</xref>). Previously, silencing genes involved in Casparian strips formation resulted in increased lateral root development (X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al. 2020</xref>). As the suberization of the Casparian strips increases upon salt stress, it limits the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and loss of K<sup>+</sup> ions from the root stele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barberon et al. 2016</xref>). However, the effects of increased root suberization under salt stress have thus far not been described to affect lateral root development. Here, we have identified <italic>SR3G</italic> as a negative regulator of root suberization under salt stress (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref></bold>), which provides an additional layer of protection against sodium accumulation (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref></bold>), but negatively impacts lateral root development (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>As SR3G was previously not described in the context of salt stress, we attempted to identify its molecular context through its transcriptional regulation. Through our <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis, we have identified <italic>WRKY75</italic> as a putative regulator of <italic>SR3G</italic> expression, and confirmed it using RT-qPCR and Y1H assay (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref></bold>). WRKY75 was previously described to act as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance through activation of <italic>SOS1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lu et al. 2023</xref>). Similar to previous study, we also observed <italic>wrky75</italic> mutants to be more sensitive to salt stress within our experiments (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A-C</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, when the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutation was coupled with <italic>sr3g-5</italic>, the roots displayed a phenotype identical to Col-0 (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref></bold>), implying that the salt sensitivity of the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant was counteracted by the <italic>SR3G</italic> mutation. Considering <italic>WRKY75’s</italic> role in positively regulating <italic>SOS1</italic> expression during salt stress, it is plausible that its binding to the <italic>SR3G</italic> promoter inhibits its expression, thereby enhancing salt tolerance on a larger scale.</p>
<p>One of the main players in Na<sup>+</sup> transport is High-affinity K<sup>+</sup> Transporter (HKT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Laurie et al. 2002</xref>). HKT1 is expressed in root stele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mäser et al. 2002</xref>), where it retrieves Na<sup>+</sup> from the transpiration stream and limits ion accumulation in the shoot, resulting in higher salt stress tolerance at later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Møller et al. 2009</xref>). At early developmental stages, <italic>HKT1</italic> overexpression reduces the development of lateral root primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julkowska et al. 2017</xref>), thus creating less Na<sup>+</sup> entry gate into the main root, resulting in less Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in shoot. Similarly, <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutants developed fewer lateral roots that are consistent with the lower Na<sup>+</sup> levels in the root upon salt stress (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). The effects of HKT1 and SR3G differ in the magnitude of repression of lateral root development, with HKT1 mutants resulting in almost complete cessation of lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julkowska et al. 2017</xref>), whereas repression of SR3G function has much more subtle phenotype. Whereas the effect of cell-type specific overexpression of HKT1 on plant performance was negative during the early developmental stage, due to impairing lateral root development, the <italic>sr3g</italic> mutants showed increased salt tolerance when exposed to salt stress treatment during their early vegetative growth (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>). These results suggest that reduced lateral root development under salt stress can have a gradient of responses leading to increased and decreased salt tolerance, and the effect is highly dependent on the wider physiological mechanisms, and their contributions to ion exclusion and maintained plant development throughout salt stress exposure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study of salt-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio, alongside the development of new tools to quantify these changes during the seedling establishment stage, represents an important new perspective into mechanisms underlying salt stress tolerance. Identification of SR3G as a novel regulator of root suberization, shoot growth, and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation provides better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to salt stress, but also offers a new avenue to explore more nuanced and tissue-specific strategies for enhancing salt stress tolerance.</p>

    <caption><p><bold>Table S1. The individual traits recorded and calculated from the HapMap accessions exposed to the three different levels of salt stress.</bold> The root and shoot projected area were quantified using a custom developed tool. The change in the root and shoot area over time was used to calculate Growth Factor (GF) by fitting an exponential function. The broad sense heritability (H2) was calculated for each trait over individual days and conditions using MVApp.</p>
        <p><bold>Table S2. Genotypic mean data used as an input for GWAS.</bold> The genotypic mean data was calculated from at least 4 biological replicates per genotype per condition. The root and shoot area were extracted using a custom developed tool. The Growth Factors (GF) for root and shoot were calculated using exponential growth function. Total seedling slze (Tot) was calculated by adding root and shoot area for individual day. Shoot per Total (SpT) ratio was calculated for individual days by dividing genotype specific shoot area by the total seedling area for that day and condition. Root per Shoot ratio (RpS) was calculated by dividing genotype specific root area by the shoot area for that day and condition.</p>
        <p><bold>Table S3. Significant associations identified with GWAS of all used traits.</bold> The location of individual SNPs is listed according to its location on Chromosome (Chr) and position (Pos). The individual SNP Minor Allele Count (MAC) and Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) is calculated based on specific SNP set used (4 Million or 250 Thousand – listed in “Mapping” column). The traits associated with individual SNPs are abbreviated as RpS for Root-per-Shoot, SpT for Shoot-per-Total seedling area, Tot for Total seedling area, GR for growth rate and SHIIT for Shoot Ion Independent Tolerance index (Salt / Control).</p>

<p>Through cellular, developmental, and physiological analysis, this <bold>valuable</bold> study identifies a gene that functions to regulate the relative growth of roots and shoots under salt stress. The holistic approach taken provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence that this gene, a member of a larger tandemly duplicated gene family initially highlighted by association mapping, as well as an upstream regulator contribute to salt tolerance. More robust statistical or biological support for some conclusions could further strengthen this manuscript. The manuscript will be of interest to plant biologists studying mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance and gene family evolution.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to assess the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio, identify the underlying genetic mechanisms, and evaluate their contribution to salt tolerance. To this end, the authors systematically quantified natural variations in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio. This innovative approach considers the coordination of root and shoot growth rather than exploring biomass and the development of each organ separately. Using this approach, the authors identified a gene cluster encoding eight paralog genes with a domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with the majority of SNPs clustering into SR3G (At3g50160). In the manuscript, the authors utilized an integrative approach that includes genomic, genetic, evolutionary, histological, and physiological assays to functionally assess the contribution of their genes of interest to salt tolerance and root development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The holistic approach and integrative methodologies presented in the manuscript are essential for gaining a mechanistic understanding of a complex trait such as salt tolerance. The authors focused on At3g50160 but included in their analyses additional DUF247 paralogs, which further contributes to the strength of their approach. In addition, the authors considered the developmental stage (young seedlings, early or late vegetative stages) and growth conditions of the plants (agar plates or soil) when investigating the role of SR3G in salt tolerance and root or shoot development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors' claims and interpretation of the results are not fully supported by the data and analyses. In several cases, the authors report differences that are not statistically significant (e.g., Figures 4A, 7C, 8B, S14, S16B, S17C), use inappropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test instead of Dunnett Test/ANOVA as in Figures 10B-C, S19-23), present standard errors that do not seem to be consistent with the post-hoc Tukey HSD Test (e.g., Figures 4, 9B-C, S16B), or lack controls (e.g., Figure 5C-E, staining of the truncated versions with FM4-64 is missing).</p>
<p>In other cases, traits of root system architecture and expression patterns are inconsistent between different assays despite similar growth conditions (e.g., Figures S17A-B vs. 10A-C vs. 6A, and Figures S16B vs. 4A/9B), or T-DNA insertion alleles of WRKY75 that are claimed to be loss-of-function show comparable expression of WRKY75 as WT plants. Additionally, several supplemental figures are mislabeled (Figures S6-9), and some figure panels are missing (e.g., Figures S16C and S17E).</p>
<p>Consequently, the authors' decisions regarding subsequent functional assays, as well as major conclusions about gene function, including SR3G function in root system architecture, involvement in root suberization, and regulation of cellular damage are incomplete.</p>

<p>Salt stress is a significant and growing concern for agriculture in some parts of the world. While the effects of sodium excess have been studied in Arabidopsis and (many) crop species, most studies have focused on Na uptake, toxicity, and overall effects on yield, rather than on developmental responses to excess Na, per se. The work by Ishka and colleagues aims to fill this gap.</p>
<p>Working from an existing dataset that exposed a diverse panel of A. thaliana accessions to control, moderate, and severe salt stress, the authors identify candidate loci associated with altering the root:shoot ratio under salt stress. Following a series of molecular assays, they characterize a DUF247 protein which they dub SR3G, which appears to be a negative regulator of root growth under salt stress.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-executed study that demonstrates the functional role played by a single gene in plant response to salt stress in Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>The abstract and beginning of the Discussion section highlight the &quot;new tool&quot; developed here for measuring biomass accumulation. I feel that this distracts from the central aims of the study, which is really about the role of a specific gene in root development under salt stress. I would suggest moving the tool description to less prominent parts of the manuscript.</p>
