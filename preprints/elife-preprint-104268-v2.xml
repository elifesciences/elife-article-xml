<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The mycobacterial cytoskeletal protein Wag31 is necessary for maintaining cell shape and directing cellular growth and elongation. Wag31 has a characteristic N-terminal DivIVA-domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. While the role of Wag31 in polar elongation is known, there is limited mechanistic insight on how it orchestrates growth and elongation. In this report, we delineate roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of Wag31 using genetics, state-of-the-art multi-omics, biochemical, and imaging approaches. We show that Wag31 predominantly interacts with several membrane-associated proteins involved in lipid metabolism, cell wall synthesis and division. Native levels of Wag31 are critical for the maintenance and distribution of membrane lipids. Both depletion and overexpression of Wag31 perturbs lipid homeostasis, leading to the formation of intracellular lipid inclusions (ILIs). Protein-lipid crosslinking and imaging studies reveal that purified Wag31 can bind and effectively tether Cardiolipin (CL)-containing liposomes. We further show that the tethering activity lies in the DivIVA-domain containing N-terminal of Wag31 while the C-terminal mediates protein-protein interactions of Wag31. Despite retaining its ability to interact with partner proteins, the DivIVA domain-deleted Wag31 mutant shows defects in liposome tethering <italic>in vitro</italic> and non-polar localization of CL <italic>in vivo</italic>, which eventually causes lethality. Our study suggests that membrane tethering ‘licenses’ Wag31 to form scaffolds that help orchestrate protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions necessary for mycobacterial growth and survival.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>a. Including a negative control for the pull-down experiments to validate the interaction.
We have included two non-interactors of Wag31 i.e. MmpL4 and MmpS5 which were
not identified in our interactome database as negative controls in the experiment. We performed
His pull-down experiments with both of them independently twice, each time with a positive
control (known interactor of Wag31 (Msm2092)). The data presented in (revised Fig. S3d.)
confirms that the interactions validated through the pull-down assay were indeed specific.
b. Performing pull-down experiments using N-terminal 60 aa of Wag31 as bait.
To rule out the role of the N-terminal in mediating protein-protein interactions, we
cloned the N-terminal of Wag31 that comprises the DivIVA-domain (Wag31DC) and expressed
in E. coli. We performed his-pull down experiments with MurG, SepIVA, Msm2092, AccA3 and
a negative control (non-interactor) MmpS5. As shown in Fig. 7d revised, His-Wag31 could bind
to all four interactors whereas His-Wag31DC could not, strengthening the conclusion that
interactions of Wag31 with other proteins are mediated by its C-terminal. However, we can not
ignore the possibility of other interactors binding to the N-terminal of Wag31. Unfortunately, due
to poor expression/instability of Wag31DC in mycobacterial shuttle vectors, we are unable to
perform a global interactome analysis.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell division is a critical event in the life of a bacterium as it is the prime mode of bacterial growth and reproduction. Hence, the process of their division is tightly knitted. The key process in bacterial cell division, i.e., assembly of the FtsZ ring at the mid-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), is tightly regulated by the Min and Nucleoid occlusion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Mycobacterium, which comprises clinically relevant pathogens-<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium leprae,</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> lacks both the regulators of FtsZ ring placement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Instead, they encode for a DivIVA protein, usually encoded by Firmicutes and other Actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). It is necessary that the bacterial shape, crucial for normal cellular physiology, is maintained during cell division. Rod-shaped bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> encode MreB and multiple MreB-like proteins that sustain the rod morphology of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). <italic>Mycobacterial spp</italic>. lack MreB homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The DivIVA protein of <italic>Mtb</italic> called Wag31 is known to regulate both cellular growth and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), which makes it an exciting candidate to investigate.</p>
<p>DivIVA proteins were discovered three decades ago during the study of cell division mutants of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). DivIVA proteins are rich in coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), which enable them to form higher oligomeric structures and, hence, scaffolds, making them suitable adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). They are known to play diverse roles in various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), e.g., they play dual roles of septum positioning and chromosome partitioning in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>); cell-separation/resolution post-cell-division in <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>); pole formation and maturation in <italic>Streptococcus spp</italic>. (Fadda, 2007) In <italic>Mycobacterium spp.</italic>, Wag31 is an essential protein that senses negative membrane curvature found at poles and septum and localizes there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). It plays roles in cellular elongation and septation in concert with other divisome and elongasome components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). It is specifically found in higher amounts at the old pole, where it directs polar elongation by recruiting the acyl CoA carboxylase (ACCase) complex involved in fatty acid, mycolic acid, and methyl-branched chain lipid precursor synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). It localizes to the septum after cytokinesis is over, perhaps for septal synthesis via its interactions with FtsI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), though the process remains largely unknown. Consequently, loss of Wag31 leads to cell division defects-loss of polar elongation, which renders the cells ‘round’ in shape that occurs due to affected peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Though Wag31 participates in coordinating PG metabolism, the mechanism or the protein network by which it does so remains unknown.</p>
<p>Wag31 has also been associated with the maintenance of the intracellular membrane domain (IMD), a specialized compartment for lipid synthesis, localized predominantly at the old pole in consonance with pole elongation and spottily all around the plasma membrane where it may function to repair membrane defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The loss of Wag31 leads to the delocalization of IMD and its protein markers, such as MurG and GlfT2, but it is not understood whether Wag31 plays a direct role in membrane-partitioning or it is just a consequence of localized membrane synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The role of Wag31in PG and lipid synthesis that drives cell division remains unclear. Despite numerous studies, the details of how Wag31 orchestrates mega-complexes at the pole or partitions the membrane into two to govern cellular elongation remain elusive.</p>
<p>Here, we endeavoured to address the lacunae in the functionality of Wag31 by asking the following questions- i) what are the ultrastructural changes that occur in mycobacteria due to the absence of Wag31, ii) do Wag31 deficient cells undergo transcriptional rewiring to adjust to cell division defects, iii) is the change in cellular morphology from ‘rod-to-round’ accompanied by altered lipid levels, iv) what is the interactome of Wag31, v) what are the functions of its N and C-terminal domains and finally vi) what is its relationship with the mycobacterial membrane. The present study shows that Wag31 levels are critical for maintaining lipid homeostasis in mycobacteria. Our results demonstrate that the N- and C-terminals of Wag31 have distinct functions. The N-terminal of Wag31 binds and tethers the membrane together while the C-terminal interacts with various proteins. Together, the domains help Wag31 to orchestrate membrane-localized processes essential for maintaining normal cellular morphology and physiology.</p>

<title>Loss of Wag31 leads to the formation of intracellular lipid inclusions (ILIs)</title>
<p>In the pursuit of bridging the knowledge gap existing in the functionality of Wag31 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), we generated a <italic>Wag31</italic> conditional mutant in <italic>Msm</italic>, by integrating a copy of <italic>wag31</italic> under tetracycline (ATc- tet off) regulation at the L5 locus and replacing the native copy with a hygromycin cassette (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1a</xref>). The mutant, <italic>Δwag31</italic>, thus generated, was confirmed by PCRs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1b</xref>) and Western blotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). The lack of Wag31 led to a drop in the turbidity of culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Analysis of bacillary survival <italic>in vitro</italic> by enumerating CFUs 12h post-ATc addition, revealed a 2 log fold difference in the survival of <italic>Δwag31</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Given the essential role of Wag31 in causing polar growth of the cell, we investigated the effect of depletion of Wag31 on bacterial cellular morphology using electron microscopy (EM). Scanning EM (SEM) suggested that the absence of Wag31 caused a transition in the morphology of the cells from rod to round, as previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Apart from round morphology (∼36 %), we also observed a rod-to-round transformation stage in which cells were bulged at one pole with the other pole intact (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e-g</xref>). To obtain detailed insights, we performed transmission EM (TEM), which divulges information on the internal structure of cells. We discovered spherical, electron-lucent bodies (indicated by an arrowhead in Fig.1h) in the cytosol of all the samples. While <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Δwag31</italic>- ATc harbored a few (∼2-3) electron-lucent bodies, their numbers were drastically higher in the case of <italic>Δwag31</italic>+ATc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). The cytosol of <italic>Δwag31</italic>+ATc was filled with multiple variable-sized bodies which resembled Lipid bodies that <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb)</italic> accumulates inside the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). As the term ‘lipid bodies/lipid droplets’ is used specifically for the lipids acquired by <italic>Mtb</italic> from the host cell, we referred to them as intracellular lipid inclusions (ILIs). We categorized the cells based on the number of ILIs they contained. Their distribution remained reasonably similar within <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Δwag31</italic>-ATc cells for all the classes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). Whereas <italic>Δwag31</italic> treated with ATc had as high as 85% cells harboring more than 5 ILIs and very few cells with less than 5 ILIs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1i</xref>). Our data, therefore, reports a novel observation of lipid accumulation when Wag31 is depleted from mycobacteria.</p>

<title>Wag31 levels influence lipid homeostasis</title>
<p>Next, we set out to analyze if the ILIs are indeed lipidic in nature by staining cells with BODIPY (493/503), a dye that preferentially partitions into neutral lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). We stained either untreated or ATc-treated <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Δwag31</italic> with BODIPY and visualized them on a microscope. ATc- treated <italic>Δwag31</italic> cells displayed the highest level of BODIPY fluorescence, indicating the maximum abundance of lipid bodies among the three strains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, c</xref>). Further, we examined whether the appearance of ILIs is associated just with the loss of Wag31 or is a consequence of deviations from the native expression level of Wag31. Towards this, we overexpressed Wag31 episomally using an isovaleronitrile (IVN) inducible system (<italic>Msm::wag31</italic>) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2a</xref>) and stained the cells with BODIPY. Unlike Wag31 depletion, which resulted in spherical cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), Wag31 overexpression resulted in the bulging of cells from one pole (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Additionally, the overexpression of Wag31 also led to lipid aggregates in the cell with a few larger ‘donut-like’ aggregates in the bulged pole (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b,d</xref>).</p>

<p>Lipid accumulation in both cases led us to inspect whether lipid metabolism is closely tied to Wag31 expression levels in mycobacteria. To investigate that possibility, total cellular lipids were extracted from <italic>Msm,</italic> Wag31 depletion, and overexpression conditions and subjected to semi-quantitative LC-MS analysis (illustrated in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Lipidomic analysis of <italic>Δwag31</italic>+ATc revealed an imbalance in the levels of neutral lipids, phospholipids, and free fatty acids in comparison to <italic>Msm</italic>-ATc (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f-g</xref>). <italic>Δwag31</italic>+ATc cells had a significant accumulation of unsaturated diacylglycerols (∼3-5 fold) and a very long chain containing (&gt;C36) phosphatidylethanolamines (∼5-32 fold). This was accompanied by increased levels of different chain lengths (C18-C24) of free fatty acids (∼1.7-4 fold) and reduced levels of cardiolipins C70:0 &amp; C70:1 (∼3 fold). Wag31 overexpression, on the other hand, led to a 2-fold increase in the level of different species of alpha-mycolic acids (C74-C78) as compared to <italic>Msm</italic>+IVN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>), while other tested lipids remained unchanged (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Altogether, the results presented above demonstrate that Wag31 levels are crucial for maintaining lipid homeostasis in mycobacteria, the depletion and overexpression of which impact lipid metabolism differently.</p>

<title>Molecular interactions of Wag31 with membrane-associated proteins govern cellular homeostasis</title>
<p>We reasoned that Wag31, an adaptor protein, might maintain lipid homeostasis by interacting with proteins involved in these pathways. To examine the protein interaction network of Wag31, we performed an interactome analysis by utilizing <italic>Δwag31</italic>, which expresses FLAG-Wag31 integrated at the L5 locus, and used FLAG-GFP as the control to differentiate from non-specific interactions. FLAG- Wag31 and FLAG-GFP from biological triplicates were immunoprecipitated using whole cell lysates from the log phase cells and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3a</xref> &amp; Table S2). This study identified both direct and indirect protein-partners of Wag31. The proteins identified were categorized based on their functions. It was found that Wag31 interacts with proteins involved in cell-wall elongation and division, lipid metabolism, intermediary metabolism and respiration and information pathways (translation, replication) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Interactions of Wag31 with AccA3 and AccD5, subunits of the ACCase complex, and Rne or RNaseE (Msm4626), a membrane-associated protein, have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Subunits of ACCase complex and Rne were among the top 5 hits in our MS/MS data, validating our approach (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, marked with asterisk). The classification of the top 20 hits is represented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>. The highest number of protein interactors, expectedly, fell in the cell wall and cell processes category (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). For the present study, we focussed on the interactors found in the cell wall elongation and cell division and lipid metabolism functional categories to probe the cause behind the lipid dysbiosis phenotype.</p>

Msm1813, or acyl CoA carboxylase (ACAD), crucial for nascent fatty acid precursor synthesis, was also enriched in the interactome. Other lipid metabolism interactors of Wag31 included acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Msm2080), involved in lipid catabolism; GpsA, involved in phospholipid biosynthesis; and Msm0372, involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. To validate the high-throughput data, we chose MurG, SepIVA and Msm2092 and performed pull-down assays with His-tagged Wag31. MmpL4 and MmpS5 which didn’t appear in the interactome database were used as negative controls in this experiment. His-tagged Wag31 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) was incubated with <italic>Msm</italic> lysates expressing 3X-FLAG tagged versions of the interactors and non-interactors mentioned above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) and pulled-down with the help of cobalt beads followed by a western blot analysis. Results obtained confirmed the interaction of Wag31 with MurG, SepIVA and Msm2092, but not with the MmpL4 and MmpS5, thus validating our data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>
<p>Since Wag31 is a spatiotemporal regulator of other proteins, we were intrigued to discover the localisation of its interacting partners. We used the data curated by Zhu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) and determined that Wag31 majorly interacts with membrane-associated proteins with a few exceptions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3b</xref>). The mycobacterial plasma membrane has been recently shown to have a cell wall-associated compartment called PM-CW and a cell wall-free compartment called PM<sub>f</sub> or IMD, which is the site for lipid synthesis. Based on the available data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), we found that Wag31 interacts more with IMD- proteins than with PM-CW proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>.) In accordance with assigned roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), PM-CW residing proteins in the interactome are involved in cell wall and cell processes and intermediary metabolism and respiration. Similarly, IMD-homing proteins clustered in the lipid metabolism and cell wall synthesis category. These results suggest that Wag31 maintains lipid homeostasis and cellular morphology primarily through its interactions with the membrane proteins participating in such pathways.</p>

<title>Wag31 binds and tethers cardiolipin-containing membranes</title>
<p>Wag31 is a cytoplasmic protein that recognizes negative curvature regions in the cell, i.e., poles and septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). It also forms higher-order structural assemblies at the poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). However, the precise mechanism by which Wag31 assemblies localize to the poles remains elusive. The predominant interactions of Wag31 with membrane-associated proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) were intriguing and led us to investigate if it can directly bind to membranes. We reasoned that such membrane binding activity might render it capable of acting as a scaffold that anchors and organizes other proteins, thereby modulating their functions. To test this, we performed a lipid crosslinking-based PLiMAP assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Purified Wag31 was incubated with ∼100 nm extruded liposomes containing each of the abundant classes of bacterial lipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), or cardiolipin (CL). Liposomes contained trace amounts of a reactive fluorescent lipid (RFL), which crosslinks with membrane-bound proteins upon photoactivation. These assays revealed that Wag31 preferentially binds CL- but not PG- or PE-containing liposomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Both CL and PG are anionic lipids, and the preferential binding of Wag31 to CL indicates that the binding cannot be attributed to a charge-based interaction. Remarkably, the sensitive fluorescence-based detection revealed the presence of SDS- resistant higher-order oligomers of membrane-bound Wag31 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>).</p>

<p>Wag31 is a homolog of the DivIVA protein from <italic>B. subtilis.</italic> The latter has been shown to bind to the membrane via the N-terminal DivIVA domain (N-DivIVA<sub>BS</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). However, the functional significance of the N- &amp; C- terminal domains of mycobacterial Wag31 has not been dissected. Considering that the Wag31 N-terminal region shares 42% sequence identity with N-DivIVA<sub>BS</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), we sought to inspect the effect of disruption of a particular residue (K20) in the N-terminus and the deletion of the entire N-terminus, encompassing the DivIVA domain (1-60 amino acids) on membrane binding (Fig. S5a). The K20 residue lies within a positively charged patch, which likely constitutes a membrane-associating surface in the intertwined loop region of Wag31(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Moreover, mutating the K20 residue has been shown to decrease the cell length and elongation rate by 18% and 22%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The K20A mutation showed a marginal defect in binding to CL-liposomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c-d</xref>), indicating that K20 alone is insufficient for membrane binding. However, Wag31<sub>K20A</sub> showed a marked defect in forming SDS-resistant higher-order oligomers, as seen in the binding assays. Interestingly, deletion of the entire N-terminal domain caused a significant defect in both membrane binding and forming SDS- resistant higher-order oligomers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c-d</xref>). Surprisingly, binding was not entirely abolished, suggesting that the C-terminus of Wag31 may also contribute to membrane binding. Taken together, our results indicate that Wag31 preferentially binds CL-containing membranes and that regions other than the N- terminal domain contribute to membrane binding. The latter feature distinguishes Wag31 from DivIVA<sub>BS,</sub> and Wag31 likely contains membrane binding sites located at both the N- and C-terminal regions, which might lead to differences in the manner in which it interacts with the membrane and partner proteins compared to DivIVA<sub>BS</sub>.</p>
<p>To further confirm membrane binding, we imaged 100 nm-extruded CL-containing liposomes with a membrane dye DiI in the presence of Wag31. We used a GFP-tagged Wag31 mixed with an untagged Wag31 at a 1:10 molar ratio for these experiments. In the absence of Wag31-GFP, liposomes appeared as faint but distinct fluorescent puncta (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, first panel). Surprisingly, in reactions containing Wag31-GFP, we observed liposomes clustered into bright fluorescent puncta that were positive for Wag31-GFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, remaining panels). The Wag31 tetramer has been modelled as a long rod-shaped protein filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) and such clustering of liposomes falls in congruence with the model. It indicates that these long filaments of Wag31 act to tether liposomes. We then systematically evaluated this effect by testing liposomes of different compositions and Wag31 mutants. Again, in the absence of Wag31, both PE- and CL-containing liposomes appeared as faint but distinct fluorescent puncta (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). The addition of Wag31 caused clustering of CL-containing liposomes into bright foci (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>), which is quantified by a particle intensity analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). This clustering was caused by membrane binding of Wag31 because PE-containing liposomes that do not bind Wag31 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) showed no clustering (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f,g</xref>). As expected, Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub> was defective in membrane binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref>) and showed a severe tethering capacity defect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f,g</xref>). Surprisingly, Wag31<sub>K20A,</sub> which showed a marginal defect in membrane binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c,d</xref>), showed a marked defect in tethering capacity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f,g</xref>). Together, these results suggest that membrane-binding and membrane-tethering are non-overlapping attributes in the structure of Wag31, and the N-terminal DivIVA-domain is indispensable for membrane-tethering activity.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Tethering is crucial for the survival of mycobacteria</title>
<p>Results presented in Fig.4c indicate that Wag31 binds strongly to CL-containing membranes. CL is a negatively charged inverted cone-shaped lipid that has been shown to be concentrated at the sites of negative curvature in the bacterial cell, i.e., pole and septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Wag31 has been demonstrated previously to localize at sites of negative curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Their similar localization pattern, coupled with Wag31’s affinity to bind to CL, led us to examine the effect of this binding <italic>in vivo</italic>. We hypothesized that modulations in Wag31 levels might alter CL distribution in the cell.</p>
<p>To examine this, we utilized a fluorophore 10-N-Nonyl-acridine orange (NAO) that is widely used to examine the localization of CL in prokaryotes and in the mitochondria of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). NAO binds to anionic phospholipids with an affinity constant of 7 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> and to CL with an affinity constant of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). We stained <italic>Msm and</italic> Wag31 depleted and overexpressing cells with NAO and imaged them using a fluorescence microscope. While the localization pattern of NAO was polar in <italic>Msm</italic>+ATc and <italic>Δwag31</italic>-ATc, there was a redistribution of red fluorescence to the cytosol and along the perimeter of the cell in <italic>Δwag31</italic>+ATc (Fig.5a-b). We quantified the distribution of fluorescence using a line profile which yielded peaks of intensity at the poles and a basal level of fluorescence along the lateral cell body for both <italic>Msm</italic>+ATc and <italic>Δwag31</italic>-ATc (Fig.5b). Wag31 overexpression also led to a change in the distribution of NAO from the poles and septum to ‘donut-like’ fluorescent foci in the cytosol (Fig.5c-d). As the affinity of NAO for CL is more than other anionic phospholipids and our result (shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) indicate that Wag31 prefers to bind CL over PG (another negatively charged phospholipid), the change in the distribution of NAO fluorescence implies that the loss or overexpression of Wag31 causes the mislocalization of CL in mycobacterium.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we investigated the impact of tethering-deficient Wag31 mutants on cell survival. Wag31 has an N-terminal domain joined to the C-terminal via a linker region. The N-terminal domain contains a positively charged patch in the intertwined region (the region between two helices in the N- terminus) and membrane binding has been attributed to this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). This patch is lined with conserved arginine and lysine residues, K15, K20, and R21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). As our <italic>in vitro</italic> results suggest the importance of K20 and the DivIVA-domain in tethering, we performed complementation assays with the tethering-defective mutants to examine cell survival and morphology. <italic>Δwag31</italic> was complemented with an integrative copy of either Wag31 or Wag31<sub>K20A</sub> or Wag31<sub>ΔN.</sub> <italic>Δwag31+</italic>ATc showed a two log-fold difference in survival and a 40 % decrease in the percentage of rod-shaped cells compared with <italic>Δwag31-</italic>ATc (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f-g</xref>). Complementation with Wag31 and Wag31<sub>K20A</sub> rescued the loss of cell viability and restored the rod shape of the cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f-g</xref>), whereas Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub> behaved similar to <italic>Δwag31+</italic>ATc. It neither restored the rod shape of the cells nor reversed the survival defect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f-g</xref>). These results highlight the importance of the N-terminal DivIVA-domain for sustaining mycobacterial morphology and survival.</p>

<title>Tethering is correlated to lipid levels and CL localization in mycobacteria</title>
<p>As described above, Wag31-mediated membrane tethering is an absolute for the survival of mycobacteria. Perturbations in lipid homeostasis and mislocalization of CL due to altered Wag31 levels hint at a correlation between its ability to function as a homotypic tether and maintain lipid composition and localization. To derive the mechanism behind it, we performed fluorescence imaging experiments with native and tethering defective mutants of Wag31. To investigate a role of tethering in lipid homeostasis in mycobacteria, we stained wildtype and complementation strains with BODIPY and quantified the fluorescence intensities. We observed comparable staining intensity in <italic>Msm</italic> +ATc and, <italic>Δwag31 -</italic>ATc (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-b</xref>). <italic>Δwag31+</italic>ATc expectedly had the highest BODIPY staining intensity, indicating higher than normal lipid levels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-b</xref>). Complementation with Wag31 fully restored the lipid levels to normal, whereas complementation with Wag31<sub>K20A</sub> couldn’t restore the lipid levels completely (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-b</xref>). Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub> exhibited higher lipid levels than <italic>Δwag31-</italic>ATc (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-b</xref>). These results highlight that the maintenance of lipid homeostasis by Wag31 is a consequence of its tethering activity.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the dependence of CL localisation on tethering by staining <italic>Msm</italic> +ATc, <italic>Δwag31 -</italic>ATc<italic>, Δwag31+</italic>ATc, <italic>Δwag31::wag31+</italic>ATc<italic>, Δwag31::wag31<sub>K20A</sub>+</italic>ATc, and <italic>Δwag31:: wag31<sub>ΔN</sub> +</italic>ATc with NAO. NAO staining showed a polar and septal (in dividing cells) localization pattern in the case of <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Δwag31-</italic>ATc, whereas it stained the cytosol and perimeter of the Wag31 depleted cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). Complementation with Wag31 restored NAO localization completely, whereas Wag31<sub>K20A</sub> restored it partially, which could be attributed to its limited tethering activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). Importantly, we observed a mis-localized pattern of NAO with Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub> similar to Wag31 depletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). These results inform of the dependence of CL localization on membrane tethering activity of Wag31. Taken together, the data suggests the importance of the N-terminal region of Wag31 in regulating lipid homeostasis and localization.</p>

<title>The N and C-terminal domains of Wag31 have distinct functions</title>
<p>Wag31 is a 272 amino-acids long protein that contains an N- and a C-terminal domain that are joined by a linker region (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). In this report, we established a role for the N-terminal region of Wag31 that comprises DivIVA-domain in membrane-tethering (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

<p>We performed His pull-down assays utilizing <italic>E. coli</italic> lysates expressing either Wag31 or Wag31<sub>ΔC</sub> or Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b, e</xref>). These lysates were mixed and incubated with <italic>Msm</italic> lysates expressing 3x-FLAG tagged versions of the above-mentioned proteins (Fig.7c, f) in separate reactions and subsequently pulled-down with Cobalt beads. The western blot analysis revealed that all the tested interactors bound to Wag31 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d, g</xref>). Expectedly, MmpS5, being a non-interactor of Wag31 did not bind to it (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>, none of the interactors bound to Wag31<sub>ΔC</sub>, indicating that the presence of N-terminal DivIVA-domain is not sufficient to enable Wag31 to interact with other proteins. Interestingly, interactions with all the proteins were retained in the case of Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g</xref>), thus suggesting that Wag31 interacts with other proteins via its C-terminal. Taken together, the results suggest that the N-terminal region of Wag31 is involved in membrane-tethering through interactions with CL, and the C-terminal region is involved in modulating interactions with other membrane-associated proteins. Thus N-terminal and C-terminal of Wag31 have distinct molecular functions that together are crucial for maintaining cell shape, lipid homeostasis and survival of mycobacteria.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Wag31 modulates mycobacterial cell division by acting as an adaptor protein that recruits the elongation machinery to the old pole for unipolar growth of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In the absence of Wag31, rod-shaped cells advance into a spheroplast-like stage, which is thought to arise from dysregulated PG metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Recently, Wag31 has been implicated in maintaining the lipid-rich IMD compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). But the molecular mechanisms by which Wag31 manages these functions has remained unclear. In this study, we discover an additional function of Wag31 as a membrane tether, which likely reconciles many of the previously ascribed functions of this protein into a unified model. To gain insights into defects associated with a change in cell shape, we imaged Wag31-deficient cells and found a dramatic accumulation of lipids in the form of ILIs. Interestingly, both <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>ΔWag31</italic>-ATc showed the presence of ILIs, but in much less abundance, indicating that ILIs are a normal occurrence that may function to regulate cellular functions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g-h</xref>).</p>
<p>The loss of Wag31 leads to the accumulation of neutral lipids while its overexpression increase the levels of alpha-mycolic acids (α-MA), implying that the maintenance of native Wag31 levels is critical for the proper balance of lipid composition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f-h</xref>). The lipid classes that get impacted by the depletion of Wag31 vs overexpression are different. Wag31 is an adaptor protein that interacts with proteins of the ACCase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) that synthesize fatty acid precursors and regulate their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The varied response on lipid homeostasis could be attributed to a change in the stoichiometry of these interactions of Wag31. While Wag31 depletion would prevent such interactions from occurring and might affect lipid synthesis that directly depends on Wag31-protein partner interactions, its overexpression would lead to promiscuous interactions and a change in the stoichiometry of native interactions that would ultimately modulate lipid synthesis pathways.</p>
<p>A protein’s interactome is akin to its functional fingerprint. Here, we identify 116 novel interacting partners of Wag31 through mass spectrometry and validate three of these interactions, namely with MurG, SepIVA and Msm2092, through pull-down studies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5i</xref>). Strikingly, the bulk of Wag31 interactors are membrane proteins, which might be attributed to the formation of Wag31 oligomers on the membrane. Our results identify MurG, SepIVA, which regulates MurG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), the D- aminopeptidase Msm2092 and AmiB, both of which are PG remodellers, as Wag31 interactors. Together, these results contribute towards our understanding of how Wag31 affects PG synthesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a,d</xref>). AccA3 is an interactor of Wag31 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) and catalyses the first committed step in the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids by forming malonyl-CoA. In addition, Long-chain specific acyl dehydrogenase (LCAD), which we report here to be another interactor of Wag31, catalyses the first step in the β- oxidation of fatty acids, which might explain the accumulation of long chain PEs and long-chain fatty acids.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the overexpression of Wag31 leads to an upregulation in α-MA levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>). The localization of the α-MA transporter MmpL3 depends on polar PG levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). MurG is an essential enzyme for PG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) and we report here that it strongly interacts with Wag31 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,d</xref>). It is tempting to hypothesize that homeostatic control on lipid composition arises from the ability of Wag31 to modulate the activity of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism and PG synthesis. That both depletion and overexpression of Wag31 affects lipid composition is likely also a manifestation of its ability to function as a homotypic tether, where the tethering ability is inherently sensitive to the tether concentration.</p>
<p>Our results are the first to establish a membrane tethering function of Wag31. DivIVA proteins possess an N-terminal membrane-binding domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Our data show that disruption of the N-terminal domain (Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub>) markedly reduces membrane binding and completely abolishes membrane tethering (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f, g</xref>). The N-terminal domain binds CL while the C-terminal coiled-coil domain facilitates multimerization, which together could explain the molecular basis for Wag31 to function in homotypic tethering of CL-containing membranes. Results from testing mutants defective in membrane tethering indicate that this function is important for the proper localisation of CL and eventually the survival of mycobacteria (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6c-d</xref>). Thus, alterations in the native levels of Wag31 results in a displacement of CL from the poles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-d</xref>). However, given NAO’s ability to bind to anionic phospholipids (albeit with lower affinity), a smaller degree of NAO redistribution intensity might be coming indirectly from other anionic phospholipids displaced from the membrane due to the loss of membrane integrity or cell shape changes caused by Wag31 depletion.</p>
<p>While, complementation with Wag31 reverses the phenotypic changes observed upon Wag31 depletion, complementation with the membrane tethering-defective mutant (Wag31<sub>ΔN</sub>) fails to do so (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f-g</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6a-d</xref>). These results not only highlight the dependence of CL localization on membrane-tethering but also underscores the importance of tethering for maintaining cellular morphology, physiology and survival. CL micro-domains at the poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) have been shown to be an important hub for protein localisation and activity. Several studies have implicated CL in modulating the activities of membrane-resident proteins involved in electron-transport, protein translocation, bacterial two-component system etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Our work delineates the roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of Wag31. The N-terminal DivIVA-domain facilitates lipid binding and membrane tethering, and the C- terminal coiled-coil domain engages in protein-protein interactions and facilitates the multimerization of Wag31. This is evident from findings that deletion of the N-terminal DivIVA-domain affects lipid binding and tethering but not its ability to bind interacting partners (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c-d, f-g</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Based on our results, we propose a model in which the N-terminal of Wag31 binds and tethers CL ensuring its proper localization while the C-terminal is free to interact and recruit proteins to the membrane to facilitate cell growth and division (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). We reason that the loss of cell-shape and viability in the absence of tethering occurs due to mis-localization of CL which in turn has a negative impact on membrane-localized processes at a global scale.</p>

In the absence of Wag31, CL-microdomains become delocalised due to the loss of tethering, pulling away several membrane-associated proteins causing non-polar growth and loss of curvature.

Os<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was removed from the samples by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 10 min at RT and discarded as per safety guidelines. The cells were then subjected to serial dehydration at RT with increasing concentrations of ethanol from 25% to 100%. Briefly, the cells were incubated for 5 min with 25% ethanol, harvested, and incubated for 7 min with 50% ethanol. This was followed by serially incubating the cells for 15, 20, and 30 min for 75%, 95%, and 100% (thrice) ethanol, respectively. Cells were then taken forward for critical-point drying with the help of 100 µl Hexamethyldisilazine (HMDS). Meanwhile, stubs were prepared by placing carbon tape and coverslip on them. 10 µl of the dried sample was spotted on the coverslip and evenly spread. Next, the stub was coated with 0.8 mm Gold and stored in a desiccator or imaged at 20,000X using FEI Nova NanoSEM 450. For TEM, cells were grown and harvested as described above for SEM. For TEM sample preparation, 50 OD cells were taken, fixed, stained, and gradually dehydrated with ethanol, as explained above. The cells were then infiltrated with Epon 812 resin. This was followed by cutting the resin into several 62 nm thick ultra-thin sections using an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC7). The sections were then stained with Uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined on a 120 kV transmission electron microscope (L120C, Talos, Thermo Scientific) at 17,500 magnification.</p>

<title>Sample preparation for Lipidomics and analysis</title>
<p>Secondary cultures of <italic>Msm</italic> and <italic>Δwag31</italic> were seeded at a density of A600∼ 0.05 and either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/mL ATc for 12 h until A600∼ 0.8-1.0. Post 12 h incubation with ATc, Cells corresponding to A<sub>600</sub>∼20 were harvested and processed for lipid extraction. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 1 ml sterilized PBS and transferred to a 3 ml glass vial. 2:1 Chloroform::Methanol mixture was added to it and vortexed vigorously for 2 min. Chloroform contained 1 nm 15:0 FFA to be used as the internal standard for normalization. The samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at RT to separate the organic layer. The latter was transferred to a new glass vial, and 2 ml Chloroform (containing 2% Formic acid) was added to the old vial to extract phospholipids from the sample. The samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at RT to extract the phospholipid-containing organic layer. Both organic layers were pooled and dried under a stream of Nitrogen gas at RT. The dried lipid extracts were re-solubilized in 200 μL of 2:1 CHCl3: CH<sub>3</sub>OH, and 10 μL was injected into an Agilent 6545 QTOF (quadrupole-time-of-flight) instrument for semi-quantitative analysis using high-resolution auto MS/MS methods and chromatography techniques. A Gemini 5U C-18 column (Phenomenex) coupled with a Gemini guard column (Phenomenex, 4×3 mm, Phenomenex security cartridge) was used for LC separation. The solvents used for negative ion mode were buffer A: 95:5 H2O:CH<sub>3</sub>OH + 0.1% ammonium hydroxide and buffer B: 60:35:5 Isopropanol: CH<sub>3</sub>OH:H2O + 0.1% ammonium hydroxide. The 0.1% ammonium hydroxide in each buffer was replaced by 0.1% Formic acid + 10 mM Ammonium Formate for positive ion mode runs. All LC/MS runs were for 60 min, starting with 0.3 mL/min 100% buffer A for 5 minutes, 0.5 mL/min linear gradient to 100% buffer B over 40 minutes, 0.5 mL/min 100% buffer B for 10 minutes, and equilibration with 0.5 mL/min 100% buffer A for 5 minutes. The following settings were used for the ESI-MS analysis: drying gas and sheath gas temperature: 320°C, drying gas and sheath gas flow rate: 10 L/min, fragment or voltage: 150 V, capillary voltage: 4000 V, nebulizer (ion source gas) pressure: 45 psi and nozzle voltage: 1000 V. For analysis, a lipid library was employed in the form of a Personal Compound Database Library (PCDL), and the peaks were validated based on relative retention times and fragments obtained. This library was selectively curated from the MycoMass database and the LIPID MAPS Structure Database (LMSD). All robustly detected lipid species were quantified by normalizing areas under the curve (AUC) to the AUC of the relevant internal standard added and by normalizing to the total cell number. Log2 fold changes were then plotted for each lipid compared to the Msm-ATc samples.</p>

One-fifth of the IP supernatant was resolved on a 10% gel, transferred onto a Nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-FLAG Antibody (Sigma). Lysates from confirmed IPs (biological quadruplets) were taken further for mass spectrometry sample preparation and analysis. Sample preparation and, mass spectrometry analysis were outsourced to VProteomics, New Delhi. Briefly, the IP samples were reduced with 5 mM TCEP, followed by alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetamide. The samples were digested with 1μg Trypsin for 16 h at 37 °C. Digests were cleaned using a C18 silica cartridge and resuspended in a buffer containing 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. 1 μg of peptide was used for analysis in an Easy-nlc-1000 system coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris mass spectrometer. The gradients were run for 110 min. MS1 spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (Max IT = 60 ms, AGQ target = 300%; RF Lens = 70%; R=60K, mass range = 375−1500; Profile data). Dynamic exclusion was employed for 30 seconds, excluding all charge states for a given precursor. MS2 spectra were collected for the top 20 peptides. MS2 (Max IT=60ms, R= 15K, AGC target 100%). Proteome Discoverer (v2.5) was used to analyse the RAW data against the Uniprot Msm database. The precursor and fragment mass limitations for the dual Sequest and Amanda searches were established at 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively. The false discovery rate for proteins and peptide spectrum matches was adjusted to 0.01 FDR. For identification of interactors unique to Wag31, we removed all the proteins obtained in the three replicates of <italic>Msm::gfp</italic> from the <italic>Δwag31</italic> datasets. In the corrected datasets, proteins common to all the three replicates with minimum unique peptides #2 were considered interactors. To identify top hits, PSM cut-off was set to 18 and unique peptides to 5.</p>

<p>Understanding bacterial growth mechanisms potentially uncover novel drug targets which are crucial for maintaining cellular viability, particularly for bacterial pathogens. In this <bold>important</bold> study, Kapoor et al, investigate the role of Wag31 in lipid and peptidoglycan biosynthesis in mycobacteria. A detailed analysis of Wag31 domain architecture revealed a role in membrane tethering. More specifically, the N-terminal and C-terminal domains appeared to have distinct functional roles. The data presented are <bold>solid</bold> and support the conclusion made. This study will be of broad interest to microbiologists and molecular biologists.</p>

<p>This is a comprehensive study that sheds light on how Wag31 functions and localises in mycobacterial cells. A clear link to interactions with CL is shown using a combination of microscopy in combination with fusion fluorescent constructs, and lipid specific dyes. Furthermore, studies using mutant versions of Wag31 shed light on the functionalities of each domain in the protein. My concerns/suggestions for the manuscript are minor:</p>
<p>(1) Ln 130. A better clarification/discussion is required here. It is clear that both depletion and overexpression have an effect on levels of various lipids, but subsequent descriptions show that they affect different classes of lipids.</p>
<p>
(2) The pulldown assays results are interesting, but the links are tentative.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors may perhaps like to rephrase claims of effects lipid homeostasis, as my understanding is that lipid localisation rather than catabolism/breakdown is affected.</p>
<p>In response to the above reviews the authors have made the required changes in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kapoor et. al. investigated the role of the mycobacterial protein Wag31 in lipid and peptidoglycan synthesis and sought to delineate the role of the N- and C- terminal domains of Wag31. They demonstrated that modulating Wag31 levels influences lipid homeostasis in M. smegmatis and cardiolipin (CL) localisation in cells. Wag31 was found to preferentially bind CL-containing liposomes, and deleting the N-terminus of the protein significantly decreased this interaction. Novel interactions between Wag31 and proteins involved in lipid metabolism and cell wall synthesis were identified, suggesting that Wag31 recruits proteins to the intracellular membrane domain by direct interaction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The importance of Wag31 in maintaining lipid homeostasis is supported by several lines of evidence.</p>
<p>
(2) The interaction between Wag31 and cardiolipin, and the role of the N-terminus in this interaction was convincingly demonstrated.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>(1) Interactome analysis with truncated versions of the proteins could not be performed in M. smegmatis due to protein instability.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the characterization of mycobacterial cytoskeleton protein Wag31, examining its role in orchestrating protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions essential for mycobacterial survival. The most significant finding is that Wag31, which directs polar elongation and maintains the intracellular membrane domain, was revealed to have membrane tethering capabilities.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provided a detailed analysis of Wag31 domain architecture, revealing distinct functional roles: the N-terminal domain facilitates lipid binding and membrane tethering, while the C-terminal domain mediates protein-protein interactions. Overall, this study offers a robust and new understanding of Wag31 function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors did not address some of the comments. The following concerns should be addressed.</p>
<p>• As far as I can tell, authors did not address my prior comments on Line 270, which is Line 280 in the revised manuscript: the N-terminal region is important for lipid homeostasis, but the statement in Line 270, &quot;the maintenance of lipid homeostasis by Wag31 is a consequence of its tethering activity&quot; requires additional proof. Please indicate the page and line numbers in the revised manuscript so that I can identify the specific changes the authors made.</p>
<p>• Since this pull-down assay was conducted by mixing E. coli lysate expressing Wag31 and Msm lysate expression Wag31 interactors like MurG, it is possible that the interactions are not direct. Authors acknowledge that this is a valid point, and indicated that they &quot;will describe this caveat in the revised manuscript&quot;. I have difficulty finding where this revision was made. Please indicate the page and line numbers.</p>

<p>(1) Ln 130. A better clarification/discussion is required here. It is clear that both depletion and overexpression have an effect on levels of various lipids, but subsequent descriptions show that they affect different classes of lipids.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have added a better clarification on this in the discussion of revised manuscript. The lipid classes that get impacted by the depletion of Wag31 vs overexpression are different. Wag31 is an adaptor protein that interacts with proteins of the ACCase complex (Meniche et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014) that synthesize fatty acid precursors and regulate their activity (Habibi Arejan et al., 2022).</p>
<p>The varied response on lipid homeostasis could be attributed to a change in the stoichiometry of these interactions of Wag31. While Wag31 depletion would prevent such interactions from occurring and might affect lipid synthesis that directly depends on Wag31-protein partner interactions, its overexpression would lead to promiscuous interactions and a change in the stoichiometry of native interactions that would ultimately modulate lipid synthesis pathways.</p>

<p>(2) The pulldown assays results are interesting, but links are tentative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. The interactome of Wag31 was identified through the immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Wag31 complemented at an integrative locus in Wag31 mutant background to avoid overexpression artifacts. We used Msm::gfp expressing an integrative copy (at L5 locus) of FLAG-GFP as a control to subtract non-specific interactions. The experiment was performed in biological triplicates, and interactors that appeared in all replicates but not in the control were selected for further analysis. Although we identified more than 100 interactors of Wag31, we analyzed only the top 25 hits, with a PSM cut-off 18 and unique peptides5. Additionally, two of Wag31's established interactors, AccD5 and Rne, were among the top five hits, thus validating our data.</p>
<p>As mentioned in line 139 of the previous version of the manuscript, we agree that the interactions can either be direct or through a third partner. The fact that we obtained known interactors of Wag31 makes us believe these interactions are genuine. Moreover, for validation, we performed pulldown experiments by mixing E. coli lysates expressing His-Wag31 full-length or truncated protein with M. smegmatis lysates expressing FLAG-tagged interacting proteins. The wash conditions used were quite stringent for these pull-down assays—the wash buffer contained 1% Triton X100 that eliminates all non-specific and indirect interactions. However, we agree that we cannot conclusively state that the interactions are direct without purifying the proteins and performing the experiment. As mentioned above, this caveat was stated in the previous version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kapoor et. al. investigated the role of the mycobacterial protein Wag31 in lipid and peptidoglycan synthesis and sought to delineate the role of the N- and C- terminal domains of Wag31. They demonstrated that modulating Wag31 levels influences lipid homeostasis in M. smegmatis and cardiolipin (CL) localisation in cells. Wag31 was found to preferentially bind CL-containing liposomes, and deleting the N-terminus of the protein significantly decreased this interaction. Novel interactions between Wag31 and proteins involved in lipid metabolism and cell wall synthesis were identified, suggesting that Wag31 recruits proteins to the intracellular membrane domain by direct interaction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The importance of Wag31 in maintaining lipid homeostasis is supported by several lines of evidence. (2) The interaction between Wag31 and cardiolipin, and the role of the N-terminus in this interaction was convincingly demonstrated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) MS experiments provide some evidence for novel protein-protein interactions. However, the pulldown experiments lack a valid negative control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have included two non-interactors of Wag31 i.e. MmpL4 and MmpS5 which were not identified in our interactome database as negative controls in the experiment. As shown in Figure S3, we performed His pull-down experiments with both of them independently twice, each time with a positive control (known interactor of Wag31 (Msm2092)). Fig. S3b revised shows E. coli lysate expressing His-Wag31 which was incubated with Msm lysates expressing either FLAG tagged-MmpL4 or -MmpS5 or Msm2092 (revised Fig. S3c). The mixed lysates were pulled down with Cobalt beads that bind to the His-tagged protein and analysed using Western blot analysis by probing with anti-FLAG antibody (revised Fig. S3d.). The data presented confirms that the interactions validated through the pull down assay were indeed specific.</p>

<p>(2) The role of the N-terminus in the protein-protein interaction has not been ruled out.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Wag31<sub>Msm</sub> is a 272 amino acids long protein. The Nterminal of Wag31, which houses the DivIVA-domain, comprises the first 60 amino acids. Previously, we attempted to express the N-terminal (60 aa long) and the C-terminal (212 aa long) truncated proteins in various mycobacterial shuttle vectors to perform MS/MS experiments. Despite numerous efforts, neither expressed with the N/C-terminal FLAG tag or no tag in episomal or integrative vectors due to instability of the protein. Eventually, we successfully expressed the C-terminal Wag31 with an N and Cterminal hexa-His tag. However, this expression was not sufficient or stable enough for us to perform Ni<sup>2+</sup>-affinity pull-down experiments for mass spectrometry. N-terminal of Wag31 could not be expressed in M. smegmatis even with N and C-terminal Hexa-His tags.</p>
<p>To rule out the role of the N-terminal in mediating protein-protein interactions, we cloned the N-terminal of Wag31 that comprises the DivIVA-domain in pET28b vector (Fig. 7a revised). Subsequently, the truncated protein, hereafter called  Wag31<sub>∆C</sub>  flanked by 6X His tags at both the termini was expressed in E. coli and mixed with Msm lysates expressing interactors of Wag31 (Fig. 7b-c revised). Earlier experiments with Wag31<sub>∆1-60&lt;/sub or Wag31<sub>∆N</sub> (in the revised manuscript) were performed with MurG, SepIVA, Msm2092 and AccA3 (Fig. 7e-g). Thus, we used the same set of interactors to test our hypothesis. Briefly, His-  Wag31<sub>∆C</sub>  was mixed with Msm lysates expressing either FLAG-MurG, -SepIVA, -Msm2092 or -AccA3 and pull down experiments were performed as described previously. FLAGMmpS5, a non-interactor of Wag31 was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 7d revised, His-Wag31 could bind to all the four interactors whereas His- Wag31<sub>∆C</sub>  couldn’t, strengthening the conclusion that interactions of Wag31 with other proteins are mediated by its Cterminal. However, we can’t ignore the possibility of other interactors binding to the N-terminal of Wag31. Unfortunately, due to poor expression/instability of  Wag31<sub>∆C</sub>  in mycobacterial shuttle vectors, we are unable to perform a global interactome analysis of  Wag31<sub>∆C</sub></sub></p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the characterization of mycobacterial cytoskeleton protein Wag31, examining its role in orchestrating protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions essential for mycobacterial survival. The most significant finding is that Wag31, which directs polar elongation and maintains the intracellular membrane domain, was revealed to have membrane tethering capabilities.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provided a detailed analysis of Wag31 domain architecture, revealing distinct functional roles: the N-terminal domain facilitates lipid binding and membrane tethering, while the C-terminal domain mediates protein-protein interactions. Overall, this study offers a robust and new understanding of Wag31 function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The following major concerns should be addressed.</p>
<p>• Authors use 10-N-Nonyl-acridine orange (NAO) as a marker for cardiolipin localization. However, given that NAO is known to bind to various anionic phospholipids, how do the authors know that what they are seeing is specifically visualizing cardiolipin and not a different anionic phospholipid? For example, phosphatidylinositol is another abundant anionic phospholipid in mycobacterial plasma membrane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Despite its promiscuous binding to other anionic phospholipids, 10-N-Nonyl-acridine orange is widely used to stain Cardiolipin and determine its localisation in bacterial cells and mitochondria of eukaryotes (Garcia Fernandez et al., 2004; Mileykovskaya &amp; Dowhan, 2000; Renner &amp; Weibel, 2011). This is because it has a stronger affinity for Cardiolipin than other anionic phospholipids with the affinity constant being 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> M−<sup>1</sup> for Cardiolipin association and 7 × 10<sup>4</sup> M−<sup>1</sup> for that of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol association (Petit et al., 1992). Additionally, there is not yet another stain available for detecting Cardiolipin. Our proteinlipid binding assays suggest that Wag31 preferentially binds to Cardiolipin over other anionic phospholipids (Fig. 4b), hence it is likely that the majority of redistribution of NAO fluorescence that we observe might be contributed by Cardiolipin mislocalization due to altered Wag31 levels, with smaller degree of NAO redistribution intensity coming indirectly from other anionic phospholipids displaced from the membrane due to the loss of membrane integrity and cell shape changes due to Wag31.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Authors' data show that the N-terminal region of Wag31 is important for membrane tethering. The authors' data also show that the N-terminal region is important for sustaining mycobacterial morphology. However, the authors' statement in Line 256 &quot;These results highlight the importance of tethering for sustaining mycobacterial morphology and survival&quot; requires additional proof. It remains possible that the N-terminal region has another unknown activity, and this yet-unknown activity rather than the membrane tethering activity drives the morphological maintenance. Similarly, the N-terminal region is important for lipid homeostasis, but the statement in Line 270, &quot;the maintenance of lipid homeostasis by Wag31 is a consequence of its tethering activity&quot; requires additional proof. The authors should tone down these overstatements or provide additional data to support their claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that there exists a possibility for another function of the N-terminal that may contribute to sustaining mycobacterial physiology and survival. We would revise our statements in the paper to reflect the data. Results shown suggest that the tethering activity of the Nterminal region may contribute to mycobacterial morphology and survival. However, additional functions of this region can’t be ruled out. Similarly, the maintenance of lipid homeostasis by Wag31 may be associated with its tethering activity, although other mechanisms could also contribute to this process.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Authors suggest that Wag31 acts as a scaffold for the IMD (Fig. 8). However, Meniche et. al. has shown that MurG as well as GlfT2, two well-characterized IMD proteins, do not colocalize with Wag31 (DivIVA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1402158111">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1402158111</ext-link>). IMD proteins are always slightly subpolar while Wag31 is located to the tip of the cell. Therefore, the authors' biochemical data cannot be easily reconciled with microscopic observations in the literature. This raises a question regarding the validity of protein-protein interaction shown in Figure 7. Since this pull-down assay was conducted by mixing E. coli lysate expressing Wag31 and Msm lysate expression Wag31 interactors like MurG, it is possible that the interactions are not direct. Authors should interpret their data more cautiously. If authors cannot provide additional data and sufficient justifications, they should avoid proposing a confusing model like Figure 8 that contradicts published observations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the literature, MurG and GlfT2 have been shown to have polar localisation (Freeman et al., 2023; Hayashi et al., 2016; Kado et al., 2023) and two groups have shown slightly sub-polar localisation of MurG (García-Heredia et al., 2021; Meniche et al., 2014). Additionally, (Freeman et al., 2023) showed SepIVA to be a spatio-temporal regulator of MurG. MS/MS analysis of Wag31 immunoprecipitation data yielded both MurG and SepIVA to be interactors of Wag31 (Fig. 3). Given Wag31 also displays polar localisation, it is likely that it associates with the polar MurG. However, since a sub-polar localisation of MurG has also been reported, it is possible that they do not interact directly and another protein mediates their interaction. Based on the above, we will modify the model proposed in Fig. 8.</p>
<p>We agree that for validation of interaction, we performed pulldown experiments by mixing E. coli lysates expressing His-Wag31 full-length or truncated protein with M. smegmatis lysates expressing FLAG-tagged interacting proteins. The wash conditions used were quite stringent for these pull-down assays—the wash buffer contained 1% Triton X100 that eliminates all non-specific and indirect interactions. However, we agree that we cannot conclusively state that the interactions are direct without purifying the proteins and performing the experiment. We will describe this caveat in the revised manuscript and propose a model that reflects the results we obtained.</p>

The sequence analysis of the plasmid expressing Wag31<sub>K20A</sub> doesn’t show additional mutations other than the desired K20A.

<p>- The data in Fig 6d suggests higher levels of CL in the ∆wag31 compared to wild-type - how do the authors reconcile this with the MS data in Fig. 2g showing lower CL levels?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fig. 6d represents the distribution of CL localisation in the tested strains of mycobacteria whereas Fig. 2g shows the absolute levels of CL in various strains. We attribute greater confidence on the lipidomics data which suggests down regulation of CL species. The NAO staining and microscopy is merely for studying localization of the CL along the cell, and cannot be used to reliably quantify or equate it to CL levels. The staining using a probe such as NAO is dependent on factors such as hydrophobicity and permeability of the cell wall, which we expect to be severely altered in a Wag31 mutant. Therefore, the increased staining of NAO seen in Wag31 mutant could just be reflective of the increased uptake of the dye rather than absolute levels of CL. The specificity of staining and localization however can be expected to be unaltered.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Following are suggestions for improving the writing and presentation.</p>
<p>• Figure 1, the meaning of the yellow arrows present in f and h should be mentioned in the figure legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have incorporated that in the revised legend. In Fig.1f, the yellow arrowhead represents the bulged pole morphology whereas in Fig. 1h, it indicates intracellular lipid inclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Figure 7 legend refers to panels g, h, and i. However, Figure 7 only has panels a-c. The legend lacks a description of panel c.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected the typos and the legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Figure S1, F2-R2 and F3-R3 expected sizes should be stated in the legend of the figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Figure S5, is this the same figure as 5e? If so, there is no need for this figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed Fig. S5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Methods need to be written more carefully with enough details. I listed some of the concerns below.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Detailed methodology was previously provided in the supplementary material and now we have moved it to the materials and methods in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Line 392, provide more details on western blotting. What is the secondary antibody? What image documentation system was used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the methodology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Line 400, while the methods may be the same as the reference 64, authors should still provide key details such as the way samples were fixed and processed for SEM and TEM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided a detailed description of the same in methodology in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Line 437, how do authors calculate the concentration of liposome to be 10 µM? Do they possibly mean the concentration of phospholipids used to make the liposomes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, this is the concentration of total lipids used to make liposomes. 1 μM of Wag31 or its mutants were mixed with 100 nm extruded liposomes containing 10 μm total lipid in separate Eppendorf tubes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Supplemental Line 9, &quot;turns of&quot; should read &quot;turns off&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have edited this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Supplemental Line 13, define LHS and RHS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>LHS or left hand sequence and RHS or right hand sequence refers to the upstream and downstream flanking regions of the gene of interest.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Supplemental Line 20, indicate the manufacturer of the microscope and type of the objective lens.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added these details now.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Supplemental Line 31, define MeOH, or use a chemical formula like chloroform.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>MeOH is methanol. We have provided a chemical formula in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Supplemental Line 53, indicate the concentration of trypsin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included that in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Supplemental Line 72, g is not a unit. &quot;30,000 g&quot; should be &quot;30,000x g&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised this in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>• Supplemental Line 114, provide more details on western blotting. What is the manufacturer of antiFLAG antibody? What is the secondary antibody? How was the antibody binding visualized? What image documentation system was used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have provided these details in the revised version.</p>
