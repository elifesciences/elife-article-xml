<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sleep is a nearly universal feature of animal behaviour, yet many of the molecular, genetic, and neuronal substrates that orchestrate sleep/wake transitions lie undiscovered. Employing a viral insertion sleep screen in larval zebrafish, we identified a novel gene, <italic>dreammist</italic> (<italic>dmist</italic>), whose loss results in behavioural hyperactivity and reduced sleep at night. The neuronally expressed <italic>dmist</italic> gene is conserved across vertebrates and encodes a small single-pass transmembrane protein that is structurally similar to the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase regulator, FXYD1/Phospholemman. Disruption of either <italic>fxyd1</italic> or <italic>atp1a3a</italic>, a Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase alpha-3 subunit associated with several heritable movement disorders in humans, led to decreased night-time sleep. Since <italic>atpa1a3a</italic> and <italic>dmist</italic> mutants have elevated intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> levels and non-additive effects on sleep amount at night, we propose that Dmist-dependent enhancement of Na<sup>+</sup> pump function modulates neuronal excitability to maintain normal sleep behaviour.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability of animals to switch between behaviourally alert and quiescent states is conserved across the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cirelli, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Joiner, 2016</xref>). Fundamental processes that govern the regulation of sleep-like states are shared across species, such as the roles of circadian and homeostatic cues in regulating the time and amount of sleep, stereotyped postures, heightened arousal thresholds, and the rapid reversibility to a more alert state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Joiner, 2016</xref>). The near ubiquity of sleep implies that it serves ancient functions and is subject to conserved regulatory processes. However, many key molecular components that modulate sleep and wake states remain undiscovered.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, investigations into sleep and arousal states of genetically tractable model organisms, such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (zebrafish) have uncovered novel molecular and neuronal components of sleep regulation through gain-and loss-of-function genetic screens (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barlow and Rihel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sehgal and Mignot, 2011</xref>). The power of screening approaches is perhaps best exemplified by the first forward genetic sleep screen, which identified the potassium channel <italic>shaker</italic> as a critical sleep regulator in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cirelli et al., 2005</xref>). This result continues to have a lasting impact on the field, as not only did subsequent sleep screening efforts uncover the novel Shaker regulator <italic>sleepless</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Koh et al., 2009</xref>), but investigations into Shaker’s beta subunit Hyperkinetic ultimately revealed a critical role for this redox sensor linking metabolic function to sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bushey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kempf et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Disparate screening strategies across model organisms continue to unveil novel sleep modulators in both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems. For example, the roles of RFamide receptor DMSR-1 in stress-induced sleep in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Iannacone et al., 2017</xref>) and SIK3 kinase in modulating sleep homeostasis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Funato et al., 2016</xref>) were identified in genetic screens. Moreover, a gain of function screening strategy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> revealed the novel sleep and immune regulator, <italic>nemuri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Toda et al., 2019</xref>), and a zebrafish overexpression screen uncovered the secreted neuropeptides neuromedin U and neuropeptide Y, which decrease and increase sleep, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). The success of screening strategies in revealing novel sleep-wake regulatory genes suggests that more sleep signals likely remain to be discovered.</p>
<p>One of the lessons from these genetic screens is that many of the uncovered genes play conserved roles across species. For example, Shaker also regulates mammalian sleep (Douglas et al., 2007) and RFamides induce sleep in worms, flies, and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lenz et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, not every invertebrate sleep-regulatory gene has a clear vertebrate homolog, while some known human sleep/wake regulators, such as the narcolepsy-associated neuropeptide hypocretin/orexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chemelli et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Peyron et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sakurai, 2013</xref>), lack invertebrate orthologs. Therefore, genetic sleep screens in vertebrates are likely to provide added value in uncovering additional regulatory components required to control the initiation and amount of sleep in humans.</p>
<p>While sleep screening in mammals is feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Funato et al., 2016</xref>), it remains an expensive and technically challenging endeavour. With its genetic tractability, availability of high-throughput sleep assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rihel and Schier, 2013</xref>), and conserved sleep genetics, such as the hypocretin, melatonin, locus coeruleus, and raphe systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gandhi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Singh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Oikonomou et al., 2019</xref>; Prober et al., 2006), the larval zebrafish is an attractive vertebrate system for sleep screens. We took advantage of a collection of zebrafish lines that harbour viral-insertions in &gt;3500 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Varshney et al., 2013</xref>) to perform a targeted genetic screen. We identified a short-sleeping mutant, <italic>dreammist</italic>, with a disrupted novel, highly conserved vertebrate gene that encodes a small single pass transmembrane protein. Sequence and structural homology to the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump regulator FXYD1/Phospholemman suggests that Dreammist is a neuronal-expressed member of a class of sodium pump modulators that is important for regulating sleep-wake behaviour.</p>

<title>Reverse genetic screen identifies <italic>dreammist,</italic> a mutant with decreased sleep</title>
<p>We used the ‘Zenemark’ viral-insertion based zebrafish gene knock-out resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Varshney et al., 2013</xref>) to perform a reverse genetic screen to identify novel vertebrate sleep genes. This screening strategy offers several advantages compared to traditional chemical mutagenesis-based forward genetic screening approaches. First, unlike chemical mutagenesis, which introduces mutations randomly, viral insertions tend to target the 5’ end of genes, typically causing genetic loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sivasubbu et al., 2007</xref>). Second, because the virus sequence is known, it is straightforward to map and identify the causative gene in mutant animals. Finally, since viral insertions in the Zenemark collection are already mapped and sequenced, animals harbouring insertions within specific gene classes can be selected for testing (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). This allowed us to prioritise screening of genes encoding protein classes that are often linked to behaviour, such as G-protein coupled receptors, neuropeptide ligands, ion channels, and transporters (Supplemental Data 1).</p>
<p>For screening, we identified zebrafish sperm samples from the Zenemark collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Varshney et al., 2013</xref>) that harboured viral insertions in genes of interest and used these samples for <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization and the establishment of F2 families. For each viral insertion line, clutches from heterozygous F2 in-crosses were raised to 5 days post-fertilisation (dpf) and tracked using videography (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>) to quantify the number and duration of sleep bouts (defined in zebrafish larvae as inactivity lasting 1 minute or longer; Prober et al., 2006) and waking activity (time spent moving per active bout) over 48 hours. The genotypes of individual larvae were determined by PCR after behavioural tracking, with each larva assigned as wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous for a given viral insertion to assess the effect of genotype on sleep/wake behaviour. While most screened lines had minimal effects on sleep-wake behavioural parameters (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B-S1C</xref>), one homozygous viral insertion line, <italic>10543/10543,</italic> had a reduction in daytime sleep (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>) and an increase in daytime waking activity (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>) relative to their wild type sibling controls. We re-named this <italic>10543</italic> viral insertion line <italic>dreammist</italic> (<italic>dmist</italic>).</p>
<p>In follow-up studies, we observed that animals homozygous for the viral insertion at this locus (<italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic>) showed a prominent decrease in sleep during the day and a trend to sleep less at night compared to their wild-type siblings (<italic>dmist<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>dmist</italic> mutants had an almost 50% reduction in the average amount of daytime sleep (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) due to a decrease in the number of sleep bouts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), whereas the sleep bout length at night was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic> larvae also exhibited significantly increased daytime waking activity, which is the locomotor activity while awake (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, 1F</xref>). Because Zenemark lines can contain more than one viral insertion (17.6% of lines have ≥2 insertions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Varshney et al 2013</xref>), we outcrossed <italic>dmist<sup>vir/+</sup></italic> fish to wild-type fish of the AB-TL background and re-tested <italic>dmist</italic> mutant fish over several generations. Normalising all the behavioural parameters to <italic>dmist<sup>+/+</sup></italic> controls with a linear mixed effects (LME) model showed consistent sleep changes in <italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic> fish over 5 independent experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The <italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic> larvae consistently show a more than 50% decrease in sleep during the day due to a significant reduction in the number and duration of sleep bouts, as well as a large increase in waking activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The <italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic> mutants also had a significant reduction in sleep at night compared to wild type siblings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). These effects on sleep and wakefulness are not due to alterations in circadian rhythms, as behavioural period length in fish that were entrained and then shifted to free-running constant dark conditions was unaffected in <italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic> compared to wild-type sibling larvae (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A-S2C</xref>).</p>

<title>The <italic>dmist</italic> gene encodes a novel, small transmembrane protein</title>
<p>Having identified a sleep mutant, we next sought to investigate the target gene disrupted by the viral insertion. Line <italic>10543</italic> (<italic>dmist<sup>vir</sup></italic>) was initially selected for screening due to a predicted disruption of a gene encoding a serotonin transporter (<italic>slc6a4b</italic>) on chromosome 5. However, mapping of the <italic>dmist</italic> viral insertion site by inverse-PCR and sequencing revealed that the virus was instead inserted into the intron of a small two-exon gene annotated in the Zv6 genome assembly as a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA; gene transcript ENSDART00000148146, gene name <italic>si:dkey234h16.7</italic>), which lies approximately 6 kilobases (kb) downstream of the <italic>slc6a4b</italic> gene in zebrafish. At least part of this region is syntenic across vertebrates, with a small two-exon gene identified adjacent to the genes <italic>ankrd13a</italic> and <italic>GIT</italic> in several vertebrates, including human and mouse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Amplifying both 5’ and 3’ ends of zebrafish <italic>si:dkey234h16.7</italic> and mouse E13.5 <italic>1500011B03-001</italic> transcripts with Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) confirmed the annotated zebrafish and mouse transcripts and identified two variants with 3’ untranslated regions (3’UTR) of different lengths in zebrafish (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). To test whether the viral insertion in <italic>dmist<sup>vir</sup></italic><sup>/</sup><italic><sup>vir</sup></italic> disrupts expression of <italic>si:dkey234h16.7</italic> or neighbouring genes, we performed quantitative analysis of gene transcript levels in wild type and mutant <italic>dmist</italic> larvae by RT-qPCR. This revealed that the <italic>dmist</italic> viral insertion caused a more than 70% reduction in the expression of <italic>si:dkey234h16.7</italic> while the expression of the most proximal 5’ or 3’ flanking genes, <italic>slc6a4b_Dr</italic> and <italic>ankrd13a_Dr</italic>, were unaffected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and S3A). Since this reduced expression is most consistent with <italic>si:dkey234h16.7</italic> being the causal lesion of the <italic>dmist</italic> mutant sleep phenotype, we renamed this gene <italic>dreammist</italic> (<italic>dmist</italic>).</p>

<p>Computational predictions indicated that the <italic>dmist</italic> transcripts contain a small open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 70 amino acids (aa) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Querying the human and vertebrate protein databases by BLASTp using the C-terminal protein sequence of Dmist identified orthologs in most vertebrate clades, including other species of teleost fish, birds, amphibians, and mammals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, C</xref>). All identified orthologs encoded predicted proteins with an N-terminal signal peptide sequence and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The peptide sequence identity across orthologs ranged from 38 to 84%, with three peptide motifs (QNLV, CVYKP, RRR) showing high conservation across all vertebrates, and high similarity for many additional residues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>). Additional searches by tBLASTn failed to identify any non-vertebrate <italic>dmist</italic> orthologs. In summary, we found that the <italic>dreammist</italic> gene, the expression of which is disrupted in <italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic> fish with sleep phenotypes, encodes a protein of uncharacterized function that is highly conserved across vertebrates at both the genomic and molecular levels.</p>

<title>Genetic molecular analysis of <italic>dmist</italic> expression in zebrafish and mouse</title>
<p>Because the viral insertion disrupts <italic>dmist</italic> throughout the animal’s lifetime, we examined both the developmental and spatial expression of <italic>dmist</italic> to assess when and where its function may be required for normal sleep. Using the full-length transcript as a probe (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>), we performed <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization across embryonic and larval zebrafish development. Maternally deposited <italic>dmist</italic> was detected in early embryos (2-cell stage) prior to the maternal to zygotic transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Giraldez et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with maternal deposition of <italic>dmist</italic> transcripts, inspection of the 3’ end of the <italic>dmist</italic> gene revealed a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (‘TTTTTTAT’; Supplemental Information 2) that is required for zygotic translation of maternal transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Villalba et al., 2011</xref>). At 24 hpf, transcripts were detected in regions that form the embryonic brain, such as ventral telencephalon, diencephalon and cerebellum, and in the developing eye (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C</xref>). By 5 dpf, <italic>dmist</italic> transcripts were detected throughout the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). To test whether <italic>dmist</italic> transcripts are under circadian regulation, we performed RT-qPCR in fish that were entrained and then shifted to free-running constant dark conditions. In contrast with the robust 24-hr rhythmic transcription of the circadian clock gen <italic>per1</italic>, we did not detect any changes in <italic>dmist</italic> expression throughout the 24 hour circadian cycle (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with brain expression in larval zebrafish, we identified the expression of <italic>Dmist_Mm</italic> in a published RNAseq dataset of six isolated cell types from mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). We confirmed that <italic>Dmist_Mm</italic> is specifically enriched in neurons by hierarchical clustering of all 16,991 expressed transcripts across all six cells types, which demonstrated that <italic>Dmist_Mm</italic> co-clusters with neuronal genes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>). Pearson correlation of <italic>Dmist_Mm</italic> with canonical markers for the six cell types showed that <italic>Dmist_Mm</italic> expression is highly correlated with other neuronal genes but not genes associated with microglia, oligodendrocytes, or endothelia. This result indicates that <italic>dmist</italic> is specifically expressed in neurons in both zebrafish and mouse (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F</xref>).</p>

To test these computational predictions, we transiently co-expressed GFP-tagged Dmist (C-terminal fusion) with a marker for the plasma membrane (myr-Cherry) in zebrafish embryos. Imaging at 90% epiboly revealed Dmist-GFP localised to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Conversely, introducing a point mutation into Dmist’s signal peptide cleavage site (DmistA22W-GFP) prevented Dmist from trafficking to the plasma membrane, with likely retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these data indicate that Dmist localises to the plasma membrane despite its small size, as computationally predicted.</p>

<p>We next assessed the sleep and activity patterns of <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> fish. As seen in exemplar individual tracking experiments, <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> larvae sleep less at night due to fewer sleep bouts and also show an increase in waking activity relative to wild type and heterozygous mutant siblings (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-H</xref>). This significant night-time reduction in sleep and increase in hyperactivity is also apparent when combining 5 independent experiments with an LME model to normalize behaviour across datasets (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Although <italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic> larvae also sleep less at night (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), the large day-time reduction in sleep observed in <italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic> larvae is absent in <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> animals, perhaps due to differences in genetic background that affect behaviour. Because the <italic>dmist<sup>vir</sup></italic> is likely a hypomorphic allele, we focused subsequent experiments on the CRISPR-generated <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> larvae.</p>
<p>To test whether the increased night-time activity of <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> mutants persists in older animals, we raised <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> mutants with their heterozygous and wild type siblings to adulthood in the same tank and tracked individual behaviour for several days on a 14:10 light:dark cycle. As in larval stages, <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> adults were hyperactive relative to both <italic>dmist<sup>i8/+</sup></italic> and <italic>dmist<sup>+/+</sup></italic> siblings, maintaining a higher mean speed at night (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J-L</xref>). This suggests that either Dmist affects a sleep/wake regulatory circuit during development that is permanently altered in <italic>dmist</italic> mutants, or that Dmist is continuously required to maintain normal levels of night-time locomotor activity.</p>

Using the multiple sequence alignment tool MAFFT to align the zebrafish, mouse, and human Dmist peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Katoh and Toh, 2010</xref>) and seeding a JackHMMR iterative search of the Uniprot database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>) found distant homology between Dmist and Fxyd1/Phospholemman (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), a small transmembrane domain peptide that regulates ion channels and pumps, including the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Crambert et al., 2002</xref>).

<p>Using <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation, we found that <italic>fxyd1</italic> is expressed in cells along the brain ventricle and choroid plexus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) in contrast to the neuronal expression of <italic>dmist</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Despite these different expression patterns, based on their sequence similarity we reasoned that Fxyd1 and Dmist may regulate the same molecular processes that are involved in sleep. To test this hypothesis, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a 28 bp deletion in the third exon of the zebrafish <italic>fxyd1</italic> gene, causing a frameshift that is predicted to encode a truncated protein that lacks the FXYD, transmembrane, and C-terminal domains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Contrary to a previous report based on morpholino knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>fxyd1<sup>Δ28/Δ28</sup></italic> larvae were viable with no detectable defect in inflation of the brain ventricles. We therefore tested <italic>fxyd1</italic> mutant larvae for sleep phenotypes. Like <italic>dmist</italic> mutants, <italic>fxyd1<sup>Δ28/Δ28</sup></italic> larvae slept less at night (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-F</xref>). Interestingly, this sleep loss is mainly due to shorter sleep bouts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating that <italic>fxyd1</italic> mutants initiate sleep normally but do not properly maintain it, unlike <italic>dmist</italic> mutants, which initiate fewer night-time sleep bouts, although in both cases there is consolidation of the wake state at night (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). Thus, despite the non-neuronal expression of <italic>fxyd1</italic> in the brain, mutation of the gene most closely related to <italic>dmist</italic> results in a similar sleep phenotype.</p>

<title>The brain-wide Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump alpha subunit Atp1a3a regulates sleep at night</title>
<p>Given the similarity between Dmist and Fxyd1 and their effects on night-time sleep, we hypothesized that mutations in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump subunits known to interact with Fxyd1 might also affect sleep. Consistent with this hypothesis, a low dose of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump inhibitor, ouabain, reduced night-time sleep in dose-response studies (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>). When applied in the late afternoon of 6 dpf, 1 µM ouabain decreased subsequent night-time sleep by 16.5% relative to controls, an effect size consistent with those observed in <italic>dmist</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, C</xref>). Night-time waking activity was also significantly increased after low-dose ouabain exposure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, D</xref>). Ouabain binds to specific sites within the first extracellular domain of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump alpha subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Price and Lingrel, 1988</xref>), and species-specific changes to these sites confers species-specific ouabain resistance, as in the case of two naturally occurring amino acid substitutions present in the Atp1a1 subunit of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dostanic et al., 2004</xref>). Alignment of the ouabain sensitive region of zebrafish and mouse Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump alpha subunits revealed that zebrafish Atp1a1a lacks the conserved Glutamine at position 121 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that one of the other subunits with conserved ouabain-binding sites is responsible for the low dose ouabain sleep effects. We focused on the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump alpha-3 subunit (Atp1a3), as this has been shown to directly interact with Fxyd1 in mammalian brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feschenko et al., 2003</xref>). Murine <italic>Dmist</italic> expression also correlates well with the <italic>Atp1a3</italic> distribution across 5 brain cell types in mouse (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.63), which has the strongest correlation score with neuronal markers (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref> compared to <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F</xref>).

<p>Zebrafish have two Atp1a3 paralogs, <italic>atp1a3a</italic> and <italic>atp1a3b</italic>. Similar to <italic>dmist</italic>, <italic>atp1a3a</italic> is widely expressed in the larval zebrafish brain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, compare to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). While <italic>atp1a3b</italic> is also expressed in the zebrafish brain, its expression is more limited to regions of the midbrain and hindbrain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). To test whether these genes are involved in regulating zebrafish sleep, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to isolate an allele of <italic>atp1a3a</italic> containing a 19 bp deletion and an allele of <italic>atp1a3b</italic> containing a 14 bp deletion. Both mutations are predicted to generate null alleles due to deletion of the start codon (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5D</xref>). Both <italic>atp1a3a <sup>Δ19/Δ19</sup></italic> and <italic>atp1a3b <sup>Δ14/Δ14</sup></italic> mutant larvae were healthy and viable through early development, although atp1a3b mutant larvae were not obtained at Mendelian ratios. Contrary to a previous report based on morpholino injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Doǧanli et al., 2013</xref>), neither mutant had defects in the inflation of their brain ventricles. Sleep-wake tracking experiments found that <italic>atp1a3b <sup>Δ14/Δ14</sup></italic> mutants were more active during the day with minimal sleep phenotypes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E-G</xref>). In contrast, mutation of <italic>atp1a3a</italic> resulted in large effects on sleep-wake behaviour. Compared to wild type and heterozygous mutant siblings, <italic>atp1a3a<sup>Δ19/Δ19</sup></italic> animals were hyperactive throughout the day and night and had a large reduction in sleep at night (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H, I</xref>). The night-time sleep reduction was due to a reduction in the length of sleep bouts, as <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutants even had a small increase in the number of sleep bouts at night (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). In conclusion, loss of <italic>atp1a3a</italic> results in sleep loss at night, similar to treatment with the small molecule <italic>ouabain</italic>, and to <italic>dmist</italic> and <italic>fxyd1</italic> mutants. Notably, the <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutant phenotype is much stronger, as might be expected if Dmist plays a modulatory, and Atp1a3a a more central, role in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump activity.</p>

<title>Dmist modulates Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump function and neuronal activity-induced sleep homeostasis</title>
<p>The similar night-time reduction in sleep in <italic>dmist</italic> and <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutants, combined with the similarities between Dmist and Fxyd1, suggested that Dmist may regulate the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump. We therefore exposed wild type and mutant larvae to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a GABA-receptor antagonist that leads to globally heightened neuronal activity and elevated intracellular sodium levels that must be renormalized by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump activity. Consistent with the hypothesis that Dmist and Atp1a3a subunits are important for a fully functional Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, brains from both <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> and <italic>atp1a3a<sup>Δ19/Δ19</sup></italic> larvae had elevated intracellular sodium levels after exposure to PTZ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Thus, neither <italic>dmist</italic> nor <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutants were able to restore intracellular sodium balance after sustained neuronal activity as quickly as wild type siblings. Consistent with the night-specific alterations in sleep behaviour, we also found that baseline brain Na<sup>+</sup> levels in <italic>dmist</italic> mutants were significantly elevated at night but not during the day (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Collectively, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that night-time sleep duration is affected by changes in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump function and that Dmist is required to maintain this function both at night and after sustained high levels of neuronal activity.</p>
<p>We have previously shown in zebrafish that a brief exposure to hyperactivity-inducing drugs such as the epileptogenic PTZ or wake-promoting caffeine induces a dose-dependent increase in homeostatic rebound sleep following drug washout that is phenotypically and mechanistically similar to rebound sleep following physical sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Reichert et al., 2019</xref>). Based on their exaggerated intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> levels following exposure to PTZ, we predicted that <italic>dmist</italic> mutants would also have increased rebound sleep in response to heightened neuronal activity. Upon wash-on/wash-off of lower dose (5 mM) PTZ, sleep rebound occurs in approximately 50% of wild type larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Reichert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C, D</xref>). In contrast, all <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> larvae showed increased rebound sleep compared to <italic>dmist<sup>+/+</sup></italic> sibling controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-E</xref>). Taken together with the elevated sodium retention experiments, such increases in rebound sleep induced by neuronal activity suggests that <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> fish more rapidly accumulate sleep pressure in response to heightened neuronal activity.</p>
<p>Finally, we predicted that if Dmist is affecting baseline sleep via modulation of Atp1a3a-containing Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps, <italic>dmist</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>atp1a3a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> double mutants should have a reduction in night-time sleep that is not the sum of effects from either mutant alone. In other words, if Dmist and Atp1a3a are acting in separate pathways, the double mutant would have an additive phenotype, but if Dmist and Atp1a3a act together in the same complex/pathway, the mutant phenotypes should be non-additive. Indeed, <italic>dmist</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>atp1a3a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants have a sleep reduction similar to that of <italic>atp1a3a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants alone, consistent with a non-additive effect (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>). Similar non-additivity can be also observed in the <italic>dmist</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>atp1a3a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> animals, which, like <italic>atp1a3a</italic><sup>+/-</sup> animals alone, have a milder sleep reduction, indicating that the lack of additivity between dmist and atp1a3a phenotypes is unlikely due to a floor effect, since double homozygous mutants can sleep even less (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). This genetic interaction data is consistent with our hypothesis that Atp1a3a and Dmist act in the same pathway—the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump--to influence sleep.</p>

<title>Genetic screening discovers <italic>dmist</italic>, a novel sleep-regulatory gene</title>
<p>Using a reverse genetic viral screening strategy, we discovered a short-sleeping mutant, <italic>dmist</italic>, which has a disruption in a previously uncharacterized gene encoding a small transmembrane peptide. Given that the <italic>dmist</italic> mutant appeared within the limited number of 25 lines that we screened, it is likely that many other sleep genes are still waiting to be discovered in future screens. In zebrafish, one promising screening strategy will be to employ CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to systematically target candidate genes. Advances in the efficiency of this technology now makes it feasible to perform a CRISPR “F0 screen” in which the consequences of bi-allelic, gene-specific mutations are rapidly tested in the first generation, with only the most promising lines pursued in germline-transmitted mutant lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Grunwald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jao et al., 2013</xref>; Kroll et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shankaran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). CRISPR F0 screens could be scaled to systematically target the large number of candidate sleep-regulatory genes identified through human GWAS studies and sequencing of human patients suffering from insomnia and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allebrandt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dashti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jansen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Jones et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Palagini et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Dmist is related to the Na+/K+ pump regulator Fxyd1</title>
<p>The small Dmist transmembrane protein is highly conserved across vertebrates, expressed in neurons, and important for maintaining normal sleep levels. How can such a small, single pass transmembrane protein lacking any clear functional domains modulate the function of neurons and ultimately animal behaviour? The recognition that Dmist has sequence homology (∼35% amino acid similarity; a conserved ‘RRR’ motif in the C-terminus) and structural homology (e.g. signal peptide and single pass transmembrane domains) to the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump regulator Fxyd1 (Phospholemman) offers some important clues.</p>
<p>Fxyd1/Phospholemman is a member of the FXYD protein family, of which there are seven mammalian members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sweadner and Rael, 2000</xref>). Each of the FXYD proteins is small, contains a characteristic FXYD domain, and has a single transmembrane domain. FXYD family members interact with alpha subunits of the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup> ATPase to regulate the function of this pump, with individual family members expressed in different tissues to modulate Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity depending on the physiological needs of the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Geering et al., 2003</xref>). In cardiac muscle, FXYD1 is thought to act as a hub through which various signalling cascades, such as PKA, PKC, or nitric oxide, can activate or inhibit Na<sup>+</sup> pump activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pavlovic et al., 2013</xref>). For example, FXYD1 is critical for mediating the increased Na<sup>+</sup> pump activity observed after β-receptor stimulation via cAMP-PKA signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Despa et al., 2008</xref>). Much less is known about the role of FXYD1 in non-cardiac tissue, although it is expressed in neurons in the mammalian cerebellum, the choroid plexus, and ependymal cells, where it interacts with all three alpha subunits of the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feschenko et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In zebrafish, we also found that <italic>fxyd1</italic> is expressed in cells around the ventricles and in the choroid plexus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), in contrast to <italic>dmist</italic> which is expressed in neurons throughout the brain. Despite the different expression patterns, mutation of each gene resulted in a similar reduction of sleep at night. However, unlike <italic>dmist</italic> mutants, which have fewer sleep bouts (i.e. initiate sleep less) and an increase in waking locomotor activity, <italic>fxyd1</italic> mutants have shorter sleep bouts (i.e. cannot maintain sleep) on average and do not have a locomotor activity phenotype. Just as the various FXYD family members modulate the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump in different tissue-and context-specific ways, this phenotypic variation between <italic>fxyd1</italic> and <italic>dmist</italic> mutants could be due to the different <italic>fxyd1</italic> and <italic>dmist</italic> expression patterns, modulation kinetics of pump/channel dynamics, or interaction with different accessory proteins or signal transduction cascades. Nevertheless, the similar timing and magnitude of sleep reduction, combined with the structural similarity of Fxyd1 and Dmist, suggest that they may regulate similar sleep-related processes.</p>

<title>Dmist, the sodium pump, and sleep</title>
<p>The similarity between Dmist and FXYD1 led us to directly manipulate the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup> ATPase to test its importance in sleep. The Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase is the major regulator of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> in all cells and, by actively exchanging two imported K<sup>+</sup> ions for three exported Na<sup>+</sup> ions, is essential for determining cellular resting membrane potential (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clausen et al., 2017</xref>). The Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase consists of a catalytic alpha subunit (4 known isoforms, ATP1A1-4), a supporting beta subunit (3 isoforms, ATP1B1-3), and a regulatory gamma subunit (the FXYD proteins). The alpha1 and alpha3 subunits are the predominant catalytic subunits in neurons (alpha2 is mostly restricted to glia), although the alpha1 subunit is also used ubiquitously in all tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">McGrail et al., 1991</xref>). By mutating zebrafish orthologs of <italic>Atp1a3</italic>, we therefore could test the neuronal-specific role of the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in sleep.</p>
<p>Mutations in both zebrafish <italic>Atp1a3</italic> orthologs increased waking locomotor behaviour during the day. However, only mutations in <italic>atp1a3a,</italic> which is expressed brain-wide, but not in <italic>atp1a3b</italic>, which is expressed in more restricted brain regions, led to changes in night-time sleep. The <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutants have a larger sleep reduction than <italic>dmist<sup>vir</sup></italic>, <italic>dmist<sup>i8</sup></italic>, or <italic>fxyd1<sup>Δ28</sup></italic> mutants, which is expected since loss of a pump subunit should have a larger effect than the loss of a modulatory subunit, as has been shown for other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cirelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Autosomal dominant missense mutations leading to loss of function in <italic>ATP1A3</italic> cause movement disorders such as rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism and childhood alternating hemiplegia (recurrent paralysis on one side) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Canfield et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Heinzen et al., 2014</xref>), while loss of function mutations in <italic>Atp1a3</italic> result in generalised seizures and locomotor abnormalities, including hyperactivity, in mice, which was not observed in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clapcote et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hunanyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ikeda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kirshenbaum et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sugimoto et al., 2014</xref>). A very high prevalence of insomnia was recently reported in patients with childhood alternating hemiplegia, some of which harboured mutations in <italic>Atp1a3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kansagra et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with our observations that insomnia at night is a direc behavioural consequence of <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutation in zebrafish. Since zebrafish <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutants phenocopy the insomnia and hyperactivity phenotypes observed in patients, small molecule screens aimed at ameliorating zebrafish <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutant phenotypes may be a promising approach for the rapid identification of new therapies for the management of this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hoffman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rihel et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, the night-specific sleep phenotypes of <italic>dmist</italic>, <italic>fxyd1</italic>, and <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutants point to a role for the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase in boosting sleep at night. How might the alpha3 catalytic subunit of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump regulate sleep, and how could Dmist be involved? We found that Dmist is required for proper maintenance of brain intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> levels at night but not during the day, mirroring the timing of sleep disruption in <italic>dmist<sup>i8/i8</sup></italic> animals. This suggests that the decreased night-time sleep of <italic>dmist</italic> mutants is due to a specific requirement for Dmist modulation of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump at night. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Dmist’s function is required in only a subset of critical sleep/wake regulatory neurons during the day that then influence behaviour at night, such as the wake-active, sleep-homeostatic regulating serotonergic neurons of the raphe (Oikonomou et al., 2019) or wake-promoting Hcrt/orexin neurons (Li et al., 2022). Another possibility is that disruption of proper establishment of the Na<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient in <italic>dmist</italic> mutant neurons leads to dysfunction of various neurotransmitter reuptake transporters, including those for glycine, GABA, glutamate, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which rely on energy from the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A third possibility is that Dmist and the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase regulate sleep not by modulation of neuronal activity per se but rather via modulation of extracellular ion concentrations. Recent work has demonstrated that interstitial ions fluctuate across the sleep/wake cycle in mice. For example, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> is high during wakefulness, and cerebrospinal fluid containing the ion concentrations found during wakefulness directly applied to the brain can locally shift neuronal activity into wake-like states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). Given that the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase actively exchanges Na<sup>+</sup> ions for K<sup>+</sup>, the high intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> levels we observe in <italic>atp1a3a</italic> and <italic>dmist</italic> mutants is likely accompanied by high extracellular K<sup>+</sup>. Although we can only speculate at this time, a model in which extracellular ions that accumulate during wakefulness and then directly signal onto sleep-regulatory neurons could provide a direct link between Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup> ATPase activity, neuronal firing, and sleep homeostasis. Such a model could also explain why disruption of Fxyd1 in non-neuronal cells also leads to a reduction in night-time sleep.</p>
<p>In addition to decreased night-time sleep, we also observed that <italic>dmist</italic> mutants have an exaggerated sleep rebound response following the high, widespread neuronal activity induced by the GABA-receptor antagonist, PTZ. Since both Atp1a3a and Dmist were essential for re-establishing proper brain intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> levels following PTZ exposure (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), we speculate that the exaggerated sleep rebound is a consequence of increased neuronal depolarization due to defective Na<sup>+</sup> pump activity. This is consistent with our previous observations that the intensity of brain-wide neuronal activity impacts the magnitude of subsequent sleep rebound via engagement of the Galanin sleep-homeostatic output arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Reichert et al., 2019</xref>). Why does loss of <italic>dmist</italic> lead to both decreased night-time sleep and increased sleep rebound in response to exaggerated neuronal activity during the day? One possibility is that Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump complexes made up of different alpha and beta subunits may be differentially required for maintaining Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis under physiological conditions and have different affinities for (or regulation by) Dmist. For example, the Atp1a1 subunit is considered the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump workhorse in neurons, while Atp1a3, which has a lower affinity for Na<sup>+</sup> ions, plays an essential role in repolarizing neurons when Na<sup>+</sup> rapidly increases during high levels of neuronal activity, such as after a seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Azarias et al., 2013</xref>). If Dmist preferentially interacts with Atp1a3a subunit, with which the non-additive effect of <italic>dmist</italic> and <italic>atp1a3a</italic> mutation on sleep is consistent, day-time sleep-related phenotypes in <italic>dmist</italic> mutants might be uncovered only during physiological challenge. Conversely, neurons may be more dependent on Atp1a3a and Dmist for sodium homeostasis at night due to changes in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump composition, Dmist interactions, or ion binding affinities. For example, activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump can be modulated by the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Damulewicz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Nakashima et al., 2018</xref>), changes in substrate availability, including ATP (reviewed in Therien and Blostein, 2000), or hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ewart and Klip, 1995</xref>). Teasing out how Dmist modulation of the Na+/K+ pump changes across the day-night cycle, and in which neurons Dmist’s function may be particularly important at night, will require future investigation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, through a genetic screening strategy in zebrafish, we have identified a novel brain expressed gene that encodes a small transmembrane protein regulator of night-time sleep and wake behaviours. Future work will be required to uncover the precise signalling dynamics by which Dmist regulates the Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and sleep.</p>

<title>Larval Zebrafish Behavioural Tracking</title>
<p>At 4 days post fertilisation (dpf), zebrafish larvae were placed into individual wells of a 96-square well plate (WHA 7701-1651 Sigma-Aldrich) filled with 650 μl of embryo water per well and tracked for 3 days under a 14:10 light:dark schedule (lights on-09:00, lights off-23:00) using automated videotracking in ViewPoint ZebraBoxes (Viewpoint Life Sciences). The 96-well plate was under constant illumination with infrared LEDs, and white LEDs simulated the light:dark schedule. Videography (with one-third inch Dragonfly2 PointGrey monochrome camera, frame rate: 25-30 Hz; fixed-angle megapixel lens, Computar M5018-MP) of individual behavior was recorded in quantization mode to detect movement by background subtraction between frames in individual wells with 60 second integration time bins. Parameters used for detection were calibrated according to the sensitivity of individual boxes but were in the following range: detection threshold, 15-20; burst, 50 pixels; freeze, 3-4 pixels. Embryo water in the wells was topped up daily with fresh water, and ambient room temperature was maintained at approximately 26°C. Output data was sorted, parsed and analysed by custom Perl and Matlab scripts (MATLAB R2016 version 9.1, The MathWorks), as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rihel et al. 2010</xref>.</p>
<p>Oxygen-permeable lids (Applied Biosystems 4311971) were applied over the top of the 96-well plate when performing experiments in constant darkness, and the larvae were left undisturbed for the duration of the experiment to avoid light exposure.

<p>Fish from a <italic>dmist<sup>i8/+</sup></italic> x <italic>dmist<sup>i8/+</sup></italic> cross were raised in a mixed gender tank to adulthood. Zebrafish adults (aged 3-4 months) were randomly selected and tracked on a 14:10 light:dark cycle (180 lux at water surface, lit from above) for three days as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, fish were placed into uncovered plastic chambers (7×12×8.5 cm; WxLxH) with small holes for water exchange, and these were placed in a circulating water tank (46×54 cm with 4.5 cm water height). This setup was supplied with fish water from the home aquarium heated to 28°C and pumped from a 45 L reservoir at a flow rate of 1.3 L/min. Infrared light (60 degree, 54 LED Video Camera Red Infrared Illuminator Lamp, SourcingMap, with the ambient light detector covered) was continuously supplied from below. Fish were tracked at 15 Hz using Viewpoint Life Sciences ZebraBox tracking software in tracking mode, with a background threshold of 40, inactive cut-off of 1.3 cm/sec, and a small movement cut-off of 8 cm/sec. Each track was visually inspected for errors at one-minute resolution across the entire session and analysed using custom Matlab scripts (MATLAB R2016 version 9.1, The Mathworks, Inc). Experiments were performed blind to genotype, which was determined by fin-clip after the experiment. Females and males were originally analysed separately; since no significant gender effect was found (two-way ANOVA, genotypeXgender), data from both genders were pooled for the final analysis.</p>

<title>Genotyping</title>
<p>Prior to genotyping, adult fish were anaesthetised in 30 μg/ml MS-222, fin-clipped by cutting a small section of the caudal fin, and then allowed to recover in fresh fish water. For pooled experiments, 3 dpf larvae from heterozygous in-crosses were fin-clipped as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wilkinson et al., 2013</xref> and allowed to recover in a square 96-well plate to keep larvae separate prior to pooling larvae of the same genotype. Genomic DNA was extracted from adult fin clips and larvae by boiling for 30 minutes in 50 μl 1X base solution (0.025 M KOH, 0.2 mM EDTA). Once cooled, an equal volume (50 μl) of neutralisation buffer (0.04 M Tris-HCl) was then added and undiluted genomic DNA used for genotyping.</p>
<p>The <italic>dmist<sup>vir</sup></italic> genotype was detected by PCR (standard conditions) using a cocktail of three primers (0.36 mM final concentration each primer) to detect the wild type allele and viral insertion (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) so that genotypes could be assigned according to size of bands detected (<italic>dmist<sup>vir/vir</sup></italic> 800 bp; <italic>dmist<sup>vir/+</sup></italic> 508 bp and 800bp; <italic>dmist<sup>+/+</sup></italic> 508 bp).</p>

<title>Sodium Green Assay</title>
<p>Cell permanent Sodium Green tetraacetate (Invitrogen, S 6901) was prepared fresh from frozen stock by dissolving in DMSO to 1 mM then diluting in fish water to a final concentration of 10 µM. About 50 larvae (5-7 dpf) from <italic>atp1a3a<sup>Δ19/+</sup></italic> or dmist<italic><sup>i8/</sup></italic><sup>+</sup> in-crosses were placed in wells of a 6 well plate, then most fish water was removed and replaced with 3 mL of the 10 µM Sodium Green solution for two hours. During exposure, the plate was covered in foil and placed in a 28°C incubator. For PTZ experiments, larvae were also exposed to 10 mM PTZ (diluted from 1 mM stock dissolved in water) for two hours. For timepoints at night (ZT17-19), larvae were handled and collected under red light. After soaking in Sodium Green, larvae were washed 3X with fish water, anaesthetised with MS-2222, and fixed in 4% PFA/4% sucrose overnight at 4°C. After 3X wash in PBS, larval brains were dissected and placed in 200 µL PBS in a 48 well plate, and the matched bodies were used for genotyping (see <italic>Genotyping</italic>). Brains were imaged using an upright MVX10 MacroView microscope with an MC PLAPO 1x objective (both OLYMPUS) with a mercury lamp for fluorescent excitation at 488 nm (OLYMPUS, U-HGLGPS). Images of roughly the same focal plane (dorsal/ventral view) were taken with an XM10 OLYMPUS camera by a single exposure following minimal light exposure (to avoid bleaching). Mean fluorescent intensity was calculated from ROIs placed on the optic tectum/midbrain using ImageJ, background subtracted and normalized to the average fluorescence intensity for each imaging session.</p>

<caption><title>A viral insertion screen for sleep-wake regulators</title>
<p>A) Schematic of screening strategy. Candidate genes were selected from a list of 904 mammalian genes encoding protein classes most often linked to behavioural regulation, including 1) genes previously implicated in sleep and circadian rhythms; 2) G-protein coupled receptors; 3) neuropeptide ligands; 4) channels; and 5) proteins involved in post-translational regulation, such as de-ubiquitinating enzymes (Supplemental Data 1). tBLASTN of the human protein sequences identified 1162 zebrafish orthologs (Zv6), of which 702 (60.4%) had viral insertions mapped in the ‘Zenemark’ zebrafish viral insertion library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Varshney et al., 2013</xref>). Sperm harbouring viral insertions in 25 loci were successfully used for <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization and propagated to the F3 generation for screening. F3 larvae from single family F2 in-crosses were monitored on a 14hr:10hr light:dark cycle from 4-7 dpf using videography and genotyped at the end of the experiment.</p><p>B-C) Histogram of total daytime sleep (B) and average daytime waking activity (C) normalized as standard deviations from the mean (Z-score) of all the viral-insertion lines tested (including heterozygous <italic>vir/+</italic> and homozygous <italic>vir/vir</italic>).

<p>Barlow et al performed a viral insertion screen in larval zebrafish for sleep mutants. They identify a mutant named dreammist (dmist) that displayed defects in sleep, namely, decreased sleep both day and night, accompanied by increased activity. They find that dmist encodes a previously uncharacterized single-pass transmembrane protein that shows structural similarity to Fxyd1, a Na+K+-ATPase regulator. They go on to show that genetic manipulations of either FXYD1 or the Na/K pump also reduce sleep. They use pharmacology and sleep deprivation experiments to provide further evidence that the NA/K pump regulates intracellular sodium and rebound sleep.</p>
<p>This study provides additional evidence for the important role of membrane excitability in sleep regulation. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, with the following strengths and weaknesses as described below.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Elegant use of CRISPR knockout methods to disrupt multiple genes that help establish the importance of regulating Na+K+-ATPase function in sleep.</p>
<p>
Data are mostly clearly presented.</p>
<p>
Double mutant analysis of dmist and atp1a3a help establish an epistatic relationship between these proteins.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors emphasize the role of increased cellular sodium. It will be interesting to also see the consequences of perturbating potassium. The potassium channel shaker has been previously identified as a critical sleep regulator in Drosophila.</p>
