<title>Summary</title><p>Previously, Tuller et al. found that the first 30 to 50 codons of the genes of yeast and other eukaryotes are slightly enriched for rare codons, so are presumably translated somewhat slowly. They argued, based on informatics, that this initial slow translation “ramp” was adaptive; and that it increased the efficiency of translation by provided a queuing mechanism to prevent ribosome collisions. Today, the translational speeds of the various codons are known, and indeed rare codons are translated slowly. We re-examined the slow translation ramp. We confirm the finding of Tuller et al. that the 5’ region of genes is enriched for rare codons. However, we also find that the 5’ ends of yeast genes are poorly conserved in evolution, suggesting that they are unstable and turn over relatively rapidly. When a new 5’ end forms <italic>de novo</italic>, it is likely to include codons that would otherwise be rare. Because evolution has had a relatively short time to select against these codons, 5’ ends are typically slightly enriched for rare, slow codons. Opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al., we show by direct experiment that genes with slowly translated codons at the 5’ end are expressed relatively poorly, and substituting faster codons improves expression. Further informatic studies suggest that for natural genes, slow 5’ ends are correlated with poor gene expression, opposite to the expectation of Tuller et al. Thus we conclude that slow 5’ translation is a “spandrel”; it is a non-adaptive consequence of something else, in this case the turnover of 5’ ends in evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuller et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> were interested in the idea that a slow translational ramp at the beginning of a gene might queue ribosomes in an orderly way, thereby preventing ribosome traffic jams and collisions. However, at that time, translation speeds for the 61 sense codons were not known from direct measurement. Therefore, as a proxy for codon translation speed, Tuller et al. devised a proxy speed measurement based on the tRNA-adaptation index (tAI), a measure of the abundance of each tRNA. The assumption is that codons recognized by more abundant tRNAs would be translated faster. Using this proxy, Tuller et al. found that in yeast and other eukaryotes, the first 30 to 100 codons are enriched for codons for which tRNAs are rare (generally, rare codons), and are presumably translated slowly. The size of the effect is small (about a 3% difference, Tuller et al. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), but is statistically significant.</p>
<p>At the time of the work of Tuller et al., ribosome profiling had recently been developed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, and early ribosome profiling results showed a very high density of ribosomes near the 5’ end of the mRNA, consistent with very slow translation in this region, which could have been partly explained by the results of Tuller et al. However, later work showed that this 5’ high density of ribosomes was an artefact of the way cycloheximide was used to arrest translation in the original protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. With newer protocols for ribosome profiling, the region of 5’ high ribosome density largely disappears (but it does not entirely disappear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> (see Discussion)).</p>
<p>Since then, many workers have used ribosome profiling to directly measure the speed of translation of individual codons (cited below). With such data in hand, we re-visited the issues addressed by Tuller et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. On the one hand, our analyses confirm that the 5’ regions of genes are typically slightly enriched for rare codons, and these encodings likely slow translation. On the other hand, various aspects of the data led us to an alternative hypothesis, namely that the 5’ ends were turning over relatively rapidly in evolution; that these 5’ ends were therefore relatively young; and that selection had not yet succeeded in removing all the rare, slow codons initially present in the <italic>de novo</italic> 5’ ends. We did a direct experimental test of the effects of slow or fast initial translation. Exactly opposite to Tuller et al., we found that encoding slow initial translation resulted in lower protein production than fast initial translation. This continued to be true even when we placed ribosome collision sites inside the reporter gene. Thus a slow initial translation ramp, though present, does not improve gene expression.</p>
<p>It is natural to assume that the enrichment of slow codons near 5’ ends is a product of selection. However, as elegantly argued by Gould and Lewontin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> in their classic paper “The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptionist Programme”, not all biological phenomena are adaptive, or even a direct product of selection. They argued from the example of a “spandrel”: in architecture, a triangular space created when an arch supports a lintel. There is no architectural role for spandrels as such; they are the indirect and inevitable result of the juxtaposition of two other functional architectural elements. We argue that the slow initial translation of eukaryotic genes may likewise be a spandrel, a non-adaptive consequence of something else, the instability of 5’ ends in evolution.</p>

<title>Calculations of encoded translation speed imply slow initial translation</title>
<p>Tuller et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> used codon-specific tRNA abundance as a proxy to estimate speed of translation of codons. Since then, analysis of ribosome profiling data has yielded direct measurements of the translation speed of individual codons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we have repeated some of the work of Tuller et al., but using the Ribosome Residence Time (RRT, Methods and Materials, Table S1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> of each of the 61 sense codons as a measure of translation speed. We refer to “encoded translation speed” to specify that we are focusing purely on the effects of different codons on translation speed, and not on other factors that might differentially affect translation speed at different regions of the mRNA.</p>
<p>Using the RRT, encoded translation speeds were calculated in sliding windows across all coding ORFs from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. (The start codon was omitted because it is constant across genes and is an unusually “fast” codon.) Consistent with Tuller et al., we find that the first 30-100 codons had significantly lower calculated translation speeds than the rest of the gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We focused our analyses on the first 40 codons for comparability to Tuller et al.; we call this the “Slow Initial Translation” region, or SIT. Although the tendency towards slow translation near the beginning of the gene is very highly statistically significant, the size of the effect is small. When we compare the first 40 codons of a gene to the rest of the same gene, we find that the average difference in encoded translation speed is about 1.2% (similar to <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>), with a p-value &lt; 0.001. For comparison, codons can vary in translation speed by about two-fold (Table S1), or perhaps as much as 6-fold (Weinberg et al., their <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>, also shown in our Table S1).</p>

The horizontal line indicates average inverse RRT across all ORFs. The average speed in the first 40 amino acids is about 1.1% slower than in the rest of the gene (p &lt; 0.001)</p></caption>

Each of the 61 sense codons is displayed along the X-axis, grouped by amino acid.

</fig>
<p>In the first 40 codons, we saw notable depletion of AUG (by nearly 50%), ATT, and ATC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These are all fast codons, and their depletion would lead to slower translation. But AUG is the usual Start codon, and ATT and ATC can also be used as Start codons. Possibly these codons are depleted to reduce the possibility of translation initiating at the wrong place. We considered whether the SIT might be due to depletion of Start codons. We recalculated translation speeds after assigning AUG a neutral speed. On the one hand, this did reduce the difference in translation speed between the SIT and the rest of the gene by about 13% of the difference, but even so, the slow initial translation was highly significant. Thus, bias against Start codons contributes only modestly to slow translation.</p>
<p>We also saw enrichments of all six arginine codons (very likely because of their use in N-terminal signal sequences, data not shown), especially the slow, rare codons CGA, CGC, and CGG. Slow, rare codons for proline (CCC, CCG), leucine (CTC), glycine (GGG) and cysteine (TGC) were also enriched (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Rare codons are rare in the first 40 codons, just not as rare as elsewhere</title>
<p>Although the proportion of rare, slow codons in the SITs is relatively higher than the proportion of rare codons in the body of genes, in absolute terms rare codons are still rare compared to more common synonymous codons (e.g., <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, Leu codons). That is, rare, slow codons are still strongly disfavored in the SIT, though they are less strongly disfavored than elsewhere. This was true for all rare codons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Why are there relatively more rare, slow codons at 5’ ends?</title>
<p>Our analysis is consistent with that of Tuller et al. to the extent that we find a slight relative enrichment of rare, slow codons near the 5’ ends of coding regions. Tuller et al. interpret the slow translation ramp as an adaptation—they believe there is selection for slow codons near the 5’ end to enhance efficiency of translation. But there are other possibilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>The Young Spandrel Hypothesis</title>
<p>We have noticed (see below) that the N-termini of yeast genes are often poorly conserved, and otherwise highly homologous genes often vary at the N-termini between different closely-related species. This suggests a different idea: N-termini are unstable and variable in evolution. They form <italic>de novo</italic> from new DNA sequence, and so all codons may initially occur at similar frequencies. Since these N-termini are, on average, younger than the remainder of the gene, selection has worked on them for a shorter time. Therefore selection against rare, slow codons may be less complete, and N-termini, due to their relative youth, may still retain some extra rare codons.</p>
<p>In this idea, in contrast to Tuller et al., the slight excess of rare codons near N-termini is not adaptive; it is not at all a product of selection. Instead, in the words of Gould and Lewontin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, it is a spandrel. It is a non-adaptive by-product of something else, in this case the evolutionary instability of N-termini. This idea is explored below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Poor 5’ conservation is a feature of many yeast genes</title>
<p>To illustrate the idea, we picked example genes. We used protein-protein BLAST at NCBI to blast several query genes against species of the subphylum <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> (but having subtracted out all of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows that for these chosen example genes, the middle portions of the proteins are highly conserved, but the N-termini are not. We suggest that these non-conserved N-terminal regions are young in evolution, and therefore likely contain an excess of rare codons.</p>

Top hits are shown. Red regions indicate homology with an alignment score &gt; 200, while white indicates no detected homology (BLAST default parameters).

</fig>
<p>In the next section, we ask whether the findings of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> can be generalized to proteins of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Method of scoring N-terminal conservation, and rationale for using Saccharomycotina</title>
<p>We continued our investigations into N-termini, protein conservation, and translation speed using a more systematic approach. We ran local protein-protein BLAST for all <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes against a database consisting of the <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> subphylum, omitting <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> was chosen because almost every gene from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has a recognizable, conserved homolog in almost every species in <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic>, and yet the evolutionary distances are long enough that there is considerable sequence variability. We excluded species of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> as they are too closely related to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and they are also very numerous in the database, and would overwhelm results from the other members of <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic>. We believe, however, that this particular choice of subphylum does not greatly affect the final result.</p>
<p>Conservation at the N-terminus was calculated as the weighted proportion of yeast species with sequence matches (a match by default BLAST parameters) beginning in the first 40 amino acids. The lowest conservation score is 0 (no hits in the first 40 amino acids), whereas the highest conservation score is 40 indicating that every species had a match (default BLAST parameters) starting at the first amino acid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">S3</xref>). The length of genes is negatively correlated with the N-termini conservation score (rho= −0.47; p&lt;0.001)—that is, short genes tended to have more conserved N-termini.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>N-termini are variable and poorly conserved</title>
<p>We measured protein conservation across more than 3,000 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins with orthologues among 822 closely related yeasts from <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic>. For each protein, we developed a conservation score for the first 40 amino acids to represent the N-termini, an equivalent conservation score for the middle 40 amino acids, and an equivalent conservation score for the C-terminal 40 amino acids (Methods and Materials; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, the N-termini of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> orthologs had conservation scores that were much lower, and very differently distributed than the middle of the same orthologs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The first 40 amino acids had a flat distribution of protein conservation scores, indicating high levels of variability amongst these orthologs. That is, many of the orthologs had no detectable homology with the first 40 amino acids of the <italic>cerevisiae</italic> protein.</p>

Scores range from 0 (no conservation) to 40 (perfect conservation). The frequency of each conservation score (3964 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins) was plotted.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="497802v2_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In contrast, the middle 40 amino acids were highly conserved, with conservations scores peaking at 40. It Is evident that for the middle 40 amino acids, a large fraction of orthologs had a region of high homology to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein, whereas this was not true for the N-termini. Finally, the last 40 amino acids had conservation scores similar to those of the first 40 amino acids, though a bit higher (more conserved) (see <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref> for a comparison). These results suggest both ends of the gene “breathe”, gaining and losing new sequences during evolution, whilst the middles of the same genes stay constant. Thus the ends of the genes are younger than the middles. At their first formation, they would likely have contained some rare codons, which selection may not yet have had time to remove.</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>5’ translation speeds positively correlate with 5’ conservation scores</title>
<p>If the “Young Spandrel” hypothesis is true, and slow 5’ translation is caused by evolutionary instability of 5’ ends, then there should be a correlation between encoded slow translation, and poor N-terminal conservation. Our model predicts the newest N-termini to have the lowest conservation and the rarest codons, and, vice versa, the termini with the rarest codons should have the lowest conservation scores. To test this, we ranked all genes by the conservation scores of their first 40 amino acids. We then divided this ranked list into thirds. For each of the thirds (i.e., the bottom, middle, and top conservation scores) we plotted the average relative initial translation speeds.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, the genes with the most poorly conserved N-termini also had the slowest initial translation, while the genes with the most conserved N-termini had the fasted initial translation, supporting the Spandrel hypothesis, and opposite to the Ramp hypothesis.</p>

<p>We also looked at the correlation in the other direction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). We ranked genes by their relative initial translation speed, and divided the ranked list into thirds, then plotted N-terminal conservation scores. Again the effects are correlated: genes with the slowest initial translation have the lowest N-terminal conservation scores. Thus, overall, there is a strong correlation between N-terminal instability (i.e., newness in evolution, low conservation scores) and slow initial translation (i.e., the presence of slow/rare codons).</p>

<title>The Ramp hypothesis is inconsistent with observations of ribosome density and gene expression</title>
<p>In the Tuller “Ramp” hypothesis, in which the purpose of the slow translational ramp is to queue ribosomes and prevent collisions, genes with the highest ribosome occupancy would be in the most danger of ribosome collisions, and would therefore presumably have pronounced SITs. SITs might not be necessary on genes with low ribosome density, since there would not be much danger of collision in any case. To test this, we used the Arava et al. 2003 dataset which measured the density of ribosomes on all <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mRNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). We ranked genes by ribosome density, then grouped them in thirds. Opposite to the expectation from the Tuller et al. “Ramp” theory, the genes with the highest ribosome densities had the fastest initial translation, whereas the genes with the lowest ribosome densities had the slowest initial translation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). While these findings are opposite to the expectation of the “Ramp” theory, they are consistent with the spandrel theory, because genes with high ribosome density would be subject to more intense selection against slow codons, thus leading to faster 5’ ends. Furthermore, analysis of Conservation Scores on the same genes showed that the genes with the lowest ribosome densities also had the lowest Conservation Scores (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), as predicted by the Spandrel hypothesis.</p>

<p>Similarly, in the “Ramp” hypothesis, ribosome collisions on highly-expressed genes would presumably have more serious consequences for the cell than collisions on poorly-expressed genes, and so highly expressed genes ought to have the most pronounced SITs. To test this, we used the Lipson et al. 2009 transcriptome dataset which measured the number of mRNA transcripts for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Again, we ranked genes by expression, then grouped them by thirds. Exactly contrary to the “Ramp” hypothesis, we found that genes with the highest expression had the fastest initial translation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In this analysis, the middle and bottom genes are not significantly different from each other; possibly some of the poorly expressed genes are inducible genes that would be highly expressed under some other condition (e.g., the sporulation genes, the <italic>GAL</italic> genes). In addition, the most highly expressed genes had the highest conservation scores, consistent with the Spandrel hypothesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).</p>

<title>Experimentally, encoded slow initial translation does not increase gene expression; the opposite is true</title>
<p>Tuller et al. hypothesized that slow initial translation was adaptive, and improved efficiency of translation and gene expression by minimizing ribosome collisions. However, in the Spandrel hypothesis, slow initial translation is not generated by selection and is not adaptive. It might not have any effect on gene expression, but, if anything, slow translation might reduce gene expression. While informatics is wonderful, it is always nice to do an experiment, and in this section, we present direct experimental results regarding the effect of encoded slow, medium, and fast initial translation on gene expression.</p>
<p>We used a gene expression reporter based on EKD1024<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> (Methods and Materials). In this construct, GFP is the reporter, but for accuracy it is normalized against a divergently transcribed red fluorescent protein (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, GFP expression is reported as a GFP/RFP ratio. Although the reporter is GFP, the N-terminal region of this particular protein is derived from yeast <italic>HIS3</italic>, not GFP, and has little if any effect on the fluorescence of the GFP fused downstream. We used synonymous slow, medium, or fast codons to recode some of the codons in the first 41 amino acids of this GFP reporter to generate three reporters with slow, medium, or fast translation over the first 41 amino acids. The amino acid sequences of the three constructs were identical. The slow, medium, and fast average RRT values over the first 41 codons were 1.20, 1.04, and 0.93, respectively. That is, this SIT is slower than most natural SITs, and this FIT is faster than most natural FITs, but the difference is moderate.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> (left three bars), the SIT did not improve expression of GFP, contrary to Tuller et al. In fact, the GFP with the SIT was expressed at only 71% of the level of the GFP with the FIT. It was surprising to us that the difference was this large—again, recoding was limited to codons within the first 41, and the protein sequences were identical.</p>

<label>Fig. 7.</label>
<caption><p>Slow Initial Translation inhibits gene expression. Left 3 bars. A synthetic GFP was constructed with a leader amino acid sequence that had little effect on GFP. The leader sequence was recoded to give slow (SIT), medium (MIT) or fast (FIT) translation speed over the first 41 amino acids, without changing the amino acid sequence—i.e., the SIT, MIT and FIT had identical amino acid sequences, but different average RRTs. Each construct (SIT, MIT, FIT) was integrated in single copy at the <italic>ADE2</italic> locus, and 25 independently-transformed strains were picked, and GFP fluorescence was measured for each, and the RFP-normalized mean was plotted. GFP was normalized to RFP expressed from the same reporter molecule, but RFP fluorescence hardly changed amongst the transformants, and non-normalized GFP would have given very similar results. Slower initial translation reduced gene expression. Right 3 bars. As above, but a Putative ribosome Collision Site (PCS) (CGA-CGG) was inserted between the leader and the GFP. Again, slower initial translation reduced gene expression.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="497802v2_fig7.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Another possibility is that a SIT can protect against ribosome collisions when there is a site downstream that induces ribosome collisions. Sites thought to induce ribosome collisions include rare Arg-Arg codon pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We therefore introduced the codon pair CGA-CGG (replacing Asn-Asp, AAT-GAT) downstream of the first 41 amino acids, but still upstream of important GFP residues. Indeed, this single CGA-CGG codon pair, potentially inciting ribosome collisions, caused a large reduction--about 50%--in expression of GFP (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, right three bars). The reduction was about same in the SIT, MIT, and FIT constructs. In this case, with putative collision sites, the GFP with the SIT was expressed at only 67% of the level of the equivalent GFP with the FIT. That is, this SIT (a fairly extreme SIT) did not at all protect against the putative ribosome collisions—if anything, it made things worse. This result suggests there is no benefit to “queuing” ribosomes, if “queuing” even occurs. Instead, the fastest-translating gene once again gave the highest expression, despite the collision site.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Tuller et al. found that the 5’ ends of genes are translated slowly because of the codons used at 5’ ends, and posited that this was a selective advantage because it somehow increased efficiency of translation. However, this theory predicts positive correlations between slow initial translation and high gene expression, and slow initial translation and high overall (that is, on the whole gene) ribosome density. In fact, by informatic analysis of existing data, we find the correlations are opposite to those predicted by the “Ramp” model. Most importantly, an experiment in which rates of initial translation are changed shows that faster initial translation causes higher gene expression, exactly opposite to the prediction of the “Ramp” hypothesis. We believe no ramp is needed.</p>
<p>Tuller et al. believed that a region of slow translation was encoded, using slowly-translated codons, and it is specifically this idea of encoded slow translation that we are addressing. However, ribosome profiling experiments done in the absence of cycloheximide still show an increased density of ribosome footprints near the 5’ end, independent of encoding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. This increased density could be due to slower translation at the 5’ end for some encoding-independent reason, or it could mean that some proportion of ribosomes fall off the mRNA as they progress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Consistent with the latter idea, ribosome profiling studies show a general trend towards lower ribosome densities at more 3’ positions in translating mRNAs (Weinberg et al., their Figure S7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>). In any case, by direct experiment, we find that encoding a faster 5’ end improves gene expression.</p>
<p>We considered that the increased density of ribosomes at the 5’ end could be because some genes have additional ATG Start codons, sometimes upstream and sometimes downstream of the annotated Start, and translation of short open reading frames from these additional Start codons could contribute to ribosome density at the 5’ end. Using the program “Frameshift Detector”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and ribosome profiling data, we quantitated the fraction of out-of-frame ribosomes both globally, and within the first 150 nucleotides of genes. We found the global proportion of out-of-frame ribosomes is about 13%, and the proportion of out-of-frame ribosomes in the first 150 nucleotides is about 14.6%. Although this increased out-of-frame ribosome presence of about 1.6% is highly significant (p ~ 10<sup>−28</sup>), it is not nearly big enough to explain the observed 5’ increase (~ 50%) in ribosome density (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, their <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The observation that 5’ ends have low conservation, likely because of instability in evolution, provides a completely different explanation for the region of encoded slow initial translation. In this “Spandrel” hypothesis, N-termini frequently change in evolution, gathering new 5’ sequences <italic>de novo.</italic> These would contain all codons at similar frequencies—i.e., rare codons would not be especially rare. Although these rare codons would eventually be removed by selection, the fact that N-termini are relatively young means that this process might not be complete for all genes, and so some rare, slow codons still remain. These explain the initial region of encoded slow translation. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed correlations between slow initial translation and low gene expression; and slow initial translation and low ribosome density, and with the results of gene expression experiments. It is also consistent with the region of slow translation we observe at the 3’ ends of genes.</p>
<p>We have looked at the conservation of N-termini only in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. However, Tuller et al. found that there is a region of encoded slow initial translation in genes of a wide variety of eukaryotes. We speculate that in these other cases, too, slow initial translation is a spandrel deriving from the turnover of 5’ ends. This in turn has implications for protein structure and evolution; for the interpretation of evolutionary sequence clocks; and for the rates of selection against rare codons.</p>
<p>It was surprising to us that recoding just the first 41 codons of the GFP fusion protein from slow to fast increased the level of GFP expression by so much—about 30%. These 40 codons were originally derived from the yeast <italic>HIS3</italic> gene, and this increase in expression is roughly the proportional increase expected based on fully recoding the <italic>HIS3</italic> gene to preferred codons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Because this recoding from slow to fast tends to replace G/C rich codons with A/T rich codons, recoding from slow to fast may decrease the stability of RNA structures near the 5’ end, and increase the accessibility of the cap. Decreased stability of mRNA structures could be responsible for the increase in gene expression, consistent with studies in both yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and <italic>E. coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We characterized both the 5’ and 3’ ends of genes. Qualitatively, results were similar: both 5’ and 3’ ends showed reduced conservation scores, increased proportions of rare codons, and slow translation, consistent with the Spandrel hypothesis. However, quantitatively, effects on rare codons and slow translation are much bigger at the 5’ end. We are puzzled by the asymmetry. Contributing to the asymmetry is the depletion of initiation codons from the 5’ end. These are fast codons; they are presumably depleted to prevent translation-initiation at the wrong place; and this effect is specific to the 5’ end. Also contributing are basic, arginine-rich sequences in N-terminal signal sequences; these Arg-rich sequences include many rare Arg codons, and this enrichment for N-terminal signal sequences is specific to the 5’ end. Still, even after taking these into account, quantitative effects seem bigger at the 5’ end. We speculate that although rare codons and slow translation are generated as spandrels, poor translation could be a selective advantage in genes that need to be expressed at low levels. Here, we are turning the hypothesis of Tuller et al. on its head: contrary to Tuller, slow initial translation seems to reduce gene expression, and yet this may be adaptive for some genes. Similarly, although architectural spandrels were originally generated from the need to support a lintel by an arch, nevertheless, there may eventually have been “selection” for them, as church-goers found them beautiful.</p>
<p>Finally, again, in “The Spandrels of San Marco …”, Gould and Lewontin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> warned that not all biological phenomena are adaptive, and it is a mistake to assume that any particular characteristic of an organism must necessarily have been generated by natural selection. We believe the encoded slow initial translation of eukaryotic genes may be an example of this.</p>

<title>Statistical calculations of relative initial rate of translation</title>
<p>Bioinformatics were performed on protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs) of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) website, as last modified on April 22, 2021. Protein-coding ORFs annotated as dubious or pseudogenes were not included in analyses. All statistics were performed using The R Project for Statistical Computing. Translation speed was measured using the ribosome residence time (RRT) which is a metric of the occupancy of ribosomes on each sense codon within the A-site <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The RRT values we used are shown in Table S1; these are modified from the original RRT results of Gardin et al. by inclusion of the ribosome profiling data of Jan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Relative initial translation speed</title>
<p>Tuller et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> focused on a “ramp” of translation speed, where the first part of the gene has slow translation relative to the rest of the gene. The ramp thus refers to a rate. To quantitate this slow relative ramp for each gene, we calculated the average RRT for an initial window of the gene (e.g., 40 amino acids, see below), then divided by the average RRT of the rest of the gene. Thus, genes with a “slow ramp” have a ratio less than 1. We then took log2 of this ratio; genes with a slow ramp yield a negative number, and the more negative the number, the steeper the ramp.</p>
<p>For each gene, the relative initial translation speed (RIT) (explained above) was calculated across windows of the first 30, 40, 50 … and 100 codons, with all windows being statistically significant for slow translation. For these RIT calculations, the first (start) codon was omitted since all protein-coding genes in this dataset except Q0075 start with ATG, and ATG is one of the fastest codons, which would skew the RIT. Similarly, the last (stop) codon was omitted.

<p>We downloaded and compiled the source databases from DDBJ, EMBL, Genbank, RefSeq, PIR, and UniProtKB. Duplicate sequences were deleted. To perform local BLAST, we downloaded the NCBI BLAST software (version 2.13.0+) and used RStudio as a wrapper to operate the software; all default BLAST parameters were selected, except that the number of alignments was changed to the maximum value of 1000000000. Local protein BLAST of every <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein (5694 proteins, see above) was performed against all genomes of the subphylum <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> (which includes the genus <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>), but omitting all species in the genus <italic>Saccharomyces.</italic> We eliminated submissions of duplicate species by limiting our database to the highest bitscores from sequence hits derived from each unique species. We were only interested in sequences that had high homology with queried <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins, so all hits with bitscores lower than 50 were omitted.</p>
<p>We wanted to compare conservation at the beginning of proteins with conservation at the middle and end of those same proteins. For this purpose, we split each <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein into two halves (start to middle; middle to end), then blasted each half against all genomes in the subphylum <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> (omitting <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>). We then calculated a “conservation score” (see below) for the first 40 amino acids of the protein, and, identically, for the first 40 amino acids of the second half of the protein. (We describe the first 40 amino acids of the second half of the protein as the “middle”, but in fact the region is displaced 20 amino acids C-terminal from the exact middle.) In a parallel way, a conservation score is calculated for the last 40 amino acids of each protein. For example, the length of Swi5 is 709 amino acids, and therefore BLASTs of the first half spanned from 1:354, and BLASTs for the second half spanned from 355:709. Conservation scores were calculated for residues 1:40 (beginning) (from the BLASTs of the first half of the protein), and 355:394 (middle) and 670:709 (end) (from BLASTs of the second half of the protein). In total, BLAST of the first half of all queried <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins yielded a total of 477,749 high homology (minimum of bitscore of 50) sequence matches across 817 unique <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> species, whereas BLAST of the second half of each protein yielded a total of 486,871 high homology matches across 813 unique <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> species.</p>
<p>With respect to the above procedure, we note that we are relying on the BLAST algorithm to find regions of homology. Homology would be somewhat more easily found in the middle of sequences than at the ends because of seeding issues. It is for this reason that we divided proteins in half, and used a BLAST with the second half of the protein to find homologies with the first 40 amino acids of the second half. That is, in this procedure, for the middle homologies, the algorithm is being asked to find homologies at the end of a sequence, exactly as is the case for the first 40 and last 40 amino acids.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Calculations of protein conservation scores and ratios</title>
<p>The general idea of the “Conservation Score” is that it represents the lengths of the regions of BLAST homology between the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> query and the <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> subjects in the beginning, middle, and end 40-aminoacid windows. Each <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> query sequence was separated into two equal halves, and then BLASTs were done on both halves against all of <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> (omitting all submissions from the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> genus). For all subject proteins with high homology over any region (i.e., a bitscore greater than 50), one finds the pair-wise regions of homology with a BLAST “Alignment Score” of 200 or more (red colored regions in the BLAST website “Graphic Summary”). The length of the high-homology region in the window of interest (but not the actual number of amino acid sequence matches within that region) contributes to the Conservation Score. That is, amino acids have to be within a region of homology found by BLAST in order to contribute to the score; even though all proteins begin with “M”, these only contribute to the conservation score if they are within a region of BLAST homology. The Conservation Score is the sum of (the length of the homology in the window, multiplied by the proportion of qualified subject proteins with that length of homology). Example Conservation Scores are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>, and an example Conservation Score is calculated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS3">Table S3</xref>. We only considered conservation scores from proteins that had homology with at least 40 unique species in <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic>. We also omitted proteins that were shorter than 100 amino acids. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>, conservation scores ranged from 0, meaning no BLAST homology region within the window of 40 amino acids for any qualifying homologue in <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic>, up to a maximum of 40, meaning that all qualifying homologues in <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> had matches starting at the first amino acid. In total, protein conservation analyses used 3964 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins with high homology hits for BLAST done on the first and second half of proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Design of the fluorescent reporter gene constructs</title>
<p>We created a reporter gene based on reporter plasmid EKD1024<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Briefly, a bidirectional galactose promoter simultaneously induces the expression of GFP and RFP in the presence of galactose, and we integrated the reporter into the yeast genome at the <italic>ADE2</italic> locus.

<caption><p>Example conservation scores. Scores were calculated as described in Materials and Methods, but in this example, only for a subset of <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic>. “Total Hits” is the number of different proteins from the sub-phylum <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> subset giving a BLAST bitscore of at least 50. “Hits in the first 40 amino acids” is the number of proteins (out of the proteins in the “Total Hits” columns) that had a BLAST alignment with an alignment score &gt;200 matching any part of the first 40 amino acids of the query sequence (i.e., of <italic>PCA1</italic>, <italic>NSR1</italic>, etc.). “Query Start” is the range of amino acid positions in the Query protein where the BLAST alignments started. For instance, for <italic>BUD5</italic>, the 125 S<italic>accharomycotina</italic> homologs had BLAST alignments that started at positions between amino acid 211 and amino acid 420 on <italic>S. cerevisiae BUD5</italic>; none had an alignment starting within the first 40 amino acids.

For <italic>RPL12B</italic>, all 121 of the <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> homologs had BLAST alignments starting at amino acid 1 of <italic>S. cerevisiae RPL12B</italic>. The “Conservation Score” is the score calculated as described in Materials and Methods. Note that the number of hits varies in part because the genomes of the <italic>Saccharomycotina</italic> species were not all fully sequenced. Thus, <italic>BNA2</italic> likely has fifteen fewer hits than <italic>TRP3</italic> because the <italic>BNA2</italic> locus was not sequenced in some species. However, the number of hits does not affect the conservation score (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS2">Table S2</xref>), as long as the number meets the qualifying minimum.</p></caption>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> contribution to the origins and translational consequences of the relatively low rate of translation elongation in the first ∼30-50 codons of genes in most organisms. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that the prevalence of rare codons in the first ~40 codons in yeast is due to the relatively recent evolution of these coding sequences, or of lower purifying selection operating on them, and that a preponderance of codons encoded by rare tRNAs near the N-terminus is not associated with higher translational efficiency in the manner proposed by the &quot;translational ramp&quot; hypothesis. There are, however, several <bold>incomplete</bold> aspects of the study: it neglects to discuss extensive published work providing different explanations for the slow rate of elongation at the start of open reading frames; it does not consider such effects in interpreting the reporter data produced for the current study; it does not resolve the apparent discrepancy posed by the lack of slow elongation observed despite poor sequence conservation of C-terminal coding regions; and it does not measure reporter mRNA levels to evaluate translational efficiencies.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Sejour et al. is testing &quot;translational ramp&quot; model described previously by Tuller et al. in S. cerevisiae. Authors are using bioinformatics and reporter based experimental approaches to test whether &quot;rare codons&quot; in the first 40 codons of the gene coding sequences increase translation efficiency and regulate abundance of translation products in yeast cells. Authors conclude that &quot;translation ramp&quot; model does not have support using new set of reporters and bioinformatics analyses. The strength of bioinformatic evidence and experimental analyses of the rare codons insertion in the reporter make compelling case for authors claims. However major weakness of the manuscript is that authors do not take in account other confounding effects in their analyses as well as multiple previous studies that argue with &quot;translation ramp&quot; model. The existence of the early elongation ramp with &quot;rare codons&quot; was previously contested with local mRNA structure at the start codon, peptidyl-tRNA drop-off or interactions of the nascent peptide chain with exit channel of the ribosome models. All of these effects are not considered or discussed in the manuscript at this point. Such an authors approach makes the manuscript rather biased and short on discussing multiple other possible conclusions on reasons of slow translation elongation at the beginning of the protein synthesis.</p>

<p>Tuller et al. first made the curious observation, that the first ∼30-50 codons in most organisms are encoded by scarce tRNAs and appear to be translated slower than the rest of the coding sequences (CDS). They speculated that this has evolved to pace ribosomes on CDS and prevent ribosome collisions during elongation - the &quot;Ramp&quot; hypothesis. Various aspects of this hypothesis, both factual and in terms of interpretating the results, have been challenged ever since. Sejour et al. present compelling results confirming the slower translation of the first ~40 codons in S. cerevisiae but providing alternative explanation for this phenomenon. Specifically, they show that the higher amino acid sequence divergence of N-terminal ends of proteins and accompanying lower purifying selection (perhaps the result of de novo evolution) is sufficient to explain the prevalence of rare slow codons in these regions. These results are an important contribution in understanding how aspects of evolution of protein coding regions can affect translation efficiency on these sequences and directly challenge the &quot;Ramp&quot; hypothesis proposed by Tuller et al.</p>
<p>I believe the data is presented clearly and the results generally justify the conclusions. I do have one specific concern related to interpretating the data. The authors show that the conservation score of the last 40 codons is not dissimilar to the conservation score of the first 40 (Fig. 4 A &amp; C). They also show that the calculated translational speed of the first 40 codons is significantly lower than the rest of the CDS. At the same time, they show lack of statistically significant decrease of calculated translational speed for the last 40 codons (Figure S1). If the poor conservation of the first 40 codon explains the slower speed of their translation what is the authors' explanation for the absence of statistically significant reduction of calculated translational speed for the last 40 codons?</p>
<p>&quot;Although the reporter is GFP, the N- terminal region of this particular protein is derived from yeast HIS3, not GFP, and has little if any effect on the fluorescence of the GFP fused downstream.&quot;</p>
<p>The statement above is logical and reasonable; however, it is not supported by any reference or control experiments. At the very least this fact should be explicitly acknowledged. Also, the RNA levels of reporters were not measured, which means it cannot be categorically concluded that the observed effect is due to changes of translational efficiency. This is an important caveat.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for their comments, and their evident close reading of the manuscript.  Generally, we agree with the reviewers on the strengths and weaknesses of our manuscript.  We plan to submit a revised version which has a more extensive discussion of alternative explanations for initial high ribosome density as seen by ribosome profiling, and which more specifically points out the limitations of our work.</p>
<p>As a preface to specific responses to the reviewers, we will say that we could divide observations of slow initial translation into two categories, which we will call “encoded slow codons”, and “increased ribosome density”.  With respect to the first category, Tuller et al. documented initial “encoded slow codons”, that is, there is a statistical excess of rare, slowly-translated codons at the 5’ ends of genes.  Although the size of this effect is small, statistical significance is extremely high, and the existence of this enrichment is not in any doubt. At first sight, this appears to be a strong indication of a preference for slow initial translation.  In our opinion, our main contribution is to show that there is an alternative explanation for this initial enrichment of rare, slow codons—that they are a spandrel, a consequence of sequence plasticity at the 5’ (and 3’) ends of genes. The reviewers seem to generally agree with this, and we are not aware that any other work has provided an explanation for the 5’ enrichment of rare codons.</p>
<p>The second category of observations pertaining to slow initial translation is “increased ribosome density”.  Early ribosome profiling studies used cycloheximide, and these showed a much greater density of ribosomes near the 5’ end of genes than elsewhere.  This high initial ribosome density helped motivate the paper of Tuller et al., though their finding of “encoded slow codons” could explain only a very small part of the increased ribosome density.  More modern ribosome profiling studies do not use cycloheximide as the first step in arresting translation, and in these studies, the density of ribosomes near the 5’ end of genes is greatly reduced.  And yet, there remains, even in the absence of cycloheximide at the first step, a significantly increased density of ribosomes near the 5’ end (e.g., Weinberg et al., 2016).  (However, at least some of these studies do use cycloheximide at later steps in the protocol, and the possibility of a cycloheximide artefact is difficult to exclude.)  It appears to us that some of the reviewer’s main concerns are that we do not explain the increased 5’ ribosome density seen by ribosome profiling.  We agree; but we feel it is not the main point of our manuscript.  In revision, we will more extensively discuss other work on increased ribosome density, and more explicitly point out the limitations of our manuscript in this regard.  We also note, though, that increased ribosome density is not a direct measure of translation speed—it can have other causes.</p>
<p>Specific Responses.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 was concerned that we did not more fully discuss other work on possible reasons for slow initial translation.  We will discuss such work more extensively in our revision.  However, as far as we know, none of this work proposes a reason for the 5’ enrichment of rare, slow codons.</p>
<p>Reviewer 1 was also concerned about confounding effects in our reporter gene analysis of the effects of different codons on efficiency of translation.  We have two comments.  First, it is important to remember that although we changed codons in our reporters, we did not change any amino acids.  We changed codons only to synonymous codons.  Thus at least one of the reviewer’s possible confounding effects—interactions of the nascent peptide chain with the exit channel of the ribosome—does not apply.  However, of course, the mRNA nucleotide sequence is altered, and this would cause a change in mRNA structure or abundance, which could matter.  We agree this is a limitation to our approach.  However, to fully address it, we feel it would be necessary to examine a really large number of quite different sequences, which is beyond the scope of this work.</p>
<p>Reviewer 2 was concerned that the conservation scores for the 5’ 40 amino acids, and the 3’ 40 amino acids were similar, but slow translation was only statistically significant for the 5’ 40 amino acids.  As we say in the manuscript, we are also puzzled by this.  We note that 3’ translation is statistically slow, if one looks over the last 100 amino acids.  Our best effort at an explanation is a sort of reverse-Tuller explanation:  that in the last 40 amino acids, the new slow codons created by genome plasticity are fairly quickly removed by purifying selection, but that in the first 40 amino acids, for genes that need to be expressed at low levels, purifying selection against slow codons is reduced, because poor translation is actually advantageous for these genes.  To expand on this a bit, we feel that the 5000 or so proteins of the proteome have to be expressed in the correct stoichiometric ratios, and that poor translation can be a useful tool to help achieve this. In this explanation, slow translation at the 5’ end is bad for translation (in agreement with our reporter experiments), but good for the organism, whereas in Tuller, slow translation at the 5’ end is good for translation.</p>
<p>Reviewer 2 wondered whether the N-terminal fusion peptide affects GFP fluorescence in our reporter.  This specific reporter, with this N-terminus, has been characterized by Dean and Grayhack (2012), and by Gamble et al. (2016), and the idea that a super-folder GFP reporter is not greatly affected by N-terminal fusions is based on the work of Pedelacq (2006).  None of these papers show whether this N-terminal fusion might have some effect, but together, they provide good reason to think that any effect would be small.  We will add these citations to the revision.</p>
