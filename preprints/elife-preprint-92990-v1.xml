<title>Abstract</title>
<p>New antimalarial drug candidates that act via novel mechanisms are urgently needed to combat malaria drug resistance. Here, we describe the multi-omic chemical validation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> M1 alanyl metalloaminopeptidase as an attractive drug target using the selective inhibitor, MIPS2673. MIPS2673 demonstrated potent inhibition of recombinant <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (<italic>Pf</italic>A-M1) and <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> (<italic>Pv</italic>-M1) M1 metalloaminopeptidases, with selectivity over other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and human aminopeptidases, and displayed excellent <italic>in vitro</italic> antimalarial activity with no significant host cytotoxicity. Orthogonal label-free chemoproteomic methods based on thermal stability and limited proteolysis of whole parasite lysates revealed that MIPS2673 solely targets <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 in parasites, with limited proteolysis also enabling estimation of the binding site on <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 to within ~5 Å of that determined by X-ray crystallography. Finally, functional investigation by untargeted metabolomics demonstrated that MIPS2673 inhibits the key role of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 in haemoglobin digestion. Combined, our unbiased multi-omic target deconvolution strategies confirmed the on-target activity of MIPS2673, and validated selective inhibition of M1 alanyl metalloaminopeptidase as a promising multi-stage and cross-species antimalarial strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria is a devastating parasitic disease that causes major health, economic and societal impacts to almost half of the world’s population that live in malaria-endemic countries. In 2021 there were an estimated 247 million cases of malaria globally and 619 000 associated deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> An estimated 95% of malaria deaths are attributed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the species responsible for the most severe and lethal form of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> <italic>P. vivax</italic> is also responsible for significant morbidity, and is the most geographically widespread malaria parasite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Although the global incidence rate of malaria has declined over the last decade, the number of people worldwide suffering and dying from malaria is now increasing and parasite resistance has emerged to all current antimalarial drug classes, including the front-line artemisinin therapies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Alarmingly, artemisinin-based combination therapies fail to cure infections in up to 50% of patients in some regions of Asia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and delayed parasite clearance rates following artemisinin-based therapy (synonymous with decreased parasite susceptibility to artemisinin) has now been detected in Africa,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> where most malaria deaths occur. This, combined with the lack of mechanistic diversity in emerging antimalarials in development, means there is an urgent need for new drug classes with novel mechanisms of action that bypass resistance and treat both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> infections.</p>
<p>Haemoglobin digestion is an essential metabolic process and a point of key vulnerability during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite intraerythrocytic development. The parasite digests up to 75% of host cell haemoglobin to provide amino acids for protein synthesis and this process additionally serves non-anabolic functions, such as maintaining osmotic stability of the infected red blood cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites employ the interplay of numerous proteases from different classes to digest haemoglobin into its constituent amino acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> <italic>P. falciparum</italic> M1 alanyl aminopeptidase (<italic>Pf</italic>A-M1) and M17 leucyl aminopeptidase (<italic>Pf</italic>A-M17) are two zinc-dependent metalloaminopeptidases involved in the terminal stage of haemoglobin digestion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Both <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 and <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 are thought to be essential for parasite survival and are promising targets for antimalarial therapy <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> However, attempts at genetic manipulation of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 have been unsuccessful to date, which has precluded formal genetic validation of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 as a drug target. Bestatin-based inhibitors of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 were previously shown to prevent proteolysis of haemoglobin peptides, leading to a swollen digestive vacuole and stalled growth at the trophozoite stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Loss of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 function through chemical inhibition or conditional knockdown also results in stalled growth at the trophozoite stage but does not induce digestive vacuole swelling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Instead, specific loss of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 function results in the presence of multiple membrane bound digestive vacuoles per parasite. We have previously used rational drug design to optimise dual M1 and M17 inhibitors with nanomolar potency across multiple <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> More recently, we reported a selective <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 inhibitor with potent antimalarial activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17, <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 is an attractive target for novel antimalarial drug development. The <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 enzyme is a monomeric protein consisting of four domains and is widely believed to function in the cytosol, although localisation to other compartments has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> It has a broad substrate specificity that includes most basic and hydrophobic amino acids, but preferentially cleaves leucine and methionine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 uses a zinc-dependent mechanism to catalyse the release of single amino acids from the N-terminus of short peptides. All reported inhibitors of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 target the enzyme active site and act to chelate the catalytic zinc ion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Obtaining selectivity for <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 over <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 is challenging as the enzymes share similar architecture within the active sites and a catalytic mechanism involving zinc ions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> As such, very few compounds that selectively inhibit <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 over <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and unbiased identification of the target in parasites is critical to confirm specificity.</p>
<p>Identifying the molecular targets of compounds is a significant challenge for antimalarial drug development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> One of the most successful approaches to target deconvolution has been <italic>in vitro</italic> evolution and whole genome analysis (IVIEWGA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> However, IVIEWGA can also point to genes encoding general drug-resistance mechanisms rather than the cellular target, and a major goal of new drug development for malaria is the identification of compounds that fail to yield resistant parasites <italic>in vitro</italic> (irresistible compounds), as these compounds are less likely to result in clinical resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> Chemoproteomics methods based on mass spectrometry offer alternative routes to validate the molecular target(s) of compounds in parasites. One strategy relies on the use of chemical probes to enrich and identify protein targets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> However, this method requires chemical modification of the drug, which could alter its pharmacological properties. New thermal stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and limited proteolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> techniques are two examples of unbiased chemoproteomics methods that provide direct evidence of on-target engagement on a proteome-wide scale, without the need for modification of the drug. These methods rely on the concepts of thermal and proteolytic stabilisation of the protein target due to ligand binding and leverage recent advances in mass spectrometry to detect drug-specific changes to protein or peptide abundance within complex proteomes. Thermal proteome profiling was recently applied in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to successfully identify the targets of several antimalarial compounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> Whereas limited proteolysis proteomics has not previously been reported to identify drug targets in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, this approach has successfully mapped protein-small molecule interactions in other complex eukaryotic proteomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here, we report a multi-stage M1 selective aminopeptidase inhibitor with a hydroxamic acid zinc binding group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> (MIPS2673), which targets both the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<italic>Pf</italic>A-M1) and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (<italic>Pv</italic>-M1) M1 homologues and demonstrates antimalarial activity against a panel of drug resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. We developed orthogonal chemoproteomics approaches based on thermal stability and limited proteolysis, combined with metabolomics analysis, to validate the on-target activity of MIPS2673 in parasites. Our comparatively simple and inexpensive chemoproteomics methods for identifying antimalarial drug targets utilise an efficient data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) approach that allows comprehensive and reproducible proteome coverage. Together, our studies confirm <italic>Plasmodium</italic> M1 alanyl aminopeptidase as the sole target of MIPS2673 and validate selective inhibition of this enzyme as a multi-stage and cross-species antimalarial strategy.</p>

<title>Design and synthesis of a cross-species hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor selective for Plasmodium M1 alanyl aminopeptidase</title>
<p>We previously reported a series of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 and M17 aminopeptidase inhibitors that possessed a hydroxamic acid zinc binding group to coordinate catalytic zinc ion(s) and a variety of hydrophobic groups to probe the S1′ binding pocket of these enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> Whilst a number of these modifications successfully improved inhibitory potency, their incorporation reduced polarity and aqueous solubility. One such example is the pivaloyl group present in compound <bold>1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> In order to balance these opposing factors, one of the methyl groups of the pivaloyl was replaced by an alcohol to increase polarity whilst maintaining the capacity to engage the S1′-pocket via hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). This modification resulted in MIPS2673 (compound <bold>4</bold>), which has a significantly lower cLogP (1.45 vs 2.23 for <bold>1</bold>) and favourable solubility (i.e. the kinetic solubility of MIPS2673 was estimated to be in the 50–100 µg/mL range using nephelometry vs 12.5–25 µg/mL for <bold>1</bold>). MIPS2673 (4) was synthesized from methyl 2-amino-2-(4-bromophenyl)acetate (2) in three synthetic steps as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>. Amide formation was achieved via an EDCI-mediated coupling and the trifluorophenyl moiety was installed using a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling to form the synthetic intermediate <bold>3</bold>. Finally, the methyl ester was converted to the corresponding hydroxamic acid using 5 M methanolic KOH and NH<sub>2</sub>OH•HCl to afford MIPS2673 (4).</p>

<p>We determined the inhibitory activity of MIPS2673 against M1 and M17 enzymes from both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). The binding affinities (<italic>K</italic>i) of MIPS2673 toward purified, recombinant <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 shows the compound to be a potent inhibitor (<italic>K</italic>i = 211 ± 11 nM), with &gt; 4-fold selectivity over <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 (<italic>K</italic>i = 921 ± 69 nM). MIPS2673 was significantly more potent against Pv-M1 (<italic>K</italic>i = 6.4 ± 0.5 nM) with &gt; 155-fold selectivity over <italic>Pv</italic>-M17 (<italic>K</italic>i &gt; 1000 nM).

The fluoro-substituents sit deep in the S1 pocket and form the same intricate network of water-mediated hydrogen-bonds as <bold>1</bold>, in which the fluorine atoms act as H-bond acceptors. The substitution on the <italic>tert</italic>-butyl, replacing a methyl with an alcohol, is difficult to definitively position in the structure due to the rotation around the C-03 bond. It is possible that this alcohol could form a long H-bond to Arg-489, which should provide some improvement in position and potency. The Arg-489 side-chain shows two orientations in the electron density, suggesting that some rotation of the alcohol is occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). Inspection of the structure of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 with <bold>1</bold> (PDB ID 4ZY2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> does not reveal why the compound is selective. The <italic>tert</italic>-butyl of <bold>1</bold> is sitting in an open pocket and the introduction of an alcohol is unlikely to induce any clashes, steric or electrostatic. This suggests that the reason for the selectivity between the two enzymes results from the ability (or inability) to access the interior cavity of the <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 hexamer that houses the active sites.</p>
<p>To investigate the potential for off-target effects, we examined the selectivity of MIPS2673 over several human M1 homologs, including leukotriene A-4 hydrolase (LTA4H), endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2). MIPS2673 showed minimal inhibition of ERAP1 and ERAP2 at concentrations below 500 µM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>), whereas MIPS2673 caused &gt; 50% inhibition of LTA4H at concentrations above 10 µM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS1">Table S1</xref>). We also tested MIPS2673 against the HEK293 cell line to further predict potential human cytotoxicity. No cytotoxicity to HEK293 cells was observed up to a concentration of 40 µM. As a comparison, the current antimalarials chloroquine and dihydroartemisinin inhibit HEK293 proliferation by 67% and 29%, respectively, at 40 µM. At 120 µM, MIPS2673 inhibited cellular proliferation by 89% compared to the untreated control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS2">Table S2</xref>).</p>

<title>In vitro antiparasitic activity of MIPS2673</title>
<p>Having synthesised a <italic>Plasmodium</italic> specific M1 aminopeptidase inhibitor, we next explored the activity of MIPS2673 against <italic>in vitro</italic> blood-stage cultures of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. We found that MIPS2673 has sub micromolar activity against the laboratory reference strain, 3D7 (72 h EC<sub>50</sub> = 324 nM (250–470 CI)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>), as well as against a panel of drug resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS3">Table S3</xref>). Stage specificity assays were performed to identify which stage of asexual development MIPS2673 is most active against. Synchronised ring or trophozoite cultures were exposed to MIPS2673 for 24 h or 48 h at 10x EC<sub>50</sub>, then stringently washed to remove the compound. Parasite growth was assessed after 48 h compared to a vehicle-treated control. This confirmed MIPS2673 is most potent against trophozoite stage parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>), corresponding to the period of peak <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> As expected, no stage-dependent difference in activity was observed in parasites exposed to MIPS2673 for 48 h, as this duration incorporates the full asexual erythrocytic cycle. The control compound, artesunate, was equipotent across all conditions, consistent with the known activity and kinetic profiles for artemisinins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>To visually characterise the effects of MIPS2673 on parasites, we treated synchronised 3D7 cultures at the early ring stage and monitored their development by light microscopy evaluation of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>). We found that MIPS2673 caused significant growth retardation when compared to the untreated control and parasite growth stalled at early trophozoite (22–28 h trophozoites) and late ring (~ 22 h rings) stages at 5x and 10x EC<sub>50</sub>, respectively. The presence of haemozoin in both treatment groups indicated that the initial catabolism of haemoglobin is unaffected by MIPS2673.</p>
<p>Having confirmed activity against asexual stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we next determined whether MIPS2673 kills the transmissible sexual forms of the parasite, known as gametocytes. We found that MIPS2673 has transmission-blocking activity and is most potent against early gametocytes (stages I-III), compared to late (stages IV-V) and mature (stage V) stages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS4">Table S4</xref>), but is less potent than the artemisinin derivative, artesunate.</p>

<title>Identification of molecular targets for MIPS2673 in P. falciparum by thermal stability proteomics</title>
<p>Our biochemical studies showing binding and inhibition of recombinant <italic>Plasmodium</italic> metalloaminopeptidases do not rule out the possibility that the anti-parasitic activity of MIPS2673 is due to non-specific binding to other parasite metalloproteins or off-target proteins. Genetic target validation was not possible as previous attempts to mutate <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 were not successful,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and MIPS2673-resistant parasites were not available. Therefore, we developed orthogonal mass spectrometry-based chemoproteomics approaches to validate that MIPS2673 is on-target and M1-selective in the complex parasite environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). We initially developed a streamlined thermal stability proteomics workflow that combined traditional thermal proteome profiling methods with an optimised data-independent acquisition (DIA)-LC-MS/MS approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup></p>

<p>Parasites are isolated from the host red blood cell by hypotonic lysis. Proteins are extracted from cells under native conditions by multiple freeze-thaw cycles. The lysate is pooled and distributed to achieve multiple independent incubations per reaction condition for use in either thermal stability or limited proteolysis workflows. For thermal stability proteomics studies, the parasite lysate is subjected to treatment with vehicle (untreated control) or drug at two concentrations, followed by thermal challenge at 60 °C. The soluble (non-denatured) protein fraction is isolated by ultracentrifugation and digested overnight with trypsin. The resulting peptide mixture is analysed by DIA-LC-MS/MS against an in-house generated spectral library to determine drug-induced thermal stabilisation. For limited proteolysis studies, ligand-protein interactions are monitored at multiple drug concentrations following double protease digestion. An initial pulse proteolysis with the broad specificity protease, proteinase K (PK), captures local ligand-induced structural alterations of proteins that become differentially susceptible to protease cleavage upon drug binding. Samples then undergo complete digestion under reducing conditions with trypsin/LysC. Differential proteolytic patterns produced upon ligand binding are detected by DIA-LC-MS/MS and analysed against a limited proteolysis spectral library.</p></caption>

<p>To identify the binding target/s of MIPS2673 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> asexual blood stages in a proteome-wide manner, we used native parasite lysates, as direct drug-protein interactions are more selectively identified in cellular lysates, rather than live cells that are susceptible to downstream effects of drug action. The parasite lysates were exposed to 1 µM or 4 µM of MIPS2673 or vehicle (DMSO control) for 3 minutes prior to heating at 60°C, a temperature that should allow detection of most drug-induced protein stabilisation events in an untargeted manner with wide proteome coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> After the thermal challenge, the soluble (non-denatured) protein fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation, digested overnight with trypsin and the peptide mixture analysed directly using global DIA-LC-MS/MS. Proteins detected with significantly higher abundance in treated relative to control samples reflect thermal stabilisation of the target due to ligand binding. To minimise identification of false positive hits, proteins reproducibly stabilised (p &lt; 0.05 and fold-change ≥ 1.2 compared to the untreated control) across multiple drug concentrations and experiments were considered drug interacting proteins. Among 1632 proteins reproducibly detected with a minimum of two peptides across two independent experiments (each with at least three independent incubations of MIPS2673 or vehicle with protein lysate), five proteins were consistently stabilised at both drug concentrations compared to DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS1">Data S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS2">Data S2</xref>). Of these, <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 (PF3D7_1311800) was one of the most significantly stabilised proteins (p &lt; 0.01 at 1 µM). <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 exhibited concentration-dependent stabilisation in the presence of MIPS2673, with an average stabilisation of 1.8-fold and 2.8-fold at 1 µM and 4 µM, respectively, relative to the untreated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). The four other proteins consistently stabilised were not metalloproteins and included two conserved <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins with unknown functions (PF3D7_1026000 and PF3D7_0604300), a putative AP2 domain transcription factor (PF3D7_1239200) and a human protein, Ras-related Rab-39A (Q14964) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>).

<p>We also developed an efficient protocol for limited proteolysis-based studies of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and applied it for the unbiased identification of targets of MIPS2673 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Native <italic>P. falciparum</italic> lysates were treated for 10 minutes with different concentrations of MIPS2673 (1 μM or 10 μM in experiment one and 0.1 μM, 1 μM or 10 μM in experiment two) or vehicle in at least four independent incubations per experiment. Proteome extracts were then subjected to double protease digestion. An initial limited proteolysis with proteinase K for 4 minutes captured local structural alterations of proteins that become differentially susceptible to protease cleavage upon drug binding. Secondly, samples undergo complete digestion under reducing conditions overnight with trypsin/LysC to make peptides amenable for global proteomics analysis. Differentially abundant proteolytic peptides between MIPS2673 and vehicle-treated samples were then identified on a global scale with DIA-LC-MS/MS. The proteolytic peptide patterns of drug targets should be altered in the treated samples as compound binding prevents protein cleavage by proteinase K, resulting in decreased abundance of peptides with non-tryptic ends or an increase in concentration of the associated fully tryptic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>). We quantified 26,611 peptides from 2,153 proteins in experiment one and 16,662 peptides from 1,989 proteins in experiment two (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS3">Data S3</xref>). Each dataset was initially analysed for differentially abundant peptides between each MIPS2673 concentration and vehicle by filtering based upon relative peptide abundance (absolute fold-change &gt; 1.5), statistical significance (q &lt; 0.01) and proteolytic peptide pattern (i.e. increased fully tryptic or decreased half tryptic). In experiment one and experiment two respectively, approximately 3% of peptides from 379 proteins and 0.6% of peptides from 69 proteins, met these thresholds at each drug concentration and were considered significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>). After prioritising targets based upon the number of significant peptides detected per protein (Fisher exact test, Bonferroni corrected p &lt; 0.05), we identified seven putative drug targets in experiment one and only one putative target in experiment two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS4">Data S4</xref>). Interestingly, among the seven possible target proteins identified by limited proteolysis in experiment one, five were metalloproteins. These included <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1, three other aminopeptidases - M17 leucyl aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase P (<italic>Pf</italic>APP) and M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase (<italic>Pf</italic>A-M18) - and adenosine deaminase (<italic>Pf</italic>ADA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). The expected target, <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 aminopeptidase, was the only protein reproducibly identified as the MIPS2673 target across both independent limited proteolysis experiments.

Among the nine structurally significant LiP-MS peptides, four contained atoms within Van der Waals distance (&lt; 4 Å) of MIPS2673. Based on these observations, we hypothesised that significantly dysregulated LiP-MS peptides could estimate the known MIPS2673 binding site on <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1. A distance of 6.44 Å from MIPS2673 was used to define the binding cleft boundary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> and included the <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 residues known to interact with bound MIPS2673.

Heatmap analysis of relative abundances of all putative metabolites revealed that treatment with MIPS2673 disproportionally impacted peptide metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Fig. S3</xref>).

Targeted analysis of the 97 increased peptides in drug treated cultures revealed that the majority were likely derived from haemoglobin (Hb) chains (α and β) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6A</xref>).

MIPS2673 is active against a panel of drug resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains, including parasites with decreased susceptibility to the current frontline antimalarials, has potential to treat both active disease (asexual blood stage activity) and block parasite transmission (anti-gametocyte activity), and is non-cytotoxic to the human HEK293 cell line. Together, our studies confirm <italic>Plasmodium</italic> M1 alanyl aminopeptidase as the target of MIPS2673 and validate selective inhibition of this enzyme as a promising antimalarial strategy.</p>
<p>The gene encoding <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 was previously shown to be refractory to knockout and is predicted to be essential for blood stage growth, making it an attractive antimalarial drug target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> To confirm that MIPS2673 inhibited <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 in the parasite, we initially developed a streamlined workflow that combined traditional thermal stability proteomics methods with a data-independent acquisition (DIA)-LC-MS/MS approach. Thermal proteome profiling was recently adapted for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and applied for antimalarial drug target identification using data-dependent acquisition (DDA)-based LC-MS/MS analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> Here, protein thermal stabilisation is typically monitored in the presence or absence of compound over a range of temperatures (thermal proteome profiling), or at multiple drug concentrations at a single temperature (isothermal dose response). The extensive samples generated by these approaches require multiplexing with expensive isobaric stable isotope labelling reagents and offline fractionation to minimise sample complexity prior to DDA-LC-MS/MS analysis. Furthermore, DDA-based proteomics is prone to inconsistent peptide detection, which limits the number of proteins that can be reproducibly identified and quantified. In contrast, using DIA analyses in thermal proteome profiling was recently shown to be an effective and economical alternative to traditional DDA-based thermal shift quantitation workflows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> DIA-based protein quantification also results in high run-to-run reproducibility and a comprehensive dataset that is not biased towards highly abundant proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> Our DIA-based thermal stability proteomics workflow identified approximately 47% of the detectable <italic>P. falciparum</italic> blood stage proteome,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> with the undetected proteins primarily comprised of membrane-bound proteins that are not readily extracted with detergent-free buffers required for stability assays of soluble proteins. This proteome coverage is comparable to previously reported DDA thermal proteomics studies of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> but our method avoids the need for testing over a wide range of concentrations or temperatures, isobaric tags and offline fractionation steps that increase the time, cost and complexity associated with previously published methods. Since in bacterial and other eukaryotic cellular systems, limited proteolysis coupled with mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) has proven useful for revealing direct drug targets, protein interactions with endogenous metabolites and ligand binding sites at peptide-level resolution,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> we also explored LiP-MS based on DIA-LC-MS/MS as a complementary approach to demonstrate MIPS2673 target engagement in malaria parasites.</p>
<p>Both thermal stability proteomics and LiP-MS strategies support unbiased deconvolution of drug mechanisms on a system-wide scale. Whilst our <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assay data demonstrated selective inhibition of recombinant <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 over <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 (4-fold), with a Ki for <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 inhibition similar to the EC<sub>50</sub> for killing <italic>P. falciparum in vitro</italic>, this does not rule out inhibition of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 or other protein targets within parasites, especially when the EC<sub>50</sub> concentration approaches the <italic>K</italic>i for <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 inhibition.</p>
<p>Thermal stability proteomics and limited proteolysis coupled with global DIA-LC-MS/MS analysis reproducibly identified <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 as the sole target of MIPS2673 from approximately 2,000 detected proteins. This validated our chemoproteomics strategy for detection of ligand-protein interactions in complex proteomes and confirmed the on-target activity and M1-selectivity of MIPS2673. Even at 3x EC<sub>50</sub>, and concentrations expected to inhibit recombinant <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17, there were no off-targets consistently identified across both thermal stability proteomics and LiP-MS methods, highlighting the importance of using complementary approaches to map drug interactions and discriminate true protein interactors from false positive identifications.</p>
<p>Our structural analysis showed that MIPS2673 acts by chelating the catalytic zinc ion of the <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 active site, similar to all other inhibitors produced to date.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> A strategy targeting the catalytic zinc may present challenges for achieving selectivity over host zinc dependent enzymes, but MIPS2673 demonstrated excellent selectivity over several human M1 homologues, providing rationale for further development of M1 selective inhibitors that present a low risk of host toxicity. Our LiP-MS analysis also supported a zinc-dependent binding mechanism. While other stability-based proteomics methods for drug target identification, such as thermal proteome profiling, map drug-protein interactions by measuring variations in thermal stability of whole proteins, they lack the structural resolution of LiP-MS, which measures local changes in proteolytic susceptibility. Most of the structurally significant <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 peptides we identified by LiP-MS were within 5 Å of the MIPS2673 binding site determined by X-ray crystallography. The structurally altered peptides identified with LiP-MS included the peptide S<sub>292</sub>EVIIHPETNYALT<sub>305</sub>, which guards the entrance pathway to the active site and is likely involved in substrate recognition and catalytic competence of the enzyme structure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> as well as the peptide L<sub>449</sub>NLVAVSDFNVGAMENK<sub>465</sub>, which contains the highly conserved GAMEN exopeptidase motif.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> The GAMEN motif functions to bring substrate to the active site metal for catalysis and contributes hydrogen bonds for ligand binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> Interestingly, we also identified several structurally significant LiP-MS peptides distal (&gt; 5 Å) to this location. Ligands and substrates access the <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 active site via a long C-terminal channel within domain IV and their migration is orchestrated by several transient states which are stabilized by interactions with specific residues of the domain, including Arg<sup>969</sup>, Arg<sup>489</sup>, Lys<sup>849</sup>, Lys<sup>907</sup>, Glu<sup>850</sup>, Asp<sup>830</sup>, Glu<sup>572</sup> and Asp<sup>581</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> We identified the structurally significant peptides S<sub>822</sub>YIVSLPQDR<sub>831</sub> and R<sub>898</sub>NTLLSLL<sub>905</sub> that are located &gt; 5 Å from the MIPS2673 binding site at the entrance to the channel cavity. The SYIVSLPQDR and RNTLLSLL peptides contain, or are in very close proximity to, the ASP<sup>830</sup> and Lys<sup>907</sup> residues, respectively, which may have a role in regulating recognition and initial passage and migration of ligands into the channel cavity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> Together, this demonstrates the potential of LiP-MS not only for unbiased identification of protein targets of drugs, but also for estimating drug binding and interaction sites.</p>
<p><italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 has been shown to play an essential role in the terminal stages of haemoglobin digestion and the generation of an amino acid pool within the parasite cytosol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Turnover of haemoglobin into oligopeptides and amino acids peaks during the trophozoite stage when <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 expression and activity is highest. In agreement with <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 being the target of MIPS2673, we showed that the trophozoite stage coincides with the period that parasites are most susceptible to MIPS2673, and that the growth of MIPS2673-treated parasites becomes stalled at the trophozoite stage. Inhibition of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 using an activity-based probe based on the bestatin scaffold also resulted in trophozoite stage stalling of parasite growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> However, the activity-based probe also caused digestive vacuole swelling, a phenotype that we did not observe. Digestive vacuole swelling is commonly associated with inhibition of proteases such as the falcipains that are involved in initiating haemoglobin digestion within the parasite digestive vacuole. Since <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 is a cytoplasmic protein,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> specific inhibition of this enzyme with MIPS2673 is unlikely to cause digestive vacuole swelling. Instead, the phenotype previously observed with the activity-based probe may be the result of off-target effects. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed significant accumulation of short peptides following treatment of parasite cultures with MIPS2673. Many of these accumulated peptides likely originate from haemoglobin as MS/MS and accurate mass isomer analysis shows the sequence of these peptides to be more similar to haemoglobin than other host or parasite proteins. Starving the parasite of key haemoglobin-derived amino acids is therefore the likely mechanism leading to parasite death after MIPS2673 treatment.</p>
<p>Several aminopeptidases in addition to <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 are involved in the terminal stages of peptide processing within malaria parasites. These include the essential aminopeptidases, <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 and aminopeptidase P (<italic>Pf</italic>APP), and the dispensable enzyme, <italic>Pf</italic>A-M18, all of which share a metal-dependent catalytic mechanism. Although no off-targets were consistently identified in our study, four of the seven putative hits identified in our first LiP-MS experiment were metalloaminopeptidases (<italic>Pf</italic>A-M1, <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17, <italic>Pf</italic>A-M18 and <italic>Pf</italic>APP), with only <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 reproducibly identified as the primary MIPS2673 target across both LiP-MS experiments. <italic>Pf</italic>A-M18 and <italic>Pf</italic>APP are unlikely to be true off-targets that contribute to the antimalarial mechanism in parasites as we found MIPS2673 is non-inhibitory towards recombinant versions of these enzymes, even at concentrations &gt; 120-fold above the EC<sub>50</sub> for <italic>in vitro</italic> parasite killing. We previously reported that specific loss of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 function results in multiple membrane bound digestive vacuoles per parasite. This phenotype was not observed in parasites treated with MIPS2673, arguing against <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 being an off-target. Furthermore, distinct peptide profiles for MIPS2673 and a <italic>Pf</italic>A-M17 inhibitor were observed in our metabolomics dataset, with MIPS2673 showing specific accumulation of basic peptides, which agrees with the broad substrate specificity of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1. In our first LiP-MS experiment we also identified the zinc metalloprotein adenosine deaminase (<italic>Pf</italic>ADA) as a possible MIPS2673 off-target. <italic>Pf</italic>ADA is one of three purine salvage enzymes and catalyses deamination of adenosine to inosine, as well as the conversion of 5′-methylthioadenosine, derived from polyamine biosynthesis, into 5′-methylthioinosine. Investigation of metabolites identified in our metabolomics experiment revealed no significant change in purine or polyamine pathway metabolites, suggesting that MIPS2673 has no functional impact on these pathways in parasites. Interestingly, re-analysis of this dataset from experiment one with a less stringent statistical cut-off (Fisher exact test, uncorrected p &lt; 0.05) revealed 47 putative targets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS4">Data S4</xref>) that were significantly enriched for metallopeptidase (p = 0.022), aminopeptidase (p = 2.1E-4), aspartic-type endopeptidase (p = 7.34E-3) or threonine-type endopeptidase (p = 1.2E-11) gene ontology (GO) terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig. S4</xref>). Proteins within the metal ion binding gene ontology (GO) term were not significantly enriched (p = 0.985) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tabS5">Data S5</xref>), confirming that MIPS2673 does not interact indiscriminately with metalloproteins. Whilst this extended list of putative peptidase-related targets may represent plausible secondary targets – either stabilised by MIPS2673 itself or by peptides accumulating due to primary inhibition of <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 – they do not appear responsible for the antiparasitic activity of MIPS2673, as stabilisation of these additional putative targets was not reproducible across independent experiments, and the relevance of the most significant of these (<italic>Pf</italic>A-M17, <italic>Pf</italic>A-M18, <italic>Pf</italic>APP and <italic>Pf</italic>ADA) is refuted by our thermal stability, metabolomics and recombinant enzyme inhibition data.</p>
<p>Thermal stability proteomics identified <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 and four other proteins that appeared to be stabilised by MIPS2673. Of these four additional proteins, none were metalloprotein or peptidase off-targets, and only the putative AP2 domain transcription factor (PF3D7_1239200) is predicted to be essential for blood stage growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> This protein is thought to be localised to the parasite nucleus and involved in heterochromatin-associated gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 was previously thought to have nuclear localisation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> but is now widely accepted to be cytosolic and no function within the parasite nucleus is currently known. It is unlikely that these proteins contribute to MIPS2673 activity in parasites and it is possible that the cell lysis step required to generate a parasite lysate for thermal proteomics (and LiP-MS) introduces artefacts by allowing novel protein interactions or compound access to previously compartmentalised proteins. While the proteins identified individually by thermal stability proteomics and LiP-MS could be MIPS2673 off targets, their lack of consistency across assays suggests that they are likely false discoveries. <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 was the sole protein reproducibly identified across both unbiased target identification methods, indicating it is the primary target in parasites.</p>
<p>Collectively, we have demonstrated selective targeting of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> M1 alanyl aminopeptidase as an effective antimalarial strategy and validated MIPS2673 as a <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 inhibitor through unbiased MS-based chemoproteomics. This work provides a basis for continued development of inhibitors against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> M1 alanyl aminopeptidase in an era when new therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed to combat widespread emergence of malaria parasite drug resistance. More broadly, our study demonstrates the power of mass spectrometry-based techniques to simultaneously probe whole proteomes in an unbiased manner and identify direct drug-protein interactions. The unbiased and orthogonal MS-based proteomics methods described here support investigation of drug mechanisms on a system-wide scale without the need for a specific prior hypothesis about the function of a compound. This makes LiP-MS and thermal stability proteomics ideally suited to reveal the molecular targets of phenotypically active compounds, even for cases where genetic approaches are not tractable. Drug discovery efforts based on phenotypic screens have successfully identified thousands of molecules that kill <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> but most of these hits act by unknown mechanisms. Combined, these complementary target identification strategies will provide greater coverage of the druggable proteome and maximise the chance of deconvoluting targets of compounds with uncharacterised modes of action. These strategies can assist in the discovery of new antimalarial drug targets that will facilitate the development of next-generation medicines with novel and diverse mechanisms, ensuring effective treatments for malaria are available in the future.</p>

<title>Data analysis for thermal stability proteomics experiments</title>

For processing, raw files were loaded and Spectronaut calculated the ideal mass tolerances for data extraction and scoring based on its extensive mass calibration with a correction factor of 1. Both at precursor and fragment level, the highest data-point within the selected <italic>m/z</italic> tolerance was chosen. Identification of peptides against the library was based on default Spectronaut settings (Manual for Spectronaut 13.0, available on Biognosis website). Briefly, precursor Qvalue Cut-off and Protein Qvalue Cut-off were as per default at 1%, therefore only those that passed the cut-off were considered as identified and used for subsequent processing. Retention time prediction type was set to dynamic iRT. Interference correction was on MS2 level. For quantification, the interference correction was activated and a cross run normalisation was performed using the total peak area as the normalisation base with a significance level of 0.01.</p>
<p>Significantly stabilised proteins were determined by first calculating the fold-change between the MIPS2673 (1 μM and 4 μM conditions) and vehicle-treated samples for each experiment. Statistical significance of the change in protein abundance was determined by a Welch’s t-test. Proteins that were significantly stabilised (fold-change &gt; 1.2, p &lt; 0.05) at both MIPS2673 concentrations in multiple experiments were considered putative targets.

<p>For limited proteolysis experiments, raw data files were processed using Spectronaut™ 13.0 as described above, except a limited proteolysis-specific <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infected red blood cell spectral library was used. The in-house generated library contained 85,039 peptides corresponding to 4,681 protein groups.</p>
<p>All limited proteolysis datasets were analysed at the modified peptide sequence level. The datasets were first analysed for differentially abundant peptides between MIPS2673 and vehicle by filtering based upon relative peptide abundance (absolute fold-change &gt; 1.5) and statistical significance (q &lt; 0.01). Within independent experiments, peptides meeting these thresholds at each drug concentration were considered significant. To filter and prioritise possible protein targets, a one-sided Fisher exact test was used to determine whether, based on the total number of peptides detected for each protein in the dataset, the number of significant LiP peptides identified for each protein was greater than would be expected by chance. Resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni method. Proteins passing the Bonferroni corrected statistical cut-off were considered putative targets. Proteins that did not pass the stringent Bonferroni corrected statistical cut-off, but were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) were considered lower confidence targets.

<title>Significance</title>
<p>Drug resistance now threatens all existing treatments for malaria, the world’s most lethal parasitic disease of humans. As a result, there is an urgent need for new antimalarial drug candidates that act via novel pathways and have a high barrier for resistance. It is therefore important to understand the mechanism of action for emerging antimalarials. However, target deconvolution is a major bottleneck for new drug development for malaria, particularly when genetic approaches for target identification are not possible. Mass spectrometry-based chemoproteomics has emerged as a powerful alternative strategy to deconvolute drug protein targets in a proteome-wide and unbiased manner. To this end, we report a novel promising antimalarial compound targeting M1 alanyl aminopeptidase (<italic>Pf</italic>A-M1) in the malaria parasite, and validate this target by combining biochemical assays on recombinant enzymes, with metabolomics, thermal stability chemoproteomics and a novel drug target deconvolution strategy for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>: limited proteolysis coupled mass spectrometry (LiP-MS). LiP-MS uses mass spectrometry to detect proteolytic stabilisation of proteins in a parasite lysate due to ligand binding. LiP-MS also estimated the binding site of MIPS2673 on <italic>Pf</italic>A-M1 to within ~5 Å of that determined by X-ray crystallography, highlighting the value of this approach in resolving both the molecular target and binding site of drugs. Implementing LiP-MS in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> expands the drug target deconvolution toolbox for malaria drug discovery. Our studies chemically validated selective targeting of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> M1 alanyl aminopeptidase as a promising multi-stage and cross-species strategy for the treatment of malaria and demonstrated the value of combining multiple orthogonal mechanism of action studies for target deconvolution. This combination of methods provides a validated workflow to help uncover the targets of other promising antimalarial candidates in the pipeline.</p>

Additionally, metabolomic analysis effectively documents specific alterations in the final steps of hemoglobin breakdown. These findings underscore the potential of the developed methodology, not only in understanding PfA-M1 targeting but also in its broader applicability to diverse malarial proteins or pathways. Revisions are needed to further enhance overall clarity and detail the scope of these implications.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The article &quot;Chemoproteomics validates selective targeting of Plasmodium M1 alanyl aminopeptidase as a cross-species strategy to treat malaria&quot; presents a series of biochemical methods based on proteomics and metabolomics, as a means to:</p>
<p>
(1) validate the specific targeting of biologically active molecules (MIPS2673) towards a defined (unique) protein target within a parasite</p>
<p>
and</p>
<p>
(2) to explore whether by quantifying the perturbations generated at the level of the parasite metabolome, it is possible to extrapolate which metabolic pathway has been disrupted by using this biologically active molecule and whether this may further confirm selective targeting in parasites of the expected (or in-vitro targeted) enzyme (here PfA-1).</p>
<p>The inhibitor used in this work by the authors (MIPS2673) is to my knowledge a novel one, although belonging to a chemical series previously explored by the authors, which recently enabled them to discover a specific PfA-M17 inhibitor, MIPS2571 (Edgard et al., 2022, ref 11 of this current work). Indeed, inhibitors specifically targeting either PfA-M1 or PfA-M17 (and not both, as currently done in the past) are scarce today, and highly needed to functionally characterize these two zinc-aminopeptidases. MIPS2673, blocks the development of erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum with an EC50 of 324 nM, blocks the parasite development at the young trophozoite stage at 5x EC50 (but at ring stages at 10xEC50, figure 1E), and inhibits the enzymatic activity of PfA-M1 (and its ortholog Pv-M1) but not of the related malarial metallo-aminopeptidases (M17 and M18 families) nor the human metalloenzymes from closely related enzymatic families, supporting its selective targeting of PfA-M1 (and Pv-M1).</p>
<p>All experiments are carried out in vitro (e.g. biochemical studies such as enzymology, proteomics, metabolomics) and on cultured parasites (erythrocyte stages of Plasmodium falciparum and several gametocytes stages obtained in vitro); there are no in vivo manipulations. The work related to Plasmodium vivax, which justifies the &quot;cross-species&quot; indication in the title of the article, is restricted to using a recombinant form of the M1-family aminopeptidase in enzymatic assays. The rest of the work concerns only Plasmodium falciparum. While I found globally that this work is original and brings new data and above all proposes chemical validation approaches that could be used for other target validations under similar limiting conditions (impossibility of KO of the gene), I have some specific questions to address to the authors.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>
-The chemoproteomic approach, that explores the ability of MIPS2673 to more significantly &quot;protect&quot; the putative target (PfA-M1) against thermal degradation or enzymatic attack (by proteinase K), to document its selective targeting towards PfA-M1 (the inhibitor, once associated with its target, is expected to stabilize its structure or prevent the action of end proteases), uses several concentrations of MIPS2673 and provides convincing results. My main criticism is that these tests are carried out with parasite extracts enriched in 30-38 hours old forms, and restricted to the fraction of soluble proteins isolated from these parasitic forms, which still limits the scope of the analysis. It is clear that this methodological approach is a choice that can be argued both biologically (PfA-M1 is well expressed in these stages of the parasite development) and biochemically (it is difficult to do proteomic analyses on insoluble proteins) but I regret that the authors do not discuss these limitations further, notably, I would have expected (from Figure 1E) some targets to be also present at ring stages.</p>
<p>-The metabolomic approach, by documenting the ability of MIPS2673 to selectively increase the number of non-hydrolyzed dipeptides in treated versus untreated parasites is another argument in favor of the selective targeting of PfA-M1 by MIPS2673, in particular by its broad-spectrum aminopeptidase action preferentially targeting peptides resulting from the degradation of hemoglobin by the parasite. The relative contribution of peptides derived from host hemoglobin versus other parasite proteins is, however, little discussed.</p>
<p>The work as a whole remains highly interesting, both for the specific topic of PfA-M1's role in parasite biology and for the method, applicable to other malarial drug contexts.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors first developed a new small molecular inhibitor that could target specifically the M1 metalloproteases of both important malaria parasite species Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax. This was done by a chemical modification of a previously developed molecule that targets PfM1 as well as PfM17 and possibly other Plasmodial metalloproteases. After the successful chemical synthesis, the authors showed that the derived inhibitor, named MIPS2673, has a strong antiparasitic activity with IC50 342 nM and it is highly specific for M1. With this in mind, the authors first carried out two large-scale proteomics to confirm the MIPS2673 interaction with PfM1 in the context of the total P. falciparum protein lysate. This was done first by using thermal shift profiling and subsequently limited proteolysis. While the first demonstrated overall interaction, the latter (limited proteolysis) could map more specifically the site of MIPS2673-PfM1 interaction, presumably the active site. Subsequent metabolomics analysis showed that MIPS2673 cytotoxic inhibitory effect leads to the accumulation of short peptides many of which originate from hemoglobin. Based on that the authors argue that the MIPS2673 mode of action (MOA) involves inhibition of hemoglobin digestion that in turn inhibits the parasite growth and development.</p>

<p>This is a manuscript that attempts to validate Plasmodium M1 alanyl aminopeptidase as a target for antimalarial drug development. The authors provide evidence that MIPS2673 inhibits recombinant enzymes from both Pf and Pv and is selective over other proteases. There is in vitro antimalarial activity. Chemoproteomic experiments demonstrate selective targeting of the PfA-M1 protease.</p>
<p>This is a continuation of previous work focused on designing inhibitors for aminopeptidases by a subset of these authors. Medicinal chemistry explorations resulted in the synthesis of MIPS2673 which has improved properties including potent inhibition of PfA-M1 and PvA-M1 with selectivity over a closed related peptidase. The compound also demonstrated selectivity over several human aminopeptidases and was not toxic to HEK293 cells at 40 uM. The activity against P. falciparum blood-stage parasites was about 300 nM.</p>
<p>Thermal stability studies confirmed that PfA-M1 was a binding target, however, there were other proteins consistently identified in the thermal stability studies. This raises the question as to their potential role as additional targets of this inhibitor. The authors dismiss these because they are not metalloproteases, but further analysis is warranted. This is particularly important as the authors were not able to generate mutants using in vitro evolution of resistance strategies. This often indicates that the inhibitor has more than one target.</p>
<p>The next set of experiments focused on a limited proteolysis approach. Again several proteins were identified as interacting with MIPS2673 including metalloproteases. The authors go on to analyze the LiP-MS data to identify the peptide from PfA-M1 which putatively interacts with MIPS2673. The authors are clearly focused on PfA-M1 as the target, but a further analysis of the other proteins identified by this method would be warranted and would provide evidence to either support or refute the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>The final set of experiments was an untargeted metabolomics analysis. They identified 97 peptides as significantly dysregulated after MIPS2673 treatment of infected cells and most of these peptides were derived from one of the hemoglobin chains. The accumulation of peptides was consistent with a block in hemoglobin digestion. This experiment does reveal a potential functional confirmation, but questions remain as to specificity.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an interesting series of experiments that have identified a putative inhibitor of PfA-M1 and PvA-M1. The work would be significantly strengthened by structure-aided analysis. It is unclear why putative binding sites cannot be analyzed via specific mutagenesis of the recombinant enzyme. In the thermal stability and LiP -MS analysis, other proteins were consistently identified in addition to PfA-M1 and yet no additional analysis was undertaken to explore these as potential targets. The metabolomics experiments were potentially interesting, but without significant additional work including different lengths of treatment and different stages of the parasite, the conclusions drawn are overstated. Many treatments disrupt hemoglobin digestion - either directly or indirectly and from the data presented here it is premature to conclude that treatment with MIPS2673 directly inhibits hemoglobin digestion. Finally, the potency of this compound on parasites grown in vitro is 300 nM - this would need improvements in potency and demonstration of in vivo efficacy in the SCID mouse model to consider this a candidate for a drug.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Overall, this is an interesting series of experiments that have identified a putative inhibitor of the Plasmodium M1 alanyl aminopeptidases, PfA-M1 and PvA-M1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The main strengths include the synthesis of MIPS2673 which is selectively active against the enzymes and in whole-cell assay.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The weaknesses include the lack of additional analysis of additional targets identified in the chemoproteomic approaches.</p>
