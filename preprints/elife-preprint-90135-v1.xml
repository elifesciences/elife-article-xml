<title>Abstract</title><p>The white-footed deermouse <italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic>, a long-lived rodent, is a key reservoir for agents of several zoonoses, including Lyme disease. While persistently infected, this deermouse is without apparent disability or diminished fitness. For a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood by <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> and adjusted for white cell concentrations. Deermice were distinguished from the mice and rats by LPS response profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. LPS-treated <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, in contrast to mice and rats, also displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with comparatively reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors in the deermice. The results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and perhaps other animal reservoirs for agents of human disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>How does the white-footed deermouse <italic>Peromyscus leucopus</italic> continue to thrive while sustaining infections with disease agents it serves as reservoir for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbour 2017</xref>)? The diverse tickborne pathogens (and diseases) for humans include the extracellular bacterium <italic>Borreliella burgdorferi</italic> (Lyme disease), the intracellular bacterium <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic> (anaplasmosis), the protozoan <italic>Babesia microti</italic> (babesiosis), and the Powassan flavivirus (viral encephalitis). Most deermice remain persistently infected but display scant inflammation in affected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Moody et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cook and Barbour 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Long et al. 2019</xref>), and without apparent consequence for fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schwanz et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Voordouw, Lachish, and Dolan 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>A related question—conceivably with the same answer--is what accounts for the two-to-three fold longer life span for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> than for the house mouse, <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sacher and Hart 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Labinskyy et al. 2009</xref>)? The abundance of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> across much of North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hall 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moscarella et al. 2019</xref>) and its adaptation to a variety of environments, including urban areas and toxic waste sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Biser et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Levengood and Heske 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Munshi-South and Kharchenko 2010</xref>), indicates successful adjustment to changing landscapes and climate. <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species, including the hantavirus reservoir <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Morzunov et al. 1998</xref>), are more closely related to hamsters and voles in family Cricetidae than to mice and rats of family Muridae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bradley et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>As a species native to North America, <italic>P. leucopus</italic> is an advantageous alternative to the house mouse, which is of Eurasian origin, for study of natural variation in populations that are readily at-hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bedford and Hoekstra 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Long et al. 2022</xref>). A disadvantage is the limited reagents and genetic tools of the sorts that are applied for mouse studies. As an alternative, we study <italic>P. leucopus</italic> with a non-reductionist approach that is comparative in design and agnostic in assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>). The genome-wide expression comparison for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> is with <italic>M. musculus</italic> and, added here, the brown rat <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>. Given the wide range of pathogenic microbes that deermice tolerate, we use the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as the primary experimental treatment because the inflammation it elicits within a few hours has features common to different kinds of serious infections, not to mention severe burns and critical injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Xiao et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously reported that a few hours after injection of LPS, <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> had distinguishing profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in the blood, spleen, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>). In brief, the inflammation phenotype of deermice was consistent with an “alternatively-activated” or M2-type macrophage polarization phenotype instead of the expected “classically-activated” or M1-type polarization phenotype that was observed for <italic>M. musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Murray et al. 2014</xref>). The deermice also differed from mice in displaying evidence of greater neutrophil activation and degranulation after LPS exposure. The potentially damaging action from neutrophil proteases and reactive oxygen species appeared to be mitigated in part in <italic>P. leucopu</italic>s by proteins like secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (Slpi) and superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2).</p>
<p>Here, we first address whether the heightened transcription of neutrophil-associated genes in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> is attributable to differences in numbers of white cells in the blood. To better match for genetic diversity, we substituted outbred <italic>M. musculus</italic> for the inbred BALB/c mouse of the previous study. We retained the experimental protocol of short-term responses to LPS. This main experiment was supplemented by a study of rats under the similar conditions and by an investigation of a different dose of LPS and duration of exposure in another group of deermice. The focus was on the blood of these animals, not only because the distinctions between species in their transcriptional profiles were nearly as numerous for this specimen as for spleen and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>), but also because for ecological and immunological studies of natural populations of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species blood is obtainable from captured-released animals without their sacrifice.</p>
<p>The results inform future studies of <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species, not only with respect to microbial infections and innate immunity, but also determinants of longevity and resilience in the face of other stressors, such as toxic substances in the environment. The findings pertain as well to the phenomenon of infection tolerance broadly documented in other reservoirs for human disease agents, such as betacoronaviruses and bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mandl et al. 2018</xref>). Less directly, the results provide for insights about maladaptive responses among humans to microbes, from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to post-infection fatigue syndromes.</p>

<title>LPS experiment and hematology studies</title>
<p>Twenty adult animals of each species and equally divided between sexes received by intraperitoneal injection either purified <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS at a dose of 10 µg per g body mass or saline alone (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Within 2 h LPS-treated animals of both species displayed piloerection and sickness behavior, i.e. reduced activity, hunched posture, and huddling. By the experiment’s termination at 4 h, 8 of 10 <italic>M. musculus</italic> treated with LPS had tachypnea, while only one of ten LPS-treated <italic>P. leucopus</italic> displayed this sign of the sepsis state (<italic>p</italic> = 0.005).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Within a given species there was little difference between LPS-treated and control animals in values for erythrocytes. But overall the deermice had lower mean (95% confidence interval) hematocrit at 42% (36-48), hemoglobin concentration at 13.8 g/dL (12.1-15.5), and mean corpuscular volume for erythrocytes at 49 fL (47-51) than <italic>M. musculus</italic> with respective values of 56% (51-62), 16.1 g/dL (14.6-17.7), and 60 fL (58-62) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). These hematology values for adult CD-1 <italic>M. musculus</italic> and LL stock <italic>P. leucopus</italic> in this study were close to what had been reported for these colony populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">CharlesRiver 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wiedmeyer et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to red blood cells, the mean numbers of white blood cells in the LPS groups in both species were lower than those of control groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Controls had a mean 4.9 (3.5-6.4) x 10<sup>3</sup> white cells per µl among <italic>M. musculus</italic> and 5.8 (4.2-7.4) x 10<sup>3</sup> white cells per µl among <italic>P. leucopus</italic> (p = 0.41). For the LPS-treated animals the values were 2.1 (1.5-2.7) x 10<sup>3</sup> for mice and 3.1 (0.9-5.4) x 10<sup>3</sup> for deermice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.39). However, there was difference between species among LPS-treated animals in the proportions of neutrophils and lymphocytes in the white cell population. The ratios of neutrophils to lymphocytes were 0.25 (0.14-0.45) and 0.20 (0.13-0.31) for control <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 0.53). But under the LPS condition. the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was 0.18 (0.11-0.28) for mice and 0.64 (0.42-0.97) for deermice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0006). The regression curves for plots of neutrophils and lymphocytes for LPS-treated and control <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and LPS-treated <italic>M. musculus</italic> had similar slopes, but the <italic>y</italic>-intercept was shifted upwards towards a higher ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes for blood from the LPS group of deermice. Control group mice and deermice and LPS-treated mice had similar percentages (∼5%) of monocytes in their blood; the mean monocyte percentage rose to 10% in LPS treated deermice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.12). Eosinophil percentages tended to be higher in deermice at a mean 3.4 (2.1-4.7)% than mice at 1.2 (0.5-1.9)% under either condition (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004).</p>

</fig>
<p>In the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> experiment with a 10-fold lower dose of LPS and a 12 hour duration, the mean (95% confidence interval) white blood cell count (x 10<sup>3</sup>) at termination 3.5 (2.5-4.5) in controls and 7.9 (6.0-9.7) in the LPS-treated (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Even with the higher overall white blood cell count the increase white cells was proportionately higher for neutrophils than for lymphocytes, as was seen in the deermice in the higher dose LPS experiment. The ratio of neutrophils-to-lymphocytes was 0.20 (0.07-0.32) in the controls and 0.38 (0.26-0.50) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.10).</p>
<p>The higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in the deermice exposed to LPS was consistent with the greater neutrophil activation noted by transcriptional analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>). But many individual genes that constitute this and related gene ontology (GO) terms had transcription levels in the deermice that far exceeded a three-fold difference in neutrophil counts. For some genes fold-changes were a hundred or more fold, which suggested that the distinctive LPS transcriptional response profile between species was not attributable solely to neutrophil counts.</p>

<title>Genome-wide expression in blood of deermice and mice</title>
<p>We used the respective transcript sets from the reference genomes for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> for deep coverage RNA-seq with paired-end ∼150 nt reads. Principle component analyses (PCA) of the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> data and <italic>M. musculus</italic> data revealed that untreated controls had coherent profiles within each species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). With the exception of one mouse, the LPS-treated <italic>M. musculus</italic> were also in a tight PCA cluster. In contrast, the LPS-treated deermice displayed a diversity of genome-wide transcription profiles and limited clustering.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="543964v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>For both species the number of genes with higher expression with LPS exposure exceeded those with lower or unchanged expression (Dryad Table D1). For <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> the mean fold-changes were 1.32 (1.29-1.35) and 1.30 (1.24-1.36), respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 0.31). Among <italic>P. leucopus</italic> 1154 DEGs with an absolute fold-change ≥ 2 and false-discovery rate <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.003 were identified. The corresponding number for <italic>M. musculus</italic> was 1266. Two DEGs that distinguished females from males among controls or LPS-treated were the non-coding Xist, the X chromosome inactivating gene, for females and the Y chromosome-linked DEAD-box helicase 3 (Ddx3y) gene for males.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the GO term analyses of these DEGs for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic>. The up-regulated gene profile for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> featured GO terms associated with “neutrophil degranulation”, “myeloid leukocyte activation”, “leukocyte migration”, and “response to molecule of bacterial origin”. Other sets of up-regulated genes for the deermice were “negative regulation of cytokine production” and “regulation of reactive oxygen species metabolic process”. None of these were up-regulated gene GO terms with <italic>p</italic> values &lt; 10<sup>11</sup> for <italic>M. musculus</italic>. Indeed, “leukocyte activation” and “leukocyte migration” were GO terms for down-regulated DEGs in <italic>M. musculus</italic>. Distinctive GO terms for up-regulated genes distinguishing mice from deermice were “response to virus”, “response to interferon-beta”, “response to interferon-gamma”, “response to protozoan”, and “type II interferon signaling”.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="543964v1_fig3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Of the top 100 DEGs for each species by ascending FDR <italic>p</italic> value, 24 genes were shared between species (Supplementary Materials Table S1). These included up-regulated Bcl3, Ccl3, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl3, Cxcl10, Il1rn, and Sod2. Among the 100 mouse DEGs, 20 were constituents of GO terms “response to virus” (GO:0009615) or “response to interferon-beta” (GO:0035456) and only 3 were members of GO term sets “response to molecule of bacterial origin” (GO:0002237) or “response to lipopolysaccharide” (GO:0032496). In contrast, among the top 100 deermouse DEGs, there were only 2 associated with the virus or type 1 interferon GO terms, but 12 were associated with either or both of the bacterial molecule GO terms.</p>
<p>The emerging picture was of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> responding to LPS exposure as if infected with an extracellular bacterial pathogen, including with activated neutrophils. While <italic>M. musculus</italic> animals shared with <italic>P. leucopus</italic> some features of an antibacterial response, they also displayed type I and type II interferon type response profiles associated with infections with viruses and intracellular bacteria and parasites.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Targeted RNA seq analysis</title>
<p>A challenge for cross-species RNA-seq is commensurability between annotated transcripts of reference sets. Orthologous genes can be identified, but mRNA isoforms and their 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions may not fully correspond. Accordingly, we limited targeted RNA-seq to protein coding sequences of mRNAs for the corresponding sets of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> sequences.</p>
<p>For cross-species normalization we chose a gene whose transcription approximated the varying numbers of white cells. The myeloid cell marker CD45, formally “protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, C”, and encoded by the Ptprc gene, was the denominator transcript for normalization across species and treatments. In humans, mice, and hamsters, Ptprc is expressed by nucleated hematopoietic cells and used as a white cell marker for flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schnizlein-Bick et al. 2002</xref>). Pearson’s continuous and Spearman’s ranked correlations between log-transformed total white blood cell counts and normalized reads for Ptprc across 40 animals representing both species, sexes, and treatments were 0.40 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01) and 0.34 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03), respectively.</p>
<p>The 113 mRNA coding sequences, which are listed in Methods, were drawn from the identified DEGs for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> from the genome-wide RNA-seq. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> comprises plots of the log-transformed mean target-to-Ptprc ratios for the 10 <italic>P. leucopus</italic> controls and 10 <italic>M. musculus</italic> controls (left panel) and for the 10 <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and 10 <italic>M. musculus</italic> treated with LPS (right panel). For untreated animals there was high correlation and a regression coefficient of ∼1 between the paired data for deermice and mice. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene (MT-Co1) and S100a9, a subunit of calprotectin, were comparably transcribed. But, there were other coding sequences that stood out for either their greater or lesser transcription in untreated deermice than mice. Two examples of greater expression were Arg1 and MX dynaminin-like GTPase 2 (Mx2), an ISG, while two examples of lesser expression were matrix metalloprotease 8 (Mmp8) and Slpi. There was low to undetectable transcription of Nos2 and interferon-gamma (Ifng) in the blood of controls of both species.</p>

<p>For the LPS-treated animals there was, as expected for this selected set, higher expression of the majority genes and greater heterogeneity between <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> in their responses for represented genes. In contrast to the findings with controls, Ifng and Nos2 were substantially more transcribed in treated mice, but these genes were only marginally so in deermice. A comparatively restrained transcriptional response in deermice was also noted for Mx2. On the other hand, there were greater fold-change from baseline in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> than in <italic>M. musculus</italic> for interleukin-1 beta (Il1b), Mmp8, Slpi, and S100a9.</p>

<p>To assess differences by sex among <italic>P. leucopus</italic> in their responses to LPS, we used the original reads from 20 deermice from the previous blood RNA-seq study in combination with the data for 20 deermice of the present study for the targeted RNA-seq. This yielded 11 deermice of each sex receiving LPS in the same dose and 9 animals of each sex receiving saline instead. Using <italic>Z</italic>-scores to provide comparability across studies and after correcting for multiple testing, we found no difference between females and males in their responses, beyond a tendency for Il6 and Il10 expression to be higher in males than females in the LPS treatment group.</p>

<p>While we could not type single cells using protein markers, we could assess relative transcription of established indicators of different white cell subpopulations in whole blood. The present study, which incorporated outbred <italic>M. musculus</italic> instead of an inbred strain, confirmed the previous finding of an inversion between Nos2 and Arg1 expression: that is, high Nos2 and low Arg1 in <italic>M. musculus</italic> and the opposite in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

<p>In addition to the ratio of Nos2 to Arg1 expression for typing macrophage and monocyte subpopulations, there are also the relative expressions of three other pairs of genes: (1) IL12 and IL10, where a lower IL12/IL10 ratio is more characteristic of alternatively activated or M2 type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">van Stijn et al. 2015</xref>; P.J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Murray 2017</xref>); (2) the proto-oncogene kinases Akt1 and Akt2, where the associations are Akt1 with M2-type and Akt2 with M1-type macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Vergadi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arranz et al. 2012</xref>); and (3) CD14 and CD16 (low affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor III; Fcgr3), where low expression of CD14 and high expression of CD16/Fcgr3 is associated with “non-classical” monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Narasimhan et al. 2019</xref>). There is evidence that nonclassical monocytes can change to M2-type macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Italiani and Boraschi 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>These four relationships, which are presented as log-transformed ratios of Nos2/Arg1, IL12/IL10, Akt1/Akt2, and CD14/CD16, are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>. The differences between <italic>P. musculus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> in the ratios of Nos2/Arg1 and IL12/IL10 were reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>), and the present study with outbred mice and normalization for white cells replicated those findings. In both species the Akt1/Akt2 ratio declined in LPS-treated animals, but for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> the ratio remained &gt; 1.0 even among LPS-treated animals, while in the blood of <italic>M. musculus</italic> the ratio was &lt; 1.0 at baseline and declined further in the LPS-treated animals.</p>

In mice the Cd14/Cd16 ratio increased from baseline in the LPS group. In the deermice the ratio in control animals was midway between the two groups of mice but there was a marked decrease in the LPS-treated deermice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This was not associated with a fall in the absolute numbers or percentages of monocytes in the blood of these animals.</p>
<p>Taken together, the Nos2-Arg1, Il12-Il10, Akt1-Akt2, and CD14-CD16 relationships document a disposition toward alternatively-activated macrophages and nonclassical monocytes in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> both before and after exposure to LPS.

In an experiment with the rat <italic>R. norvegicus</italic>, we used two different LPS doses (5 µg/g and 20 µg/g) but the same 4 h endpoint and whole blood as the sample. Both groups of LPS-treated rats had lowered total white blood cells and, like the mice, lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios compared to controls (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). There were also marked elevations of interferon-gamma, interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 proteins from undetectable levels in the blood of the treated rats. By targeted RNA-seq there were 24x fold-changes between the LPS-treated rats and control rats for Ifng and Nos2 but only ∼3x fold-change for Il1b. We also noted that in the rat the Nos2-Arg1, Il12-Il10, Akt1-Akt2, and CD14-CD16 relationships that serve to signify monocyte and macrophage phenotypes resembled those of the mice and not what was observed in deermice.</p>

<p>We asked why the interferon-gamma response observed in CD-1 mice and rats here was not as pronounced in BALB/c mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>). Accordingly, we used the RNA-seq reads from the prior study in combination with the reads of the present study and carried out targeted RNA-seq as described (Supplementary Materials Figure S1). The BALB/c inbred mice had, like the CD-1 mice, modest elevations of Il1b transcription. Ifng expression was also elevated in the BALB/c animals but not to the degree noted in CD-1 mice or rats. An explanation for this may be an inherent difference of BALB/c mice from other strains in their lower interferon-gamma response to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Soudi et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kuroda, Kito, and Yamashita 2002</xref>).</p>

<p>The plausible sources of Ifng mRNA in whole blood are T-cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, and Type 1 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Quatrini et al. 2017</xref>). A DEG for <italic>M. musculus</italic> by both genome-wide and targeted RNA-seq (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; Table S2) was Cd69, a C-type lectin protein and an early activation antigen for these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Heinzelmann et al. 2000</xref>). In <italic>P. leucopus</italic> transcription Cd69 occurred in the blood of control <italic>P. leucopus</italic> but it was the same or only marginally different for the LPS-treated animals (lower left of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>M. musculus</italic> the baseline transcription of Cd69 was below that of <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, but in the LPS-treated mice it was many fold higher. In mice transcripts for Cd69 correlated tightly with Ifng transcription, while in the deermice there was little correlation between Cd69 and Ifng expression at those low levels (lower right).</p>
<p>The findings are consistent with CD69-positive cells being a source of Ifng in mice. Cd69 transcription was comparatively higher in control deermice than in control mice, so we presume that deermice have CD69-positive cells at baseline. One explanation then for the comparatively few Ifng transcripts in the deermice after LPS is a diminished responsiveness of these cells. Tlr4 expression increased ∼3-fold more in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> than in <italic>M. musculus</italic> after LPS, but the magnitude of the relative decline in expression of Cd14 in deermice than mice was even greater (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). CD14 is required for the LPS-stimulated signaling through surface TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mazgaeen and Gurung 2020</xref>), and, as such, its decreased availability for this signaling pathway is a possible explanation for the moderated response to LPS in <italic>P. leucopus</italic>.</p>

<p>As noted, GO terms differentiating mice from deermice included “response to interferon-beta” and “response to virus” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). There was also the example of Mx2, an ISG with anti-viral activity on its own, that showed a greater fold-change from baseline in mice than in deermice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Five other ISGs--guanylate binding protein 4 (Gbp4), interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeat (Ifit1), interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7), ubiquitin-type modifier ISG15 (Isg15), and 2’-5’ oligoadenylate synthase 1A (Oas1a)—had elevated transcription in all LPS-treated animals. But the magnitude of fold change was less in the deermice, ranging from 6-25% of what it was in the LPS group of mice (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The up-regulation of these ISGs was evidence of type 1 interferon action, but transcripts for interferon-1 beta (Ifnb) or -alpha (Ifna) themselves were scarcely detectable in deermice or mice in the blood under either condition. We then considered pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that conceivably part of a signaling pathway leading to ISG expression. Among the DEGs from the genome-wide analyses were four cytoplasmic PRRs (Table S2): (1) Rigi (formerly Ddx58), which encodes the RNA helicase retinoic acid-inducible I (RIG-I); (2) Ifih1, which encodes interferon induced with helicase C domain 1, also known as MDA5 and a RIG-I-like receptor; (3) Dhx58, also known LGP2 and another RIG-I-like receptor; and (4) cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), which is part of the cGAS-STING sensing pathway.</p>
<p>All four of these cytoplasmic PRRs were up-regulated in blood of LPS-treated mice and deermice (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). But, again, for each of them the magnitude of fold change was less by 50-90% in treated <italic>P. leucopus</italic> than in <italic>M. musculus</italic>. The coefficients of determination for the 6 ISGs and the 4 PRRs are provided in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>. For most of the pairs there was evidence of covariation across all 40 animals. When the correlation was low across all the data, e.g. between the ISG Mx2 and the PRR Rigi or the ISGs Mx2 and Gbp4, it was high within a species.</p>

<title>Endogenous retroviruses in deermice, mice, and rats after LPS exposure</title>
<p>The six ISGs are nonexclusive consequences of activity of type I interferons. What we could document was the association of transcription of the gene for the cytoplasmic PPRs, including RIG-I, and the ISGs in both species, as well as the distinction between deermice in the magnitude of the responses of both PRRs and ISGs. These findings led us to ask what could be a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) for signaling pathways leading to expression of type 1 interferons.</p>
<p>One of these is endogenous retroviruses (ERV). The activity of these diverse, abundant, and pervasive elements have been recognized as one of the drivers of innate immune responses to a microbe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hurst and Magiorkinis 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lima-Junior et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rangel et al. 2022</xref>). Our attention was drawn to ERVs by finding in the genome-wide RNA-seq of LPS-treated and control rats that 2 of the 3 highest scoring DEGs by FDR <italic>p</italic> value and fold-change were a <italic>gag-pol</italic> polyprotein of a leukemia virus with 131x fold-change from controls and a mouse leukemia virus (MLV) envelope (Env) protein with 62x fold-change (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).</p>
<p>We returned to the mouse and deermouse data. There were four MLV or other ERV Env proteins among the 1266 genome-wide RNA-seq DEGs for <italic>M. musculus</italic>. But, there was no ERV Env protein identified as such among the 1154 DEGs identified for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> (Table S1; Dryad Table D1). One possible explanation for the difference was an incomplete annotation of the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> genome. We took three approaches to rectify this. The first was to examine the DEGs for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> that encoded a polypeptide ≥ 200 amino acids and was annotated for the genome as “uncharacterized”. A search with these candidates of both the virus and rodent proteins databases identified two that were homologous with <italic>gag-pol</italic> polyproteins of ERVs, mainly leukemia viruses, of mammals.</p>
<p>For a second approach we carried out a de novo transcript assembly of mRNA reads from blood of LPS-treated and control <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and used the resultant contigs as the reference set for RNA-seq analysis. This identified two contigs that were measurably transcribed in the blood, differentially expressed between conditions, and were homologous to ERV sequences. One was revealed to be an Env protein that was identical to a <italic>P. leucopus</italic> protein annotated as “MLV-related proviral Env protein” (XP_037065362). The second was a <italic>gag-pol</italic> protein. The latter was near-identical to the <italic>gag-pol</italic> protein identified by the first approach.</p>
<p>The third approach was to scan the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> genome for nonredundant sequences, defined as &lt; 95% identity, that were homologous with ERV <italic>pol</italic> sequences, which are not typically annotated because of masking for repetitive sequences This analysis yielded 615 unique sequences. These were used in turn as reference set for RNA-seq. There were 4 sequences that met the criterion of FDR <italic>p</italic> value &lt;0.05. Three were transcribed at 5- to 40-fold higher levels in LPS-treated deermice than in controls. But all three, as well as the fourth, a down-regulated DEG, were ERV relics with truncations, frame shifts, and in-frame stop codons. These were assessed as non-coding RNAs and not further pursued in this study.</p>
<p>To represent <italic>P. leucopus</italic> in a targeted RNA-seq comparison with mice and rats we settled on the Env protein and <italic>gag-pol</italic> coding sequences identified present in the blood mRNA and as DEGs. Representing <italic>M. musculus</italic> were highest ranked MLV Env and <italic>gag-pol</italic> protein sequences among the DEGs. For rats we chose Env and <italic>gag-pol</italic> proteins that were second and third ranked DEGs identified in the genome-wide RNA-seq (Dryad table). Because of length differences for the coding sequences, the unit used for cross-species analysis was reads per kilobase before normalization for Ptprc transcription.</p>
<p>The left panel of <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> shows the striking transcriptional fold-change in LPS-treated rats of both Env and <italic>gag-pol</italic> sequences over controls. Of lesser magnitude but no less significant was the fold-change observed <italic>M. musculus</italic> for both Env and <italic>gag-pol</italic> sequences. In both mice and rats Env and <italic>gag-pol</italic> read values were highly correlated across conditions. In contrast, in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> the magnitudes of fold-change upwards for <italic>gag-pol</italic> was less than in mice or rats, and transcription of the Env protein sequence was actually lower in LPS-treated animals than in controls. While there was a tight association between Env protein and the PRR Rigi transcription in the M. musculus, this was not observed in <italic>P. leucopus</italic>. Rigi transcription was moderately higher at the time that Env protein’s transcription was lower in the LPS group (right panel of <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<title>Study limitations</title>
<p>The approach was forward and unbiased, looking for differences between species broadly across their transcriptomes. The findings lead to hypotheses, but reverse genetics in service of that testing was not applied here. In selective cases we could point to supporting evidence in the literature on <italic>M. musculus</italic> and the phenotypes of relevant gene knockouts, but there are no such resources for <italic>Peromyscus</italic> as yet. The resource constraint also applies to the availability of antibodies for use with <italic>Peromyscus</italic> for immunoassays for specific proteins, e.g. interferon-gamma, in serum, or for cell markers, e.g. CD69, for flow cytometry of white blood cells.</p>
<p>While a strength of the study was use of an outbred population of <italic>M. musculus</italic> to approximate the genetic diversity of the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> in the study, this meant that some genes of potential relevance might have gone undetected, i.e. from type II error. The variances for a sample of genetically diverse outbred animals, like the LL stock of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> (A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Long et al. 2019</xref>; P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Long et al. 2022</xref>), would be expected to be greater than for the same sized sample of inbred animals. For some traits, especially ones that are complex or under balancing selection, even sample sizes of 10 in each group may not have provided sufficient power for discrimination between deermice and mice.</p>
<p>The parameters for the experiment of LPS dose, the route, and duration of experiment each might have had different values under another design. Those particular choices were based on past studies of deermice and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Langeroudi et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>). In another experiment we found that with doses twice or half those given the deermice the responses by rats to the different doses were indistinguishable by hematology, cytokine assays, and RNA-seq. Thus, there seems to be some latitude in the dose and still achieving replication. We obtained similar results for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> when we looked at a replicate of the experiment with the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>), when the dose was lower and duration lengthened to 12 h (this study), and when the inflammatory stimulus was bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barbour et al. 2019</xref>). The bacterial infection experiment indicated that the observed effect in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> was not limited to a TLR4 agonist; the lipoproteins of <italic>B. hermsii</italic> are agonists for TLR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Salazar et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While the rodents in these experiments were housed in the same facility and ate the same diet, we cannot exclude inherent differences in gastrointestinal microbiota between species and individual outbred animals as co-variables for the experimental outcomes. We reported differences between the LL stock <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and BALB/c <italic>M. musculus</italic> of the same age and diet in their microbiomes by metagenomic analysis and microbiologic means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Milovic et al. 2020</xref>). This included a commensal <italic>Tritrichomonas</italic> sp. in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> but not in the <italic>M. musculus</italic> in the study. The presence of these protozoa affects innate and adaptive immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Escalante et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chiaranunt et al. 2022</xref>), but it is not clear whether there are systemic consequences of colonization by this flagellate.</p>

<title>LPS, ERVs, and interferons</title>
<p>The results confirm previous reports of heightened transcription of ERV sequences in mice or mouse cells after exposure to LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hara et al. 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jongstra and Moroni 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stoye and Moroni 1983</xref>). Here we add the example of the rat. The LPS was administered in solution and not by means of membrane vesicles. The sensing PRR presumably was surface-displayed, membrane-anchored TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mazgaeen and Gurung 2020</xref>). It follows that a second, indirect effect of LPS on the mouse is through its provocation of increased ERV transcription intracellularly. ERV-origin RNA, cDNA and/or protein would then be recognized by a cytoplasmic PRR. RIG-I was one associated with ERV transcription in this study. Kong et al. reported that LPS stimulated expression of Rigi in a mouse macrophages but did not investigate ERVs for an intermediary function in this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kong et al. 2009</xref>). As was demonstrated for LINE type retrotransposons in human fibroblasts, intracellular PRR signaling can trigger a type 1 interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">De Cecco et al. 2019</xref>). The combination of these two signaling events, i.e. one through surface TLR4 by LPS itself and another through intracellular PPR(s) by to-be-defined ERV products, manifested in mice and rats as a response profile that had features of both a response to a virus with type 1 interferon and ISGs and a response to a bacterial PAMP like LPS with acute phase reactants such as calprotectin and serum amyloid.</p>
<p>This or a similar phenomenon has been observed under other circumstances. In humans there was heightened transcription of retrotransposons in patients with septic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mommert et al. 2020</xref>), as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from human subjects experimentally injected with LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Pisano et al. 2020</xref>). Bacteria like <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> that express TLR2 agonists, such as lipoteichoic acid, promoted expression of ERVs, which in turn modulated host immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lima-Junior et al. 2021</xref>). A synthetic analog of a <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> lipoprotein activated human monocytic cells and promoted replication of the latent HIV virus in cells that were persistently infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Norgard et al. 1996</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>P. leucopus</italic> does not fit with this model. Instead of the prominent interferon-gamma response observed in mice and rats, there were prominent responses of interleukin-1 beta and genes associated with neutrophil activation. Instead of the much heightened expression of ISGs, like Mx2 and Isg15, in mice treated with LPS, the deermice under the same condition had a more subdued ISG transcription profile. Instead of increased expression of ERV Env protein sequences in blood of mice and rats treated with LPS, there was decreased transcription of the homologous MLV Env gene in like-treated <italic>P. leucopus</italic>.</p>
<p>Our first annotation of the <italic>P. leucopus</italic> genome did not identify the gene for zinc finger protein 809 (Zfp809) (A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Long et al. 2019</xref>), a KRAB domain protein that initiates ERV silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wolf et al. 2015</xref>). But subsequent rounds of annotation confirmed genes and transcripts for Zfp809 in both <italic>P. leucopu</italic>s (XP_028728362) and <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> (XP_006982432). In neither deermice nor mice nor rats was Zfp809 among the up- or down-regulated DEGs with LPS (Dryad Table D1).</p>
<p>Reducing the differences between <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and the murids <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> to a single all-embracing attribute may be fruitless. But from a perspective that also takes in the 2-3x longer life span of the white-footed deermouse compared to the house mouse and the capacity of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> to serve as disease agent reservoir while maintaining if not increasing its distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Moscarella et al. 2019</xref>), the feature that seems to best distinguish the deermouse from either the mouse or rat is its predominantly anti-inflammatory quality. The presentation of this trait likely has a complex, polygenic basis, with environmental (including microbiota) and epigenetic influences. An individual’s placement is on a spectrum or, more likely, a landscape rather than in one or another binary or Mendelian category.</p>
<p>One argument against a purely anti-inflammatory characterization is the greater neutrophil numbers and activity in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> compared to <italic>M. musculus</italic> in the LPS experiment. The neutrophil activation, migration, and phagocytosis would be appropriate early defenses against a pyogenic pathogen. But if not contained, they bring local and systemic risks for the host. This damage would not likely be from nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species, given the minimal Nos2 transcription. But deermice showed heightened expression of proteases, such as Mmp8, enzymes for reactive oxygen species, such as NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), and facilitators of neutrophil extracellular traps, such as PAD4 (Padi4) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We had previously identified possible mitigators, such as the protease inhibitor Slpi and superoxide dismutase 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>). These findings were replicated here. The topic of neutrophil activation and these and other possible counters is considered in more detail elsewhere.</p>

<title>An anti-inflammatory disposition but at what cost?</title>
<p>An assignment of infection tolerance to a host and pathogen pairing assumes sufficient immunity against the microbe to keep it in check if elimination fails. <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, <italic>P. maniculatus</italic>, and likely some other <italic>Peromyscus</italic> species are in this sense “immunocompetent” with respect to the microbes they host and with which they may have a long history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoen et al. 2009</xref>). Yet, has this balance of resistance and tolerance for certain host-associated microbes been achieved in a trade-off that entails vulnerabilities to other types of agents?</p>
<p>The selection of LPS as the experimental model meant to cover this contingency, at least for the common denominator of acute inflammation many types of infections elicit. But LPS studies revealed potential weaknesses of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> that some pathogens might exploit. One of these is the low expression of inducible nitric oxide. Although Nos2 gene knockouts in <italic>M. musculus</italic> had lower LPS-induced mortality than their wild-type counterparts, the mutants were more susceptible to the protozoan <italic>Leishmania major</italic> and the facultative intracellular bacterium <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wei et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">MacMicking et al. 1995</xref>). While there are no known studies of either of these pathogens in <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, the related species <italic>P. yucatanicus</italic> is the main reservoir for <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chable-Santos et al. 1995</xref>). Compared with <italic>M. musculus</italic>, which suffer a high fatality rate from experimental infections with <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>P. yucatanicus</italic> infections are commonly asymptomatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Loría-Cervera et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the restrained interferon and ISG response shown by <italic>P. leucopus</italic>, another plausible vulnerability would be viral infections. But other studies indicate that neither RNA nor DNA viruses pose an inordinately high risk for <italic>Peromyscus</italic>. Both tolerance of and resistance to the tickborne encephalitis flavivirus Powassan virus by <italic>P. leucopus</italic> were demonstrated in an experimental model in which mice, by contrast, were severely affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mlera et al. 2017</xref>). <italic>P. maniculatus</italic> and <italic>P. leucopus</italic> have been successfully infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the respiratory route, but the infected animals displayed only mild pathology, manifested little if any disability, and recovered within a few days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fagre et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Griffin et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Milovic et al. 2023</xref>).

<title>Implications for Lyme disease and other zoonoses</title>
<p>Our studies of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> began with a natural population and documented a &gt;80% prevalence of infection and high incidence of re-infections by <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> in the area’s white-footed deermouse, the most abundant mammal there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bunikis et al. 2004</xref>). This was a Lyme disease endemic area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Diuk-Wasser et al. 2012</xref>), where residents frequently presented for medical care for a variety of clinical manifestations, from mild to serious, of <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Steere et al. 1986</xref>). Subclinical infections in humans occur, but most of those who become infected have a definable illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Steere et al. 1998</xref>). The localized or systemic presence of the microbe is a necessary condition for Lyme disease, but the majority of the symptoms and signs are attributable to inflammation elicited by the organism’s presence and not from virulence properties per se or the hijacking of host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Coburn et al. 2021</xref>). Since humans are transmission dead-ends for <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and many other zoonotic agents in their life cycles, it is not surprising that human infections are generally more debilitating if not fatal than what adapted natural hosts experience.</p>
<p>It is in the space between the asymptomatic natural host and symptomatic inadvertent host where there may be insights with basic and translational application. With this goal, we consider the ways the results inform studies of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease, where “disease” includes lingering disorders akin to “long Covid” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Nathan 2022</xref>), and where “pathogenesis” includes both microbial and host contributions. Plausibly-germane deermouse-mouse differences identified in our studies to date are summarized in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>. Two are further highlighted here.</p>

<p>The first is macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Murray 2017</xref>). By the criteria summarized above, the response to LPS by <italic>P. leucopus</italic> is consistent with the alternatively-activated or M2 type, rather than the expected classical or M1 type. But it was not only LPS-treated deermice that had this attribute, the blood of untreated animals also displayed M2 type polarization features. This included a comparatively high Arg1 expression level and a Akt1/Akt2 ratio of less than 1 at baseline in the study. This suggests that studies of other mammals, including humans, need not administer LPS or other TLR agonist to assess a blood specimen by selected RT-qPCR or equivalent assay for a disposition toward M1 or M2-type polarization. This reading could serve as a prognostic indicator of the inflammatory response to infection with <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> or other pathogen and the long-term outcome.</p>
<p>The second difference we highlight is the activation of ERV transcription that was prominent in the LPS-treated mice and rats but not in similarly-treated deermice. A paradoxical enlistment of antiviral defenses, including type 1 and type 2 interferons, for an infection with an extracellular bacterium, like <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic>, may bring about more harm than benefit, especially if the resultant inflammation persists after antibiotic therapy. There are various ways to assess ERV activation in the blood, including assays for RNA, protein, and reverse transcriptase activity. A xenotropic MLV-related retrovirus has been discounted as a cause of chronic fatigue syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McClure and Kaye 2010</xref>). However, production of whole virions need not occur for there to be PRR signaling in response to cytoplasmic Env protein, single stranded RNA, or cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Russ and Iordanskiy 2023</xref>).</p>

Following the recommendation of Hedges et al. we used the natural logarithm (<italic>ln</italic>) of ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hedges, Gurevitch, and Curtis 1999</xref>). An alternative gene for adjustments for frequencies of white blood cells in the sample was mitochondrial 12S rRNA; mature erythrocytes do not have mitochondria. The coefficient of determination (<italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic>) for log-transformed fold changes between <italic>Peromyscus</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> with Ptprc-matched reads for normalization and the corresponding values with mitochondrial 12S rRNA-matched reads for normalization was 0.96 with a coefficient of 1.04. Because of the standard uses of Ptprc/CD45 as a signifier of white blood cells, we chose this gene for indexing over the 12S rRNA.</p>

The sources for these coding sequences were the reference genome transcript sets for <italic>P. leucopus, M. musculus</italic>, and <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> listed above under “Genome-wide differential gene expression”. If there were two or more isoforms of the mRNAs and the amino acid sequences differed, the default selection for the coding sequence was the first listed isoform. The lengths of the orthologous pairs of <italic>P. leucopus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> coding sequences were either identical or within 2% of the other. Note that Fcgr1 (Cd64) was not included in the comparison, because in <italic>P. leucopus</italic> it is a pseudogene (GenBank accession OP292976).</p>

<title>Reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR assays</title>
<p>RT-qPCR assays and the corresponding primers for measurement of transcripts of genes for nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) were those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balderrama-Gutierrez et al. 2021</xref>). These primers worked for M. musculus as well as P. leucopus using modified cycling conditions. For the arginase 1 transcript assays different primer sets were used for each species. The forward and reverse primer sets for the 352 bp Arg1 product for <italic>P. leucopus</italic> were 5’-TCCGCTGACAACCAACTCTG and 5’-GACAGGTGTGCCAGTAGATG, respectively. The corresponding primer pairs for a 348 bp Arg1 of <italic>M. musculus</italic> were 5’-TGTGAAGAACCCACGGTCTG and 5’-ACGTCTCGCAAGCCAATGTA. cDNA synthesis and qPCR were achieved with a Power Sybr Green RNA-to-Ct 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems) in 96 MicroAmp Fast Reaction Tubes using an Applied Biosystems StepOne Plus real-time PCR instrument. The initial steps for all assays were 48 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 10 min. For Arg1 and Nos2 assays, this was followed by 40 cycles of a 2-step PCR of, first, 95°C for 15 s and then, second, annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min. The cycling conditions for Gapdh were 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s followed by 60 °C for 30 s.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Means are presented with asymmetrical 95% confidence intervals (CI) to accommodate data that was not normally distributed. Parametric (<italic>t</italic> test) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney) tests of significance were 2-tailed. Unless otherwise stated, the <italic>t</italic> test <italic>p</italic> value is given. Categorical variables were assessed by 2-tailed Fisher’s exact test. FDR correction of <italic>p</italic> values for multiple testing was by the Benjamini-Hochberg method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Benjamini and Hochberg 1995</xref>), as implemented in CLC Genomics Workbench (see above), or False Discovery Rate Online Calculator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tools.carbocation.com/FDR">https://tools.carbocation.com/FDR</ext-link>). Discriminant Analysis, linear regression, correlation, coefficient of determination, and General Linear Model analyses were performed with SYSTAT v. 13.1 software (Systat Software, Inc.).</p>

<p>Summary: A well-executed series of experiments that will likely be of immense interest to (a) vector-borne disease researchers and (b) gram-negative sepsis/bacteremia researchers. The study uses comparative transcriptomics to begin probing what makes Peromyscus leucopus a unique host for numerous pathogens. Most issues with the paper are trivial, relating to descriptions of statistical cutoffs. While the paper does not provide mechanistic insight into how P. leucopus restrains its immune response to LPS or other microbial invaders, it is likely that this paper will be frequently consulted by researchers trying to understand that phenomenon.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>o Use of outbred M. musculus is a commendable choice for the studies here.</p>
<p>
o Excellent decision by the authors to use their published dataset (with appropriate statistical normalization) to improve their statistical power to examine sex-biased gene expression. Is it possible to go one step further and briefly incorporate their prior BALB/c data to see how the BALB/c compare to the outbred mice. This could perhaps be just a PCA plot to see if they cluster with the outbred mice and/or Peromyscus, or are separate.</p>
<p>
o The correlations and ratios used to try to understand immune cell dynamics are clever and likely reflect interesting biology, but caution should be used when interpreting these indirect measures. As there are no tools for cell separation in P. leucopus, the authors should continue to include these data to stimulate ideas in the field, but readers should understand the &quot;conclusions&quot; are hypotheses due to the nature of the bulk RNAseq.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>o Supplemental Table 1 only lists genes that passed the authors statistical thresholds. The full list of genes detected in their analysis should be included with read counts, statistics, etc. as supplemental information</p>
<p>
o While P. leucopus is a critical reservoir for B. burgdorferi, caution should be taken in directly connecting the data presented here and the Lyme disease spirochete. While it's possible that P. leucopus have a universal mechanism for limiting inflammation in response to PAMPs, B. burgdorferi lack LPS and so it is also possible the mechanisms that enable LPS tolerance and B. burgdorferi tolerance may be highly divergent.</p>
<p>
o Statistical significance is binary and p-values should not be used as the primary comparator of groups (e.g. once a p-value crosses the deigned threshold for significance, the magnitude of that p-value no longer provides biological information). For instance, in comparing GO-terms, the reason for using of high p-value cutoffs (&quot;None of these were up-regulated gene GO terms with p values &lt; 1011 for M. musculus.&quot;) to compare species is unclear. If the authors wish to compare effect sizes, comparing enrichment between terms that pass a cutoff would likely be the better choice. Similarly, comparing DEG expression by p-value cutoff and effect size is more meaningful than analyses based on exclusively on p-value: &quot;Of the top 100 DEGs for each species by ascending FDR p value.&quot; Description in later figures (e.g. Figure 4) is favored.</p>
<p>
o The ability to use of CD45 to normalize data is unclear. Authors should elaborate both on the use of the method and provide some data how the data change when they are normalized. For instance, do correlations between untreated Mus and Peromyscus gene expression improve? The authors seem to imply this should be a standard for interspecies comparison and so it would be helpful to either provide data to support that or, if applicable, use of the technique in literature should be referenced.</p>
<p>
o Regarding the ISG data-is a possible conclusion not that Peromyscus don't upregulate the antiviral response because it's already so high in untreated rodents? It seems untreated Peromyscus have ISG expression roughly equivalent to the LPS mice for some of the genes. This could be compared more clearly if genes were displayed as bar plots/box and whisker plots rather than in scatter plots. It is unclear why the linear regression is the key point here rather than normalized differences in expression.</p>
<p>
o Some sections of the discussion are under supported:</p>
<p>
 The claim that low inflammation contributes to increased lifespan is stated both in the introduction and discussion. Is there justification to support this? Do aged pathogen-free mice show more inflammation than aged Peromyscus?</p>
<p>
 The claim that reduced Peromyscus responsiveness could lead to increased susceptibility to infection is prominently proposed but not supported by any of the literature cited.</p>
<p>
 References to B. burgdorferi, which do not have LPS, in the discussion need to ensure that the reader understands this and the potential that responses could be very different.</p>

<p>Milovic, Duong, and Barbour investigate the inflammatory response of three species of small mammals (P. leucopus, M. musculus, and R. norvegicus) to endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection via genome-wide transcriptomics from blood samples. Understanding the inflammation response of P. leucopus is of importance as they are a reservoir for several pathogens. The study is a thorough, controlled, well researched analysis that will be valuable for designing and interpreting future studies. The authors discuss the limitations of the data and the potential directions. Clearly P. leucopus respond differently to the LPS exposure which is very interesting and opens the door for numerous other comparative studies.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the manuscript are thoughtful and mostly supported by the data, but there are a couple of points for clarification.</p>
<p>1. How were the number of animals for each experiment selected? Was a power analysis conducted?</p>
<p>2. The authors conducted a cursory evaluation of sex differences of P. leucopus and reported no difference in response except for Il6 and Il10 expression being higher in the males than the females in the exposed group. The data was not presented in the manuscript. Nor was sex considered for the other two species. A further discussion of the role that sex could play and future studies would be appreciated.</p>
<p>3. The ratio of Nos2 and Arg1 copies for LPS treated and control P. leucopus and M.musculus in Table 3 show that in P. leucopus there is not a significant difference but in M.musculus there is an increase in Nos2 copies with LPS treatment. The authors then used a targeted RNA-seq analysis to show that in P. leucopus the number of Arg1 reads after LPS treatment is significantly higher than the controls. These results are over oversimplified in the text as an inverse relationship for Nos2/Arg1 in the two species.</p>
