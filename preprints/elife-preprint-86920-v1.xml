<title>Summary</title>
<p>The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway controls embryonic development and tissue homeostasis after birth. This requires regulated solubilization of dual-lipidated, firmly plasma membrane-associated Shh precursors from producing cells. Although it is firmly established that the resistance-nodulation-division transporter Dispatched (Disp) drives this process, it is less clear how lipidated Shh solubilization from the plasma membrane is achieved. We previously showed that Disp enhances proteolytic Shh solubilization from its lipidated terminal peptide anchors. This process, called shedding, converts tightly membrane-associated hydrophobic Shh precursors into delipidated soluble proteins. We show here that Disp-mediated Shh shedding is modulated by a serum factor that we identify as high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In addition to serving as soluble sinks for free membrane cholesterol, HDLs also accept the cholesterol-modified Shh peptide from Disp. The cholesteroylated Shh peptide is required and sufficient for Disp-mediated transfer because mCherry linked to cholesteroylated peptides associates with HDL in a Disp-dependent manner, but an N-palmitoylated Shh variant that lacks C-cholesterol does not. Disp-mediated Shh transfer to HDL is finalized by proteolytic processing of the palmitoylated N-terminal membrane anchor. The resulting mono-lipidated Shh variant may help meet the demands for Hh activity regulation in different cell types and developing tissues.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hedgehog (Hh) ligands activate an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway that provides instructional cues during tissue morphogenesis, which, if misregulated, contributes to developmental disorders and cancer. Hhs are unique in that they require autocatalytic covalent cholesteroylation of the C-terminus <sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and N-terminal palmitoylation by a separate Hh acyltransferase (Hhat) activity <sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Both lipids firmly tether Hh to the plasma membrane of producing cells to effectively prevent unregulated ligand release <sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Signaling at distant target cells therefore requires the regulated solubilization of Hh from the membrane of ligand-producing cells, a process that is facilitated by vertebrate and invertebrate Dispatched (Disp) orthologs <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Disp contains 12 transmembrane helices and 2 extracellular domains and belongs to the resistance-nodulation-division family of transmembrane efflux pumps. Normally, such pumps maintain cellular homeostasis and remove toxic compounds. In addition, Disp contains a conserved multipass transmembrane domain known as the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) that regulates the homeostasis of free or esterified cellular cholesterol in other SSD proteins <sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. This molecular architecture is in line with Disp extraction of free cholesterol from the plasma membrane to remove it from the cell <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. In addition, given its established role in Hh/Shh release, Disp may also extract the C-terminal Shh sterol to solubilize Hh/Shh into the extracellular compartment. Both possibilities are currently intensely investigated.</p>
<p>Notably, Disp activity alone is insufficient to solubilize the vertebrate Hh family member Shh from the plasma membrane. A second required synergistic factor for maximum Shh signaling is the soluble extracellular glycoprotein Scube2 (Signal sequence, cubulin (CUB) domain, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like protein 2) <sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. One way to explain Disp/Scube2 synergy is by Disp-mediated extraction of dual-lipidated Shh from the plasma membrane to hand it over to Scube2, a mechanism that depends on the C-terminal cysteine-rich and CUB domains of Scube2 <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. <italic>In vitro</italic> support for this mechanism comes from Disp and Scube2 co-immunoprecipitation with Shh <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and from structural data <sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Other suggested carriers for Disp-extracted lipidated Hh/Shh include lipoproteins (LPPs) <sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, exosomes as carriers of internalized and re-secreted Hhs <sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>, and micellous Hh assemblies <sup><xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Another suggested Shh release mode is Disp-regulated proteolytic processing (called shedding) from the plasma membrane <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> by two major plasma-membrane-associated sheddases called A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) 10 and 17 <sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. The role of Scube2 in this model is to enhance shedding of both terminal lipidated Shh peptides in a CUB domain-dependent manner <sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, CUB function in regulated shedding of other substrates often involves substrate recognition and induced structural changes in the substrate to boost turnover <sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we systematically characterized the biochemical parameters of Disp-regulated Shh solubilization with all these models and parameters in mind. To this end, we used a unique bicistronic Hhat/Shh co-expression system to ensure that only dual-lipidated Shh as a substrate for Disp was produced and analyzed <sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We further avoided any protein tags to ensure undisturbed Shh modification, secretion, and interaction with Disp and other potential pathway components. Finally, we used unbiased biochemical methods to analyze Shh solubilization, size and lipidation status under different experimental conditions. First, we confirmed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting and reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC that Disp and Scube2 synergistically enhance Shh shedding into the cell culture medium <sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Notably, we also found that repeated careful washing of Disp- and Shh-expressing cells to remove all serum traces abolished Shh shedding, and that high serum amounts promoted the solubilization of a previously uncharacterized fully bioactive Shh variant that lacks its palmitoylated N-terminus but retains its cholesteroylated C-terminus. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses demonstrated co-elution of this novel C-cholesteroylated Shh variant with serum apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), the major protein component of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction in serum. Consistent with this observation, purified HDL restored Shh solubilization from Shh- and Disp-expressing washed cells. We also found that the most C-terminal cholesteroylated Shh peptide is sufficient for Disp-mediated protein transfer to HDL. In contrast, palmitoylated N-terminal Shh membrane anchors are not transferred by Disp, but undergo shedding to complete Shh transfer to HDL. Our updated Hh shedding model therefore unifies previously disparate models of Disp-, sheddase-, and LPP-mediated Shh solubilization into one comprehensive system. This comprehensive system is fully in line with published <italic>in vivo</italic> Disp functions <sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, <italic>in vivo</italic> Scube2 functions <sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, <italic>in vitro</italic> roles of the Scube2 CUB domain <sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, the Disp structure <sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, and required N-terminal – but not C-terminal – shedding during Hh solubilization <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Our model is also in line with the established importance of Hh C-cholesterol for Hh association into “large punctate” structures that are visible by light microscopy <sup><xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>, C-cholesterol-dependent Hh solubilization <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, and established <italic>in vivo</italic> roles of LPPs in Hh biofunction <sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. We suggest that the purpose of Disp-regulated generation of different post-translationally modified soluble Shh forms, as shown in this study, is to fine-tune cellular responses in different Shh-receiving tissues at different developmental time points.</p>

<title>Synergistic Disp and Scube2 function increases shedding of dual-lipidated Shh from the plasma membrane</title>
<p>To analyze Shh solubilization from the plasma membrane, we produced dual-lipidated, tightly plasma membrane-associated morphogens in Bosc23 control cells that express endogenous Disp <sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (called CRISPR non-targeting control (nt ctrl) cells in this study) and in Bosc23 cells made deficient in Disp function by CRISPR/Cas9 (Using previously characterized Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>; experimental outlines are described in Fig. S1). Shh biosynthesis in both cell lines starts with the covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the C-terminus of the Shh signaling domain <sup><xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>. This reaction is autocatalytic and strictly coupled to the generation of 19 kDa Shh signaling domains from a 45 kDa precursor. Subsequent N-palmitoylation of cholesteroylated Shh/Hh requires a separate enzymatic activity encoded by Hh acyltransferase (Hhat) <sup><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>. Because Bosc23 cells do not express endogenous Hhat <sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, we minimized the production of non-palmitoylated Shh by using bicistronic mRNA that encodes the Shh precursor together with Hhat. Unlike Shh expression in the absence of Hhat, coupled Shh/Hhat expression ensures near-quantitative Shh N-palmitoylation in transfected Bosc23 cells <sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting was then used to characterize dual-lipidated Shh extraction from the plasma membrane of both cell lines into serum-depleted media (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; Fig. S2 includes all transfection controls and loading controls). We confirmed that Scube2 enhances Shh solubilization from nt ctrl cells (arrowhead) and that Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells do not solubilize Shh <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A’</xref>). We also confirmed that the electrophoretic mobility of most Shh released from nt ctrl cells was increased over that of the corresponding dual-lipidated cellular material on the same blot <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> (asterisk). RP-HPLC of the solubilized material shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> demonstrated that the observed electrophoretic mobility increase was caused by proteolytic removal of both lipidated terminal peptides (called shedding throughout this manuscript, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A’’</xref>; see Fig. S2 for cellular dual lipidated or artificially produced monolipidated and unlipidated Shh standard proteins). Transgenic Disp expression in Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells restored Shh shedding and solubilization, confirming the specificity of the assay (Fig. S2E) <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Strikingly, the same phenotypic reversal was achieved by the co-expression of the cholesterol pump Patched (Ptc) <sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> that depletes the plasma membrane of cholesterol <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. This suggests an indirect “second messenger” role of plasma membrane cholesterol not only in the regulation of Smoothened downstream of Ptc <sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>, but also in the regulation of Shh shedding downstream of Disp (Fig. S2E) <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Note that alternative solubilized Shh variants (represented by the “upper” bands) were also present in the media. These variants, however, were always produced independent of Disp and Scube2 function. In contrast, Scube2 and Disp synergistically and specifically increased Shh shedding from the cell surface <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We also observed that solubilization of artificially produced, monolipidated Shh variants (<sup>C25S</sup>Shh that lacks N-palmitate, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, B’</xref>, and ShhN that lacks C-cholesterol, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, C’</xref>, Fig. S2) was much less controlled, consistent with the observations of others <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Release of both monolipidated Shh variants remained linked to shedding of the respective lipidated membrane termini, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shifts of soluble proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B,C</xref>, arrowheads) and their delipidation during solubilization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B’’,C’’</xref>). Non-lipidated <sup>C25S</sup>ShhN was always solubilized in a Disp- and Scube2-independent manner, as expected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-D’’</xref>). These results suggest that cell-surface shedding represents a “ground-state” from which dual-lipidated Shh is protected, but only until Disp and Scube2 render it prone to shedding. Our results also explain the complete conservation of dual N- and C-terminal Hh lipidation during biosynthesis by the prevention of unregulated protein release from producing cells. This also demonstrates the importance of coupled Shh/Hhat expression to reliably characterize Disp- and Scube2-regulated Shh solubilization <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title>Shh solubilization depends on cleavage-activated Disp and the presence of serum</title>
<p>It was recently shown that the prohormone convertase furin cleaves Disp at a conserved processing site to activate the protein <sup><xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>. On the basis of this activation mode, we hypothesized that furin inhibition should specifically impair Disp-regulated Shh shedding. To test this hypothesis, we added 50 μM peptidyl chloromethylketone (CMK, a competitive inhibitor of furin) to our solubilization assays. Indeed, CMK strongly reduced Shh shedding from the cell surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>, Fig. S3A). During these assays, we also noted that repeated careful washing of cells to quantitively remove all serum traces strongly impaired Disp- and Scube2-mediated Shh solubilization into serum-free media (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Fig. S3B). We derive two important conclusions from this latter observation. The first is that the minimal requirements of Na<sup>+</sup>-driven, Disp-mediated Shh extraction and hand-over to Scube2 <sup><xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> are insufficient to explain Shh release. The second is that Shh self-assembly by the law of mass action <sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> is also not supported, because this process should solubilize Shh regardless of the presence or absence of serum. In contrast, one function of Disp is to extract and transfer plasma membrane cholesterol to a soluble sink to transport it away from the cell <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. In vertebrates, HDLs represent soluble sinks for “free” peripheral cholesterol <sup><xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>, and HDLs as well as the pharmacological cholesterol chelator methyl--cyclodextrin (m cd) were previously shown to increase Shh shedding <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that the permissive factor lacking from our shedding assay was most likely a soluble cholesterol acceptor, such as HDL or a related serum LPP.</p>

<title>Increased serum concentrations shift shedding of both Shh termini to selective N-terminal shedding</title>
<p>To characterize serum-enhanced shedding in more detail, dual-lipidated Shh was expressed in nt ctrl cells and Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells and solubilized into serum-depleted Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) or into DMEM supplemented with 0.05%, 2%, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A-D</xref>; Fig. S3 shows transfection and loading controls). We observed that Scube2 enhances Shh shedding from Disp-expressing cells into serum-depleted media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, arrowhead), but does not enhance Shh shedding from Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells. RP-HPLC of the solubilized material confirmed that the observed increase in electrophoretic mobility was caused by the proteolytic removal of both terminal lipidated peptides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A’</xref>). Increased serum concentrations during Shh solubilization (0.05% FCS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), 5% FCS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), and 10% FCS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>)) did not appear to affect Disp- and Scube2-specific Shh shedding much (arrowheads). To our surprise, however, RP-HPLC of the solubilized materials shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref> revealed a gradual shift from dual Shh shedding (labeled [1] in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A’-D’</xref>) toward the solubilization of variant proteins with their C-terminal cholesteroylated peptide still intact (labeled [2] in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B’-D’</xref>, Fig. S4A-E). We note that dual-lipidated Shh was also present in serum-containing media (indicated by an asterisk in Fig. S4A-E). However, we found that relative amounts of this fraction increased strongly in the absence of Scube2 (Fig. S4F; here, cells required incubation for 24 h to compensate for low Shh solubilization) and in the absence of Disp<sup>-/-</sup> (Fig. S4G), while Scube2 expression in Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells increased relative amounts of delipidated soluble Shh (Fig. S4H). Disp- and Scube2-independent solubilization of dual-lipidated Shh, as observed here (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), indicates that it is probably an overexpression artefact or caused by soluble plasma membrane remnants of apototic cells.</p>

<p>So far, our data supported that Scube2 increases N-terminal and C-terminal Shh shedding from Disp-expressing cells and that serum enhances this process, likely by providing a sink for membrane cholesterol transferred by Disp <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (Fig. S4I). Moreover, high serum amounts seem to promote a second Disp solubilization mode in which Shh shedding is restricted to the palmitoylated N-peptide while the C-terminus remains intact. This latter finding raised the interesting possibility that serum factors may accept or protect the cholesteroylated Shh C-terminus. Note that a filtrate of blood serum through the capillary walls, called interstital fluid, represents the microenvironment of tissues and cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, also of those that express and solubilize Shh during development <sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Interstitial fluid is rich in proteins and lipoprotein particles of small mass from the serum <sup><xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, we suggest that Shh expression in serum presence resembles conditions in Shh expressing tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>, and may therefore be physiologically relevant.</p>

According to these published observations, the selectively N-terminally shed Shh variant described here should not be very active. To test this possibility, we used the multipotent fibroblastic C3H10T1/2 cell line as a reporter. We first verified multipotency of our C3H10T1/2 reporter cell line to differentiate into osteoblasts <sup><xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>, chondrocytes <sup><xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> or adipocytes <sup><xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> (Fig. S5A). To this end, C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured for various time periods in the presence of adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic supplements, and their responsiveness confirmed based on phenotype and the expression of cell surface markers. We then incubated C3H10T1/2 cells with R&amp;D 8908-SH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). R&amp;D 8908-SH is commercially available, dual-lipidated Shh obtained by detergent-extraction from transfected cells and shares 91% sequence identity and both lipids with Indian hedgehog, an established osteogenic factor <sup><xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. R&amp;D 8908-SH induced alkaline phosphatase (Alp) expression and C3H10T1/2 differentiation into osteoblasts in a concentration-dependent manner <sup><xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>. We also incubated C3H10T1/2 cells with Shh expressed in the presence of serum and physiological release regulators Scube2 <sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and Disp <sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, inset). Surprisingly, we found that the activity of solubilized Shh was increased over similar amounts of R&amp;D 8908-SH (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, inset), and <sup>C25A</sup>Shh expressed under the same conditions was equally active. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis (qPCR) of Ptc1, Ptc2 and Gli1 expression in Shh-treated C3H10T1/2 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, Fig. S5B) confirmed this finding: After protein normalization (using 4ng R&amp;D 8908-SH and 100μl Shh or <sup>C25S</sup>Shh), qPCR confirmed similar mRNA expression increases of Ptc1 and Gli1 under direct Shh, <sup>C25S</sup>Shh or R&amp;D 8908-SH control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Ptc is known to be upregulated by Shh <sup><xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>, and Gli1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that operates downstream of Ptc (mainly Ptc1 in vertebrates, a less characterized Ptc2 homolog is also expressed) and is also transcribed in a Shh-dependent manner <sup><xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. Apparent differences between determined Ptc2 levels, as observed in this assay, can be explained by the very low Ptc2 expression levels in C3H10T1/2 cells that give rise to high margins of error (Ptc2 Cq∼33 for Shh-treated cells, Ptc2 Cq∼31 for <sup>C25A</sup>Shh-treated cells, Ptc2 Cq∼37 and ∼34 for R&amp;D 8908-SH-treated cells). Key regulators for adipogenesis, osteogenesis, chondrogenesis and proliferation in Shh and <sup>C25S</sup>Shh-induced C3H10T1/2 cells were also similar (Fig. S5B,C). Taken together, our results demonstrate that N-palmitate is not essential for Shh signaling if proteins were produced and released in the presence of serum.</p>

<title>Soluble Shh/Hh and ApoA1-containing LPPs have similar sizes</title>
<p>A decade ago, it had already been shown that sterol-modified Hh/Shh is released in LPP-associated bioactive form – as wellas in desteroylated, non-associated form – in flies and mammals <sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. This suggested that serum LPPs in our assays may have promoted dual Shh shedding <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) but possibly also promoted C-cholesteroylated Shh assembly into soluble complexes. We used size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to test this hypothesis. SEC detects soluble Shh monomers (20 kDa) and covers the entire molecular weight range up to a MW cutoff of about 1 mDa. The molecular weight span of serum HDL ranges from 1.75ξ10<sup>5</sup> Da to 3.6ξ10<sup>5</sup> Da, corresponding to particle sizes of 5-11 nm. This small size range makes HDLs abundant constituents of interstitial fluid and good candidates for Shh solubilization from cells and tissues. Larger complexes in mammalian serum include low-density lipoproteins (LDLs, MW 2.75ξ10<sup>6</sup> Da) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs, MW 10-80ξ10<sup>6</sup> Da) that both elute in the void column volume. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, Shh in DMEM + 10% FCS elutes in fractions that cover the entire molecular weight range (black line). One prominent Shh peak is detected around 20 kDa – most likely representing the fully delipidated Shh fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, labeled [1]) – and a second peak is detected between 300 kDa and 600 kDa. Reprobing the same (stripped) blot with antibodies directed against ApoA1 (the major protein component of HDL) revealed an elution profile that overlapped with that of Shh (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, orange line). Of note, most Shh co-eluted with the largest HDL particles, suggesting that maturation of small early (discoidal) HDL into larger (spherical) HDL upon incorporation of cholesterol may be accompanied by gradual Shh transfer to the same particles. In contrast, Scube2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, blue line) co-eluted with smaller Shh multimers <sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>. In order to determine which size fraction contained the most biologically active Shh, we analyzed C3H10T1/2 osteoblast precursor cell differentiation by using aliquots of eluted fractions from the same SEC run. Shh-induced C3H10T1/2 cells in a size-dependent activity distribution: Large Shh assemblies were strongly bioactive, smaller assemblies were also strongly bioactive, but monomeric Shh was only moderately active (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, green dashed line). We also found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh expressed in S2 cells and solubilized into serum-containing medium showed a similar size distribution (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, black line) and that Hh assemblies co-eluted with serum ApoA1 as well (orange line). This suggests that the mechanism of serum-enhanced Hh assembly during solubilization is conserved. The possibility of Hh assembly as a consequence of heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan interactions <sup><xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> was excluded because site-directed mutagenesis of the HS binding Cardin-Weintraub motif did not change Hh<sup>HS</sup> size distribution in our assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, black dotted line). From these observations, we conclude that large Shh/Hh assemblies form by HDL association <italic>in vitro</italic>, which is in line with a previous study showing that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh copurifies with LPP and co-localizes with LPP in the developing wing epithelium <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. The same study showed that reduced LPP levels in larvae impair Hh release and lead to Hh accumulation at the site of production, similar to the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>.</p>

<title>Disp function depends on HDL</title>
<p>To test whether soluble HDL is sufficient to increase Disp-mediated Shh solubilization, we next induced this process directly. To this end, we expressed Shh in nt ctrl cells and Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells in the presence or absence of Scube2, washed the cells 36 h post transfection, and added serum-free DMEM or DMEM supplemented with 40 μg/mL purified human HDL <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. We first confirmed that lack of serum factors strongly reduced Shh solubilization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, labeled [1], Fig. S6A). RP-HPLC of the small amounts of released Shh confirmed removal of both lipidated Shh peptide anchors during solubilization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A’</xref>, Fig. S6A’), and SEC confirmed that proteins were monomeric (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A’’</xref>). In contrast, Shh solubilization from nt ctrl cells into DMEM supplemented with 40 μg/mL HDL was strongly increased (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,C</xref>, Fig. S6B). As previously observed for Shh expression in the presence of serum, RP-HPLC of HDL-solubilized Shh [2] revealed that its C-terminal cholesteroylated peptides were still intact (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B’</xref>, Fig. S6B’), and that the proteins were strongly bioactive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B’’</xref>). Solubilized dual-lipidated Shh was also found, but its solubilization was independent of Scube2 and Disp function (Fig. S6B’’,B’’’), indicating unspecific release as observed before (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). From the observed size shift and overlap with the ApoA1 elution profile in SEC – note that the observed Shh molecular weight range almost exactly matches that of HDL – we suggest that monolipidated truncated Shh associates with HDL in a Disp-regulated manner. This possibility is supported by the previous observation that Hh levels in the hemolymph of Disp-deficient fly larvae were strongly decreased <sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. We also tested whether HDL constitutes the only possible Shh acceptor, or whether LDL can also carry monolipidated morphogens.

<title>The C-terminal cholesteroylated Shh peptide is required and sufficient for Disp-mediated export and association with HDL</title>
<p>We asked next whether both terminal lipids are required for Disp-mediated Shh export to HDL, or whether the C-cholesteroylated peptide is sufficient for the transfer. The latter possibility was suggested by N-palmitoylated peptide loss during solubilization from Disp-expressing cells in the presence of serum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) and by Disp-independent ShhN solubilization into serum-depleted medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) <sup><xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>. We expressed palmitoylated/non-cholesteroylated ShhN and non-palmitoylated/cholesteroylated <sup>C25S</sup>Shh and confirmed that palmitoylated ShhN solubilization from the plasma membrane was independent of Disp and HDL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, [1] denotes material solubilized into serum-free DMEM, [2] denotes material solubilized by HDL; also see Fig. S7A,B). SEC detected only monomeric ShhN, regardless of the absence or presence of HDL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A’,A’’</xref>). These findings suggest that the N-terminal Shh palmitate is not a good substrate for Disp-mediated transfer to HDL. In contrast, only small amounts of monomeric <sup>C25S</sup>Shh were solubilized into serum-free media (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B,B’</xref>, labeled [3]), and HDL strongly increased soluble <sup>C25S</sup>Shh and its assembly into sizes similar to those of HDL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B’’</xref>, labeled [4]; also see Fig. S7C,D). Supporting the importance of Shh cholesteroylation for its transfer to HDL, soluble <sup>C25S</sup>Shh remained lipidated (Fig. S7E). Together, our findings suggest that the C-terminal cholesterol moiety is required for Disp-mediated Shh transfer and HDL association. However, we also noted that a fraction of monolipidated <sup>C25S</sup>Shh solubilized in a Disp independent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, asterisks; Fig. S7F, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>, the green dotted line indicates the distribution of <sup>C25S</sup>Shh sizes if released from Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells). We explain this finding by unspecific <sup>C25S</sup>Shh release as a consequence of protein overexpression in the presence of HDL and support this claim by a report showing that half-times for spontaneous cholesterol desorption from membranes of several hours are dramatically decreased if large proteins – such as Shh – are attached to a single anchor <sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Once desorped, lipidated proteins either reintegrate into the plasma membrane or associate with lipophilic soluble competotors, as shown in Fig. S7G. This demonstrates that another important role of fully conserved dual N- and C-terminal Hh lipidation is to prevent non-enzymatic morphogen desorption from the plasma membrane.</p>

<p>Is the cholesteroylated peptide sufficient for Disp-mediated transfer to HDL, or does the globular Shh ectodomain participate in the transfer <sup><xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>? To answer this question, we replaced most of the <sup>C25S</sup>Shh ectodomain with mCherry N-terminally flanked by the Shh secretion signal and C-terminally flanked by the Shh cholesterol transferase/autoprocessing domain. This strategy resulted in the secretion of cholesteroylated mCherry (Fig. S7H) to the cell surface and its association with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. As observed previously for Shh (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), mCherry remained monomeric or formed small assemblies if released into serum-depleted media (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, dashed line), and HDL shifted mCherry elution into fractions that also contained ApoA1 (solid line). This result supports that HDL serves as a soluble acceptor for C-terminally cholesteroylated peptides. SEC also revealed that loss of Disp function decreased the relative amounts of HDL-associated material (solid line) and increased the relative amounts of solubilized monomeric protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, dotted line). Therefore, cholesteroylated peptides represent the critical determinant for Disp-mediated Shh transport to HDL. In contrast, Shh ectodomain interactions with Disp are not essential for the transfer. We supported physical <sup>C25S</sup>Shh interactions with HDL by the addition of EtOH or Triton X-100, both of which disassembled soluble high-molecular weight aggregates into monomers or small assemblies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p>

<title>Dual Shh lipidation and Disp-regulated Shh solubilization are interdependent</title>
<p>It is firmly established that Hh solubilization and signaling depend on Disp co-expression in source cells. However, the additional involvement of many cell surface and soluble co-factors has complicated efforts to unravel the exact nature of Disp-mediated Hh solubilization. To address this problem, we transfected Disp-deficient and Disp-expressing source cells <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> with Shh and systematically modified Shh solubilization by a number of extracellular co-factors. Then, cell-surface-associated Shh upstream of Disp function and soluble Shh downstream of Disp function were analyzed together with their co-factors by using unbiased biochemical tools. The first important result of this approach is that both Shh lipids act together to prevent uncontrolled Shh solubilization from producing cells. In contrast, artificially produced <sup>C25S</sup>Shh that lacks N-palmitate and ShhN that lacks C-cholesterol are constitutively solubilized – either by non-enzymatic desorption or by unregulated shedding (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). The second important result is that Disp and Scube2 specifically and synergistically increase shedding of the dual-lipidated precursor. These two observations suggest that cell-surface shedding constitutes a “ground state” from which dual-lipidated Shh is protected by tight plasma membrane association of both lipids – but only until Disp and Scube2 render Shh prone to proteolytic processing of the terminal peptides. This concept is important for the reinterpretation of the observation that dual lipidation is essential for unperturbed Hh biofunction <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. The current interpretation of these observations is that both Hh lipids contribute directly to Ptc receptor signaling for maximal signaling. Our results support an alternative mechanism acting upstream of Ptc: The selective artificial prevention of N- or C-terminal lipidation during Hh/Shh biosynthesis <italic>in vivo</italic> (achieved by the deletion of the N-terminal palmitate acceptor cysteine or of Hhat, or by prevented C-cholesteroylation <sup><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>) may have rendered spatiotemporally controlled Hh/Shh solubilization into unregulated “leakage” of monolipidated precursors from producing cells and tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The “non-availability” of dual-lipidated Shh for Disp-controlled spatio-temporal signaling may then have caused the observed Hh loss-of-function phenotypes <sup><xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Therefore, our release model does not contradict the established essential role of unimpaired dual Shh lipidation during biosynthesis for Hh activity regulation <italic>in vivo</italic>, but provides an alternative explanation for it. Support for our model of Disp- and Scube2-regulated Hh shedding and release on HDL include the following: Disp is required only in Hh-producing cells and not in receiving cells <sup><xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>; Hh signaling defects in Disp-deficient model organisms are caused by a defect in the deployment of cell-surface associated Shh <sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>; and full Disp activity requires Scube2 <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Further support comes from our finding that de-palmitoylated Shh in serum-containing media is fully bioactive (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and from the <italic>in vivo</italic> observation that de-palmitoylated Hh variants impair development to variable degrees but can also induce increased ectopic signaling <sup><xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>.</p>

An upward lifted sterol (green stick representation) at the start point of the hydrophobic track may represent an intermediate state of sterol extraction from the membrane, and a lipidic group modeled as the amphiphilic detergent lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (violet stick structure) may represent the end point of the transfer <sup><xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> prior to hand-over to HDL. <bold>C)</bold> We suggest two sequences of Shh transfer events. In the first event [1], plasma membrane sterol is transferred through the Disp hydrophobic surface channel to HDL acceptors. This process resembles established reverse cholesterol transport. In the second event, if present, C-terminal cholesterol moieties of Shh can also be transferred [2]. This partial Shh extraction exposes the N-terminal cleavage site [3] and makes it prone to proteolytic processing (as is the case for ShhN in A). N-terminal Shh shedding may then release the protein from the plasma membrane [4] to complete the transfer [5]. In addition to, or competing with this process, cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane (representing the first event, [1]) may trigger shedding of both terminal Shh peptides and the solubilization of monomeric proteins in an indirect manner [6].

<title>Disp mediates Shh solubilization by two functionally related transfer modes</title>
<p>The second important result of our study is that the absence of all serum traces reduces or even abolishes Disp/Scube2-mediated Shh solubilization. This reveals that Disp and Scube2 are insufficient to solubilize dual-lipidated Shh and that a previously overlooked serum factor – that we identified as HDL – is also required. We showed previously that Disp knockout in cells impairs <sup>3H</sup>cholesterol efflux and increases cholesterol levels in membranes, and that this in turn inhibits Shh shedding in an indirect manner <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. We also suggested that HDL promotes shedding by serving as a soluble sink for Disp-exported cholesterol <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Consistent with this possibility, Disp contains a sterol-sensing domain and an extended hydrophobic surface channel that may function as a “slide” for lipophiles. This slide may be powered by a transmembrane Na<sup>+</sup> flux <sup><xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>, similar to the H<sup>+</sup> flux that drives related prokaryotic resistance-nodulation-division transporter export of small molecules <sup><xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We describe here that Disp can additionally transfer cholesteroylated Shh to soluble HDL acceptors in a direct manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Both Disp functions confirm and support the established concept that the fly LPP lipophorin carries cholesteroylated Hh <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, yet that highly bioactive proteins that do not associate with LPPs, that lack the sterol, and that are secreted as dimers and monomers also exist <sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. We extend this established concept further by showing that the most C-terminal cholesteroylated Shh peptide is sufficient for direct Disp-mediated protein export to HDL because mCherry linked to this peptide also transfers to HDL in a Disp-dependent manner. This finding is also in line with a previous report demonstrating that C-cholesterol is required and sufficient for Disp-mediated protein export <sup><xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Because of their small size of 5-10 nm, HDLs are not only abundant in the circulation, but are also present in interstitial fluids, both in the adult and throughout development <sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In contrast, larger LPPs such as LDLs and VLDLs are restricted in their distribution by vascular impermeability <sup><xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>. The ratio of HDL to LDL in interstitial fluid has been estimated to average 50:1 <sup><xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>. These properties make HDL well-suited not only for reverse cholesterol transport but also for the transport of cholesteroylated Hh/Shh cargo to its receptor Ptc – that has also been shown to act as a LPP receptor <sup><xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup>, just like Disp <sup><xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. This would lead to the interesting concept that “Hh-free” LPP and “Hh-loaded” LPPs may compete for Ptc receptor binding, the former by promoting Ptc-mediated cholesterol export to suppress signaling and the latter by terminating cholesterol efflux to trigger Hh signaling <sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. Indeed, this fascinating mechanism of Ptc activity regulation has already been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>N-terminal shedding during Disp-mediated Hh export is also required <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic>-derived concept of direct cholesteroylated Hh hand-over from Disp to LPPs and coupled N-terminal peptide shedding is supported by the <italic>in vivo</italic> finding that site-directed mutagenesis of the sheddase target site fully abolishes mutant Hh biofunction in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing and eye (see Fig. S8 for a detailed description of these previously published experiments <sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>). More importantly, the same mutated proteins suppress endogenous Hh biofunction in a dominant-negative manner <sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. We can now explain both observations by mutated Hh transgenes having their C-terminal peptides readily associated with the extended Disp “slide” for lipophiles, but being unable to complete the transfer due to blocked N-terminal shedding and continued plasma membrane association of the Hh N-terminus (preventing step [3] and [4] to freeze [2] in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). As a consequence, the resulting Disp bottleneck would also slow down endogenous Hh release, explaining the observed dominant-negative developmental defects <sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> (Fig. S8C,D). This sequence of events is supported by reversed dominant-negative defects of the mutant protein upon additional removal of the N-terminal palmitate membrane anchor <sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. The same site-directed mutagenesis approach on the Hh C-terminus, however, affects Hh biofunction only mildly and does not suppress endogenous Hh biofunction <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that most Hh solubilization <italic>in vivo</italic> does not require C-terminal Hh shedding, but requires direct cholesteroylated Hh hand-over from Disp to LPPs. During this process, only the palmitoylated N-terminus is shed to complete the transfer (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, Fig. S8). Our finding that cholesteroylated C-terminal peptides are sufficient for Disp-mediated transfer to HDL is also consistent with the <italic>in vivo</italic> observation that transgenes with 27 kDa green fluorescent protein (GFP) tags inserted between the 19 kDa Hh signaling domain and its C-terminal cholesteroylated peptide are bioactive in flies <sup><xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> and mice <sup><xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>. We also note that Disp specificity of C-cholesteroylated Hh and Hh-GFP release <italic>in vivo</italic> can be elegantly explained by Hh being the only known metazoan protein with a covalently linked cholesterol moiety. Finally, our finding that palmitoylated Shh N-termini are not extracted and relayed by Disp (but instead undergo shedding) is supported by the <italic>in vivo</italic> observation that transgenic expression of ShhN – the variant protein that is N-palmitoylated but lacks C-cholesterol – rescues many early embryonic lethal defects in Disp null mutant mice <sup><xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>.</p>

Cells were grown for 2 days at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM containing 10% FCS and penicillin-streptomycin (100 µg/mL). Where indicated, 50 μM peptidyl-CMK (Millipore 344930), an inhibitor of furin activity in DMSO, or DMSO alone was added to the media. Serum-containing media were aspirated and serum-free DMEM added for 6 h, harvested, and centrifuged at 300<italic>g</italic> for 10 min to remove debris. Supernatants were incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 13,000<italic>g</italic> for 20 min to precipitate the proteins. Proteins solubilized into serum-containing media were pulled down using heparin-sepharose beads (Sigma). Cell lysates and corresponding supernatants were analyzed on the same reducing SDS polyacrylamide gel and detected by Western blot analysis by using goat-α-Shh antibodies (R&amp;D Systems, C9C5), rabbit-α-GAPDH antibodies (Cell Signaling, GAPDH 14C10, #2118), or anti- - actin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, A3854) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Flag-tagged Scube was detected by using polyclonal α-FLAG antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). GAPDH, -actin (for cell lysates) or Ponceau S (for media) served as a loading control. Note that the amounts of immunoblotted soluble and cellular Shh do not correlate inversely. This is because medium lanes represent all TCA-precipitated proteins or all proteins captured by heparin-pulldown in medium, while cells were directly lysed in SDS-buffer and only a small fraction (about 5%) were applied to the gel. As a consequence, a 100% increase in Shh solubilization will correlate to only 5% reduction in the amount of cell-surface associated Shh, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. Shh release was quantified by ImageJ and calculated as the ratio of total or processed (truncated) soluble Shh relative to the cellular Shh material.

Two days after transfection, cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) on ice and ultracentrifuged, and the soluble whole-cell extract was acetone precipitated. Protein precipitates were resuspended in 35 μL of (1,1,1,3,3,3) hexafluoro-2-propanol and solubilized with 70 μL of 70% formic acid, followed by sonication. RP-HPLC was performed on a C4-300 column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and an Äkta Basic P900 Protein Purifier. To elute the samples, we used a 0%-70% acetonitrile/water gradient with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature for 30 min. Eluted samples were vacuum dried, resolubilized in reducing sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins expressed into the media were analyzed in the same way. Signals were quantified with ImageJ and normalized to the highest protein amount detected in each run. Where indicated, Disp<sup>-/-</sup> cells were incubated for 24 h instead of the standard 6 h for protein expression before media harvest and TCA precipitation to compensate for the very low Shh release rate from these cells.</p>

<title>Bioanalytical and statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism. Applied statistical tests, post hoc tests, and number of independently performed experiments are stated in the figure legends. A p-value of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. *: p&lt;0.05, **: p&lt;0.01, ***: p&lt;0.001, and ****: p&lt;0.0001 in all assays. Error bars represent the standard deviations of the means. Standard deviations as shown for Shh protein expression and release from nt ctrl cells on Western blots represent their variations from the average value (set to 100%) detected on the same blot.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents a model in which combined action of the transporter-like protein DISP and the sheddases ADAM10/17 promote shedding of a mono-cholesteroylated Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) species following cleavage of palmitate from the dually lipidated precursor ligand. The authors propose that this leads to transfer of the cholesterol-modified SHH to HDL for solubilization. The minimal requirement for SHH release by this mechanism is proposed to be the covalently linked cholesterol modification because DISP could promote transfer of a cholesteroylated mCherry reporter protein to serum HDL. The authors used an in vitro system to demonstrate dependency on DISP/SCUBE2 for release of the cholesterol modified ligand. These results confirm previously published results from other groups (PMC3387659 and PMC3682496). In vivo support for these activities is provided by data from previously published studies from this group. It is unclear whether new in vivo experiments were conducted for this study.</p>
<p>A strength of the work is the use of a bicistronic SHH-Hhat system to consistently generate dually-lipidated ligands to determine the quantity and lipidation status of SHH released into cell culture media.</p>
<p>A critical shortcoming of the study is that the experiments showing SHH secretion/export by western blot of media fractions do not include a SHH(-) control condition. This is an essential control because SHH media blots can be dirty. Without demonstration that the bands being analyzed are specific for SHH(+) conditions, these experiments cannot be appropriately evaluated. Further, it appears that SHH is transiently transfected/expressed for each experimental condition. A stably expressing SHH/HHAT cell line would reduce condition to condition and experiment to experiment variability. Unusual normalization strategies are used for many experiments, and quantification/statistical analyses are missing for several experiments. Due to these shortcomings, the data do not justify the conclusions. The significance of the data provided is overstated because many of the presented experiments confirm/support previously published work. The study provides a modest advance in the understanding of the complex issue of SHH membrane extraction.</p>

<p>Ehring et al. analyze contributions of Dispatched, Scube2, serum lipoproteins and Sonic Hedgehog lipid modifications to the generation of different Shh release forms. Hedgehog proteins are anchored in cellular membranes by N-terminal palmitate and C-terminal cholesterol modifications, yet spread through tissues and are released into the circulation. How Hedgehog proteins can be released, and in which form, remains unclear. The authors systematically dissect contributions of several previously identified factors, and present evidence that Disp, Scube2 and lipoproteins concertedly act to release a novel Shh variant that is cholesterol-modified but not palmitoylated. The systematic analysis of key factors that control Shh release is a commendable effort and helps to reconcile apparently disparate models. However, the results concerning the roles of lipoproteins and Shh lipid modifications are largely confirmatory of previous results, and molecular identity/physiological relevance of the newly identified Shh variant remain unclear.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that an important result of the study is the identification of HDL as a previously overlooked serum factor for secretion of lipid-linked Shh (p15, l24-25). This statement should be removed. A detailed analysis of Shh release on human lipoproteins was reported previously, including contributions of the major lipoprotein classes, in cells that endogenously express Shh, in human plasma and for Shh variants lacking palmitate and/or cholesterol modifications (PMID 23554573). The involvement of Disp is also not unexpected: the importance of Dips for release of cholesterol-modified Shh is well established, as is the essential function of Drosophila Disp for formation of lipoprotein-associated hemolymph Hh. A similar argument can be made for the sufficiency of sterol modification for lipoprotein association. The authors point out that GFP insertion at the C-terminus of the N-terminal Shh domain does not abrogate function. Perhaps more relevant, an mCherry-sterol that was generated using a similar strategy as in the present study associates with Drosophila lipoproteins (PMID 20685986).</p>
<p>A novel and surprising finding of the present study is the differential removal of Shh N- or C-terminal lipid anchors depending on the presence of HDL and/or Disp. In particular, the identification of a non-palmitoylated but cholesterol-modified Shh variant that associates with lipoproteins is potentially important. However, the significance of this result could be substantially improved in two ways: 1) The molecular properties of the processed Shh variants are unclear - incorporation of palmitate/cholesterol and removal of peptides were not directly demonstrated. This is particularly relevant for the N-terminus, as the signaling activity of non-palmitoylated Hedgehog proteins is controversial. A decrease in hydrophobicity is no proof for cleavage of palmitate, this could also be due to addition of a shorter acyl group. 2) All experiments rely on over-expression of Shh in a single cell line. The authors point out that co-overexpression of Hhat is important to ensure Shh palmitoylation, but the same argument could be made for any other protein that acts in Shh release, such as Disp or a plasma membrane sheddase. The authors detect Shh variants that are released independently of Disp and Scube2 in secretion assays, which however are excluded from interpretation as experimental artifacts. Thus, it would be important to demonstrate key findings in cells that secrete Shh endogenously.</p>
<p>The co-fractionation of Shh and ApoA1 in serum-containing media is not convincing (Fig. 4C), as the two proteins peak at different molecular weights. To support their conclusion, the authors could use an orthogonal approach, optimally a demonstration of physical interaction, or at least fractionation by a different parameter (density). On a technical note, all chromatography results are presented as stylized graphs. Please include individual data points.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>1. “It is unclear whether new in vivo experiments were conducted for this study”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All in vivo experiments shown were conducted independently by new researchers in the lab, using the original fly stocks. This will be more clearly stated in the revised supplement. The aim of repeating the experiments was to directly compare the consequences of impaired N- and C-terminal shedding side-by-side in two Hh-dependent developmental systems.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. “A critical shortcoming of the study is that experiments showing Shh secretion/export do not include a Shh(-) control condition. Without demonstration that the bands analyzed are specific for Shh(+) conditions, these experiments cannot be appropriately evaluated”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>C9C5 antibody reactivity and specificity is shown below, and this control will be added to the revised manuscript. We established the C9C5 immunoblotting protocol – and generated the blot shown in Author Response Image 1 - before any of the experiments in the manuscript were started. The immunoblot clearly shows Shh specificity similar to that of R&amp;D AF464 anti-Shh antibodies that were previously used in the lab. The immunoblot also shows that both antibodies detect the same Shh signals in media, that C9C5 is more sensitive, and that AF464 and C9C5 detect 5E1-IP’d dual-lipidated and monolipidated soluble Shh equally well. Also note that, in our hands, C9C5 is highly specific: this antibody detects N-truncated C25S;Δ26-35Shh of increased electrophoretic mobility, but does not cause unspecific signals above or below, even if the blot is strongly overexposed (as shown here). Specific Shh detection by C9C5 is also discussed in our response to editor’s comments below.</p>

<p>Cells were transfected with constructs encoding full-length C25SShh or truncated C25S;Δ26-35Shh, and proteins in serum-containing media were 5E1 immunoprecipitated or concentrated by heparin-sepharose pulldown. Dual-lipidated R&amp;D 8908-SH was dissolved in the same medium and subjected to the same 5E1 immunoprecipitation or heparin pulldown. The blot was incubated with antibody AF464 and (after stripping) with antibody C9C5. Immunoblot analysis revealed high specificity of both antibodies and also revealed poor interactions of dual-lipidated 8908-SH with highly charged heparin.</p>

<p>1. “A stably expressing Shh/Hhat cell line would reduce condition to condition and experiment to experiment variability”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree with this reviewer and therefore aimed to establish stable Hhat expressing cell lines several years ago. However, stable Hhat expression eliminated transfected cells after several passages, or cells gradually ceased to express Hhat, preventing us to establish a stable line despite several attempts and tried strategies. For this reason, we established transient co-expression of Shh/Hhat from the same mRNA to at least eliminate variability between relative Shh/Hhat expression levels and to assure complete Shh palmitoylation in our assays.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. “Unusual normalization strategies are used for many experiments, and quantification/statistical analyses are missing for several experiments”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment refers to data shown in Fig. 3 (here, no quantification of Scube2 function in Disp-/- cells had been conducted) and to qPCR data shown in Fig. 4 (here, Shh and C25AShh were compared only indirectly via dual-lipidated R&amp;D 8908-SH, but not directly in a side-by-side experiment, and Shh variants with an N-terminal alanine or a serine were directly compared). We agree with the reviewer and therefore currently repeat qPCR assays and quantify blots to eliminate these technical shortcomings from the final manuscript.</p>

<p>1. “The study provides a modest advance in the understanding of the complex issue of Shh membrane extraction”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our investigation identified unexpected links between Disp as a furin-activated Hh exporter, sheddase-mediated Shh release, Scube2-mediated Shh release and lipoprotein-mediated Hh transport – established modes indeed but with no previously established direct connections – that increase their relevance. We also identified a previously unknown N-processed Shh variant attached to lipoproteins and show that Disp/Scube2 function absolutely requires lipoproteins. Therefore, although we do agree that our findings are confirmatory for the above modes, they also provide new mechanistic insight and challenge the currently dominating model of Disp-mediated hand-over of dual-lipidated Hh to Scube2 chaperones (this model does not predict a role for lipoprotein particles but for both Shh lipids in signaling, for a recent discussion, see PMID 36932157). Our findings suggest an answer to the intensely debated question of whether Disp/Ptch extract cholesterol from the outer or inner plasma membrane leaflet, and suggest that N-palmitate is dispensable for signaling of lipoprotein-associated Shh to Ptch receptors. Finally, we note that previous in vivo studies in flies often relied on Hh overexpression in the fat body, raising questions on their physiological relevance. Our in vivo analyses of Hh function in wing- and eye discs are more physiologically relevant and can explain the previously reported presence of non-lipidated bioactive Hh in disc tissue (PMID: 23554573).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>1. “However, the results concerning the roles of lipoproteins and Shh lipid modifications are largely confirmatory of previous results, and molecular identity/physiological relevance of the newly identified Shh variant remain unclear”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the confirmatory aspects of our work, please also refer to our response to reviewer 1. In addition, we would like to reply that our unbiased experimental approach was designed to challenge the model of Shh shedding by testing whether established Shh release regulators affect it (e.g. support it) or not.  As described in our work, Disp, Scube2 and lipoproteins all contribute to increased shedding (which is new), that Disp function depends on lipoprotein presence (also new), and that lipoproteins modify the outcome of Shh shedding (dual Shh shedding versus N-shedding and lipoprotein association), which is also new.</p>
<p>Regarding physiological relevance, we would like to reply that our finding that artificially generated monolipidated variants (C25SShh and ShhN) solubilize in uncontrolled manner from producing cells can explain previously observed, highly variable gain-of-function or loss-of-function phenotypes upon their overexpression in vivo 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Our data is also supported by the observed presence of variably lipidated Shh/Hh variants in vivo 6, and the in vivo observation that complete removal of Scube activity in zebrafish embryos phenocopies a complete loss of Hh function that is bypassed by increased ligand expression - and even results in wild-type-like ectopic Shh target gene expression 7. The in vivo observations are compatible with our data but are incompatible with proposed alternative models of Scube-mediated dual-lipidated Shh extraction and continued Shh/Scube association to allow for morphogen transport.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. “Thus, it would be important to demonstrate key findings in cells that secrete Shh endogenously”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Experimental data shown in Fig. S8B demonstrates that en-controlled expression of sheddase-resistant Hh variants blocks endogenous Hh function in the same wing disc compartment. To our knowledge, this assay is the most physiologically relevant test of the mechanism of Disp-mediated Hh release. Still, we have now started to analyze Hh from Drosophila disc tissue biochemically and hope that we can include our findings in the final manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. “The authors could use an orthogonal approach, optimally a demonstration of physical interaction, or at least fractionation by a different parameter”.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this reviewer’s assessment and are currently in the process to establish co-IP and density gradient conditions to test physical HDL/Shh interactions. The results will be included in the final version of record.</p>
