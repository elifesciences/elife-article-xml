<title>Abstract</title><p>CXCR4 is a ubiquitously expressed chemokine receptor that regulates leukocyte trafficking and arrest in homeostatic and pathological states, and also participates in organogenesis, HIV-1 infection and tumor development. Despite the potential therapeutic benefit of CXCR4 antagonists, so far only one, plerixafor (AMD3100), which blocks the ligand-binding site, has reached the clinic. Recent advances in imaging and biophysical techniques have provided a richer understanding of the membrane organization and dynamics of this receptor. CXCL12 activation of CXCR4 reduces the number of CXCR4 monomers/dimers at the cell membrane and increases the formation of large nanoclusters, which are largely immobile and are required for correct cell orientation towards chemoattractant gradients. Mechanistically, CXCR4 activation involves a structural motif defined by residues on TMV and TMVI of CXCR4. Using this structural motif as a template, we performed <italic>in silico</italic> molecular modeling followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> screening of a small compound library to search for allosteric antagonists of CXCR4 that do not affect CXCL12 binding. We identified AGR1.137, a small compound that abolishes CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and dynamics and blocks the ability of cells to sense CXCL12 gradients both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> without altering ligand binding or receptor internalization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is a homeostatic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is widely expressed both in embryonic and adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). It is also ubiquitously expressed in the hematopoietic system, where it plays important roles in leukocyte trafficking and arrest in specific niches both under homeostasis and disease. CXCR4 is essential for adaptive and innate immune responses as well as for bone marrow (BM) organization and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Indeed, CXCR4 and its unique chemokine ligand, CXCL12, are largely responsible for hematopoietic stem cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) in the BM.</p>
<p>Results from studies in conditional <italic>Cxcr4</italic>-knockout mice point to a relevant role for CXCR4 in several non-hematopoietic tissues, for example, in regulating central nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), and in vasculature development in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) and the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In addition, CXCR4, together with CCR5, serve as primary co-receptors (with CD4) for HIV-1 fusion and entry into target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>CXCR4 expression is frequently elevated in many cancers, including breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), ovarian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), prostate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), where it participates in tumor growth, tumor cell interactions with the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), vasculogenesis, angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Indeed, increased CXCR4 expression in metastatic lesions correlates with tumor progression and with preferential metastatic sites of the primary tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Murine studies have suggested that CXCR4 is a good target in cancer therapy since blockade of its signaling impairs metastasis in different models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Despite the essential role of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in physiology and pathology, the only commercial CXCR4 antagonist approved for clinical use is plerixafor (AMD3100), which is indicated for mobilizing stem cells from the BM to the peripheral blood in autologous transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Using Single-Particle Tracking in Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence mode (SPT-TIRF) and STimulated Emission Depletion super resolution microscopy (STED), it has been demonstrated that CXCR4 is organized at the cell membrane as monomers, dimers and small aggregates (groups of ≥3 receptors) termed nanoclusters, and that CXCL12 binding reduces the percentage of monomers/dimers, and increases the formation of large nanoclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). This is an essential mechanism to drive CXCR4 signaling that allows correct cell orientation towards CXCL12 gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). A triple-mutant CXCR4 (K239L/V242A/L246A; CXCR4mut) dimerizes but neither forms nanoclusters in response to CXCL12 nor supports CXCL12-induced directed cell migration, although it can still trigger some Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and is internalized after ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In CXCR4, it has been identified a cluster defined by TMV and TMVI residues that conform a hydrophobic lock interconnecting the signal coming from the orthosteric ligand-binding site with the downstream conserved domains involved in G protein coupling and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we used this signal propagation domain of CXCR4 as the starting point to search for new CXCR4 antagonists. We performed <italic>in silico</italic> screening of a small aromatic compound library to identify potential allosteric antagonists that block directed cell migration, without affecting ligand binding and, therefore, allowing other CXCL12-mediated functions. Applying molecular modeling analyses, we identified a novel class of structurally-related low molecular weight compounds that modulate some CXCR4 functions by binding to a new regulatory cleft formed by the TMV and TMVI transmembrane helices. One of the selected compounds, AGR1.137, abrogated CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and dynamics and, consequently, the ability of the cells to specifically sense CXCL12 gradients, but did not alter ligand binding or receptor internalization. Notably, AGR1.137 had little effect on ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation, which may minimize the side effects associated with full CXCR4 inhibition. Finally, using a zebrafish model, we observed that AGR1.137 treatment of HeLa cells reduced tumorigenesis and metastasis, indicating that AGR1.137 also impairs cell sensitivity towards CXCL12 gradients by disassembling CXCR4 nanoclustering <italic>in vivo</italic>. In sum, our results establish the importance of residues in the TMV–VI cavity for CXCR4 nanoclustering and CXCL12-mediated directional migration, and identify a partial antagonist that operates both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Screening for small compounds targeting CXCR4 that block CXCL12-induced CXCR4 nanoclustering</title>
<p>In CXCR4, the propagation domain that connects the ligand binding with the residues implicated in G-protein association, involves residues present in the area limited by transmembrane helices TMV and TMVI, which enclose a cleft of around 900 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) that is surface-exposed for interactions with the plasma membrane, and includes the residues implicated in receptor activation and in transmission of conformational changes through the TM helix domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We thus screened for allosteric antagonists matching this CXCR4 cleft and fitting into the cavity formed by TMV and TMVI but not impacting the CXCL12 binding site. Virtual screenings were performed using the MBC library (CIB-CSIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) that contains more than 2,000 small heterocyclic compounds with drug-like properties. The compounds were prepared and docked using “Glide” against the modeled CXCR4 structure prepared using the SwissModel server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The compounds identified were then ranked by docking-score given by Glide and visualization of the poses.</p>

</fig>
<p>In total, 40 candidates showed minimal interaction energy in the area of interest and were selected for functional analysis (Supplementary Table 1). We first screened their ability to block CXCL12-induced cell dependent migration in Transwell chambers.</p>
<p>Jurkat cells that were either untreated or treated with 50 μM of the selected small compounds (30 minutes, 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) were allowed to migrate towards CXCL12 (12.5 nM, 120 minutes, 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). To enhance the possible inhibitory effects, the compounds were maintained in the upper chamber containing the cells throughout the chemotaxis experiment (Supplementary Fig. 1A,B).</p>
<p>Based on these results, we initially selected two compounds, AGR1.135 and AGR1.137, which showed reproducible dose-dependent inhibitory effects on CXCR4-induced cell migration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). As a control for further analysis, we used AGR1.131, which is also theoretically directed against the same motif on CXCR4 as AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 and shows minimal interaction energy, but fails to impact CXCL12-promoted cell migration. Under these experimental conditions, none of the selected compounds were toxic against Jurkat cells, as shown by propidium iodide incorporation and cell cycle analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Structurally, the three selected compounds were verified using NMR (Supplementary information), and were characterized by the presence of a common core (4-(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)phenyl) methanol, connected through a benzamide with a lateral chain bearing amines of different length and chemical nature. AGR1.131 bears a simple benzylamine, AGR1.135 contains a complex lateral chain due to the presence of the 1-(2-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperazine, and AGR1.137 incorporates ethyl piperidine-4-carboxylate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 block CXCL12-mediated CXCR4 nanoclustering and dynamics</title>
<p>The initial virtual screening was made based on interactions between low molecular weight compounds and the TMV–TMVI region on CXCR4. We next evaluated whether the selected compounds altered CXCL12-mediated CXCR4 nanoclustering and dynamics. To do this, we utilized SPT-TIRF on CXCR4-deficient Jurkat cells (JK<sup>-/-</sup>) transiently transfected with CXCR4 fused to the AcGFP monomeric protein (CXCR4-AcGFP) and pretreated or not with the selected small compounds (50 μM, 45 minutes, 37°C). The compounds had no effect on unstimulated cells, and we observed mainly receptor monomers and dimers (∼85–91%), with a very low percentage of complexes with more than three receptors (∼9–16%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Accordingly, the basal mean spot intensity (MSI) of CXCR4 was very similar in all cases (∼1,500 a.u.) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Under these experimental conditions, most of the particles corresponded to mobile particles (∼87%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), and none of the selected compounds affected the short time-lag diffusion coefficient (D<sub>1-4</sub>) for CXCR4 trajectories, with a median value of ∼0.02 μm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>We next examined how pre-treatment with the selected compounds affected receptor dynamics upon CXCL12 stimulation. Pretreatment with AGR1.135 and AGR1.137, but not with AGR1.131, substantially impaired CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering (46–60% of nanoclusters with ≥3 receptors/particle in untreated and in AGR1.131-treated cells <italic>versus</italic> 15–16% in cells pretreated with AGR1.135 or AGR1.137) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), with an MSI of 3,002 a.u. for CXCR4 in untreated cells and 3,618 a.u. in AGR1.131-treated cells <italic>versus</italic> 1,611 a.u. in AGR1.135- and 1,403 a.u. in AGR1.137-treated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The effect was also evident when we evaluated the dynamic parameters of CXCR4. In control cells (untreated or AGR1.131-treated cells), CXCL12 significantly increased the percentage of immobile particles (12% in untreated cells <italic>versus</italic> 24% in untreated cells + CXCL12 and 20% in AGR1.131-treated cells + CXCL12) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), whereas AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 pretreatment had no effect on the percentage of immobile particles after CXCL12 stimulation (14% for AGR1.135 and 16% for AGR1.137). Moreover, the expected reduction in CXCR4 diffusivity triggered by CXCL12 in untreated (median D<sub>1-4</sub> = 0.0086 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) or AGR1.131-treated (median D<sub>1-4</sub> = 0.0099 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) cells was abolished with AGR1.135 (D<sub>1-4</sub> = 0.0169 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and AGR1.137 (D<sub>1-4</sub> = 0.0165 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) treatments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results suggest that AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 behave as allosteric antagonists of CXCR4 and alter the CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and dynamics.</p>

<title>AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 incompletely abolish CXCR4-mediated responses in Jurkat cells</title>
<p>CXCR4 internalizes in response to CXCL12, a process that mediates receptor desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Our previous results indicate that CXCR4 nanoclustering and internalization are independent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Indeed, CXCL12 triggers normal CXCR4mut internalization but fails to promote receptor nanoclustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We thus tested whether the selected antagonists affected CXCL12-mediated CXCR4 internalization. Jurkat cells treated with vehicle or the selected compounds (50 μM, 30 minutes, 37°C) were stimulated with CXCL12 (50 nM, 37°C) and receptor internalization was evaluated by flow cytometry using anti-CXCR4 antibodies. Neither AGR1.135 nor AGR1.137 treatment altered the internalization of CXCR4 that was observed in untreated Jurkat cells or in AGR1.131-treated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Indeed, using flow cytometry analysis and CXCL12-ATTO 700 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) we confirmed that none of the selected compounds affected ligand binding, whereas this was blocked by the ligand-binding inhibitor AMD3100 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 2).</p>

<p>Because CXCL12 promotes Gi-protein activation, we analyzed the effects of the selected compounds on CXCL12-mediated inhibition of cAMP production, a canonical signaling pathway downstream of CXCR4 activation. In contrast to the effect promoted by AMD3100, a binding-site antagonist of CXCR4, none of the compounds altered CXCL12-mediated Gi protein activation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). We next evaluated their effects on other signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 phosphorylation and PI3K activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Jurkat cells treated with vehicle or the selected compounds (50 μM, 30 minutes, 37°C) were activated with CXCL12 (50 nM) for different time periods and cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting using anti-P-ERK1/2 and -P-AKT antibodies. Neither AGR1.135 nor AGR1.137 nor control AGR1.131 treatments blocked CXCL12-mediated activation of the two signaling pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 3). Overall, these data indicate that although the selected compounds inhibit CXCL12-induced chemotaxis in Transwell assays, they do not impact G-protein activation or other ligand-mediated signaling pathways such as ERK1/2 or PI3K.</p>
<p>Alterations in actin cytoskeleton dynamics are linked to deficiencies in ligand-mediated receptor nanoclustering and to defects in the ability of cells to sense chemoattractant gradients. Cells treated with latrunculin A, an actin polymerization inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), and cells expressing CXCR4WHIM<sup>R334X</sup>, which fail to correctly control actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), have defective CXCL12-mediated nanoclustering and were unable to appropriately sense chemoattractant gradients. Using flow cytometry and phalloidin staining on Jurkat cells treated with vehicle or the selected compounds (50 μM, 37°C), we detected altered actin polymerization in cells treated with AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Data were corroborated by immunostaining and confocal analysis. Whereas Jurkat cells treated with vehicle or AGR1.131 were correctly polarized after CXCL12 activation, AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 treatments promoted a reduction in the number of polarized cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). As control, AGR1.137 did not affect anti-CD3 mediated actin polymerization, discarding a direct effect of the compound on actin or actin-binding proteins (Supplementary Fig. 4).</p>

<p>CXCR4 nanoclustering has been recently associated with the migratory phenotype of T cell blasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). To explore how the antagonists affected the phenotype of migrating cells, we added T cell blasts previously treated with vehicle or with the selected compounds (50 μM, 30 minutes, 37°C) to a 2D-lipid bilayer system with embedded ICAM-1, alone or with CXCL12. We observed that treatment with AGR1.135 and AGR1.137, but not with AGR1.131, abolished CXCL12-induced cell migration and cell adhesion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C, D</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that the antagonistic effects of AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 are also compatible with a partial agonist behavior, we used Transwell chambers to evaluate the ability of the selected compounds to promote Jurkat cell migration. None of the compounds induced cell migration (Supplementary Fig. 5). Overall, our results suggest that AGR1.135- and AGR1.137-driven modulation of CXCR4 nanoclustering blocks certain receptor-associated functions, including actin dynamics, directed-cell migration, integrin-mediated adhesion and migration, whereas other functions remain unaffected (i.e., receptor internalization, inhibition of cAMP production and ERK1/2 activation).</p>

<title>AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 antagonists act by direct binding on CXCR4</title>
<p>We failed to detect a direct interaction between the compounds and CXCR4; therefore, we tried an indirect approach. By <italic>in silico</italic> MD analysis using AMBER14, we defined those CXCR4 residues involved in binding of the compounds, and generated point mutant receptors to determine the inhibitory effect of AGR1.135, AGR1.137 and AGR1.131 (control) on CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis. We initially performed a binding-site search using PELE software, a Monte Carlo-based technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), to identify the most promising CXCR4 binding sites of the selected compounds. AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 showed one of the most stable trajectories upon binding to the cleft formed by TMV and TMVI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-C</xref>). By contrast, the most stable trajectories for AGR1.131 (control) corresponded to the binding to a contiguous region localized between TMI and TMVII (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Once the binding site of the compounds was confirmed, we performed docking studies to discern the best poses as a starting point for additional studies.</p>

<p>Results showed that AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 shared a similar binding mode (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) and might interact with CXCR4 in a molecular cavity between TMV and TMVI. Specifically, AGR1.135 established hydrogen bonds with residues G207, Y256 and R235, although in the latter case, a pi-cation interaction was also possible (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 6A). Additionally, AGR1.135 could interact hydrophobically with several residues in TMV and TMVI comprising a total surface of 400 Å<sup>2</sup> with a length of 20 Å (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). AGR1.137 might use the carboxyl group of V124 in TMIII and overlap with AGR1.135 binding in the cavity, interacting with the other 19 residues scattered between TMV and VI to create an interaction surface of 370 Å<sup>2</sup> along 20 Å (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 6B). AGR1.137 did not have the phenyl ring present in AGR1.135, likely explaining why it did not interact with the residue R235 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Regarding AGR1.131, its best binding site was the pocket between helices TMI and TMVII (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), which is likely the reason why this compound had no effect on receptor oligomerization.</p>
<p>To confirm the putative binding sites for AGR1.135 and AGR1.137, we generated several point mutations in CXCR4 using the residues identified in each case that did not interfere with signal transduction: G207I, L208K, R235L, F249L and Y256F. Additionally, we also added the mutations I204K, S260A as controls, as they are included in the same area (TMV-TMVI cleft) but did not interfere with compound binding or the CXCL12 binding site. All CXCR4 mutants were normally expressed at the cell surface, as demonstrated by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 7), and were fully functional, as evidenced in a CXCL12-mediated cell chemotaxis assay (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>DiI-labeled HeLa cells, treated with vehicle, AGR1.135, AGR1.137 or AGR1.131 (control), were implanted subcutaneously in the perivitelline space of 2-day-old zebrafish larvae. Images of each tumor-bearing larva were taken immediately after implantation and 3 days later, and the relative change in tumor size was determined. AGR1.135 was discarded as most of the treated larvae died, indicating a toxic effect. By contrast, AGR1.137 was not toxic to embryos, and no other non-lethal toxic phenotypes (e.g., pericardial edema, head and tail necrosis, malformation of the head or tail, brain hemorrhage or yolk sac edema) were evident; and it was not teratogenic. AGR1.137 markedly reduced the size of high-intensity red fluorescent tumors, whereas the control AGR1.131 had no effect on tumor size as compared with vehicle-treated fish, and AMD3100 reduced tumor size to a similar extent as AGR1.137 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is involved in myriad functions including leukocyte recruitment, embryogenesis, vascular development, hematopoiesis, heart development, nervous system organization, tumor progression, autoimmune diseases and, together with CD4, CXCR4 is a co-receptor used by the HIV-1 virus to infect immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). This evidence supports the clinical interest in developing specific antagonists to modulate or directly block CXCR4 functions.</p>
<p>Plerixafor (AMD3100), which blocks ligand binding, is the first FDA-approved CXCR4 antagonist used for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Unfortunately, its clinical application is limited by poor pharmacokinetics and adverse effects associated with long-term administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). These limitations and the poor clinical success of other chemokine receptor antagonists have prompted the search for alternative strategies to block chemokine receptor functions.</p>
<p>As for other GPCRs, CXCR4 exists in the plasma membrane in multiple conformations and interacts with other chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) and also with cell surface proteins such as the T-cell receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), CD4 and other receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Advanced imaging-based techniques such as SPT-TIRF and super-resolution microscopy have revealed the presence of CXCR4 monomers, dimers and oligomers at the cell membrane that diffuse as nanoclusters in the lipid bilayer. CXCL12 binding triggers receptor nanoclustering and reduces the percentage of monomers and dimers. This effect is essential for the full activation of the CXCR4 signaling pathway and the correct orientation of the cell towards chemokine gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). For instance, CXCR4R<sup>334X</sup>, a truncated mutant receptor causing WHIM syndrome, fails to form nanoclusters in the presence of CXCL12 and is unable to sense chemoattractant gradients, although it remains able to trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux and other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Due to the inability to connect CXCR4 with the actin cytoskeleton, β-arrestin-1-deficient cells do not exhibit CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Similar observations are seen with cells expressing CXCR4 and treated with latrunculin A, an actin polymerization inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Altogether, these observations indicate that receptor nanoclustering is a ligand-mediated process, requiring activation of a signaling pathway involving β-arrestin-1 and correct actin cytoskeleton dynamics.</p>
<p>CXCR4 contains a pocket created by two TM segments, TMV and TMVI, and mutations in this pocket can affect the dynamics of the conformational changes triggered by ligand binding. The mechanism involves the initial interaction of CXCL12 with the extracellular region of CXCR4, which promotes conformational changes to a series of hydrophobic residues present mostly on TMV and TMVI that continue downwards in the TM domains of the receptor, ultimately allowing G-protein interaction and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Interestingly, a complete GPCR class A chemokine receptor alignment reveals that hydrophobic residues in this area that are not in highly conserved positions could present any side-chain length in any site depending on the receptor, which likely confers a specificity that could be exploited for the discovery and/or design of new antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. 9).</p>
<p>To identify new allosteric antagonists with reduced potential side-effects, we focused on an <italic>in silico</italic> screening directed to the pocket in CXCR4 created by TMV and TMVI, without affecting the residues involved in CXCL12 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Subsequent functional analysis of the selected compounds identified AGR1.135, AGR1.137, and AGR1.131. The latter, although selected with the same <italic>in silico</italic> criteria, did not block CXCL12-mediated chemotaxis. In addition, the compounds did not affect neither CXCR2-mediated cell migration, supporting their specificity for CXCR4. The three compounds had a common core of (4-(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)phenyl)methanol but distinct side chains that carry amines of different length and chemical nature, which might explain their different biological activity.</p>
<p>SPT-TIRF analysis indicated that AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 abolished the ability of CXCL12 to trigger CXCR4 nanoclustering and altered the receptor dynamics at the cell membrane. Moreover, as expected from the selection criteria, these compounds did not alter CXCL12 binding, receptor internalization, inhibition of cAMP-production or ERK1/2 or PI3K activation. The results also suggested the existence of distinct CXCR4 conformational states responsible for the activation of different signaling pathways. It is well known that GPCRs are thought to reside in the plasma membrane in equilibrium between distinct states, depending on complex allosteric interactions and conformational changes promoted by ligands, as well as on cell-specific parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Many GPCRs show basal activity that can be modulated by ligands with different efficacy. Full agonists can induce the maximal signaling response, whereas partial agonists and inverse agonists promote submaximal signaling or decrease basal activity, respectively. In addition, some ligands are known to be biased because they selectively activate specific receptor-associated pathways at the expense of others, supporting the presence of distinct receptor conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor reinforce the idea that distinct agonists stabilize different receptor conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), raising the possibility that allosteric ligands shift the equilibrium to favor a particular receptor conformation.</p>
<p>CXCR4 docking studies to refine the binding mode of the selected compounds combined with a point mutation strategy confirmed the binding specificity of the antagonists. AGR1.135 and AGR1.137 lost their antagonism on cells expressing CXCR4L208K or CXCR4Y256F. In addition, the inhibitory behavior of AGR1.137 was also missed in cells expressing CXCR4F249L. Both antagonists showed stable trajectories bound to CXCR4, being able to occupy the cavity formed by TMV and TMVI and keeping specific hydrogen bond interactions and hydrophobic contacts along the interaction surface. Moreover, there were differences between the two antagonists in terms of binding; whereas AGR1.135 had a stronger interaction due to three hydrogen bonds that curved the position of the molecule as it fitted into the cavity formed by TMV and TMVI, AGR1.137 bound to the carboxyl group of V124 in TMIII, penetrating deeper into the receptor and then following the TMV–TMVI cleft down to the bottom of the cavity. In both cases, hydrophobic interactions with several residues of the receptor allowed the compounds to attach to the cleft and partially abrogate the movement of TMVI required for complete signal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). These differences might explain the distinct behavior of both compounds on cells expressing CXCR4F249L and suggest a closer interaction between the triazole group of AGR1.137 and the F249 residue on CXCR4. The region has also been implicated in the connection of the orthosteric chemokine binding pocket to the lipid bilayer. These observations highlight the flexibility of the cavity and its potential for modulation. They also suggest that this cavity could be used to guide the development of a new generation of antagonists that, without affecting CXCL12 binding, allosterically modulate some GPCR-mediated functions without altering others.</p>
<p>CXCR4 overexpression contributes to tumor growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, relapse and therapeutic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). As might be expected, CXCR4 antagonism has been shown to disrupt tumor-stromal interactions, sensitize cancer cells to cytotoxic drugs, and reduce tumor growth and metastatic burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). We used a ZTX model with HeLa cells, which express functional CXCR4, to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance of the selected antagonists. This is a well-studied model to evaluate tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Our results demonstrate that AGR1.137 treatment of HeLa cells reduces the relative tumor size by 50% and limits cell dissemination in the absence of toxicity, altogether indicating that this compound has both anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic properties. While the effect of AGR1.137 on cell dissemination could be a consequence of its impact on tumorigenesis, it also abolished <italic>in vitro</italic> directed-HeLa cell migration, supporting the inhibition of cell metastasis.</p>
<p>Our data support the notion of CXCR4 as a flexible protein that can adopt a spectrum of conformations depending on several factors such as the presence of a bound ligand, the lipid composition of the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and the presence of other interacting proteins. As for many GPCRs, the stabilization of distinct CXCR4 states is a key element to modulate its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Our data show that by targeting the pocket between TMV and TMVI in CXCR4, AGR1.137 can block (both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>) CXCL12-mediated receptor nanoclustering and cell sensitivity towards chemoattractant gradients without altering ligand binding and, thus, preserving other signaling events. Ultimately, these results demonstrate the value in stabilizing specific CXCR4 conformations and in considering targets other than the ligand-binding site for the design of partial antagonists with reduced side-effects to block a specific set of CXCR4 functions.</p>

<title>Discovery of CXCR4 modulators</title>
<p>The CXCR4 model was built on the SWISS-MODEL server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) using the human CXCR4 sequence and the crystallographic structure of a CXCR4 dimer in complex with the small molecule IT1t as template (PDB code: 3ODU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).

Virtual screening of ligands was performed from the compounds included in the MBC library using the “Glide” module as a docking tool on CXCR4 model.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study identifies novel small molecule antagonists of CXCR4 that disrupt nanocluster formation and chemotactic function without blocking CXCL12 binding and downstream signals. The conclusions are based on <bold>solid</bold> evidence, but the work could be improved by including kinetic and dose information on the most active inhibitors. We also note that modeling and mutagenesis implicate helix V and VI in an allosteric mechanism, but that the description of the modeling is not sufficiently detailed such that others could replicate it.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript, titled &quot;Allosteric Modulation of the CXCR4:CXCL12 Axis by Targeting Receptor Nanoclustering via the TMV-TMVI Domain,&quot; presents a compelling investigation into the development of a potential anti-cancer therapeutic agent. The study focuses on targeting specific CXCR4 intermolecular interactions via an allosteric antagonist which binds proximal to the orthosteric ligand binding site. The novel compounds developed aim to mitigate tumor dissemination, proliferation, and metastasis in transgenic Zebrafish models implanted with HeLa cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study holds significant promise, offering a novel approach to addressing the targeted modulation of CXCR4. The multidisciplinary methodology employed is commendable, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular interactions. The proposed workflow, although requiring some adjustments, is reasonable and has the potential to make a substantial impact in the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Despite the brilliance of the concept and its potential impact, the computational approach appears somewhat superficial and lacks essential considerations. A comprehensive revision of the computational methodology is strongly recommended, with a focus on addressing key points. Additionally, the experimental section should be modified accordingly to align with the refined results. While the study's foundations are promising, its current state warrants a thorough revision to enhance its scientific rigor and overall robustness.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This work describes a new pharmacological targeting approach to inhibit selective functions of the ubiquitously expressed chemokine receptor CXCR4, a potential target of immunomodulatory or anti-cancer treatments. Overall, the results build a strong case for the potential of this new compound to target specific functions of CXCR4, particularly linked to tumorigenesis. However, a more thorough evaluation of the function of the compound as well as future studies in mammalian model systems are needed to better assess the promise of the compound.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work elegantly utilizes in silico drug modelling to propose new small molecule compounds with specific features. This way, the authors designed compound AGR1.137, which abolishes ligand-induced CXCR4 receptor nanoclustering and the subsequent directed cell migration without affecting ligand binding itself or some other ligand-induced signaling pathways. The authors have used a relatively broad set of experiments to validate and demonstrate the effects of the drug. Importantly, the authors also test AGR1.137 in vivo, using a zebrafish model of tumorigenesis and metastasis. A relatively strong inhibitory effect of the compound is reported.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The data would be significantly strengthened by adding kinetics and titration of concentrations. This is particularly important as it is the first description of these particular compounds and would help to evaluate the potency and possible side effects of the drug.</p>
<p>The authors carry out single-molecule tracking experiments to analyze nanoclustering of CXCR4 upon ligand binding. This complex data is presented in a sub-optimal manner. Representative images of the data should be included together with more thorough analysis tools like autocorrelation function or mean square displacement to get a more conclusive view of receptor clustering and the effects of the compound.</p>
<p>In the in vivo tumorigenesis experiments, again more kinetics and different concentrations of the drug would generate more convincing data. Also, the individual data points should be visualized to allow full evaluation of the data, throughout the experiments.</p>

<p>Many thanks for handling our manuscript (eLife-RP-RA-2023-93968) entitled &quot;Allosteric modulation of the CXCR4:CXCL12 axis by targeting receptor nanoclustering via the TMV-TMVI domain&quot;, by García-Cuesta et al. We are delighted to hear your willingness to consider our manuscript following appropriate revision. We have carefully read the referees' commentaries and have organized new experiments to address their specific queries.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review)</bold></p>
<p>The computational methodology is going to be carefully reviewed.  In particular to justify the software and techniques used in this manuscript. We will also describe the method for identifying the pocket on the CXCR4 structure as well as the workflow used to explain the transition from docking evaluation to MD analyses. Additionally, we will conduct experiments to enhance the results and address the specific feedback provided, ultimately improving the overall reliability.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review)</bold></p>
<p>Although the paper was initiated by titrating the compounds in migration experiments, we are going to add new kinetics and titration of concentrations in these experiments. In addition, we are going to change the way in which we present the data from the singlemolecule tracking experiments. We will add a representative video of each experimental condition, and include some of the mean square displacement curves to support our data on the analysis of the diffusion coefficient (D1-4) to give a more conclusive view of receptor clustering. Regarding the tumorigenesis experiments we will include the individual data points and we will try to perform kinetics with distinct concentrations of the drug.</p>
