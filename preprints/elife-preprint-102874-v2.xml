<title>Abstract</title><p>Neuropathic pain, a major health problem affecting 7-10% of the global population, lacks effective treatment due to its elusive mechanisms. Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal neurons was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Moreover, GPR30 was expressed in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons that received direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain and GPR30 mediates descending facilitation by corticospinal direct projections, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuropathic pain, a persistent and disabling condition affecting approximately 7–10% of the global population, arises from a lesion or dysfunction of the somatosensory nervous system <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup>. This disorder manifests as mechanical allodynia (pain triggered by innocuous stimuli) and thermal hyperalgesia (exaggerated pain responses to noxious heat)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]</sup>. However, the complex and elusive mechanisms of neuropathic pain still make it difficult to treat. Therefore, identifying precise mechanisms and discovering new therapeutic targets is urgently needed.</p>
<p>The spinal cord (SC) serves as a pivotal hub for processing peripheral sensory inputs and integrating descending modulatory signals. Neuropathic mechanical allodynia occurs via circuit-based transformation in this region<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]</sup>. Superficial laminae of the SC primarily encode noxious stimuli, whereas deeper laminae process innocuous signals. Under neuropathic conditions, however, low-threshold mechanosensory inputs aberrantly activate nociceptive neurons in superficial laminae through disinhibition and sensitization mechanisms, driving mechanical allodynia. Excitatory interneurons, constituting ∼75% of spinal dorsal horn (SDH) neurons, are central to this pathological process<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]</sup>. Among these, cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK<sup>+</sup>) interneurons, enriched in SDH deep laminae, have recently been proposed as mediators of both mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>. Notably, CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons receive direct corticospinal projections from the primary sensory cortex (S1), modulating neuropathic pain sensitivity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>; however, the molecular underpinnings of this regulation remain obscure.</p>
<p>Estrogen, beyond its classical nuclear receptors (ERα/ERβ), exerts non-genomic effects via the membrane receptor G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPR30), which is increasingly recognized as a key player in nociceptive modulation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]</sup>. Although GPR30’s role in pain modulation has been documented, its specific contribution to SDH circuitry in neuropathic pain remains unexplored.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that spinal GPR30 orchestrates neuropathic pain by modulating excitability of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons and corticospinal descending facilitation. We discovered that GPR30 activation in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was both required and sufficient for the development of neuropathic pain. Interestingly, we observed that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons was required for the enhancement of spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (sEPSC) in CCI mice, in an AMPA-dependent manner. Importantly, we revealed that GPR30 was expressed in the spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons receiving direct projections from S1 sensory cortex, and that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was critical for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. These findings establish GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons as a compelling therapeutic target for neuropathic pain management.</p>

<title>Spinal inhibition of GPR30 reverses CCI-induced neuropathic pain and neuronal activation</title>
<p>To investigate the functional relevance of spinal GPR30 in neuropathic pain, we employed a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model to evaluate whether pharmacological blockade of spinal GPR30 alleviates neuropathic pain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed a significant elevation of <italic>Gper1</italic> (GPR30) mRNA levels in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of CCI mice compared to sham (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). By the way, the <italic>Gper1</italic> mRNA levels in the DRG remained unchanged after CCI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Intrathecal application of the GPR30 antagonist, G-15, effectively attenuated CCI-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in both sexes of mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-E</xref>), whereas basal nociceptive thresholds remained unaltered in naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">B</xref>). Of note, the analgesic effects of G-15 lasted for up to 6 hours after intrathecal application in CCI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1C</xref>). Immunochemical data demonstrated that innocuous tactile stimulation triggered pronounced c-Fos expression, a marker of neuronal activation, predominantly in GPR30<sup>+</sup> cells within the SDH of CCI mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F-J</xref>). Critically, G-15 treatment substantially suppressed this c-Fos expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F-J</xref>), indicating that spinal GPR30 inhibition normalizes both hypersensitivity and neuronal activation in neuropathic pain in both sexes.</p>

<p>We further probed whether GPR30 activation alone could mimic neuropathic symptoms in naïve mice. Intrathecal application of the selective GPR30 agonist, G-1, robustly evoked mechanical allodynia and thermal hypersensitivity, with symptom persistence exceeding 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1D-G</xref>). Consistent with behavioral outcomes, G-1 administration markedly increased c-Fos<sup>+</sup> neuron density in the SDH, with over 80% of activated cells co-expressing GPR30.</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings establish spinal GPR30 as a critical mediator of sex-independent neuropathic pain development in the CCI model.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons is required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain</title>
<p>To delineate the spinal cellular substrates of GPR30-mediated pain modulation, we first mapped its expression pattern. Our results revealed exclusive GPR30 localization to neuronal populations within the SDH instead of astrocytes or microglial cells via immunochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>). Notably, as an estrogen receptor, GPR30 expression showed no sexual dimorphism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2D</xref>). To assess the relative expression of GPR30 in excitatory versus inhibitory neurons, we performed <italic>Ish</italic> and immunostaining with <italic>VGAT</italic>, <italic>Vglut2</italic> and GPR30 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). GPR30 was predominantly expressed on the excitatory neurons of SDH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Further characterization in wild-type mice using AAV2/9-Camk2-mCherry labeling also confirmed predominant GPR30 enrichment in SDH excitatory interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3</xref>).</p>

<p>Given the established role of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons in neuropathic pain and their dominance among SDH excitatory interneurons<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup>, we hypothesized that GPR30 within this subset drives nociceptive sensitization. To validate this, we characterized CCK expression in the spinal cord via transgenic models by crossing <italic>CCK-Cre</italic> with <italic>Ai14</italic> reporter mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). <italic>Ish</italic> and immunostaining confirmed that our transgenic mice recapitulated the majority of <italic>CCK</italic> expression in the deep laminae of the SDH as marked by isolectin B4 (IB4), CGRP and NF200 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). To verify the role of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons in allodynia under neuropathic pain, we performed immunostaining of c-Fos in CCK-Ai14 mice, and we confirmed that more CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons were activated after CCI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4</xref>). What’s more, near-universal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons were co-localized with GPR30 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">G</xref>).</p>

<title>GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons is essential for the enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in the SDH of CCI mice</title>

<p>Given that EPSCs are primarily mediated through glutamatergic receptors such as AMPA receptor, coupled with emerging evidence showing that GPR30 could facilitate excitatory transmission via increasing the clustering of glutamatergic receptor subunits<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]</sup>, we proceeded to examine whether GPR30-mediated EPSCs depend on AMPA-mediated currents. Electrophysiological experiments were carried out in spinal slices from <italic>CCK-Cre</italic> mice treated with intraspinal injections of AAV2/9-DIO-EGFP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>). To record AMPA-dependent currents, electronical stimulation from the electrode placed in the deep laminae of SDH was applied (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). And CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons were held at −70 mV in the presence of APV (100 μM) to block NMDA receptors and bicuculline (20 μM) to block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and strychnine (0.5 μM) to block glycine receptors. All recorded cells responded to the electrode stimulation, exhibiting evoked EPSCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). Furthermore, the application of 0.1 μM G-1 augmented the amplitude of AMPA currents (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">I</xref>).

<p>Building on previous findings suggesting a functional interaction between S1-SDH projections and spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>, our current study aimed to further elucidate the structural relationship among GPR30, S1-SDH projections and CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons. To achieve this, we performed anterograde trans-monosynaptic tracing by injecting AAV2/1-hSyn-Cre into the right S1 cortex, followed by AAV2/9-DIO-mCherry into the contralateral lumbar SDH. This approach allowed us to visualize the mCherry<sup>+</sup> S1-SDH postsynaptic neurons in the deep laminae of the lumbar SDH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">H</xref>).

Thus, our findings confirm that spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons are directly innervated by the S1 cortex.</p>
<p>To further examine the interplay between GPR30, S1-SDH projections, and CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons, we utilized a monosynaptic anterograde tracing strategy. Specifically, we injected AAV2/1-EF1α-FLP into the right S1 cortex and AAV2/9-hSyn-Con/Fon-GFP into the contralateral lumbar SDH of CCK-Cre mice. This strategy enabled us to visualize GFP-positive S1-SDH postsynaptic CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">L</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons, located in the deep laminae of the spinal cord, have long been recognized for their pivotal role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain, as well as descending facilitation by sensory cortex-spinal cord projections. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanisms underlying nociception remain poorly understood. GPR30, as a membrane estrogen receptor, exerts modulatory effects on various physiological and pathological processes, including the development of neuropathic pain, within seconds to minutes <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup>. In this study, we observed significant upregulation of GPR30 expression in the SDH after CCI, underscoring its critical role in neuropathic pain development. To investigate this further, we employed a comprehensive approach, including transgenic mice models, behavioral assays, pharmacological interventions, chemogenetic methods, and electrophysiological studies. These experiments revealed that GPR30 plays an indispensable role in neuropathic pain, particularly through its regulation of AMPA-dependent EPSCs in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons, which are essential for pain signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GPR30 is crucial for the descending facilitation of pain signals via corticospinal direct projections. These findings collectively suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons may represent a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Estrogen has long been recognized as a key player in modulating nociception, with its drastic fluctuations notably impacting nociceptive thresholds<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup>. Our prior research demonstrated that moderate estrogen supplementation effectively mitigated hyperalgesia in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, however, excessive estrogen supplementation paradoxically exacerbated hyperalgesia<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup>. This discrepancy might stem from the fact that varying estrogen concentrations can differentially activate estrogen receptors, including nuclear receptors (ERα and ERβ) and membrane receptors (GPR30)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup>. Considering our findings that inhibiting spinal GPR30 does not alter the basal nociception in naïve mice, it appears that GPR30 may not be significantly activated by estrogen under normal conditions. Additionally, estrogen has long been implicated in modulating neuropathic pain. Intra-dorsal root ganglion (DRG) administration of estrogen in CCI rats has been shown to enhance mechanical and thermal pain in an ERα-dependent manner<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]</sup>. Conversely, estrogen supplementation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of CCI mice significantly alleviated neuropathic hyperalgesia in a GPR30-dependent manner<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]</sup>. These findings further underscore the distinct roles of different estrogen receptors in pain modulation.</p>
<p>GPR30 is widely expressed in the nervous system and exerts vital effects in nociceptive modulation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]</sup>. For example, the activation of GPR30 in DRG could aggravate the hyperalgesia in OVX mice, while inhibition of GPR30 relieved hyperalgesia<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]</sup>. Besides, the GPR30 expressed on GABAergic cells in rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) mediates the descending facilitation of nociception<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>. However, though GPR30 is also widely expressed in SDH<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]</sup>, still little is known about the functions as well as underlying mechanisms of spinal GPR30 in nociceptive modulation. Consistent with previous studies<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]</sup>, here we found that intrathecal injection of G-1 could dramatically induce mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in mice. To further explore whether spinal GPR30 is involved in pathological nociception, we subjected mice to CCI surgery to mimic neuropathic pain<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]</sup>. In accordance with our expectations, the inhibition of spinal GPR30 significantly reversed the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by CCI. Moreover, GPR30 has been reported to be involved in nociceptive sexual dimorphism. For example, the regulatory role of GPR30 in DRG in maintenance of hyperalgesia induced by repeated exposure of opioid only exists in female rats<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]</sup>. However, according to our results, spinal GPR30 modulated nociception in a sex-independent manner. We also found that GPR30 is indiscriminately expressed on the neurons of both sexes of mice, which might account for the sex-independent function of spinal GPR30 in nociceptive modulation. Consistent with our results, several studies also have confirmed that the spinal <italic>Gper1</italic> expression showed no significant difference between male and female mice<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]</sup>. What’s more, the fluctuation of estrogen failed to change the basic expression of spinal GPR30<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup>. These results further indicate that spinal GPR30 modulated nociception in a sex-independent manner.</p>
<p>The SDH is a major locus for the integration of peripheral sensory input and supraspinal modulation. Most peripheral nociceptive afferents project to the superficial laminae of the SDH which respond to the noxious stimulations, while low-threshold mechanoreceptors form synaptic contacts in the deep laminae which respond to innocuous stimulations<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]</sup>. However, under the condition of mechanical allodynia, innocuous stimulation might also activate more superficial nociceptive circuits and lead to painful perception, which might come from the circuit-based transformation in the SDH<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]</sup>. It should be noted that the spinal dorsal horn is composed of a large number of excitatory (75%) and inhibitory (25%) interneurons, as well as a small part of projection neurons which relay integrated information to various supraspinal regions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]</sup>. Excitatory interneurons have been confirmed to take a vital role in conveying mechanical allodynia according to the nature of injury<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</sup>. As a distinct type of excitatory interneurons mainly located in the deeper laminae of SDH, CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons are important for neuropathic injuries<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>. The inhibition of spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons could alleviate neuropathic mechanical allodynia to a great extent<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]</sup>. By the way, spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons also account for the thermal hyperalgesia<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>. However, little is known how CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons mediate the nociception. Combined with our results that GPR30 is widely expressed in spinal excitatory interneurons and involved in neuropathic pain modulation, we speculate that CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons might convey neuropathic hyperalgesia via GPR30. As expected, most CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons express GPR30 and knock-down of the <italic>Gper1</italic> in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons dramatically relieve the pain induced by CCI, thus indicating the vital role of GPR30 in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons mediating neuropathic pain. However, it should be noted that half of GPR30<sup>+</sup> neurons are not co-localized with CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons, and further studies are needed to explore the function of these GPR30<sup>+</sup>CCK<sup>-</sup> neurons in neuropathic pain.</p>
<p>Abnormal activation of neurons in SDH is one of the causes of hyperalgesia and the change of post synaptic currents is the vital factor influencing neuronal excitability<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]</sup>. Given this critical link between EPSCs and excitability, we measured excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and found an elevation of EPSCs amplitudes in spinal CCk<sup>+</sup> neurons after CCI, indicating the increased excitability of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons in CCI mice. Furthermore, the knock-down of <italic>Gper1</italic> in CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons could inhibit the increase of EPSCs amplitude induced by CCI. Together, these data illustrate that GPR30 take a vital role in activation of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons after nerve injury via promoting the enhancement of EPSCs. It should be noted that EPSCs are specifically produced by glutamatergic receptors expressed on post-synaptic membrane, including AMPA and NMDA receptors<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]</sup>. In our study, we confirmed that the selective activation of GPR30 by G-1 remarkedly enhanced the AMPA-current in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons, which might account for the increased excitability of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons in neuropathic pain. It should be noted that the IPSCs could also influence the excitability of neurons, however, the knockdown of Gper1 failed to change the IPSCs amplitude in CCI mice, suggesting that GPR30 did not take part in the inhibitory synaptic regulation.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence has mapped neural circuits from peripheral to central nervous system to illustrate the neural mechanisms of nociception<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]</sup>. In brief, pain is derived from the activation of peripheral nociceptors whose cell bodies lie in DRG, and then nociceptive signals are transduced to the SDH for preliminary regulation and finally projected to cerebral cortex via a series of brain region mediating nociception. Additionally, pain is also modulated by the descending modulatory pathways constituted of projections from ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG) to the RVM and then to the spinal cord which takes several steps<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]</sup>. However, A recent study has come up with the existence of long direct projections form S1 cortex to deep laminae of SDH and the vital role of S1-SDH projections in neuropathic pain<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>. Inhibition of S1-SDH projections attenuates neuropathic pain, while activation decreases pain thresholds in naive mice. We confirmed the existence of these direct projections and their postsynaptic targets’ critical role in neuropathic pain. Notably, these long projections specifically synapse within SDH deep laminae onto CCK⁺ neurons<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>.We also structurally verify that CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons receive direct projections from S1 cortex. Furthermore, we also found that the majority of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons receiving S1-SDH projections express GPR30, thus indicating an important role of GPR30 in descending modulation of S1-SDH. As expected, the knockdown of <italic>Gper1</italic> in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons dramatically alleviated the hyperalgesia induced by CCI. All these results further confirmed an important role of GPR30 in descending facilitation of neuropathic pain. However, since viral strategy only labeled a small fraction of post-synaptic CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons from S1 cortex and was insufficient to functionally manipulate these neurons, more efficient methods should be employed to verify the role of GPR30 expressed on S1-SDH post-synaptic CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons under neuropathic pain conditions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>GPR30 plays a critical role in the development of neuropathic pain, particularly within CCK+ neurons. Our research highlights GPR30’s essential function in enhancing AMPA-dependent EPSCs, which are crucial for the activation of CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons and the subsequent development of abnormal nociception under neuropathic conditions. Furthermore, GPR30 is pivotal in facilitating the descending projections via corticospinal projections, contributing to the propagation of neuropathic pain signals. These findings suggest that targeting GPR30 in spinal CCK<sup>+</sup> neurons could be a promising therapeutic strategy for neuropathic pain in clinic.</p>

<p>For intracranial injection, mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium solution (70 mg/kg per mice) and then secured in a stereotaxic frame (RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China). A middle scalp incision exposed the skull, and then a hole was drilled on the skull above the right S1 cortex to allow passage of a glass microelectrode filled with the virus. Viral injections were performed with the following coordinates of S1: 0.95∼1.15 mm from bregma, 1.4∼1.6 mm from midline, and 0.9∼1.1 mm ventral to skull. A volume of 300 nL virus was injected at 50 nL/min with calibrated glass microelectrodes by a microsyringe pump (#78-8710 KD Scientific, USA). After infusion, the micropipette was slowly removed after five minutes. For spinal cord injection, mice were anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium solution. The spinal cord could be visible between T12 and T13 vertebral spines following a middle incision along the lumbar vertebrae. With a stereotaxic frame, a glass microelectrode was inserted between L3-L4 spinal cord to a depth of −400 um below the dura, avoiding the posterior spinal arteries. With a stereotaxic injector, 500 nL of viral solution or CTB-555 (1% in PBS; BrainVTA, Wuhan, China) was slowly infused over a period of 5 minutes.

<title>Spinal slice preparation and whole-cell recording</title>
<p>Spinal slices were prepared as previously described<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]</sup>.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study investigates nerve-injury-induced allodynia by studying the role of a subpopulation of excitatory dorsal horn CCK+ neurons that express the estrogen receptor GPR30 and potentially modulate nociceptive sensitivity via direct inputs from primary somatosensory cortex. In this revised version, the authors addressed many of the critiques raised through added analyses that <bold>convincingly</bold> support the notion that spinal GPR30 neurons are indeed an excitatory subpopulation of CCK+ neurons that contribute to neuropathic pain. While evidence of a direct functional corticospinal projection to CCK+/GPR30+neurons is not fully demonstrated, this work will be of broad interest to researchers interested in the neural circuitry of pain.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Chen et al. investigate the role of the membrane estrogen receptor GPR30 in spinal mechanisms of neuropathic pain. Using a wide variety of techniques, they first provide convincing evidence that GPR30 expression is restricted to neurons within the spinal cord, and that GPR30 neurons are well-positioned to receive descending input from the primary sensory cortex (S1). In addition, the authors put their findings in the context the previous knowledge in the field, presenting evidence demonstrating that GRP30 is expressed in the majority of CCK-expressing spinal neurons. Overall, this manuscript furthers our understanding of neural circuity that underlies neuropathic pain and will be of broad interest to neuroscientists, especially those interested in somatosensation. Nevertheless, the manuscript would be strengthened by additional analyses and clarification of data that is currently presented.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present convincing evidence for expression of GPR30 in the spinal cord that is specific to spinal neurons. Similarly, complementary approaches including pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of GPR30 are used to demonstrate a role for the receptor in driving nerve injury-induced pain in rodent models.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although steps were taken to put their data into the broader context of what is already known about the spinal circuitry of pain, more considerations and analyses would help the authors better achieve their goal. For instance, to determine whether GPR30 is expressed in excitatory or inhibitory neurons, more selective markers for these subtypes should be used over CamK2. Moreover, quantitative analysis of the extent of overlap between GPR30+ and CCK+ spinal neurons is needed to understand the potential heterogeneity of the GPR30 spinal neuron population, and to interpret experiments characterizing descending SI inputs onto GPR30 and CCK spinal neurons. Filling these gaps in knowledge would make their findings more solid.</p>
<p>Revised Manuscript Update:</p>
<p>In their revised manuscript, Chen et al. have added additional data that establishes GPR30 spinal neurons as a population of excitatory neurons, half of which express CCK. These data help to position GPR30 neurons in the existing framework of spinal neuron populations that contribute to neuropathic pain, strengthening the author's findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that a population of CCK+ spinal neurons in the deep dorsal horn express the G protein coupled estrogen receptor GPR30 to modulate pain sensitivity in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in mice. Using complementary pharmacological and genetic knockdown experiments they convincingly show that GPR30 inhibition or knockdown reverses mechanical, tactile and thermal hypersensitivity, conditioned place aversion, and c-fos staining in the spinal dorsal horn after CCI. They propose that GPR30 mediates an increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors after CCI using slice electrophysiology which may underlie the increased behavioral sensitivity. They then use anterograde tracing approaches to show that CCK and GPR30 positive neurons in the deep dorsal horn may receive direct connections from primary somatosensory cortex. Chemogenetic activation of these dorsal horn neurons proposed to be connected to S1 increased nociceptive sensitivity in a GPR30 dependent manner. Overall, the data are very convincing and the experiments are well conducted and adequately controlled. However, the proposed model of descending corticospinal facilitation of nociceptive sensitivity through GPR30 in a population of CCK+ neurons in the dorsal horn is not fully supported.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are very well executed and adequately controlled throughout the manuscript. The data are nicely presented and supportive of a role for GPR30 signaling in the spinal dorsal horn influencing nociceptive sensitivity following CCI. The authors also did an excellent job of using complementary approaches to rigorously test their hypothesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The primary weakness in this manuscript involves overextending the interpretations of the data to still propose a role for corticospinal descending facilitation. While the viral tracing demonstrates a potential connection between S1 and CCK+ or GPR30+ spinal neurons, no direct evidence is provided for S1 in facilitating any activity of these neurons in the dorsal horn.</p>
<p>Comments on the latest version:</p>
<p>The authors did an excellent job addressing many of the critiques raised. Despite acknowledging that a direct functional corticospinal projection to CCK/GPR30+neurons is not supported by the data and revising the title, these claims still persist throughout the manuscript. Manipulating gene expression or the activity of postsynaptic neurons through a trans-synaptic labeling strategy does not directly support any claim that those upstream neurons are directly modulating spinal neurons through the proposed pathway. Indeed they might, but that is not demonstrated here.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your constructive feedback.</p>
<p>In response to your suggestion, we have used more specific markers to distinguish excitatory (VGLUT2) and inhibitory (VGAT) neurons via in situ hybridization. These analyses revealed that GPR30 is predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons of the superficial dorsal horn (SDH), as presented in the Results section (lines 117-120) and in Figure 2A-B.</p>
<p>Additionally, we performed a quantitative analysis to determine the extent of co-localization between GPR30+ and CCK+ neurons. The data were included in the Results (lines 131–132) and Figure 2G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Using a variety of experimental manipulations, the authors show that the membrane estrogen receptor G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) expressed in CCK+ excitatory spinal interneurons plays a major role in the pain symptoms observed in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. Intrathecal application of selective GPR30 agonist G-1 induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in male and female mice. Downregulation of GPR30 in CCK+ interneurons prevented the development of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity during CCI. They also show the up modulation of AMPA receptor expression by GPR30.</p>
<p>Generally, the conclusions are supported by the experimental results. I also would like to see significant improvements in the writing and the description of results.</p>
<p>Methodological details for some of the techniques are rather sparse. For example, when examining the co-localization of various markers, the authors do not indicate the number of animals/sections examined. Similarly, when examining the effect of shGper1, it is unclear how many cells/sections/animals were counted and analyzed.</p>
<p>In other sections, there is no description of the concentration of drugs used (for example, Figure 4H). In Figures 4C-E, there is no indication of the duration of the recordings, the ionic conditions, the effect of glutamate receptor blockers, etc</p>
<p>Some results appear anecdotal in the way they are described. For example, in Figure 5, it is unclear how many times this experiment was repeated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate your valuable feedback and thoughtful recommendations.</p>
<p>To address your concerns regarding methodological transparency, we have added the following details to the revised manuscript:</p>
<p>The number of animals and sections analyzed in co-localization studies.</p>
<p>The number of cells/sections/animals used in each quantification following shGper1 treatment.</p>
<p>The concentrations of drugs administered (e.g., in Figure 4H).</p>
<p>Detailed recording conditions, including duration, ionic composition, and pharmacological conditions (Figures 4C-E).</p>
<p>In addition, we have thoroughly revised the writing throughout the manuscript to enhance clarity and precision in the description of our findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that a population of CCK+ spinal neurons in the deep dorsal horn express the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30 to modulate pain sensitivity in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in mice. Using complementary pharmacological and genetic knockdown experiments they convincingly show that GPR30 inhibition or knockdown reverses mechanical, tactile, and thermal hypersensitivity, conditioned place aversion, and c-fos staining in the spinal dorsal horn after CCI. They propose that GPR30 mediates an increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors after CCI using slice electrophysiology which may underlie the increased behavioral sensitivity. They then use anterograde tracing approaches to show that CCK and GPR30 positive neurons in the deep dorsal horn may receive direct connections from the primary somatosensory cortex. Chemogenetic activation of these dorsal horn neurons proposed to be connected to S1 increased nociceptive sensitivity in a GPR30-dependent manner. Overall, the data are very convincing and the experiments are well conducted and adequately controlled. However, the proposed model of descending corticospinal facilitation of nociceptive sensitivity through GPR30 in a population of CCK+ neurons in the dorsal horn is not fully supported.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are very well executed and adequately controlled throughout the manuscript. The data are nicely presented and supportive of a role for GPR30 signaling in the spinal dorsal horn influencing nociceptive sensitivity following CCI. The authors also did an excellent job of using complementary approaches to rigorously test their hypothesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The primary weakness in this manuscript involves overextending the interpretations of the data to propose a direct link between corticospinal projections signaling through GPR30 on this CCK+ population of spinal dorsal horn neurons. For example, even in the cropped images presented, GPR30 is present in many other CCK-negative neurons. Only about a quarter of the cells labeled by the anterograde viral tracing experiment from S1 are CCK+. Since no direct evidence is provided for S1 signaling through GPR30, this conclusion should be revised.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your encouraging comments and critical insights.</p>
<p>We fully acknowledge the concern regarding the proposed direct involvement of corticospinal projections in modulating nociceptive behavior via GPR30 in CCK+ neurons. While our anterograde tracing experiments suggest anatomical overlap, we agree that definitive evidence of functional connectivity is lacking.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we have revised the Abstract, Discussion, and Graphical Abstract to present our findings more cautiously. We now describe our observations as indicating that S1 projections potentially interact with GPR30<sup>+</sup> spinal neurons, rather than asserting a definitive functional link.</p>
<p>To support this revised interpretation, we performed additional quantitative analyses examining the co-localization among S1 projections, CCK+, and GPR30+ neurons. Furthermore, we clarified that the chemogenetic activation studies targeted a mixed neuronal population and did not exclusively manipulate CCK+ neurons.</p>
<p>These changes aim to better align our conclusions with the presented data and provide a more nuanced framework for future investigations.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major corrections</p>
<p>(1) Figure 2: The authors conclude that GPR30 is mainly expressed in excitatory spinal neurons because they are labeled by a virus with a Camk2 promoter. While there is evidence that Camk2 is specific to excitatory neurons in the brain, based on RNAseq datasets (e.g. Linnarsson Lab, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mousebrain.org/adolescent/genesearch.html">http://mousebrain.org/adolescent/genesearch.html</ext-link> ) this is less clear cut within the spinal cord. A more direct way to assess the relative expression of GPR30 in excitatory versus inhibitory neurons would be to perform immunohistochemistry or FISH with GPR30/Vglut2/Vgat.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if this observation is not crucial for the overall arch of the story, I recommend the authors eliminate these data, as they do not support the idea that GPR30 is mainly in excitatory neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important limitation. To strengthen our conclusion regarding the neuronal identity of GPR30-expressing cells, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using vGluT2 (marker for excitatory neurons) and VGAT (marker for inhibitory neurons). The results confirmed that GPR30 is predominantly expressed in vGluT2-positive excitatory neurons within the spinal cord. These new data are presented in the revised manuscript (lines 117-120) and shown in Figure 2A-B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) (2a) Figure 2: The authors also report that GPR30 is expressed in most CCK+ spinal neurons. A more rigorous way to present the data would be to perform quantification and report the % of CCK neurons that are GPR30.</p>
<p>(2b) More importantly, it is unclear what % of GPR30 neurons are CCK+. These types of quantifications would provide useful insights into the heterogeneity of CCK and GPR30 neuron populations, and help align findings of experiments using the behavioral pharmacology using GRP antagonists to the knockdown of Gper1 in CCK spinal neurons - for instance, does a population of GRP30+/CCK- neurons exist? If so, it would be worth discussing what role (if any) that population might play in nerve injury-induced mechanical allodynia.</p>
<p>Understanding the breakdown of GPR30 populations becomes even more relevant when the authors characterize which cell types are targeted by descending projections from S1. It is clear that the vast majority of CCK+ neurons that receive descending input from S1 neurons are GPR30+, but there are many other GPR30+ neurons that do not receive input from SI neurons presented in 5M. Is this simply because only a small fraction of CCK+/GPR30+ neurons are targeted by descending S1 projections, or could they represent a distinct population of GPR30 neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(2a) We appreciate the suggestion. Quantification showed that approximately 90% of CCK⁺ neurons express GPR30, and about 50% of GPR30⁺ neurons co-express CCK. These data are now provided in the revised Results (lines 131-132) and in Figure 2F-G.</p>
<p>(2b) Indeed, our data reveal that a substantial portion of GPR30⁺ neurons do not co-express CCK. While this study focuses on GPR30 function in CCK⁺ neurons, we recognize the potential relevance of GPR30⁺/CCK⁻ populations. We have addressed this point in the Discussion (lines 303-306):</p>
<p>“However, it should be noted that half of GPR30⁺ neurons are not co-localized with CCK⁺ neurons, and further studies are needed to explore the function of these GPR30⁺/CCK⁻ neurons in neuropathic pain.”</p>
<p>Regarding descending input, our data in Figure 5 show that S1 projections selectively innervate a subset (~30%) of CCK⁺ neurons, most of which co-express GPR30. This suggests that S1-targeted CCK⁺/GPR30⁺ neurons may represent a functionally distinct population. We have added clarification to the revised manuscript, while acknowledging that further studies are needed to elucidate the roles of non-targeted GPR30⁺ neurons.</p>

<p>(3) Throughout the manuscript both male and female mice were used in experiments. Rather than referring to male and female mice as different genders, it would be more appropriate to describe them as different sexes.</p>

<p>(3) Line 169-170, reads &quot;Known that EPSCs are mediated by glutamatergic receptors like AMPA receptors and several studies have been reported the relationship between GPR30 and AMPA receptor25,29&quot;. Rewriting the sentence such that it better describes what the known relationship is between GPR30 and AMPA would be helpful in setting up the rationale of the experiment in Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have rewritten this section to better clarify the rationale behind the electrophysiological experiments (lines 161-164):</p>
<p>“Given that EPSCs are primarily mediated through glutamatergic receptors such as AMPA receptors, and emerging evidence suggesting that GPR30 enhances excitatory transmission by promoting clustering of glutamatergic receptor subunits, we examined whether GPR30 modulates EPSCs via AMPA receptor-dependent mechanisms.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 198-199 &quot;Then we explored the possible connections among GPR30, S1-SDH projections and CCK+ neuron.&quot; In the context of spinal circuitry, &quot;connections&quot; may raise the expectation that synaptic connectivity will be evaluated. What I think best describes what the authors investigated in Figure 5 is the &quot;relationship&quot; between GPR30, S1-SDH projections, and CCK+ neurons.</p>

<p>We have revised the sentence accordingly (lines 184-186):</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Can the authors provide more detail about the distribution of CCK+ cells in the spinal cord and, in particular, the localization of double-stained (CCK/cfos) neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To better characterize the distribution of CCK⁺ neurons within the spinal dorsal horn (SDH), we performed immunostaining in CCK-tdTomato mice using lamina-specific markers: CGRP (lamina I), IB4 (lamina II), and NF200 (lamina III–V). Our results demonstrate that CCK⁺ neurons are primarily localized in the deeper laminae of the SDH. These findings are now described in the revised Results (lines 126–129) and shown in Figure 2E.</p>
<p>In addition, we conducted c-Fos immunostaining in CCK-Ai14 mice and found increased activation of CCK⁺ neurons following CCI. This supports the involvement of CCK⁺ neurons in neuropathic pain. These data are included in the Results (lines 129–131) and Supplementary Figure S4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 2A. There is no formal quantification of the percentage of TdTomato+ neurons that are also CCK+. The description of these results is insufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this point and have revised the description of Figure 2A accordingly. To strengthen our analysis, we conducted additional FISH experiments with vGluT2 and VGAT probes. Quantification revealed that GPR30 is predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons (approximately 60%). These data are shown in the revised Results (lines 117-119) and Figures 2A-B and S3. This supports our conclusion that GPR30 is largely localized to excitatory spinal interneurons.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 4H. What is the evidence that these are AMPA-mediated currents? This is not explained in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this point. We now provide detailed experimental procedures to clarify that the recorded EPSCs are AMPA receptor–mediated. Specifically, spinal slices from CCK-Cre mice were used, and excitatory postsynaptic currents were recorded in the presence of APV (100 μM, NMDA receptor blocker), bicuculline (20 μM, GABA_A receptor blocker), and strychnine (0.5 μM, glycine receptor blocker), ensuring that the observed currents were AMPA-dependent.

<p>(4) What is the signaling mechanism leading to a larger amplitude of currents after G-1 infusion?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important question. G-1 is a selective agonist for GPR30. Based on previous studies by Luo et al. (2016), we speculate that activation of GPR30 may increase the clustering of glutamatergic receptor subunits at postsynaptic sites, thereby enhancing AMPA receptor-mediated currents. While our current study did not directly address the intracellular signaling cascade, we have incorporated this mechanistic speculation in the Discussion.</p>

<p>(6) Line 198. What is the evidence that AAV2/1 EF1α FLP is an antegrade trans monosynaptic marker?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for this request. AAV2/1 has been widely used for anterograde monosynaptic tracing based on its properties (Wang et al., Nat Neurosci 2024; Wu et al., Neurosci Bull 2021): (1) it infects neurons at the injection site and undergoes active anterograde transport; (2) newly assembled viral particles are released at synapses and infect postsynaptic partners; (3) in the absence of helper viruses, the spread halts at the first synapse, ensuring monosynaptic restriction. We have elaborated on this in the revised manuscript (line 198), citing Wang et al. (Nat Neurosci 2024) and Wu et al. (Neurosci Bull 2021).</p>

<p>(7) Figure 5G. I do not understand the logic of this experiment. A Cre AAV is injected in the S1 cortex. Why should this lead to the expression of tdTomato on a downstream (postsynaptic?) neuron? The authors should quote the literature that supports this anterograde transsynaptic transport.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this question. As described in previous studies (e.g., Wu et al., Neurosci Bull 2021), AAV2/1-Cre injected into the S1 cortex leads to Cre expression in projection targets due to transsynaptic anterograde transport. Subsequent injection of a Cre-dependent AAV (AAV2/9-DIO-mCherry) into the spinal cord enables specific labeling of postsynaptic neurons that receive input from S1. We have clarified this mechanism in line 206 and provided the appropriate citation.</p>

<p>(9) Line 257. How do the authors envision that estrogen would change its modulation of GPR30 under basal and neuropathic conditions? Is there any evidence for this speculation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this thoughtful question. In the current study, we focused on pharmacologically manipulating GPR30 activity via its selective agonist and antagonist. We did not directly investigate how endogenous estrogen regulates GPR30 under physiological and neuropathic states. We have recognized this limitation and highlighted the need for future research to investigate this regulatory mechanism.</p>

<p>(10-20) In my opinion, the entire manuscript needs a careful revision of the English language. While one can follow the text, it contains numerous grammatical and syntactic errors that make the reading far from enjoyable. I am highlighting just a few of the many errors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s honest assessment. The manuscript has undergone thorough language editing by a native English speaker to correct grammatical errors, improve clarity, and enhance overall readability. We also restructured several sections, particularly the Discussion, to improve logical flow.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(21) The discussion of results is a bit disorganized, with disconnected sentences and statements, and somewhat repetitive. For example, lines 303 to 306 lack adequate flow. It is also quite long and includes general statements that add little to the discussion of the new findings (lines 326-333).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have revised the Discussion extensively. Disconnected or repetitive sentences (e.g., lines 303-306, 326-333) have been removed or rewritten. For instance, we added a new transitional paragraph (lines 307-311) to improve flow:</p>
<p>“Abnormal activation of neurons in the SDH is a key contributor to hyperalgesia, and enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission is a major mechanism driving increased neuronal excitability. Therefore, we evaluated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and observed increased amplitudes in CCK⁺ neurons following CCI, suggesting elevated excitability in these neurons.”</p>
<p>We also removed redundant generalizations to maintain a focused discussion of our novel findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) What is the distribution of GPR30 throughout the spinal cord and DRG? The authors demonstrate that this can overlap with a CCK+ population, but there are many GPR30+ and CCK negative neurons, even in the cropped images presented. It would be helpful to quantify the colocalization with CCK.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. As shown in the revised manuscript, GPR30 is expressed in both the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). However, our updated data (Figure 1B) demonstrate that Gper1 mRNA levels in the DRG are not significantly altered after CCI, suggesting a limited involvement of DRG GPR30 in neuropathic pain. These results are described in the revised Results (line 94).</p>
<p>Regarding spinal co-expression, we performed a detailed quantification. Approximately 90% of CCK⁺ neurons express GPR30, while about 50% of GPR30⁺ neurons are CCK⁺. These co-localization results are now included in the revised Results and presented in Figure 2G.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It is clear that CCI and GPR30 influence excitatory synaptic transmission in CCK+ neurons. However, these experiments do not fully support the authors' claims of a postsynaptic upregulation of AMPARs. Comparing amplitudes and frequencies of spontaneous EPSCs cannot necessarily distinguish a pre- vs postsynaptic change since some of these EPSCs can arise from spontaneous action potential firing. I suggest revising this conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate these insightful comments. We fully agree that our data from spontaneous EPSC recordings (sEPSCs) in CCK⁺ neurons are not sufficient to distinguish between pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms, as sEPSCs may include spontaneous presynaptic activity. Therefore, we have revised the text throughout the manuscript to avoid overstating conclusions related to postsynaptic AMPA receptor upregulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) What is the rationale for the evoked EPSC experiments from electrical stimulation in &quot;the deep laminae of SDH?&quot; I do not think that this experiment can rule out a presynaptic contribution of GPR30 to the evoked responses, particularly if these are Gs-coupled at presynaptic terminals. Paired-pulse stimulations could help answer this question, otherwise, alternative interpretations, also related to the point above, should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful critique. Indeed, electrical stimulation of the deep SDH laminae does not exclude presynaptic involvement, especially considering that GPR30 is a G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) and could act presynaptically. We agree that paired-pulse ratio (PPR) analysis would be more informative in distinguishing pre- from postsynaptic effects, but this was not performed due to technical limitations in our current experimental setup.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we have revised our interpretations in both the Results and Discussion to acknowledge that our data do not rule out presynaptic contributions. We now state that GPR30 activation enhances EPSCs in CCK⁺ neurons, while further studies are needed to dissect the precise site of action.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) I appreciate the challenging nature of the trans-synaptic viral labeling approaches, but the chemogenetic and Gper knockdown experiments do not selectively target this CCK+ population of deep dorsal horn neurons. The data are clear that each of these components (descending corticospinal projections, CCK neurons, and GPR30) can modulate nociceptive hypersensitivity, but I do not agree with the overall conclusion that each of are directly linked as the authors propose. I recommend revising the overall conclusion and title to reflect the convincing data presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this critical observation. We agree that while our data show functional roles for descending cortical input, CCK⁺ neurons, and GPR30 in modulating pain hypersensitivity, the evidence does not establish a definitive direct circuit integrating all three components.</p>
<p>In response, we have revised our conclusions to reflect this limitation. Specifically, we avoided claiming a direct functional link among S1 projections, CCK⁺ neurons, and GPR30. Instead, we now propose that GPR30 modulates neuropathic pain primarily through its action in CCK⁺ spinal neurons, with potential involvement of descending facilitation from the somatosensory cortex.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have revised the manuscript title to better reflect our mechanistic focus:</p>
<p>
“GPR30 in spinal CCK-positive neurons modulates neuropathic pain.”</p>
