<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Metabolic capacity can vary substantially within a bacterial species, leading to ecological niche separation, as well as differences in virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility. Genome-scale metabolic models are useful tools for studying the metabolic potential of individuals, and with the rapid expansion of genomic sequencing there is a wealth of data that can be leveraged for comparative analysis. However, there exist few tools to construct strain-specific metabolic models at scale.</p>
<p>Here we describe Bactabolize (github.com/kelwyres/Bactabolize), a reference-based tool which rapidly produces strain-specific metabolic models and growth phenotype predictions. We describe a pan reference model for the priority antimicrobial-resistant pathogen, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (github.com/kelwyres/KpSC-pan-metabolic-model), and a quality control framework for using draft genome assemblies as input for Bactabolize.</p>
<p>The Bactabolize-derived model for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> reference strain KPPR1 performed comparatively or better than currently available automated approaches CarveMe and gapseq across 507 substrate and 2317 knockout mutant growth predictions. Novel draft genomes passing our systematically-defined quality control criteria resulted in models with a high degree of completeness (≥99% genes and reactions captured compared to models derived from matched complete genomes) and high accuracy (mean 0.97, n=10).</p>
<p>We anticipate the tools and framework described herein will facilitate large-scale metabolic modelling analyses that broaden our understanding of diversity within bacterial species and inform novel control strategies for priority pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacteria exhibit metabolic diversity and can utilise a broad range of substrates for growth. It has become clear amongst pathogens that there is an intertwined relationship between metabolism and nutrient usage with virulence and antimicrobial resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Comparative analyses of metabolic profiles (e.g. substrate usage) are key to fully understanding these relationships. Traditionally, these profiles have been assessed via phenotypic growth on a limited number of substrates, such as those used to delineate between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) which form the basis of a number of commercial products for species identification. However, these methods are not sufficiently discriminatory for in-depth comparisons within species, and alternative approaches such as the Omnilog Phenotype MicroArray system (Biolog) are too expensive and/or labour intensive for application to large numbers of isolates. Similarly, probing of essential metabolism-associated genes via transposon mutant libraries (e.g. to identify novel virulence factors and therapeutic targets) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) cannot be easily scaled across diverse bacterial populations.</p>
<p>Genome-scale metabolic models or metabolic reconstructions are a computational approach to analysing the metabolic potential of an organism, within which the entire biochemical network is represented as a stoichiometric matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Metabolic models are constructed programmatically, but typically informed and at least partially validated using phenotypic growth data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Once constructed, they can be run through simulations and analysed under various contexts, such as <italic>in silico</italic> growth experiments (Flux Balance Analysis [FBA]) to predict substrate usage profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), evaluate the impact of single gene knockouts on growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and identify metabolic chokepoints for drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), among others. Traditionally, metabolic models are strain-specific (i.e. each model represents a unique individual <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models">http://bigg.ucsd.edu/models</ext-link>) and may not be applicable to other isolates due to unrepresented genetic diversity.</p>
<p>We recently described 37 curated strain-specific models for the <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> Species Complex (<italic>Kp</italic>SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) comprised of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and its close relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). These organisms are a common cause of healthcare-associated infections world-wide, and among the World Health Organization’s priority antimicrobial resistant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). <italic>Kp</italic>SC are highly diverse and gene content can differ substantially between strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Accordingly, our models varied in terms of gene and reaction content, resulting in variable growth substrate usage profiles and metabolic redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Similar variation has also been described in other key bacterial pathogens e.g. <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)<italic>, Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). This is highly relevant to the use of metabolic models for the exploration of virulence and antimicrobial resistance, and for the identification of novel drug targets. Therefore, such works should seek to include multiple strain-specific models, and in some cases 100s-1000s of models may be required to accurately represent population diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several open source tools currently available that can rapidly produce strain-specific metabolic models, including CarveMe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), gapseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), ModelSEED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and KBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) (see the recent review by Mendoza and colleagues for comparative descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>)), as well as a recently published modelling and analysis pipeline, ChiMera, which leverages CarveMe for model construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In their systematic analysis Mendoza <italic>et al.</italic> indicated CarveMe and ModelSEED to be of particular interest for large-scale studies due to their speed and model quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) (note that gapseq was published later and therefore not included in this review). KBase implements ModelSEED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) as a web interface application, limiting its utility for high-throughput analysis of 100s – 1000s of bacterial genomes. CarveMe is a command line application; it is open source but is dependent on commercial solvers such as CPLEX (free for academic use). However, its use of a universal reference model may limit specificity of strain-specific models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and result in overestimation of model genes. These limitations can be overcome by manual curation of the output models, but such curation is highly labour intensive and not suitable for high-throughput analyses. Furthermore, the CarveMe database (BiGG universal_model) appears to be no longer actively maintained, meaning that there is no opportunity to integrate novel structural and/or biochemical data as these become available in the literature (as discussed in COBRA community forums). gapseq is a recently published command line tool which leverages an independent universal database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In their comparative analyses, the gapseq authors demonstrate superior accuracy to both CarveME and ModelSEED; however the concerns about the specificity of universal models remain and it has been reported that model construction takes considerable time (several hours in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>)).</p>
<p>Here, we present Bactabolize (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kelwyres/Bactabolize">https://github.com/kelwyres/Bactabolize</ext-link>), an easy-to-use tool which allows scalable production of strain-specific draft metabolic models and prediction of growth phenotypes in under three minutes per input genome. Bactabolize builds upon the reference-based model reconstruction approach described by Norsigian <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), leveraging the COBRApy framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and BiGG nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). We present a pan-metabolic reference model for the <italic>Kp</italic>SC (derived from our 37 curated strain-specific models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)), and describe an exemplar quality control framework for the application of Bactabolize to <italic>Kp</italic>SC draft genome assemblies. We show that Bactabolize can rapidly produce strain-specific models from draft genomes with a high degree of completeness (as compared to models generated from completed genome assemblies), resulting in highly accurate growth predictions that match or exceed the accuracy of models from CarveMe and manual curation efforts.</p>

<title>Description of Bactabolize</title>
<p>Bactabolize is written in Python 3 and utilises the metabolic modelling library COBRApy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Bactabolize has four main commands:
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><label>i)</label><p>Draft model generation (<italic>draft_model</italic> command), which generates a strain-specific draft metabolic reconstruction (‘model’) using the approach outlined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and uses gap-filling to identify any missing reactions required to simulate growth in the user-specified conditions</p></list-item>
<list-item><label>ii)</label><p>Patching incomplete models (<italic>patch_model</italic> command) by the addition of missing reactions e.g. those identified by the automated gap-filling process</p></list-item>

<caption><p>Simplified overview of Bactabolize’s main commands. In pink is the <italic>draft_model</italic> command, which builds a draft strain-specific metabolic model using an input reference model and an input target assembly (approach adapted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)). If the model fails to simulate growth, Bactabolize will attempt automated gap-filling and produce a model patch file. The <italic>patch_model</italic> command (orange) allows the addition of missing reactions to produce a valid draft model that can simulate growth in a user-specified growth environment. A functioning model can be passed to the <italic>fba</italic> command (yellow), which performs Flux Balance Analysis to simulate growth in the user specified conditions, across all carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur metabolite sources supported by the model under aerobic and anerobic conditions. The <italic>sgk</italic> command (blue) shows the Single Gene Knockout analysis, which outputs a predicted phenotype. User inputs and outputs are shown in white boxes while Bactabolize commands are shown inside the grey box.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Additional processing scripts are provided alongside Bactabolize to improve model metadata annotation (improve_model_annotations.py), convert models generated using KBase and ModelSEED to Bactabolize/BiGG-compatible format (SEED_to_BiGG_model_convert.sh), generate network graph files from models (model_to_network_graph.py) and merging output FBA profiles (merge_fba_profiles_longtable.sh). Full documentation, including example code and test data are available at the Bactabolize code repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kelwyres/Bactabolize">https://github.com/kelwyres/Bactabolize</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For draft model construction, Bactabolize requires users to provide an input assembly (annotated or unannotated FASTA or Genbank format respectively), a reference model (JSON format) and the corresponding reference sequence data (gene and protein sequences in two separate multi-fasta files or a single Genbank annotation in a .gbk file) (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref></bold>). For optimum results we suggest using a pan-model that captures as much diversity as possible for the target species or group of interest, because Bactabolize’s reconstruction method is reductive i.e. each output strain-specific model will include only genes, reactions and metabolites that are present in the reference or a subset thereof (although novel genes, reactions and metabolites can be added via manual curation).</p>
<p>If the input assembly is unannotated, Bactabolize will identify coding sequences using Prodigal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) but will otherwise honour the existing coding sequence (CDS) notations and optionally use Prodigal to search for additional CDS. Draft genome-scale metabolic models are output in both SMBL v3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) and JSON formats (one pair of files for each independent strain-specific model), along with an optional MEMOTE quality report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Bactabolize will identify orthologs in the input genome(s) compared to the reference sequence data using Bi-directional BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) Best Hits (BBH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) using BLAST+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Users can parameterise the ortholog finding settings (coverage and identity thresholds) for BBH. Alternatively, there is the option of using protein similarity to identify orthologs instead of identity.</p>
<p>Once a draft model has been constructed, it is validated via a simulated growth experiment on user-input choice of media and atmosphere (aerobic or anerobic).

If the model fails to simulate growth, gap-filling is performed to indicate missing reactions. Users can add these reactions to a patch JSON file and optionally use the <italic>patch_model</italic> command to correct the model (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>). Bactabolize uses a conservative gap-filling approach that only adds the minimum number of reactions to enable growth under the chosen conditions. We recommend testing the models in minimal media and atmosphere expected to support growth for all isolates of the species of interest, unless the user has access to matched phenotypic data demonstrating growth for individual isolates in specific conditions. Aggressive gap-filling will effectively homogenise the models and should be avoided if the goal is to understand the underlying strain diversity.</p>
<p>Substrate usage analysis (the <italic>fba</italic> command) is performed iteratively for each possible carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphor substrate supported by the model(s) (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold>), by replacing the default substrate in the user specified growth medium (specified in the fba_spec JSON file). For example, in M9 media the default substrates are glucose (carbon), ammonia (nitrogen), sulphate (sulfur) and phosphate (phosphor). Each substrate can be tested in aerobic and/or anaerobic conditions. Growth prediction output is recorded in a tab delimited file (one per strain). The merge_fba_profiles_longtable.sh helper script will combine the outputs for multiple strains into a single file for downstream analysis.</p>
<p>The growth impacts of single-gene knockout mutations can be simulated via the <italic>sgk</italic> command (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref></bold>). Bactabolize will iterate through every gene in the model, temporarily removing it and its associated reactions (unless they are also associated with another gene) and running FBA to simulate growth in the user-specified conditions. The output is comparable to single-gene knockout studies such as transposon mutagenesis and can be used to probe gene essentiality.</p>

<p>We constructed a species complex-specific pan-metabolic reference model by combining a collection of 37 manually curated models for which we have previously demonstrated high accuracy (range 88.3%–96.8% for prediction of 94 distinct growth phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)).

<title>Performance comparison</title>
<p>We compared the output and performance of Bactabolize to the two previously published tools that can support high-throughput analyses i.e. CarveMe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) and gapseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). To aid interpretation in the context of community standard approaches, we also include a comparison to the popular web-based reconstruction tool, KBase (ModelSEED), and a manually curated metabolic reconstruction of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> strain KPPR1 (also known as VK055 and ATCC 43816, metabolic model named iKp1289) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). This isolate was chosen as there is a completed genome sequence (Genbank accession: CP009208), single-source growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and single-gene knockout growth essentiality data available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> draft models for strain KPPR1 were built using; i) Bactabolize with the <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan v1 reference; ii) CarveMe, with its universal reference model (CarveMe universal); iii) CarveMe, with <italic>Kp</italic>SC-pan v1 reference (CarveMe <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan); iv) gapseq; and v) KBase (ModelSEED). Importantly, neither <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> KPPR1 nor its genetic lineage (7 gene multi-locus sequence type, ST493), are represented in the <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan-reference model, meaning these benchmarking comparisons were on equal footing. Subsequently, each model was used to predict growth phenotypes; i) in M9 minimal media with different sole sources of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur; and ii) for all possible single gene knockouts in LB under aerobic conditions. The predicted phenotypes were compared directly to the published phenotype data.</p>
<p>Among the high-throughput approaches, the Bactabolize draft model captured fewer genes and reactions (n = 1233 and 2307, respectively) than the gapseq (n = 1489 and 3186, respectively) and CarveMe universal models (n = 1960 and 2857, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). The Bactabolize and CarveMe universal models contained similar numbers of metabolites (1696 vs 1737, respectively), while the gapseq model contained many more (n = 2519). Notably, the initial gapseq model was gap-filled by simulation of growth in M9 minimal media with glucose (consistent with Bactabolize and CarveMe media recipes), which resulted in the addition of 31 reactions to the draft model. This is in contrast to CarveMe and Bactabolize-generated models which produced biomass in M9 minimal media plus glucose without additional gap-filling. The CarveMe <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan model captured considerably more genes than any of the other models (n = 2407), but these were associated with many fewer unique reactions and metabolites (1206 and 825, respectively). Upon further investigation we determined that this method resulted in the over prescription of gene reaction rules (GPRs) to multiple reactions (mean 2.2 GPRs per reaction when compared to Bactabolize using the same pan reference model: 1.94 GPRs per reaction.</p>

<p><bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5</xref></bold> and <bold>S6</bold> show the overlaps of metabolites and reactions between the high-throughput reconstruction methods after processing with MetaNetX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) to standardise the reaction and metabolite nomenclatures (excluding CarveMe pan for simplicity and given the likely problems of reaction oversubscription). The majority of the reactions included in the Bactabolize model were conserved in either the CarveMe universal model (n = 1225, 53.2%), gapseq model (n = 54, 2.3%) or both (n = 665, 28.9%). The reaction overlap was skewed to the CarveMe universal model which shared 1225 reactions that were conserved in the Bactabolize model but absent from the gapseq model. Notably, the gapseq model contained a large number (2200) of unique reactions (70.4% of those in the model). Similarly, the vast majority of metabolites in the Bactabolize model were conserved in one or both of the other models (n = 917, 85.6%). However, it is likely that true overlaps between methods are underrepresented due to the different reaction identifiers and chemical synonyms used within the BiGG (Bactabolize, CarveMe) vs ModelSEED nomenclatures (gapseq), which are difficult to harmonise in an automated manner even after the application of MetaNetX.</p>
<p>In comparison to the low-throughput reconstruction approaches, the Bactabolize model contained a similar number of genes, reactions and metabolites to the manually curated model (n = 1289, 2484 and 1827, respectively) and many more than the KBase model (72, 544 and 534, respectively). This is likely due to the low number of metabolism-associated genes identified by KBase, which has impacted the associated reaction and metabolite data.</p>
<p>MEMOTE scores, (produced by the MEMOTE report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>)) indicate the quality of the model metadata annotations, with the scores ranging between 0 – 100%. These provide a measure of model portability and the level of connected databases available to support the metabolite, reaction and genetic information represented in the model, but bear no reflection on model accuracy. Bactabolize performs on the lower end, with CarveMe universal and gapseq performing the best (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). The KBase model appears to perform well in this regard, however this is due to the low number of genes, reactions and metabolites included in the model. Bactabolize using the <italic>Kp</italic>SC-pan model outperforms the model propagation mode of CarveMe using the same reference model (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Work is ongoing to improve the metadata annotations in the <italic>Kp</italic>SC-pan reference model, to support large-scale model propagation.</p>
<p>We assessed the performance of each model for <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of growth phenotypes compared to the previously published experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 scores were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Note that the specific set of growth substrates and gene knockouts that can be simulated is determined by the sets of genes and metabolites captured by each model and is therefore model-dependent (<bold>Data S1 and S2</bold>). Among those with matched experimental phenotype data, the Bactabolize and CarveMe universal models were able to predict growth for a greater number of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur substrates than gapseq, CarveMe <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan, KBase and iKp1289 models (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>, <bold>Data S1</bold>). While the CarveMe universal model had the highest number of true-positive growth predictions overall (n = 132 of 617 total predictions), it also had a comparably high number of false-positive predictions (n = 39 of 617 total predictions, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Similarly, the gapseq and iKp1289 models resulted in 31 (262 total predictions) and 50 (513 total predictions) false-positive predictions, respectively. In contrast, the Bactabolize model had fewer false-positive predictions (n = 21 of 505 total predictions) alongside a high number of true-positive predictions (n = 117 of 505 total predictions), resulting in the highest overall accuracy metrics (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, Data S1</bold>). The KBase model was a notable outlier, associated with a high number of false-negative predictions (n = 31 of 103 total predictions) and low false-positive predictions (n = 3 of 103 total predictions), presumably resulting from the very low number of genes and reactions included in the model, driving low sensitivity and accuracy.</p>
<p>The gene essentiality results showed that gapseq produced the highest absolute number of true-positive gene essentiality predictions (n = 79 of 1403), followed by Bactabolize <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan (n = 44 of 1220 total predictions), then CarveMe universal (n = 39 of 1951 total predictions). CarveMe universal had the largest number of true-negatives by a wide margin (n = 1599 of 1951 total predictions), followed by gapseq (n = 1085 of 1403 total predictions), then Bactabolize <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan (n = 939 of 1220 total predictions), driving their high accuracies (83.96%, 82.96% and 80.57%, respectively). The Bactabolize model was associated with the greatest overall precision and specificity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F &amp; 2G</xref></bold>) while the gapseq model resulted in the highest F1-score and sensitivity.</p>
<p>While model features and accuracy are essential metrics for comparison, computation time is also a key consideration for high-throughput analyses. We recorded the time required for each tool to build draft models for 10 of the completed <italic>Kp</italic>SC genomes used in the quality control framework (see below) on a high-performance computing cluster (Intel Xeon Gold 6150 CPU @ 2.70GHz and 155 GB of requested memory on a CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 environment. CarveMe <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan was the fastest with a mean of 20.04 (range 19.90 - 20.18) seconds, followed by CarveMe universal at 30.28 (range 29.20 - 31.80) seconds, then Bactabolize <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan at 98.05 (range 92.19 - 100.4) seconds. KBase took 183.50 (range 120.00 - 338.00) seconds per genome via batch analysis, including genome upload time and queuing. gapseq took 5.46 (range 4.55 - 6.28) hours to produce draft models (not including the required gap-filling), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>

<title>Quality control framework for input genome assemblies</title>
<p>There are now thousands of bacterial genomes available in public databases, the majority of which are in draft form, comprising 10s to 1000s of assembly contigs. This fragmentation of the genome is caused by repetitive sequences that cannot be resolved by the assembly algorithm and/or sequence drop-out. The latter can result in the loss of genetic information such that some portion of genes present in the underlying genome are lost from the genome assembly (either completely or partially). This in turn, poses a limitation for the reconstruction of metabolic models using these assemblies, since most published approaches use sequence searches to predict the presence/absence of genes and their associated enzymatic reactions. Therefore, if we are to use public genome data for high-throughput metabolic modelling studies, it is essential to evaluate the expected model accuracies and understand the minimum input genome quality requirements.</p>
<p>Here we performed a systematic analysis leveraging our published curated <italic>Kp</italic>SC models (n=37, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)), which were generated using completed genome sequences and were therefore considered to represent ‘complete’ models for which the underlying genome sequence contains all genes that are truly present in the genome (note the biological accuracy of these models was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) and is not the subject of the current study). We randomly subsampled the corresponding Illumina read sets to various depths (10 – 100x, increments of 10) in triplicate and generated draft assemblies that were passed to Bactabolize for generation of draft metabolic models (<bold>Data S3</bold>). Due to low read depth (≤30x), two isolates were removed from this analysis. Additionally, ten 10x depth read samples failed to produce assemblies, leaving 1040 draft genomes for analysis. The resulting draft metabolic models were compared to the complete models to; i) determine the proportions of complete model genes and reactions captured in the draft models; and ii) compare 846 <italic>in silico</italic> aerobic growth predictions in M9 minimal media, where growth on 266 carbon, 153 nitrogen, 59 phosphorus and 25 sulfur sources were examined. Substrates containing multiple elements were tested as sole sources of each element independently and in combination, e.g. 1,5-Diaminopentane was tested as a sole carbon, sole nitrogen and sole carbon plus nitrogen source.</p>
<p>As expected, assembly quality generally increased with increasing sequencing depth i.e. assemblies generated from higher depth read sets were associated with higher N50 values, fewer contigs and fewer assembly graph dead-ends, although the rate of improvement drastically declined beyond 40-50x depth (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>, Data S3</bold>). We noted that it was rare for draft models to capture 100% of model genes and reactions (just 420 of all 1040 draft assemblies were associated with models that captured 100% model genes) (<bold>Data S3, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref></bold>), even when using the highest quality draft genomes. However, ≥99% of genes and reactions were commonly captured, which plateaued from 40x depth onwards (<bold><xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref></bold>). Therefore, we sought to evaluate whether ≥99% model capture would produce functionally accurate models.</p>
<p>We used FBA to simulate substrate growth profiles for the 40x depth assemblies, representing a sequencing depth that can be routinely achieved with standard Illumina library preparations. All but one assembly triplicate set (isolate SB4767 98% gene capture, 99% reaction capture) captured ≥99% but ≤100% model genes and/or reactions. The substrate growth profiles were then compared to those of the complete models. The vast majority of draft models produced accurate growth predictions; 102 of 108 models resulted in predictions with 100% concordance to those from the corresponding complete models. Three models for <italic>K. quasipneumoniae similipneumoniae</italic> isolate SB164 resulted in predictions with a mean of 99.8% concordance. The remaining three models were for isolate SB4767 and resulted in mean of 80.4% concordance. Notably, these models were those representing &lt;99% gene capture. Together, these data suggest that draft models capturing ≥99% of the complete model genes/reactions generate highly accurate growth predictions and that these capture rates can be readily achieved from draft genome assemblies.</p>
<p>We investigated the relationships between assembly quality metrics and model gene/reaction capture in more detail. Variation in assembly graph dead-ends accounted for the greatest amount of variation in model capture, closely followed by raw contig counts (cubic polynomial fit, R<sup>2</sup> of ≥0.98 for graph dead-ends, R<sup>2</sup> of ≥0.9 for contig count). A segmented linear model was fitted to N50 length (R<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.83), producing a breakpoint at 25153 bp (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To further explore the optimum thresholds for assembly metrics, we tallied the number of draft assemblies resulting in ≥99% and &lt;99% gene and reaction capture at increasing graph dead-end and contig count cut-offs, and decreasing N50 cut-offs. Draft models that captured ≥99% of the complete model genes/reactions were considered ‘good’ models, whereas draft models that captured &lt;99% of complete model genes/reactions were considered ‘bad’ models. The optimum threshold for assembly graph dead end was determined to be ≤200. At this value, 94.44% of ‘good’ models were captured, and 0% ‘bad’ models. The optimum threshold for contig counts was determined as ≤130 contigs at which 67.92% of ‘good’ and 0% ‘bad’ models were captured (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). The optimum threshold for N50 was determined to be ≥65000, at which 94.97% of ‘good’ and 1.71% of ‘bad’ models were captured. The assembly graph dead-end threshold results in comparatively higher sensitivity (i.e. a higher proportion of ‘good’ models pass the threshold) than contig count and comparatively better specificity (i.e. lower proportion of ‘bad’ models pass the threshold) than N50, but the underlying metric information is not universally available because many isolate genomes are deposited in public databases only as assemblies without the associated assembly graph. We therefore recommend a three-tier approach, whereby the assembly graph dead-end criterion is preferenced if available, followed by N50 and then contig count.</p>

<title>Impact of gap-filling models</title>
<p>Of the 901 draft genome assemblies which passed our QC criteria (≤200 assembly graph dead ends), 23 of the resulting draft models failed to simulate growth in M9 minimal media with glucose (despite capturing ≥99% of the genes and reactions in the corresponding complete models). It is expected that all <italic>Kp</italic>SC models should be able to simulate growth on M9 media with glucose as a sole carbon source, as this central metabolism is universal amongst <italic>Kp</italic>SC. To replace missing, critical reactions required for growth on M9 with glucose, we investigated model gap-filling using the <italic>patch_model</italic> command of Bactabolize. We then assessed the accuracy of the gap-filled models for prediction of growth on the full range of substrates, as compared to the predictions from the corresponding complete models.</p>
<p>Gap filling added 1 – 3 missing reactions to each model, with a median of one, fully restoring biomass production in M9 media with glucose in all but two of the 23 failed models. The missing reactions appeared to be random genes across these 23 genomes, likely due to missing information in these assemblies.</p>
<p>Substrate usage predictions from the 21 successfully gap-filled models were highly accurate, with 18/21 having a prediction concordance of ≥99% across all 846 growth conditions (12/21 had 100% concordance) (<bold><xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we described Bactabolize, a pipeline for rapid and scalable production of accurate bacterial strain-specific metabolic models and growth phenotype predictions. We describe a pan-reference model for the <italic>Kp</italic>SC and demonstrate that a draft strain-specific model generated <italic>de novo</italic> via Bactabolize using the <italic>Kp</italic>SC-pan v1 reference was highly accurate for growth phenotype prediction (85.79% accuracy for substrate usage across 190 substrates, and 80.57% for gene essentiality across 1220 genes). Importantly, we also described a quality control framework for the use of draft genome assemblies as input for metabolic reconstructions. We used a systematic analysis to; i) evaluate the proportion of gene and reaction capture compared to the corresponding ‘completed’ models; ii) define quality control thresholds for input assemblies (three tier approach for <italic>Kp</italic>SC; ≤200 assembly graph dead ends, followed by ≥65000 N50, followed by ≤130 contigs); and iii) estimate the accuracy of the resultant growth predictions. While the quality control thresholds and accuracy estimates are specific to <italic>Kp</italic>SC, the conceptual framework can be applied to any organism and is essential to support the confident application of metabolic modelling for large-scale genome datasets. We appreciate that assembly graphs may not be available for dead end count, e.g. for draft genome assemblies accessed via public repositories, however we encourage users to include this information in their quality control procedures wherever possible (e.g. using the recently published counter tool available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rrwick/GFA-dead-end-counter">https://github.com/rrwick/GFA-dead-end-counter</ext-link>), because these counts represent a direct reflection of the completeness of the genome assembly. In contrast, contig counts and N50 are influenced by biological features such as repeat copy numbers as well as the underlying sequence data quality e.g. a bacterial genome harbouring many insertion sequence insertions will result in a draft assembly with a high number of contigs regardless of the sequence data quality and completeness.</p>
<p>Traditionally, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction approaches have relied upon significant manual curation efforts. While there will always remain a need for high quality curated models, such resource intensive approaches preclude their application at scale, and have therefore limited analyses to small numbers of individual strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). However, automated reconstruction approaches can support the generation and comparison of multiple strain-specific draft models from which meaningful biological insights can be derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Additionally, the quality of curated models is likely to vary depending on their age, level and type of curation, as well as the approach used for preliminary drafting. Indeed it is possible for automated approaches to outperform manually curated models; a draft model for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> KPPR1 generated using Bactabolize with the KpSC pan-v1 reference model outperformed the manually curated iKp1289 model representing the same strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). iKp1289 was published in 2017 (6 years prior to this study) and was initially drafted via the KBase pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), which uses RAST to annotate the sequences with Enzyme Commission numbers. It has been demonstrated several times that the Enzyme Commission scheme has systematic errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), leading to a loss in accuracy when compared to the ortholog identification methods used by automated approaches. Consistent with this assertion, our draft KPPR1 model constructed with KBase (without manual curation) was an outlier in terms of the very low number of genes, reactions and metabolites that were included.</p>
<p>CarveMe with universal model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) and gapseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) are the current gold standard automated approaches for model reconstruction, and we show that a draft <italic>Kp</italic>SC model generated by Bactabolize with the <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan v1 reference resulted in similar or better accuracy for phenotype prediction (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). Both the CarveMe universal and gapseq models resulted in high numbers of true-positive and true-negative growth predictions. However, these were also accompanied by comparatively higher numbers of false-positive predictions that resulted in a lower overall accuracy for substrate usage analysis compared to Bactabolize with the <italic>Kp</italic>SC-pan v1 reference (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>), and comparatively lower precision and specificity for the gene essentiality analysis. False-positive predictions may indicate that the relevant metabolic machinery are present in the cell but were not active during the growth experiments (e.g. due to lack of gene expression). In this regard, false-positives are not always a sign of model inaccuracy. However, false-positive predictions can also occur from incorrect gene annotations e.g. due to reduced specificity of ortholog assignment resulting from the use of the universal model without manual curation. Given a key objective here is to facilitate high-throughput analysis for large numbers of genomes, it is not feasible to expect that all models will be manually curated, and therefore we believe that identifying fewer genes with lower overall error rates provides greater confidence in the resulting draft models. We also note that the BiGG universal reference model which CarveMe leverages is no longer being actively maintained. In contrast, user defined reference models can be iteratively curated and updated to incorporate new knowledge and data as they become available.</p>
<p>Bactabolize’s reference-based reconstruction approach is reductive, meaning the resultant draft models will comprise only the genes, reactions and metabolites present in the reference, or a subset thereof, and will not include novel reactions unless they are manually identified and curated by the user. This is an important caveat that should be considered carefully for application of Bactabolize to large genome data sets, particularly for genetically diverse organisms such as those in the <italic>Kp</italic>SC. For optimum results we suggest using a curated pan-model that captures as much diversity as possible for the target species or group of interest. While we acknowledge that a reasonable resource investment is required to generate a high-quality reference, we have shown that a pan-model derived from just 37 representative strains can be sufficient to support the generation of highly-accurate draft models (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></bold>). Additionally, we note that it is possible to use a single strain reference model, which should ideally represent the same or closely related species to that of the input genome assemblies, in order to facilitate accurate identification of gene orthologs. It is technically possible to use an unrelated reference model, but this is expected to result in inaccurate and/or incomplete outputs and has not been tested in this study. In circumstances were no high quality closely-related reference model is available, we recommend alternative reconstruction approaches that leverage universal databases e.g. CarveMe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) or gapseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). However, gapseq’s long compute time makes it inappropriate for application to datasets comprising 100s-1000s of genomes (such as have become increasingly common in the bacterial population biology literature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>
<p>Bactabolize and the <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan v1 model are freely available under open source licenses and satisfy the four features of the FAIR research principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). In addition to the <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan-reference described here, a pan-reference model has been described previously for <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (representing 410 strains) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>) (representing 183 strains) and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) (representing 222 strains). We are actively working to expand and improve the <italic>Kp</italic>SC pan reference model and welcome similar efforts to generate high quality references for other organisms. Together these resources will facilitate population wide metabolic analyses for global priority pathogens, which can be used to understand how they transmit, cause disease and evolve drug-resistance, and to identify novel therapeutic targets.</p>

<p>The annotated and unannotated genome of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> KPPR1 were obtained from Genbank accession number: CP009208.</p>
<p>Bactabolize draft models were generated using the <italic>draft_model</italic> command in Bactabolize v1 with the <italic>Kp</italic>SC-pan v1 model as a reference, the annotated <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> KPPR1 as input and the following options:</p>
<p>--min_coverage 25 --min_pident 80 --media M9 --atmosphere aerobic</p>

<p>A draft model was generated using gapseq version 1.2 with the ‘doall’ command using the unannotated genome (as gapseq does not take annotated input files).

<title>Performance comparisons</title>
<p>The annotated and unannotated genome of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> KPPR1 were obtained from Genbank under the accession: CP009208, and draft metabolic models were generated using Bactabolize, CarveMe, ModelSEED and gapseq as described above. The previously described, manually curated model for KPPR1 (iKp1289) was also included for comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). MEMOTE version 0.13.0 was used to collate basic model statistics. The following KPPR1 phenotype data were retrieved from published studies: BIOLOG Phenotypic Microarray data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and single gene knockout data inferred from the outputs of a TraDIS transposon mutagenesis library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>).</p>
<p>A list of BIOLOG growth substrates for plates PM1, PM2A, PM3B, and PM4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>) were converted where possible to BiGG and SEED IDs by manual search of the BiGG (bigg.ucsd.edu) and SEED websites (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://modelseed.org/biochem/compounds">https://modelseed.org/biochem/compounds</ext-link>).

<p>This study presents Bactabolize, a <bold>valuable</bold> tool for the rapid genome-scale reconstruction of bacteria and the prediction of growth phenotypes. Using validated methodology, the tool relies on a reference pan-genome model to create strain-specific draft metabolic models, as demonstrated in this study using <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. While the evidence in this specific case is <bold>solid</bold>, validation across diverse bacterial species is yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>In this work, Vezina et al. present Bactabolize, a rapid reconstruction tool for the generation of strain-specific metabolic models. Similar to other reconstruction pipelines such as CarveMe, Bactabolize builds a strain-specific draft reconstruction and subsequently gap-fills it. The model can afterwards be used to predict growth on carbon sources. The authors constructed a pan-model of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) and used it as input for Bactabolize to construct a genome-sale reconstruction of K. pneumoniae KPPR1. They compared the generated reconstruction with a reconstruction built through CarveMe as well as a manually curated reconstruction for the same strain. They then compared predictions of carbon, nitrogen, phosphor, and sulfur sources and found that the Bactabolize reconstruction had the overall highest accuracy. Finally, they built draft reconstructions for 10 clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and evaluated their predictive performance. Overall, this is a useful tool, the data is well-presented, and the paper is well-written.</p>

<p>The authors present a pipeline for generating strain-specific genome-scale metabolic models for bacteria using Klebsiella spp. as the demonstrative data. This paper claims to provide a high-throughput tool for generating strain-specific models for bacteria. However, in reality, the tool requires a reference pan-genome-based complete model to generate the strain-specific model of the species of interest, which in this study is Klebsiella pneumoniae. This requirement renders the tool redundant for high-throughput purposes since the process of building or generating the pan-genome reference model is performed separately. Additionally, the quality of the newly built strain-specific model will depend on the reference model used. Therefore, this tool, on its own, can only work specifically with the available pan-genome model of reference, which in this case is only applicable to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Its effectiveness with other bacteria has not been proven. I would suggest that the authors either reframe the performance and results to be applicable only to Klebsiella or consider adding more reference pan-genome models for the study.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p>
<p>1. Overall, this is a useful tool, the data is well-presented, and the paper is well-written. However, the predictions are only compared with two existing reconstruction tools though more have been recently published</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The aim of this work was to facilitate high-throughput generation of strain-specific metabolic models e.g. at the scale of 100s -1000s as indicated throughput the introduction (see lines 74-82, 91-94), and therefore we only compared tools which were capable of high-throughput analysis via command line and excluded others (e.g. merlin). We have now tested this against the other recent command line tool, gapseq which had escaped our gaze. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Additionally, we have included KBase (ModelSEED, a web-based app that does not support high-throughput analysis) to allow for readers to interpret the results in the context of community standard approaches, since KBase is a popular tool.</p>
<p>We have added an explicit statement about the choice of approaches, now at lines 194-199 as follows:</p>
<p>“We compared the output and performance of Bactabolize to the two previously published tools that can support high-throughput analyses i.e. CarveMe (30) and gapseq (31). To aid interpretation in the context of community standard approaches, we also include a comparison to the popular web-based reconstruction tool, KBase (ModelSEED), and a manually curated metabolic reconstruction of K. pneumoniae strain KPPR1 (also known as VK055 and ATCC 43816, metabolic model named iKp1289) (15).”</p>
<p>The methods section was updated accordingly (now lines 552-558):</p>
<p>“A draft model was generated using gapseq version 1.2 with the ‘doall’ command using the unannotated genome (as gapseq does not take annotated input files). Gap-filling was subsequently performed using the ‘fill’ command and a custom M9 media file to match the nutrient list found in
Bactabolize
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kelwyres/Bactabolize/blob/main/data/media_definitions/m9">https://github.com/kelwyres/Bactabolize/blob/main/data/media_definitions/m9</ext-link> _media.json).</p>
<p>Finally, a draft model was constructed using the annotated genbank K.
pneumoniae KPPR1 file and the KBase narrative (15) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://narrative.kbase.us/narrative/ws.14145.obj.1">https://narrative.kbase.us/narrative/ws.14145.obj.1</ext-link>).”</p>
<p>The results section (now lines 193-308) and Figure 2 have also been updated / restructured to reflect the new analyses, and include a comparison of the relative compute times for the construction of models (lines 281-291) as follows:</p>
<p>“While model features and accuracy are essential metrics for comparison, computation time is also a key consideration for high-throughput analyses. We recorded the time required for each tool to build draft models for 10 of the completed KpSC genomes used in the quality control framework (see below) on a high-performance computing cluster (Intel Xeon Gold 6150 CPU @ 2.70GHz and 155 GB of requested memory on a CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 environment. CarveMe KpSC pan was the fastest with a mean of 20.04 (range 19.90 - 20.18) seconds, followed by CarveMe universal at 30.28 (range 29.20 - 31.80) seconds, then Bactabolize KpSC pan at 98.05 (range 92.19 - 100.4) seconds. KBase took 183.50 (range 120.00 - 338.00) seconds per genome via batch analysis, including genome upload time and queuing. gapseq took 5.46 (range 4.55 - 6.28) hours to produce draft models (not including the required gap-filling), consistent with previous reports (37).”</p>
<p>Finally, the whole discussion has been updated and substantially restructured (lines 472-474, 475-493, 494-512). Specific mentions to the new analyses are at lines:</p>
<p>472-474: “Consistent with this assertion, our draft KPPR1 model constructed with KBase (without manual curation) was an outlier in terms of the very low number of genes, reactions and metabolites that were included.”</p>
<p>475-493: “CarveMe with universal model (30) and gapseq (31) are the current gold standard automated approaches for model reconstruction, and we show that a draft KpSC model generated by Bactabolize with the KpSC pan v1 reference resulted in similar or better accuracy for phenotype prediction (Figure 2). Both the CarveMe universal and gapseq models resulted in high numbers of true-positive and true-negative growth predictions. However, these were also accompanied by comparatively higher numbers of false-positive predictions that resulted in a lower overall accuracy for substrate usage analysis compared to Bactabolize with the KpSC-pan v1 reference (Figure 2), and comparatively lower precision and specificity for the gene essentiality analysis. False-positive predictions may indicate that the relevant metabolic machinery are present in the cell but were not active during the growth experiments (e.g. due to lack of gene expression). In this regard, false-positives are not always a sign of model inaccuracy. However, false-positive predictions can also occur from incorrect gene annotations e.g. due to reduced specificity of ortholog assignment resulting from the use of the universal model without manual curation. Given a key objective here is to facilitate high-throughput analysis for large numbers of genomes, it is not feasible to expect that all models will be manually curated, and therefore we believe that identifying fewer genes with lower overall error rates provides greater confidence in the resulting draft models. We also note that the BiGG universal reference model which CarveMe leverages is no longer being actively maintained. In contrast, user defined reference models can be iteratively curated and updated to incorporate new knowledge and data as they become available.”</p>
<p>510-512: “However, gapseq’s long compute time makes it inappropriate for application to datasets comprising 100s-1000s of genomes (such as have become increasingly common in the bacterial population biology literature).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. My understanding is that the tool requires a set of reference reconstructions for other strains of the target species. If no reference reconstruction is available for another strain of the target species, can this species not be reconstructed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Any input reference can be used to generate models however, single strain models matching the target species, or ideally a species-specific panreference, are recommended for best results. We have added a discussion on these points at lines 128-133:</p>
<p>“For optimum results we suggest using a pan-model that captures as much diversity as possible for the target species or group of interest, because Bactabolize’s reconstruction method is reductive i.e. each output strainspecific model will include only genes, reactions and metabolites that are present in the reference or a subset thereof (although novel genes, reactions and metabolites can be added via manual curation).”</p>
<p>We expand on these points further in the discussion:</p>
<p>494-512: “Bactabolize’s reference-based reconstruction approach is reductive, meaning the resultant draft models will comprise only the genes, reactions and metabolites present in the reference, or a subset thereof, and will not include novel reactions unless they are manually identified and curated by the user. This is an important caveat that should be considered carefully for application of Bactabolize to large genome data sets, particularly for genetically diverse organisms such as those in the KpSC. For optimum results we suggest using a curated pan-model that captures as much diversity as possible for the target species or group of interest. While we acknowledge that a reasonable resource investment is required to generate a high-quality reference, we have shown that a pan-model derived from just 37 representative strains can be sufficient to support the generation of highlyaccurate draft models (Figure 2 and 5). Additionally, we note that it is possible to use a single strain reference model, which should ideally represent the same or closely related species to that of the input genome assemblies, in order to facilitate accurate identification of gene orthologs. It is technically possible to use an unrelated reference model, but this is expected to result in inaccurate and/or incomplete outputs and has not been tested in this study. In circumstances were no high quality closely-related reference model is available, we recommend alternative reconstruction approaches that leverage universal databases e.g. CarveMe (30) or gapseq (31). However, gapseq’s long compute time makes it inappropriate for application to datasets comprising 100s-1000s of genomes (such as have become increasingly common in the bacterial population biology literature).”</p>

<p>We used the pan-model as a reference from which we generated a strain-specific model for K. pneumoniae KPPR1 (using Bactabolize and CarveMe). This strain-specific metabolic model was then used to simulate growth phenotypes and compared to published experimental data for KPPR1. This was described in the methods section, including the calculations for the
metrics (lines 589-593); however, we have also expanded the description within the results section to clarify the approach (lines 201-209):</p>
<p>“De novo draft models for strain KPPR1 were built using; i) Bactabolize with the KpSC pan v1 reference; ii) CarveMe, with its universal reference model (CarveMe universal); iii) CarveMe, with KpSC-pan v1 reference (CarveMe KpSC pan); iv) gapseq; and v) KBase (ModelSEED). ….. Subsequently, each model was used to predict growth phenotypes; i) in M9 minimal media with different sole sources of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur; and ii) for all possible single gene knockouts in LB under aerobic conditions. The predicted phenotypes were compared directly to the published phenotype data.” [Note the published data are cited in the previous manuscript sentence, not shown here].</p>

<p>1. To generate metabolic models, the authors present comparison results with other methods. However, the authors only present the numbers in genes, metabolites and substrates. Since the interactions between gene, metabolite, and substrate are also critical, if possible, please provide the coverage details about these interactions. Venn diagram is recommended to compare these coverage differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Two additional supplementary figures have been generated (Figures S5 and 6) showing Venn diagrams of metabolites and reactions for the highthroughput analysis approaches that are most relevant to this work (see also response to rev 1, point 1). These are discussed at lines 224-237:</p>
<p>“Figures S5 and S6 show the overlaps of metabolites and reactions between the high-throughput reconstruction methods after processing with MetaNetX (59) to standardise the reaction and metabolite nomenclatures (excluding CarveMe pan for simplicity and given the likely problems of reaction oversubscription). The majority of the reactions included in the Bactabolize model were conserved in either the CarveMe universal model (n = 1225, 53.2%), gapseq model (n = 54, 2.3%) or both (n = 665, 28.9%). The reaction overlap was skewed to the CarveMe universal model which shared 1225 reactions that were conserved in the Bactabolize model but absent from the gapseq model. Notably, the gapseq model contained a large number (2200) of unique reactions (70.4% of those in the model). Similarly, the vast majority of metabolites in the Bactabolize model were conserved in one or both of the other models (n = 917, 85.6%). However, it is likely that true overlaps between methods are underrepresented due to the different reaction identifiers and chemical synonyms used within the BiGG (Bactabolize, CarveMe) vs ModelSEED nomenclatures (gapseq), which are difficult to harmonise in an automated manner even after the application of MetaNetX.”</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows not only the model numbers but also includes benchmarking to real phenotypic data in 2DEFG as the key mode of comparison between models. This encompasses meaningful interactions between gene, metabolic and substrate. The results are discussed at length in text at lines 253-271:</p>
<p>“We assessed the performance of each model for in silico prediction of growth phenotypes compared to the previously published experimental data (15). Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 scores were calculated (60). Note that the specific set of growth substrates and gene knockouts that can be simulated is determined by the sets of genes and metabolites captured by each model and is therefore model-dependent (Data S1 and S2). Among those with matched experimental phenotype data, the Bactabolize and CarveMe universal models were able to predict growth for a greater number of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulfur substrates than gapseq, CarveMe KpSC pan, KBase and iKp1289 models (Figure 2C, Data S1). While the CarveMe universal model had the highest number of truepositive growth predictions overall (n = 132 of 617 total predictions), it also had a comparably high number of false-positive predictions (n = 39 of 617 total predictions, Figure 2D). Similarly, the gapseq and iKp1289 models resulted in 31 (262 total predictions) and 50 (513 total predictions) falsepositive predictions, respectively. In contrast, the Bactabolize model had fewer false-positive predictions (n = 21 of 505 total predictions) alongside a high number of true-positive predictions (n = 117 of 505 total predictions), resulting in the highest overall accuracy metrics (Figure 2E, Data S1). The KBase model was a notable outlier, associated with a high number of falsenegative predictions (n = 31 of 103 total predictions) and low false-positive predictions (n = 3 of 103 total predictions), presumably resulting from the very low number of genes and reactions included in the model, driving low sensitivity and accuracy.”</p>
<p>Lines 272-280:</p>
<p>“The gene essentiality results showed that gapseq produced the highest absolute number of true-positive gene essentiality predictions (n = 79 of), followed by Bactabolize KpSC pan (n = 44 of 1220 total predictions), then CarveMe universal (n = 39 of 1951 total predictions). CarveMe universal had the largest number of true-negatives by a wide margin (n = 1599 of 1951 total predictions), followed by gapseq (n = 1085 of 1403 total predictions), then Bactabolize KpSC pan (n = 939 of 1220 total predictions), driving their high accuracies (83.96%, 82.96% and 80.57%, respectively). The Bactabolize model was associated with the greatest overall precision and specificity (Figures 2F &amp; 2G) while the gapseq model resulted in the highest F1-score and sensitivity.”</p>

<p>1. Are quality control and gap-filling needed to be processed when constructing a new metabolic model?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our goal here was to implement an approach to support high-throughput analyses (see response to rev 1 point 1), including leveraging draft genome assemblies as the bases for the construction of strain-specific metabolic models. As part of this work, we have described a robust quality control (QC) framework for screening draft K. pneumoniae genomes i.e. to identify genome assemblies that should not be used. We developed this framework by comparison to models generated for matched completed genomes. Our analyses demonstrate the importance of applying QC to the input draft genome assemblies. When appropriate QC is applied to the input genomes, the resultant draft models show a high degree of completeness compared to the matched models derived from complete genomes. The draft models can also be used to simulate growth phenotypes with high accuracy as compared to those simulated for the matched complete genome models.</p>
<p>No specific QC was applied to the draft models themselves, other than confirmation of positive growth prediction in m9 minimal media plus glucose (which is expected to support growth of all K. pneumoniae). In cases where the input assembly passed our QC criteria but the resultant model was unable to simulate growth in m9 minimal media plus glucose, gap-filling may be optionally applied. Again, by comparison to the simulated phenotypes from matched complete genome models, we show that these gap-filled draft models can produce accurate phenotype predictions. See lines 396-404:</p>
<p>“Of the 901 draft genome assemblies which passed our QC criteria (≤200 assembly graph dead ends), 23 of the resulting draft models failed to simulate growth in M9 minimal media with glucose (despite capturing ≥99% of the genes and reactions in the corresponding complete models). It is expected that all KpSC models should be able to simulate growth on M9 media with glucose as a sole carbon source, as this central metabolism is universal amongst KpSC. To replace missing, critical reactions required for growth on M9 with glucose, we investigated model gap-filling using the patch_model command of Bactabolize. We then assessed the accuracy of the gap-filled models for prediction of growth on the full range of substrates, as compared to the predictions from the corresponding complete models.”   Lines 409-413: “Substrate usage predictions from the 21 successfully gap-filled models were highly accurate, with 18/21 having a prediction concordance of ≥99% across all 846 growth conditions (12/21 had 100% concordance) (Figure S9). We therefore conclude that models generated for genome assemblies passing our QC criteria, which have been gap-filled to successfully simulate growth on minimal media plus glucose, are suitable for the prediction of growth across a range of substrates.”</p>

<p>1. Are there any visualization results to check the status of the generated draft model?</p>

<p>No. This is a tool for large-scale and rapid production of metabolic models, and phenotype prediction and we have not included visualisation tools. Third party tools are available e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fluxer.umbc.edu/">https://fluxer.umbc.edu/</ext-link>.

<p>1. The justification and evaluation of the generated models are inadequate and onedimensional. The authors only focus on statistics such as the number of reactions and genes in the models, which does not accurately depict the completeness of the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer has misunderstood how we have used ‘completeness’ in this manuscript. In the section describing our novel QC framework, we use this term to refer to the relative completeness of draft models generated from draft genome assemblies as compared to curated models generated from complete genome assemblies for the same strains. The latter were considered as the ‘complete’ models for this purpose. We are not referring to any measure of network or metabolic pathway completeness. We specifically refer to gene and reaction capture compared to the ‘complete’ models because these features directly reflect the problem we are trying to address
i.e. that draft genome assemblies may not contain the complete set of genes that are truly present in the underlying genome. We have updated the manuscript text to further clarify the problem we aim to address in this section and justify the use of gene and reaction capture metrics:</p>
<p>Lines 310-319: “There are now thousands of bacterial genomes available in public databases, the majority of which are in draft form, comprising 10s to 1000s of assembly contigs. This fragmentation of the genome is caused by repetitive sequences that cannot be resolved by the assembly algorithm and/or sequence drop-out. The latter can result in the loss of genetic information such that some portion of genes present in the underlying genome are lost from the genome assembly (either completely or partially). This in turn, poses a limitation for the reconstruction of metabolic models using these assemblies, since most published approaches use sequence searches to predict the presence/absence of genes and their associated enzymatic reactions. Therefore, if we are to use public genome data for high-throughput metabolic modelling studies, it is essential to evaluate the expected model accuracies and understand the minimum input genome quality requirements.”</p>
<p>The biological accuracy of the curated ‘complete’ models has been described previously, and this is now noted in the text at lines 320-324:</p>
<p>“Here we performed a systematic analysis leveraging our published curated KpSC models (n=37, (14)), which were generated using completed genome sequences and were therefore considered to represent ‘complete’ models for which the underlying genome sequence contains all genes that are truly present in the genome (note the biological accuracy of these models was reported previously (14) and is not the subject of the current study).”</p>
<p>Throughput the manuscript we not only compare models in terms of the numbers of genes and reactions, but through comparison of binary growth predictions. Specifically, in the Performance Comparison section (Bactabolize vs other approaches) we use comparison of predicted to experimental phenotypes for strain KPPR1 (see response to rev 1 point 4 for details). In the QC Framework section we compare the predictions derived from draft models generated from draft genome assemblies to those derived from the matched ‘complete’ models, and report the concordance as a measure of impact of input assembly quality (lines 309-394). In the final results section (Predictive accuracy of draft models), we generate 10 additional models and compare the growth predictions to matched experimental data (lines 414-433). We view these phenotype prediction comparisons as the ultimate measure of ‘completeness’ with which to assess our models, because these data have direct biological meaning.</p>

<p>1. The authors have not provided evidence or discussion on the accuracy of any metabolic fluxes, which are considered to be crucial for reconstructing metabolic models. Additionally, the authors have not mentioned the importance of non-growth associated maintenance and the criticality of biomass composition analysis, both of which significantly determine the fluxes in the system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the importance of flux calculations and accurate biomass compositions when using genome-scale models to quantitatively predict growth rates. However, at this stage, the reconstructions developed using Bactabolize are intended for binary predictions and comparisons of growth capabilities on various substrates. The accuracies we report are based on measures of network completion (presence/absence of relevant reactions leading to growth or no-growth phenotypes) rather than specific growth rates.  Thus, the models generated by Bactabolize can be used to explore diversity at the strain level in terms of growth capabilities and can serve as a scaffold for building detailed (customized biomass), strain-specific models. Measuring biomass composition and metabolic flux analysis require significant experimental comparisons that are outside the scope of the current study but could be performed for target strains based on reconstructions developed using Bactabolize.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It would be interesting to compare the accuracy of the models generated using Bactabolize with those manually curated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did exactly this. We compared the manually curated model iKp1289 as part of our benchmarking. Lines 194 – 199:</p>
<p>“We compared the output and performance of Bactabolize to the two previously published tools that can support high-throughput analyses i.e. CarveMe (30) and gapseq (31). To aid interpretation in the context of community standard approaches, we also include a comparison to the popular web-based reconstruction tool, KBase (ModelSEED), and a manually curated metabolic reconstruction of K. pneumoniae strain KPPR1 (also known as VK055 and ATCC 43816, metabolic model named iKp1289) (15).”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as far as we aware there are currently no other published manually curated models for strains with matched phenotype data that are also not included as part of our pan-reference model (the latter is a key point to ensure a fair comparison of models generated using our pan-reference vs those generated with a universal reference).</p>

<p>1. A detailed discussion on the importance of manually curated models would significantly enhance the quality of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been added at lines 458-474:</p>
<p>“Traditionally, genome-scale metabolic reconstruction approaches have relied upon significant manual curation efforts. While there will always remain a need for high quality curated models, such resource intensive approaches preclude their application at scale, and have therefore limited analyses to small numbers of individual strains (15, 16). However, automated reconstruction approaches can support the generation and comparison of multiple strain-specific draft models from which meaningful biological insights can be derived (61). Additionally, the quality of curated models is likely to vary depending on their age, level and type of curation, as well as the approach used for preliminary drafting. Indeed it is possible for automated approaches to outperform manually curated models; a draft model for K. pneumoniae KPPR1 generated using Bactabolize with the KpSC pan-v1 reference model outperformed the manually curated iKp1289 model representing the same strain (15). iKp1289 was published in 2017 (6 years prior to this study) and was initially drafted via the KBase pipeline (33), which uses RAST to annotate the sequences with Enzyme Commission numbers. It has been demonstrated several times that the Enzyme Commission scheme has systematic errors (62, 63), leading to a loss in accuracy when compared to the ortholog identification methods used by automated approaches. Consistent with this assertion, our draft KPPR1 model constructed with KBase (without manual curation) was an outlier in terms of the very low number of genes, reactions and metabolites that were included.”</p>
