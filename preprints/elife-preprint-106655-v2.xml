<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Understanding plant phenological responses to climate warming is crucial for predicting changes in plant communities and ecosystems but difficult using sensitivity analysis that is based rates of phenological changes, not on drivers of spring phenology. In this article, we present a new measure <italic>phenological lag</italic> to quantify the overall effect of phenological constraints including insufficient winter chilling, photoperiod, and environmental stresses, based on observed response and that expected from species-specific changes in spring temperatures, i.e., changes in spring forcing (degree days) from warming and average temperature at budburst with the warmer climate. We applied this new analytical framework to a global dataset with 980 species and 1527 responses to synthesize observed changes in spring budburst (leafing or flowering) and investigate the mechanisms of differential phenological responses reported previously. We found longer phenological lags with experimental studies and native plants in flowering, likely due to more stressful environments associated with warmer and drier climate. Less forcing changes were mainly responsible for the smaller responses in leafing and flowering in boreal region (compared to temperate region) and in grass leafing (compared to trees and shrubs). Higher budburst temperatures also contributed to the smaller responses in flowering for experimental studies and with herbs and grasses. The effects of altitude, latitude, MAT, and average spring temperature change were minor (all combined &lt;2.5% variations), while those of photoperiod and long-term precipitation were not significant in influencing spring phenology. Our method helps to determine mechanisms responsible for changes in spring phenology and differences in plant phenological responses.</p>

<title>Mechanisms of changes in spring phenology</title>
<p>Plant phenology, particularly in spring, is shifting with warming climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Post et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Primack and Gallinat, 2016</xref>). Numerous observational studies and controlled experiments, conducted over a range of climatic and phenological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Parmesan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Prevéy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Root et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>), have produced varying results, with observed phenological changes differing by research approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>), climatic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Parmesan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Post et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Prevéy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), and functional group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Parmesan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Root et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Willis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>). For example, observed changes are often smaller with experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>), native species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>), and warmer regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Prevéy et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding these differences (also referred to as discrepancies, disparities, or mismatches) is crucial for predicting changes in plant communities and ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Polgar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Primack and Gallinat, 2016</xref>) but difficult using sensitivity analysis that is based on rates of phenological changes, not on drivers of spring phenology.</p>
<p>Plants in the northern hemisphere require an accumulation of cool winter temperatures (winter chilling) to break dormancy and an accumulation of warm spring temperatures (spring forcing, degree days) to initiate budburst (e.g., leafing or flowering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Piao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Way and Montgomery, 2015</xref>). If chilling requirements are fully met and other phenological constraints (e.g., photoperiod effect and environmental stresses) do not change with warming, the changes in spring phenology, in response to a warmer climate, result primarily from changes in spring temperatures, i.e., changes in spring forcing and rate of forcing accumulation (i.e., temperature) at budburst with the warmer climate. That is, higher budburst temperatures are associated with smaller observed changes and sensitivity, opposite to the effects of forcing changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2023</xref>). As species often differ in timing of budburst, both forcing change and budburst temperature are species-specific, reflecting variations of individual species in phenological responses to climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2023</xref>). The effects of insufficient winter chilling, photoperiod (day length), and environmental stresses (e.g., drought and spring freezing) are similar in constraining the advance of spring phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Körner and Basler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Way and Montgomery, 2015</xref>). Therefore, the difference between observed phenological change and that expected from forcing change and budburst temperature represents phenological difference due to changes in phenological constraints and can be thereafter named phenological lag. Separating effects of different constraints is possible if soil moisture/plant water status is monitored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Post et al., 2022</xref>), or species-specific chilling and photoperiod effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Man et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fu et al., 2019</xref>) or cold hardiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Man et al., 2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">2021b</xref>) are known from previous research. For example, phenological lag can represent chilling effects when photoperiod effect and environmental stresses do not change with warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The changes in spring phenology are often assessed by sensitivity, a parameter that may reflect rates of phenological changes but not uneven warming effects and responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beaubien and Hamann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Keenan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Post et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rafferty et al., 2020</xref>), nor does the parameter provide meaningful indications of magnitude and underlying mechanisms of changes in spring phenology or differences in phenological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2023</xref>). For example, the same average temperature change (spring or annual temperatures) with uneven warming can have greater (greater warming prior to budburst) or smaller (smaller warming prior to budburst) phenological change than that with even warming. Under these circumstances, interpretations based on sensitivity analysis are likely inappropriate. Here, we present a new method to partition observed phenological changes based on changes in spring phenology and temperatures with control (baseline) and warmer climates. We applied this analytical approach to meta-analyze phenological changes reported in the literature and investigated the mechanisms of the differential responses reported previously on research approach (observations or experiments), species origin (native or exotic), climatic region (boreal or temperate), and growth form (tree, shrub, herb, or grass). Our objective was to determine how phenological responses differ among different groups and how differential responses are related to the drivers of spring phenology, i.e., forcing change, budburst temperature, and phenological lag.</p>

<title>Phenological Data</title>
<p>We followed the guidelines of PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">O’Dea et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Page et al., 2021</xref>) to build up the dataset for responses of plant spring phenology to experimental and climatic warming. We used Web of Science and Google Scholar to search experimental and observational studies on warming-induced changes in spring phenology. The following criteria were used to select papers: (a) accessible peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals for boreal (MAT &lt; 6 °C) and temperate (MAT ≥ 6 °C) regions in the northern hemisphere, (b) studies reporting spring budburst (leafing or flowering) before Julian day 213 (July 31), (c) studies containing different climatic conditions of baseline (lower temperatures in early period of observations or unwarmed control treatment) and warmer (higher temperatures in later period of observations or warmer treatment) climates, (d) access to local temperature data (only one study was excluded due to lack of nearby temperature data within 50 km), and (e) reported phenological changes in unique locations, species, and periods of observations/warmer treatments. When publications did not contain sufficient phenological information, we accessed data directly from phenological databases (e.g., China’s National Earth System Science Data Center). When results were reported in graphical format, we extracted the required data using the distance measuring tool in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. In experimental studies with multiple warming treatments, we selected the treatment with the smallest temperature increases to represent a likely scenario of climate change and to maintain data independence. We also excluded studies where the timing of spring budburst, total temperature change, or observational time periods were not available.</p>
<p>In total, 66 studies were identified from 87 locations, containing 1,527 phenological responses for 980 species (Figure S1; Tables S1–S3). For studies reporting multiple phenological stages, we only used data for the first occurrence of the events. To account for variation in phenological responses, each study location was characterized by research approach (observation or experiment), climatic region (boreal or temperate), biogeographic origin of species (exotic or native to study area), and growth form (tree, shrub, herb, or grass).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Climate Data</title>
<p>Baseline and warmer temperature data for calculating forcing change, expected response, budburst temperature, phenological lag, spring warming (average temperature change from Julian day 1 to 182), and long-term MAT and MAP were obtained from 9 different sources (Table S4). When temperature data were available from multiple sources, we selected the data set with the fewest missing values. For each phenological response, the number of weather stations within 50 km of data collection ranged from 1 for studies at a single location to 14 for observational studies across large geographic areas (Table S2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>We calculated forcing change, expected response, budburst temperature, and phenological lag for each of the 1527 responses compiled. We used linear mixed-effects models to explore the differences in observed responses and phenological lags between research approaches (observations vs. experiments), species origins (native vs. exotic), and climatic regions (boreal vs. temperate), and among growth forms (trees, shrubs, herbs, and grasses). Observed response is the total phenological change observed (commonly called phenological change or response), while phenological lag represents the lag effect of all constraints and therefore modification of phenological change from the expectation based on changes in spring temperatures. Separate analysis was conducted for each of the four fixed effects and two budburst events (leafing and flowering). Location and species were treated as random effects.</p>
<p>To assess the influences of climatic, phenological, and biological variables, we used a stepwise regression with automated combined forward and backward selection by Akaike information criterion (AIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burnham and Anderson, 2002</xref>) to select the best combination of variables for predicting observed responses (N<sub>O</sub>).
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="648654v2_ueqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The variables included were altitude (A<sub>L</sub>), latitude (L<sub>A</sub>), MAT, MAP, spring phenology (D<sub>T</sub>), budburst temperature (T<sub>B</sub>), forcing change (F<sub>C</sub>), spring warming (S<sub>W</sub>), and phenological lag (N<sub>C</sub>), and not standardized prior to regression analysis.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Observed changes in spring phenology</title>
<p>Across 66 studies with 980 species and 1527 responses, observed responses (N<sub>O</sub>) ranged from −23.8 to +26.8 days for leafing and −36.3 to +49.9 days for flowering, with an average of +6.0 days for both events (Table S3). These changes differed from expected responses (N<sub>E</sub>) which ranged from −3 to +27 days for leafing and −3 to +26 days for flowering and averaged +7.8 and +9.5 days, respectively. Observed phenological responses were thus smaller than the expected by 1.8 and 3.5 days, on average, for leafing and flowering, respectively.</p>
<p>In experimental studies, observed flowering response was non-significantly smaller than those from observational studies (1.7 days, <italic>p</italic>=0.232, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), while phenological lag was significantly longer for both leafing (3.0 days, <italic>p</italic>=0.028) and flowering (2.7 days, <italic>p</italic>=0.027) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). Observed flowering response in exotic species was 2 days greater than in native species (<italic>p</italic>=0.016), likely due to differences in phenological lag (1.9 days, <italic>p</italic>=0.019). Observed leafing and flowering responses in boreal region were 4.3 and 1.9 days smaller (p=0.004, p=0.088), respectively, than in temperate region, partially due to smaller forcing changes (equivalent to 2.8 days in leafing and 1.4 days in flowering based on forcing changes and budburst temperatures, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> note a). Observed leafing response in grasses was 3.8 days smaller than in trees and shrubs (p=0.033), likely due to differences in forcing changes (6.0 days, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> note b).</p>

<title>Observations vs. experiments</title>
<p>By partitioning observed changes based on drivers of spring phenology, we clarified some of the uncertainty regarding the underlying mechanisms of differences in plant phenological response to climate warming. By synthesizing global data, we found that observed flowering responses in experimental studies were non-significantly smaller than that in observational studies, but this was not the case for leafing responses; these findings differ from those based on temperature sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>). The greater warming in experimental studies did not produce greater observed responses, due to longer phenological lags, which may have resulted in the reduced sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>). First, experimental studies are often conducted at higher altitude sites with lower MAT, later spring phenology, and therefore longer accumulation of winter chilling. The longer phenological lags are therefore unlikely the result of insufficient winter chilling. Second, artificial warming has typically provided higher forcing changes and budburst temperatures than natural climate warming (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Greater forcing changes produce larger expected responses (observed response + phenological lag), whereas higher budburst temperatures reduce expected responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Prevéy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wolkovich et al., 2021</xref>). The high temperatures in the artificial warming structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Marion et al., 1997</xref>) can also reduce humidity and soil moisture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ettinger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), slowing spring development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ganjurjav et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Moore et al., 2015</xref>), particularly in early spring when temperatures in the surrounding environment are low, thus restricting soil water movement. While the different forcing changes adequately accounts for the differences in expected leafing responses (2.5 out of 3.3 days, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> note c), the large differences in forcing changes but similar expected responses in flowering (8.63 and 9.07 days, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) suggests a strong effect of budburst temperature (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> note d) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chu et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, warming-induced moisture stress and high budburst temperatures may interact to alter observed phenological responses and temperature sensitivity in experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>). Future experiments should consider humidity, soil moisture, and plant water status to better understand disparities between observational and experimental studies and relate plant phenological changes from experimental warming to those from natural climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wolkovich et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Native vs. exotic species</title>
<p>Exotic species are often reported with more noticeable observed responses to warming, a trend that is generally based on flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Willis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>). The ecological implications of this response are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Polgar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Lower budburst temperatures faced by early-start exotics are likely partially the cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2023</xref>), as shown by a reverse trend for late-start exotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zohner and Renner, 2014</xref>). In this synthesis, phenological lag did not increase from early leafing to late flowering for exotic species, a trend that is consistent with dormancy release commonly reported on leaf and flower buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Campoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gariglio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hussain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wall et al., 2008</xref>), contrary to that for native species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). The smaller observed response in flowering for native species is associated with longer phenological lags and accumulations of winter chilling (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), suggesting more stressful environments later in the season or higher stress sensitivity with reproductive events. Comparatively, plants starting growth early in the growing season may be less restricted by soil moisture that often recharges from winter precipitation and is depleted with increased moisture consumption over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sherry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zettlemoyer et al. 2019</xref>), particularly in dry climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Man and Greenway, 2013</xref>). Moisture stress can progressively develop over the season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Piao et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>) and differentially affect exotic and native species with differing spring phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stuble et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Willis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>) The smaller observed responses in flowering of native species suggests reproductive disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">IPCC, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>). The consistent leafing response, however, does not support suggestions that late-start native species would have relatively shorter active growing seasons and, therefore, a competitive growth disadvantages relative to early-start exotic species with climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Morin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Primack and Gallinat, 2016</xref>). Total thermal benefits from climate warming do not differ among species with differing spring phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>). Given the projected increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation for many parts of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">IPCC, 2014</xref>), future studies should assess the differences in drought sensitivity between vegetative and reproductive events and among functional groups and climatic regions.</p>

<title>Boreal vs. temperate region</title>
<p>Spatial variations along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients are often reported but not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Morin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Parmesan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Our analysis indicates smaller observed responses in boreal region (MAT&lt;6 °C) due to less forcing changes (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>), but not to longer phenological lag (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The similar spring warming but less forcing changes suggests that the temperature increases in boreal region occur more frequently in the winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beaubien and Hamann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shen et al., 2015</xref>) when temperatures are below freezing and don’t contribute to spring forcing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Man and Lu, 2010</xref>). The uneven warming has been reported in both natural and experimental settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beaubien and Hamann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Prevéy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Slaney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) and supports the claim that average temperature changes do not represent species-specific forcing changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Keenan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wolkovich et al., 2021</xref>). When forcing changes are held constant, however, observed responses increase with altitude and latitude, as shown by the positive regression coefficients in both leafing and flowering models (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The possible mechanisms behind this may be lower budburst temperature and less moisture stress at higher altitude and latitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rafferty et al., 2020</xref>), as shown by the negative collinearity of altitude and latitude with budburst temperature and phenological lag in both leafing and flowering (data not shown).

Herbs and grasses often resume growth earlier than woody shrubs and trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Badeck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Heberling et al., 2019</xref>) and should have lower budburst temperatures and therefore greater phenological responses to climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Prevéy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wolkovich et al., 2021</xref>). However, different growth forms are often studied separately on sites in different climatic regions, making comparisons challenging. Furthermore, most studies on herb and grass leafing are conducted in boreal region at high altitudes, low MAT, late spring phenology, low forcing changes, and low spring warming (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); the extremely small forcing changes resulted in small observed responses despite lower budburst temperatures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). The observed responses with herbs and grasses would not be smaller if converted to temperature sensitivity (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for large differences in spring warming for leafing).

<title>Mechanistic assessment of changes in spring phenology</title>
<p>Averaged across all observational and experimental studies, observed responses and phenological lags are both positive, suggesting that climate warming advances spring phenology but not at rates expected from changes in spring temperatures. The positive lags are likely due to more stressful environments with warmer and drier climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sherry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>). We quantified phenological lags from changes in spring phenology and temperatures, an approach that does not require species-specific chilling or forcing needs that are often unavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Morin et al., 2009</xref>) or variable in methods of estimation across species and studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Man and Lu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ettinger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The relatively early stage of climate warming and association of longer phenological lags with longer accumulation of winter chilling (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) suggest that current climate warming is not likely to induce a general chilling shortage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ettinger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), although incidental effects on individual species or in particular conditions can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fu et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, the variable and minor effects of photoperiod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Basler and Körner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chuine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ettinger et al., 2020</xref>; Zohner et al., 2016) (insignificant spring phenology; see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) often reported in studies with extreme warming scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Caffarra and Donnelly, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Laube et al., 2014</xref>) or compounded with that of budburst temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>), minor effects by nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Piao et al., 2019</xref>), or incidental spring freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Man et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">2021b</xref>) are not likely to cause the systemic differences in phenological lag between observational and experimental studies or between native and exotic species.</p>
<p>analysis indicates that both forcing change (quantity) and budburst temperature (rate of forcing accumulation) strongly influence the magnitude of change in spring phenology, consistent with the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al. (2021)</xref> that smaller phenological response with late season species are largely due to their higher budburst temperatures. In phenological research, the influence of budburst temperature is not adequately recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">2023</xref>) and can be confounded with progressive increases of phenological lag with greater chilling requirements or insufficient winter chilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Asse et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Morin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Primack and Gallinat, 2016</xref>), photoperiod constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Körner and Basler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Way and Montgomery, 2015</xref>), or moisture stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Piao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wolkovich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zettlemoyer et al., 2019</xref>) suggested for late season species. The difference of the significance in budburst temperatures between leafing and flowering models (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) suggests that the influence of budburst temperatures can be greater if budburst temperatures decrease with the advance of spring phenology and progress of climate warming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). Compared to spring average temperature change that explained &lt;0.5% of the variation in observed responses (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), forcing change quantifies climate warming effect relevant to phenological change of individual species and reduces uneven warming effects among species with different spring phenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>) and areas in different climatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Post et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Both forcing change and budburst temperature can be readily extracted from phenological and temperature data, as demonstrated in this synthesis, but have not been used in assessment of plant phenological changes in spring.</p>

<title>Conclusions and caveats</title>
<p>In this article, we outline an analytical framework to partition phenological changes based on drivers of spring phenology and report differential phenological responses identified through the meta-analysis of observed changes and phenological lag. Longer phenological lag, likely resulting from more stressful environments with warmer and drier climate, helped to explain smaller responses with experimental studies and native plants in flowering, while less forcing changes were mainly responsible for the smaller responses in leafing and flowering in boreal region and in grass leafing. Some of these differential responses are different from those reported previously based on sensitivity analysis.</p>
<p>Our approach does not require species-specific chilling and forcing needs, chilling– forcing relationships, or temperature response models that are often unavailable or variable in methods of estimation across species and studies. As chilling and forcing models reflect physiological aspects of chilling and forcing processes and would not change with climate warming, the use of alternative base temperatures or forcing models would not affect the partitioning of phenological changes, except for derived budburst temperature that represents the rate of forcing accumulation not actual temperatures.</p>
<p>While our method helps to understand changes in spring phenology and differences in plant phenological responses across different functional groups or climatic regions, the ecological implications of phenological lag can be uncertain without investigation of individual constraints. In this synthesis, the effects of photoperiod and insufficient winter chilling are likely limited across all studies with the current level of climate change. In the boreal region with a long winter, insufficient winter chilling is unlikely to occur with the levels of climate warming projected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). Phenological lag indicates the overall lag effect and the need to investigate contributions of individual constraints that can be specifically determined at individual study level if biological and environmental constrains are known from on-site monitoring or previous research.</p>

<p>This study introduces a novel and potentially <bold>valuable</bold> metric-phenological lag-to quantify the gap between observed and expected phenological shifts under climate warming. While the dataset is extensive and the framework is clearly defined, key assumptions (e.g., base temperature, linear forcing response) are not empirically tested, and the analysis underexplores key spatial and climatic gradients. The strength of evidence is mostly <bold>solid</bold> but would benefit from further validation and deeper analysis.</p>

<p>Jiang et al. present a measure of phenological lag by quantifying the effects of abiotic constraints on the differences between observed and expected phenological changes, using a combination of previously published phenology change data for 980 species, and associated climate data for study sites. They found that, across all samples, observed phenological responses to climate warming were smaller than expected responses for both leafing and flowering spring events. They also show that data from experimental studies included in their analysis exhibited increased phenological lag compared to observational studies, possibly as a result of reduced sensitivity to climatic changes. Furthermore, the authors present evidence that spatial trends in phenological responses to warming may differ than what would be expected from phenological sensitivity, due to the seasonal timing of when warming occurs. Thus, climate change may not result in geographic convergences of phenological responses. This study presents an interesting way to separate the individual effects of climate change and other abiotic changes on the phenological responses across sites and species.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A straightforward mathematical definition of phenological lag allows for this method to potentially be applied in different geographic contexts. Where data exists, other researchers can partition the effects of various abiotic forcings on phenological responses that differ from those expected from warming sensitivity alone.</p>
<p>Identifying phenological lag, and associated contributing factors, provides a method by which more nuanced predictions of phenological responses to climate change can be made. Thus, this study could improve ecological forecasting models.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The analysis here could be more robust. A more thorough examination of phenological lag would provide stronger evidence that the framework presented has utility. The differences in phenologica lag by study approach, species origin, region, and growth form are interesting, and could be expanded. For example, the authors have the data to explore the relationships between phenological lag and the quantitative variables included in the final model (altitude, latitude, mean annual temperature) and other spatial or temporal variables. This would also provide stronger evidence for the author's claims about potential mechanisms that contribute to phenological lag.</p>
<p>The authors include very little data visualizations, and instead report results and model statistics in tables. This is difficult to interpret and may obscure underlying patterns in the data. Including visual representations of variable distributions and between-variable relationships, in addition to model statistics, provides stronger evidence than model statistics alone.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Greater phenological lag with experimental studies results in reduced sensitivity to climatic changes, not other way around.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A clearly defined and straightforward mathematical definition of phenological lag allows for this method to be applied in different scientific contexts.

</disp-quote>
<p>Sensitivity does not tell the magnitude of phenological changes, nor does it provide indications of mechanisms responsible for changes in spring phenology. Because of uneven warming, the same average temperature change (annual or spring temperatures) can have greater (greater warming prior to budburst) or smaller (smaller warming prior to budburst) phenological change than that with even warming. When average temperature change is close to zero, uneven warming can lead to infinite sensitivity values, either advanced (warmer temperatures prior to budburst) or delayed (cooler temperatures prior to budburst) spring phenology.</p>
<p>It is not clear why sensitivity is so popularly used in phenological research.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We used two statistical methods, variance analysis to examine differential phenological responses (Figure 2) and regression analysis to determine the relative importance of forcing change, budburst temperature, and physiological lag, the drivers of changes in spring phenology (Table 2). Our objective was to understand why plants show differential responses by research approach, species origin, climatic region, and growth form identified in previous research. Variable selection may affect minor (altitude, latitude, MAT, and average spring temperature change) or insignificant (photoperiod and long-term precipitation) variables, but not those related to drivers of spring phenology. We are not sure how hypothesis-driven approach can help with our objective.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a meta-analysis of the relative contributions of spring forcing temperature, winter chilling, photoperiod and environmental variables in explaining plant flowering and leafing phenology. The authors develop a new summary variable called phenology lag to describe why species might have different responses than predicted by spring temperature.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The summary statistic is used to make a variety of comparisons, such as between observational studies and experimental studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>By combining winter chilling effects, photoperiod effects, and environmental stresses that might affect phenology, the authors create a new variable that is hard to interpret. The authors do not provide information in the abstract about new insights that this variable provides.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Phenological lag contains effects of all constraints that may include chilling effects, photoperiod effects, and environmental stresses and is, indeed, hard to interpret without investigation of individual constraints. In our synthesis, spring phenology (or photoperiod effect) is not significant across all studies complied. It is also unlikely that lack of winter chilling causes the systemic differences in phenological lag between observational and experimental studies or between native and exotic species (see discussion at lines 335-339). At individual study level, the contribution of different constraints to the overall lag effect can be specifically determined if moisture stresses, species chilling and photoperiod effects, or cold hardiness are known from on-site monitoring or previous research.</p>
<p>The meaning of phenological lag is described at lines 34-38 in the abstract.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>It would be useful to have a map showing the sites of the studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A map showing the sites of the studies was added as supplementary Figure S1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should provide a section in which the strengths and weaknesses of the approach are discussed. Is it possible that mixing different types of data, studies, sample sizes, number of years, experimental set-ups, and growth habits results in artifacts that influence the results?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Both strengths and weaknesses are discussed at various places throughout the paper. The weakness of our method, as indicated by the reviewer, is the inclusion of different constraints in the phenological lag and has been described at lines 34-38 in the abstract and lines 80-86 in the introduction of the concept. We have also expanded Conclusion section to discuss possible caveats at lines 369-393.</p>
<p>As in all data analyses, the results can change with addition of more/different data, especially when sample size is relatively small. Ideally, comparisons are made among levels of fixed effects while controlling variations of other conditions. In phenological studies, however, climatic, phenological, and biological conditions all vary. For example, observational and experimental studies differ not only in the nature of warming (natural climate change vs artificial warming), but also in levels of warming (greater warming with experimental studies) and climatic, phenological, and biological conditions (Table 1). All phenological syntheses (or meta-analyses) have to make do with this uncontrolled nature of phenological data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Now that the authors have created this new variable, phenological lag, which of the components that contribute to it has the most influence on it? Or which components are most influential in which circumstances? For example, what are some examples where photoperiod causes a phenological lag?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Any of the phenological constraints identified can contribute alone or in combination with others to the overall effect of phenological lag. Across all studies with this synthesis, the lack of significance with spring phenology rules out photoperiod effect, while the association of longer phenological lags with longer accumulation of winter chilling does not suggest general chilling shortage with the current extent of climate change.</p>
<p>Although spring phenology is not significant across all studies, photoperiod effect can be influential at individual studies where changes in spring phenology are large. However, reported photoperiod effects in the literature are mostly confounding effects with temperatures, i.e., longer photoperiods are associated with longer hours of high daytime temperatures (see Chu et al., 2021). Other than European beech under an unlikely scenario of climate change (growth resumes at beginning of winter), there has been not clear evidence showing the effect of photoperiod in constraining spring phenology.</p>
<p>Another confounding effect with photoperiod is extra heating effect with artificial light sources in warming experiments. Some early studies have shown that leaf temperature can be several degrees above the ambient air, due to long-wave radiation with artificial light sources. It is hard to believe the constraining effect of photoperiod on spring phenology if phenological changes are within inter-annual variations (can be a few weeks), although photoperiod effect has been increasingly discussed recently.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p>
<p>A key methodological concern is the inconsistent definition of growth temperature across observations. It is calculated over the interval between the baseline phenological date and the expected date under warming - a window that varies by species, site, and treatment. This variability limits comparability across observations and may introduce circularity, as growth temperature is derived from the same modelled expectation (i.e., the expected phenological advance) that it is later used to explain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The term “growth temperature” has been replaced with “budburst temperature” to indicate temperatures at species events. Budburst temperature is the average temperature within the window of expected response with the warmer climate and, as indicated by the editor, varies by species, sites, and treatments. This species-specific temperature provides an opportunity to compare among species, sites, and treatments and helps explain differences in observed responses, as demonstrated in the discussion of results in this synthesis.</p>
<p>Forcing change, budburst temperature, and expected response are related. High budburst temperatures are associated with smaller expected responses, which helps explain smaller observed responses with late season species and areas of warm climates that have been often attributed to chilling or photoperiod effect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the use of degree days above 0 {degree sign}C as a universal metric for spring forcing oversimplifies species' temperature responses. This approach assumes not only a fixed base temperature but also a linear response to temperature accumulation, which overlooks well-established nonlinear or species-specific thermal response curves. To improve the robustness and interpretability of the phenological lag framework, we encourage the authors to consider these limitations and explore ways to test or justify these modelling assumptions more explicitly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The use of 0 degree base temperature may not be the best choice for some species. Except for some early work, there has been few experimental research on physiological aspects of chilling and forcing processes. A popular alternative is modelling using assumed temperature response models. As variables influencing chilling and forcing processes are not controlled, the determined base temperatures and temperature response models may be OK with the species studied under particular conditions but would be inappropriate for applications beyond. It is hard to believe that species, in a study, all have different base temperature for accumulation of spring forcing and optimum temperature for winter chilling. Apparently, this is the result of model fitting, not actual dynamics of chilling and forcing processes.</p>
<p>Two base temperatures are commonly used, 0 and 5 oC, although choice is not generally justified. It is known for long time that temperatures above 0oC contribute to spring forcing. My personal experience at tree nursery suggests that seedlings will flush after winter cold storage, even at forcing temperatures ≤ 5 oC in the dark. The use of 5 oC is rather the choice of tradition (5 oC is commonly used to define growing season) than scientific justification. The use of high base temperatures may not make much difference at high temperatures due to short forcing duration but will underestimate forcing at low temperatures due to long forcing duration and large proportions of forcing between 0 and base temperatures. We are not aware of any experimental studies that demonstrate non-zero base temperatures.</p>
<p>Within the dominant range of spring temperatures (e.g., between 5 and 25 oC), the forcing responses to temperatures can be approximated with linear models. Again, we are not aware of any non-linear forcing models that can be safely applied beyond the species studied under particular conditions.</p>
<p>Regardless, the uses of different base temperatures or forcing models would not affect the partitioning of phenological changes, simply because temperature response models reflect physiological aspects of chilling and forcing processes and would not change with climate warming.</p>

<p>The authors introduce a new metric, phenological lag, to assess how phenological constraints influence spring phenology, offering new insights into phenological research. However, there are several concerns. First, the research question and the study's aim are not clearly presented. The authors primarily analyzed phenological lag and simply compared it across different groups, but additional analyses are needed to adequately address the research question. In addition, the broader importance of this study is not clearly explained - why this research is necessary and what it contributes to the field should be explicitly stated.</p>

<p>The research question is outlined at lines 92-108. We added “Our objective was to determine how phenological responses differ among different groups and how differential responses are related to drivers of spring phenology, i.e., forcing change, budburst temperature, and phenological lag” at lines 106-108.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The two variables are related but show different aspects of phenological changes. Observed response divided by average temperature change gives temperature sensitivity. Observed response is the total changes in number of days observed, while temperature sensitivity is the change in number of days per unit change in average temperature (oC). Sensitivity may reflects rates of phenological change with temperature (see responses to reviewer 1).</p>

<p>(12) In the discussion section, the authors compared phenological responses among different groups separately. This section requires substantial improvement to more clearly answer the research question.</p>

<p>These discussions are related to our objective “how phenological responses differ among different groups identified in previous research (i.e., research approach, species origin, climatic region, and growth form) and how these differential responses are related to drivers of spring phenology, i.e., forcing change, budburst temperature, and phenological lag”.</p>
