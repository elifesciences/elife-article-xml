<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Changes in the intracellular concentration of free calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) underpin egg activation and initiation of development in animals and plants. In mammals, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is periodical, known as Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, and mediated by the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R1). Another divalent cation, zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), increases exponentially during oocyte maturation and is vital for meiotic transitions, arrests, and polyspermy prevention. It is unknown if these pivotal cations interplay during fertilization. Here, using mouse eggs, we showed that basal concentrations of labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> are indispensable for sperm-initiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations because Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient conditions induced by cell-permeable chelators abrogated Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses evoked by fertilization and other physiological and pharmacological agonists. We also found that chemically-or genetically generated eggs with lower levels of labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> displayed reduced IP<sub>3</sub>R1 sensitivity and diminished ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak despite the stable content of the stores and IP<sub>3</sub>R1 mass. Resupplying Zn<sup>2+</sup> restarted Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, but excessive Zn<sup>2+</sup> prevented and terminated them, hindering IP<sub>3</sub>R1 responsiveness. The findings suggest that a window of Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations is required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function in eggs, ensuring optimal response to fertilization and egg activation.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>The revised version of the manuscript contains the following main modifications:
1- A new supplementary figure, Fig. 1A, and B, has been added to address a concern of reviewer I. An accompanying explanation has been in the Results section under the first subheading.
2- We have added multiple new citations to our reference list, as suggested by reviewer I.
3-The genetically modified embryos that display lower Zn2+ levels are now identified as low-level labile Zn2+ eggs rather than Zn2+ deficient following the suggestion of reviewer I. This description was noted in the Abstract and in the Results section under the subheading starting with Zn2+ depletion diminishes the ER.
4-We have added alternative interpretations to the inhibitory actions of excess Zn2+ on Ca2+ oscillations following the suggestions of the reviewer. These additional explanations have been added to the Discussion section.
5-In response to the comments of reviewer II, we have added additional explanations to support our interpretation that the increased dye fluorescence following the ZnPT is most likely responding to higher Zn2+ levels rather than representing an increase in basal Ca2+ concentrations. This information has been added in the last subheading of the Results section.
6-All other editorial changes suggested, and minor clarifications of procedures or reagent concentrations requested by the reviewers have been included.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vertebrate eggs are arrested at the metaphase stage of the second meiosis (MII) when ovulated because they have an active Cdk1/cyclin B complex and inactive APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Heim et al., 2018</xref>). Release from MII initiates egg activation, the first hallmark of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ducibella et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Schultz and Kopf, 1995</xref>). The universal signal of egg activation is an increase in the intracellular concentration of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ridgway et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Stricker, 1999</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> release causes the inactivation of the APC/C inhibitor Emi2, which enhances cyclin B degradation and induces meiotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lorca et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shoji et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Suzuki et al., 2010a</xref>). In mammals, the stereotypical fertilization Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, oscillations, consists of transient but periodical Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases that promote progression into interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deguchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Miyazaki et al., 1986</xref>). The sperm-borne Phospholipase C zeta1 (PLCζ) persistently stimulates the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Matsu-ura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Saunders et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Wu et al., 2001</xref>) that binds its cognate receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), IP<sub>3</sub>R1 and causes Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the egg’s main Ca<sup>2+</sup> reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wakai et al., 2019</xref>). The intake of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> via plasma membrane channels and transporters ensures the persistence of the oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Stein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wakai et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Before fertilization, maturing oocytes undergo cellular and biochemical modifications (see for review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ajduk et al., 2008</xref>)). The nucleus of immature oocytes, known as the germinal vesicle (GV), undergoes the breakdown of its envelope marking the onset of maturation and setting in motion a series of cellular events that culminate with the release of the first polar body, the correct ploidy for fertilization, and re-arrest at MII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Eppig, 1996</xref>). Other organelles are also reorganized, such as cortical granules migrate to the cortex for exocytosis and polyspermy block, mitochondria undergo repositioning, and the cytoplasm’s redox state becomes progressively reduced to promote the exchange of the sperm’s protamine load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Liu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Perreault et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wakai et al., 2014</xref>). Wide-ranging adaptations also occur in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release machinery to produce timely and protracted Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations following sperm entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fujiwara et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lawrence et al., 1998</xref>), including the increase in the content of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, ER reorganization with cortical cluster formation, and increased IP<sub>3</sub>R1 sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wakai et al., 2012</xref>). The total intracellular levels of zinc (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) also remarkably increase during maturation, amounting to a 50% rise, which is necessary for oocytes to proceed to the telophase I of meiosis and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, after fertilization, Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels need to decrease, as Emi2 is a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-associated molecule, and high Zn<sup>2</sup> levels prevent MII exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bernhardt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shoji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Suzuki et al., 2010b</xref>). Following the initiation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, approximately 10 to 20% of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> accrued during maturation is ejected during the Zn<sup>2+</sup> sparks, a conserved event in vertebrates and invertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Converse and Thomas, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mendoza et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Que et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Seeler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Tokuhiro and Dean, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Wozniak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The use of Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelators such as N,N,N,N-tetrakis (2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethylenediamine (TPEN) to create Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient conditions buttressed the importance of Zn<sup>2+</sup> during meiotic transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Suzuki et al., 2010b</xref>). However, whether the analogous dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> during maturation imply crosstalk and Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release during fertilization is unknown.</p>
<p>IP<sub>3</sub>Rs are the most abundant intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel in non-muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Berridge, 2016</xref>). They form a channel by assembling into tetramers with each subunit of ∼270kDa MW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Taylor and Tovey, 2010</xref>). Mammalian eggs express the type I IP<sub>3</sub>R, the most widespread isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fissore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Parrington et al., 1998</xref>). IP<sub>3</sub>R1 is essential for egg activation because its inhibition precludes Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Miyazaki and Ito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Miyazaki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). Myriad and occasionally cell-specific factors influence Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the IP<sub>3</sub>R1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Taylor and Tovey, 2010</xref>). For example, following fertilization, IP<sub>3</sub>R1 undergoes ligand-induced degradation caused by the sperm-initiated long-lasting production of IP<sub>3</sub> that effectively reduces the IP<sub>3</sub>R1 mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brind et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jellerette et al., 2000</xref>). Another regulatory mechanism is Ca<sup>2+</sup>, a universal cofactor, which biphasically regulates IP<sub>3</sub>Rs’ channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Iino, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jean and Klee, 1986</xref>), congruent with several Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin binding sites on the channel’s sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Sienaert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sipma et al., 1999</xref>). Notably, Zn<sup>2+</sup> may also participate in IP<sub>3</sub>R1 regulation. Recent studies using electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM), a technique that allows peering into the structure of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 with a near-atomic resolution, have revealed that a helical linker (LNK) domain near the C-terminus mediates the coupling between the N-and C-terminal ends necessary for channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). The LNK domain contains a putative Zinc-finger motif proposed to be vital for IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Paknejad and Hite, 2018</xref>). Therefore, the exponential increase in Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels in maturing oocytes, besides its essential role in meiosis progression, may optimize the IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function, revealing hitherto unknown cooperation between these cations during fertilization.</p>
<p>Here, we examined whether crosstalk between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> is required to initiate and sustain Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and maintain Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content in MII eggs. We found that Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient conditions inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and oscillations without reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, IP<sub>3</sub> production, IP<sub>3</sub>R1 expression, or altering the viability of eggs or zygotes. We show instead that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency impaired IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function and lessened the receptor’s ability to gate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release out of the ER. Remarkably, resupplying Zn<sup>2+</sup> re-established the oscillations interrupted by low Zn<sup>2+</sup>, although persistent increases in intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> were harmful, disrupting the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and preventing egg activation. Together, the results show that besides contributing to oocyte maturation, Zn<sup>2+</sup> has a central function in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis such that optimal Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ensure IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations required for initiating embryo development.</p>

<title>TPEN dose-dependently lowers intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> and inhibits sperm-initiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations</title>
<p>TPEN is a cell-permeable, non-specific chelator with a high affinity for transition metals widely used to study their function in cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arslan et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lo et al., 2020</xref>). Mouse oocytes and eggs have exceedingly high intracellular concentrations of Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2010</xref>), and the TPEN-induced defects in the progression of meiosis have been ascribed to its chelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bernhardt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). In support of this view, the Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels of cells showed acute reduction after TPEN addition, as reported by indicators such as FluoZin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arslan et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Suzuki et al., 2010b</xref>). Studies in mouse eggs also showed that the addition of low µM (40-100) concentrations of TPEN disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations initiated by fertilization or SrCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lawrence et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Suzuki et al., 2010b</xref>), but the mechanism(s) and target(s) of the inhibition remained unknown. To gain insight into this phenomenon, we first performed dose-titration studies to determine the effectiveness of TPEN in lowering Zn<sup>2+</sup> in eggs. The addition of 2.5 µM TPEN protractedly reduced Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels, whereas 5 and 10 µM TPEN acutely and persistently reduced FluoZin-3 fluorescence (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). These concentrations of TPEN are higher than the reported free Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in cells, but within range of those of found in typical culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Qin et al., 2011</xref>). We next determined the concentrations of TPEN required to abrogate fertilization-initiated oscillations. Following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), we monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses while increasing TPEN concentrations. As shown in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>, 5 and 10 µM TPEN effectively blocked ICSI-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in over half of the treated cells, and the remaining eggs, after a prolonged interval, resumed lower-frequency rises (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>-center panels). Finally, 50 µM or greater concentrations of TPEN permanently blocked these oscillations (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>-right panel). It is noteworthy that at the time of addition, TPEN concentrations of 5 µM or above induce a sharp drop in basal Fura-2 F340/ F380 ratios, consistent with Fura-2’s high affinity for Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Snitsarev et al., 1996</xref>). We next used membrane-permeable and -impermeable chelators to assess whether TPEN inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by chelating Zn<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular or extracellular compartments. The addition of the high-affinity but cell-impermeable Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelators DTPA and EDTA neither terminated nor temporarily interrupted ICSI-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>), although protractedly slowed them down, possibly because of chelation and lowering of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>). These results suggest that chelation of external Zn<sup>2+</sup> does not affect the continuation of oscillations. We cannot determine that EDTA successfully chelated all external Zn<sup>2+</sup>, but the evidence that the addition of EDTA to the monitoring media containing cell impermeable FluoZin-3 caused a marked reduction in fluorescence, suggests that a noticeable fraction of the available Zn<sup>2+</sup> was sequestered (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). Similarly, injection of m<italic>Plcζ</italic> mRNA in eggs incubated in Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free media supplemented with EDTA, to maximize the chances of chelation of external Zn<sup>2+</sup>, initiated low-frequency but persistent oscillations, and addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> restored the physiological periodicity (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). Lastly, another Zn<sup>2+</sup>-permeable chelator, TPA, blocked the ICSI-initiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations but required higher concentrations than TPEN (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). Collectively, the data suggest that basal levels of labile internal Zn<sup>2+</sup> are essential to sustain the fertilization-initiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in eggs.</p>

<title>TPEN is a universal inhibitor of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in eggs</title>
<p>Mammalian eggs initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in response to numerous stimuli and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Miyazaki and Ito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wakai and Fissore, 2013</xref>). Fertilization and its release of PLCζ stimulate the phosphoinositide pathway, producing IP<sub>3</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Miyazaki, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Saunders et al., 2002</xref>). Neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (Ach) and other G-protein coupled receptor agonists engage a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dupont et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kang et al., 2003</xref>), although in these cases, IP<sub>3</sub> production occurs at the plasma membrane and is short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Swann and Parrington, 1999</xref>). Agonists such as SrCl<sub>2</sub> and thimerosal generate oscillations by sensitizing IP<sub>3</sub>R1 without producing IP<sub>3</sub>. The mechanism(s) of SrCl<sub>2</sub> is unclear, although its actions are reportedly directly on the IP<sub>3</sub>R1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hajnóczky and Thomas, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hamada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nomikos et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sanders et al., 2018</xref>). Thimerosal oxidizes dozens of thiol groups in the receptor, which enhances the receptor’s sensitivity and ability to release Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bootman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Evellin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>). We took advantage of the varied points at which the mentioned agonists engage the phosphoinositide pathway to examine TPEN’s effectiveness in inhibiting their effects. m<italic>Plcζ</italic> mRNA injection, like fertilization, induces persistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, although m<italic>Plcζ</italic>’s tends to be more robust. Consistent with this, the addition of 10 and 25 µM TPEN transiently interrupted or belatedly terminated oscillations, whereas 50 µM acutely stopped all responses (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). By contrast, SrCl<sub>2</sub>-initiated rises were the most sensitive to Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient conditions, with 2.5 µM TPEN nearly terminating all oscillations that 5 µM did (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). TPEN was equally effective in ending the Ach-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>), but curbing thimerosal responses required higher concentrations (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). Lastly, we ruled out that downregulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 was responsible for the slow-down or termination of the oscillations by TPEN. To accomplish this, we examined the IP<sub>3</sub>R1 mass in eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jellerette et al., 2004</xref>) with and without TPEN supplementation and injection of m<italic>Plc</italic>ζ mRNA.

These findings together show that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency inhibits the IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations independently of IP<sub>3</sub> production or loss of receptor, suggesting a role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Zn<sup>2+</sup> depletion reduces IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release</title>
<p>To directly assess the inhibitory effects of TPEN on IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function, we used caged IP<sub>3</sub> (cIP<sub>3</sub>) that, after short UV pulses, releases IP<sub>3</sub> into the ooplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wakai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Walker et al., 1987</xref>). To exclude the possible contribution of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the responses, we performed the experiments in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free media. In response to sequential cIP<sub>3</sub> release 5 min apart, control eggs displayed corresponding Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises that occasionally transitioned into short-lived oscillations (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). The addition of TPEN after the third cIP<sub>3</sub> release prevented the subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> response and prematurely terminated the in-progress Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold> and inset). Pre-incubation of eggs with TPEN precluded cIP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, even after 5 sec UV exposure (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). The addition of excess ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (100 µM) overcame TPEN’s inhibitory effects only if added before (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>) and not after the addition of TPEN (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref></bold>). Similar concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> or CaCl<sub>2</sub> failed to reverse TPEN effects (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F, G</xref></bold>). Together, the results show that Zn<sup>2+</sup> is required for IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release downstream of IP<sub>3</sub> production, appearing to interfere with receptor gating, as suggested by TPEN’s rapid termination of in-progress Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises and ongoing oscillations.</p>

<p>ERp44 is an ER luminal protein of the thioredoxin family that interacts with the IP<sub>3</sub>R1, reportedly inhibiting its ability to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Higo et al., 2005</xref>). The localization of ERp44 in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment of somatic cells correlates with Zn<sup>2+</sup>’s availability and changes dramatically after TPEN treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Higo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>). To rule out the possibility that TPEN suppresses the function of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 by modifying the subcellular distribution of ERp44, we overexpressed ERp44 by injecting HA tagged-<italic>Erp44</italic> mRNA into MII eggs and monitored the effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. TPEN did not alter the localization of ERp44 (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2A</xref></bold>), and overexpression of ERp44 modified neither the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations induced by agonists (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2B</xref></bold>) nor the effectiveness of TPEN to block them (data not shown). Thus, TPEN and Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency most likely inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by directly interfering with IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function rather than modifying this particular regulator.</p>

<title>Zn<sup>2+</sup> depletion diminishes the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak and increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content</title>
<p>Our above cIP<sub>3</sub> results that TPEN inhibited IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and interrupted in-progress Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises despite the presence of high levels of environmental IP<sub>3</sub> suggest its actions are probably independent of IP<sub>3</sub> binding, agreeing with an earlier report showing that TPEN did not modify IP<sub>3</sub>’s affinity for the IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Richardson and Taylor, 1993</xref>). Additionally, the presence of a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding motif near the C-term cytoplasmic domain of the IP<sub>3</sub>R1’s channel, which is known to influence agonist-induced IP<sub>3</sub>R1 gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fan et al., 2015</xref>), led us to posit and examine that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency may be disturbing Ca<sup>2+</sup> release to the cytosol and out of the ER. To probe this possibility, we queried if pre-treatment with TPEN inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through IP<sub>3</sub>R1. We first used Thapsigargin (Tg), a Sarcoplasmic/ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase pump inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Thastrup et al., 1990</xref>) that unmasks a constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak out of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lemos et al., 2021</xref>); in eggs, we have demonstrated it is mediated at least in part by IP<sub>3</sub>R1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wakai et al., 2019</xref>). Treatment with TPEN for 15 min slowed the Tg-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak into the cytosol, resulting in delayed and lowered amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). To test whether the reduced response to Tg means that TPEN left a temporarily increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in the ER after it, we added the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin (Io), which empties all stores independently of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs. Io-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were 3.3-fold greater in TPEN-treated cells, supporting the view that TPEN interferes with the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). We further evaluated this concept using <italic>in vitro</italic> aged eggs that often display reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content than freshly collected counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbott et al., 1998</xref>). After culturing eggs in the presence or absence of TPEN for 2h, we added Io during Ca<sup>2+</sup> monitoring, which in TPEN-treated eggs induced bigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises than in control eggs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>; <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05). We confirmed that this effect was independent of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 degradation because TPEN did not change IP<sub>3</sub>R1 reactivity in unfertilized eggs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>; <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05).</p>

<p>Next, we used the genetically encoded FRET sensor D1ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Palmer et al., 2004</xref>) to assess the TPEN’s effect on the ER’s relative Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels changes following the additions of Tg or Ach.

For the first three min, the Tg-induced decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ER was similar between groups. However, while the drop in Ca<sup>2+</sup> content continued in control eggs, in TPEN-treated eggs, it came to an abrupt halt, generating profound differences between the two groups (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>; <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05).

<p>Lastly, we sought to use a cellular model where low labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> occurred without pharmacology. To this end, we examined a genetic model where the two non-selective plasma membrane channels that could influx Zn<sup>2+</sup> in maturing oocytes have been deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bernhardt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Carvacho et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">2013</xref>), namely, the transient receptor potential melastatin-7 (TRPM7) and TRP vanilloid 3 (TRPV3), both members of the TRP superfamily of channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). We found that eggs from double knockout females (dKOs) had lower levels of labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref></bold>), and the addition of Tg revealed an expanded Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content in these eggs vs. control WT eggs (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref></bold>).

<p>A noticeable feature of ZnPT is the increased basal ratios of Fura-2 AM. These changes could reflect enhanced IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function and increased basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations caused by Zn<sup>2+</sup> stimulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R1. This seems unlikely, however, because extended elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> would probably induce cellular responses, such as the release of the second polar body, egg fragmentation, or cell death, neither of which happened. It might reflect, instead, Fura-2’s ability to report changes in Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels, which seemed the case because the addition of TPEN lowered fluorescence without restarting the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref></bold>). To ensure the impact of ZnPT abolishing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations was not an imaging artifact obscuring ongoing rises, we simultaneously monitored cytoplasmic and ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with Rhod-2 and D1ER, respectively. This approach allowed synchronously observing Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in both compartments that should unfold in opposite directions. In control, uninjected eggs, the fluorescent values for both reporters remained unchanged during the monitoring period, whereas in m<italic>Plc</italic>ζ mRNA-injected eggs, the reporters’ signals displayed simultaneous but opposite changes, as expected (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H, I</xref></bold>). The addition of ZnPT in uninjected eggs rapidly increased Rhod-2 signals but not D1ER’s, which was also the case in oscillating eggs, as the addition of ZnPT did not immediately alter the dynamics of the ER’s Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, suggesting D1ER faithfully reports in Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes but cannot detect changes in Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels, at least to this extent; ZnPT progressively caused fewer and lower amplitude changes in D1ER fluorescence, consistent with the diminishing and eventual termination of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Noteworthy, in these eggs, the basal D1ER fluorescent ratio remained unchanged after ZnPT, demonstrating its unresponsiveness to Zn<sup>2+</sup> changes of this magnitude. The ZnPT-induced increases in Rhod-2 fluorescence without concomitant changes in D1ER values suggest that the changes in the dyes’ fluorescence do not represent an increase in basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and, more likely, signal an increase in intracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup>. We confirmed that both reporters were still in working order, as the addition of Io triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes detected by both reporters (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H, I</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study demonstrates that appropriate levels of labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> are essential for initiating and maintaining IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in mouse eggs regardless of the initiating stimuli. Both deficient and excessive Zn<sup>2+</sup> compromise IP<sub>3</sub>R1 sensitivity, diminishing and mostly terminating Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. The results demonstrate that IP<sub>3</sub>R1 and Zn<sup>2+</sup> act in concert to modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, revealing previously unexplored crosstalk between these ions at fertilization (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref></bold>).</p>

<caption><title>Schematic of proposed regulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function by Zn<sup>2+</sup> in eggs and fertilized zygotes.</title>
<p>In MII eggs, left panel, IP<sub>3</sub>R1s are in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release permissive state with optimal levels of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> and maximum ER content, but Ca<sup>2+</sup> is maintained at resting levels by the combined actions of pumps, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak, and reduced influx. Once fertilization takes place, left center panel, robust IP<sub>3</sub> production induced by the sperm-borne PLCζ leads to Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through ligand-induced gating of IP<sub>3</sub>R1. Continuous IP<sub>3</sub> production and refilling of the stores via Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx ensure the persistence of the oscillations. Zn<sup>2+</sup> release occurs in association with first few Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises and cortical granule exocytosis, Zn<sup>2+</sup> sparks, lowering Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels but not sufficiently to inhibit IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function. Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency caused by TPEN or other permeable Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelators, right center panel, dose-dependently impairs IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function and limits Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. We propose this is accomplished by stripping the Zn<sup>2+</sup> bound to the residues of the zinc-finger motif in the LNK domain of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 that prevents the allosteric modulation of the gating process induced by IP<sub>3</sub> or other agonists. We propose that excess Zn<sup>2+</sup>, right panel, also inhibits IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, possibly by non-specific binding of thiol groups present in cysteine residues throughout the receptor (denoted by a ?). We submit that optimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in mouse eggs unfold in the presence of a permissive range of Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentration.</p></caption>

<p>Zn<sup>2+</sup> is an essential micronutrient for living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kaur et al., 2014</xref>) and is required for various cellular functions, such as proliferation, transcription, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Maret and Li, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Yamasaki et al., 2007</xref>). Studies using Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelators have uncovered what appears to be a cell-specific, narrow window of Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations needed for cellular proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Carraway and Dobner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lo et al., 2020</xref>). Further, TPEN appeared especially harmful, and in a few cell lines, even low doses provoked oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mendivil-Perez et al., 2012</xref>). We show here that none of the Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelators, permeable or impermeable, affected cell viability within our experimental observations, confirming findings from previous studies that employed high concentrations of TPEN to interrupt the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lawrence et al., 1998</xref>) or inducing egg activation of mouse eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Suzuki et al., 2010b</xref>). Our data demonstrating that ∼2.5 µM is the threshold concentration of TPEN in eggs that first causes noticeable changes in basal Zn<sup>2+</sup>, as revealed by FluoZin, is consistent with the ∼2 to 5-µM Zn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in most culture media without serum supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lo et al., 2020</xref>), and with the ∼100 pM basal Zn<sup>2+</sup> in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Qin et al., 2011</xref>). Lastly, the effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release observed here with TPEN and other chelators were due to the chelation of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, as pretreatment with ZnSO<sub>4</sub> but not with equal or greater concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> or CaCl<sub>2</sub> rescued the inhibition of the responses, which is consistent with results by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lawrence et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify how Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in eggs, we induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations using various stimuli and tested the effectiveness of membrane-permeable and impermeable chelators to abrogate them. Chelation of extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> failed to terminate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, whereas membrane-permeable chelators did, pointing to intracellular labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels as essential for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. All agonists used here were susceptible to inhibition by TPEN, whether their activities depended on IP<sub>3</sub> production or allosterically induced receptor function, although the effective TPEN concentrations varied across stimuli. Some agents, such as m<italic>Plc</italic>ζ mRNA or thimerosal, required higher concentrations than SrCl<sub>2</sub>, Ach, or cIP<sub>3</sub>. The reason underlying the different agonists’ sensitivities to TPEN will require additional research, but the persistence of IP<sub>3</sub> production or change in IP<sub>3</sub>R1 structure needed to induce channel gating might explain it. However, the universal abrogation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by TPEN supports the view drawn from cryo-EM-derived IP<sub>3</sub>R1 models that signaling molecules can allosterically induce channel gating from different starting positions in the receptor by mechanically coupling the binding effect to the ion-conducting pore in the C-terminal end of IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). The cytosolic C-terminal domain of each IP<sub>3</sub>R1 subunit is alongside the IP<sub>3</sub>-binding domain of another subunit and, therefore, well positioned to sense IP<sub>3</sub> binding and induce channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). Within each subunit, the LNK domain, which contains a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fan et al., 2015</xref>), connects the opposite domains of the molecule. Although there are no reports regarding the regulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 sensitivity by Zn<sup>2+</sup>, such evidence exists for RyRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Woodier et al., 2015</xref>), which also display a conserved Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">des Georges et al., 2016</xref>). Lastly, mutations of the two Cys or two His residues of this motif, without exception, resulted in inhibition or inactivation of the IP<sub>3</sub>R1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bhanumathy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Uchida et al., 2003</xref>). These results are consistent with the view that the C-terminal end of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs plays a dominant role in channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bhanumathy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Uchida et al., 2003</xref>). We propose that TPEN inhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in mouse eggs because chelating Zn<sup>2+</sup> interferes with the function of the LNK domain and its Zn<sup>2+</sup>-finger motif proposed role on the mechanical coupling induced by agonist binding to the receptor that propagates to the pore-forming region and required to gate the channel’s ion-pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fan et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2015</xref>).</p>
<p>In support of this possibility, TPEN-induced Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficient conditions altered the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-releasing kinetics in resting eggs or after fertilization. Tg increases intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by inhibiting the SERCA pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Thastrup et al., 1990</xref>) and preventing the reuptake into the ER of the ebbing Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the basal leak. Our previous studies showed that the downregulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R1 diminishes the leak, suggesting it occurs through IP<sub>3</sub>R1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wakai and Fissore, 2019</xref>). Consistent with this view, TPEN pre-treatment delayed the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response induced by Tg, implying that Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficiency hinders Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through IP<sub>3</sub>R1. An expected consequence would be increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> content in the ER after Tg. Io that mobilizes Ca<sup>2+</sup> independently of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Toeplitz et al., 1979</xref>) induced enhanced responses in TPEN-treated eggs vs. controls, confirming the accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ER in Zn<sup>2+</sup> deficient conditions. We demonstrated that this accumulation is due to hindered emptying of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ER evoked by agonists in Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient environments, resulting in reduced cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases, as IP<sub>3</sub>R1 is the pivotal intermediary channel between these compartments. Noteworthy, the initial phase of the Tg-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release out of the ER did not appear modified by TPEN, as if it was mediated by a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel(s)/transporter, contrasting with the abrogation of Ach-induced ER emptying from the outset. Remarkably, independently of Zn<sup>2+</sup> chelators, emptying of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ER was modified in a genetic model of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-deficient oocytes lacking two TRP channels, confirming the impact of Zn<sup>2+</sup> on Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. It is worth noting that TPEN did not reduce but maintained or increased the mass of IP<sub>3</sub>R1, which might result in the inhibition of Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent ubiquitin ligase Ubc7 by the Zn-deficient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Webster et al., 2003</xref>). We cannot rule out that these conditions may undermine other conformational changes required to trigger IP<sub>3</sub>R1 degradation, thereby favoring the accumulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R1.</p>
<p>Despite accruing Zn<sup>2+</sup> during oocyte maturation, fertilization witnesses a necessary Zn<sup>2+</sup> release into the external milieu, known as “Zn<sup>2+</sup> sparks” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Que et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">2015</xref>). This release of Zn<sup>2+</sup> is a conserved event in fertilization across species and is associated with several biological functions, including those related to fending off polyspermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Que et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Wozniak et al., 2020</xref>). The concomitant decrease in Zn<sup>2+</sup> facilitates the resumption of the cell cycle and exit from the MII stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Congruent with this observation, artificial manipulation that maintains high Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels prevents egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), whereas lowering Zn<sup>2+</sup> with chelators leads to egg activation without Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Suzuki et al., 2010b</xref>). As posed by others, these results suggest that meiosis completion and the early stages of fertilization unfold within a narrow window of permissible Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2010</xref>). Here, we extend this concept and show that IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in mouse eggs require this optimal level of labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> because the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses interrupted by TPEN-induced Zn<sup>2+</sup>-insufficiency are rescued by restoring Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels with ZnPT. Furthermore, unopposed increases in Zn<sup>2+</sup> by exposure to ZnPT abrogated fertilization-initiated Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and prevented the expected egg activation events. It is unclear how excess Zn<sup>2+</sup> disturbs the function of IP<sub>3</sub>R1. Nevertheless, IP<sub>3</sub>R1s have multiple cysteines whose oxidation enhances the receptor sensitivity to IP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Joseph et al., 2018</xref>), and it is possible that excessive Zn<sup>2+</sup> aberrantly modifies them, disturbing IP<sub>3</sub>R1 structure and function or, alternatively, preventing their oxidation and sensitization of the receptor. Lastly, we cannot rule out that high Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels directly inhibit the receptor’s channel. These results reveal a close association between the Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels controlling meiotic transitions and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release necessary for egg activation, placing the IP<sub>3</sub>R1 at the center of the crosstalk of these two divalent cations.</p>
<p>Abrupt Zn<sup>2+</sup> changes have emerged as critical signals for meiotic and mitotic transitions in oocytes, eggs, embryos, and somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lo et al., 2020</xref>). Fertilization relies on prototypical Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises and oscillations, and Zn<sup>2+</sup> sparks are an egg activation event downstream of this Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, establishing a functional association between these two divalent cations that continues to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show that, in addition, these cations actively crosstalk during fertilization and that the fertilization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations rely on optimized IP<sub>3</sub>R1 function underpinned by ideal Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels set during oocyte maturation. Future studies should explore if artificial alteration of Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels can extend the fertile lifespan of eggs, improve developmental competence, or develop methods of non-hormonal contraception.</p>

Broad-range pre-stained SDS–PAGE molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) were run in parallel to estimate the molecular weight of the immunoreactive bands. The same membranes were stripped at 50°C for 30 min (62.5 mM Tris, 2% SDS, and 100 mM 2-beta mercaptoethanol) and re-probed with anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:1000).</p>

<title>Immunostaining and confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Immunostaining was performed according to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akizawa et al., 2021</xref>). After incubation with or without TPEN, MII eggs were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in house-made phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at room temperature and then permeabilized for 60 min with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. Next, the eggs were blocked for 45 min with a blocking buffer containing 0.2% (w/v) skim milk, 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) TritonX-100, 0.75% (w/v) glycine in PBS. Eggs were incubated overnight at 4°C with mouse anti-HA antibody (1:200) diluted in blocking buffer. Eggs were washed in blocking buffer 3X for 10 min, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min with a secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (1:400) diluted in blocking buffer. Fluorescence signals were visualized using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Nikon A1 Resonant Confocal with six-color TIRF) fitted with a 63×, 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective lens.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Comparisons for statistical significance of experimental values between treatments and experiments were performed in three or more experiments performed on different batches of eggs in most studies. Given the number of eggs needed, WB studies were repeated twice. Prism-GraphPad software was used to perform the statistical comparisons that include unpaired Student’s t-tests, Fisher’s exact test, and One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons, as applicable, and the production of graphs to display the data. All data are presented as mean±s.d. Differences were considered significant at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>

<p>The study utilizes a variety of methods, chemical and expressed probes, caged release of IP3, as well as oocytes with mutations that alter zinc availability, that provide an elegant examination of how zinc deficiency and zinc excess modulate the transient and cyclic release of calcium during egg activation. In this manuscript, the authors sought to determine if there is any interplay between zinc and calcium, two divalent cations that have been demonstrated to have important roles during fertilization. They employ agents that disrupt normal zinc homeostasis and then monitor the resulting calcium oscillations during egg activation. If zinc was made unavailable via chelation with TPEN, then the calcium oscillations halted. This occurred regardless of the activation method, which included ICSI, PLC𝛇, Acetylcholine, strontium chloride, and thimerosal. This phenotype could be rescued by introducing zinc back into the egg via an ionophore, such as zinc pyrithione; however, too much zinc pyrithione also halted calcium oscillations. Taken together, these two results demonstrate that there is a threshold level of zinc that is required for proper calcium oscillations to occur.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors sought to understand how zinc affects the IP3 receptor, IP3R1. IP3R1 is the receptor that modulates the release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. The authors cited a previous study that identified zinc binding sites on IP3R1. The authors highlight that there exist no studies regarding the regulation of IP3R1 by zinc; however, such studies were cited for a similar calcium channel, the RyRs. The authors use thapsigargin to inhibit the SERCA pump, leading to calcium leak from the IP3R1. TPEN blunted the amount of calcium leaked from the ER following treatment, suggesting that zinc occupancy is necessary for IP3R1 function.</p>
<p>The results of these experiments support the authors conclusions that zinc is essential for the IP3R1-mediated release of calcium in an oscillatory manner during egg activation. These results provide further insight into signals necessary for proper egg activation and the ultimate success of the resulting embryo.</p>

<p>The manuscript describes more fully the relationship between zinc fluxes and calcium oscillations during egg activation by directly manipulating the level of zinc ions inside and outside the cell with chelators and ionophores and then measuring resulting changes in Ca++ oscillations. The authors have provided solid evidence consistent with their hypothesis that zinc ions regulate Ca++ oscillations by directly modulating the gating of the IP3-R which is the main calcium channel responsible for calcium release into the cytoplasm. The authors employ well established methods of calcium measurement along with various chelators, ionophores and a wide variety of methods that cause egg activation to demonstrate that an optimal level of zinc ions are required for Ca++ oscillations to occur.</p>
<p>Helpfully, the authors provide a model to explain their observations in Figure 7. In the model, the increase in zinc during maturation is permissive for later IP3-R gating in response to activation. The experiments with TPEN solidly demonstrate that Zn is required because lowering free zinc, (as indicated by Fluozin staining), abrogates Ca++ oscillations. This is true regardless of the method of activation. What is not clearly described in the model or in the manuscript is whether the levels of zinc at MII are simply permissive for IP3-R gating or whether there is a more acute relationship between zinc fluxes and Ca++ oscillations. In the original paper describing the zinc spark (Kim et al., ACS Chem Biol 6:716-723), the authors show that zinc efflux very closely mirrors Ca++ oscillations suggesting a more active relationship.</p>
<p>The role of TRPv3 and Trpm7 in Zn homeostasis during egg activation seems to be minor. Labile zinc accumulation, as measured by fluozin-3 staining, is reduced in the dKO eggs, but is this modest decrease in labile Zn responsible for the changes in Ca release after Tg treatment? There is an increase in the amplitude of Tg-induced Ca release in dKO eggs. This argues that there is not an inhibitory effect in the dKO mice. That it takes a little longer to reach Ca peak could be due to the greater amount of Ca being released.</p>
<p>The effect of PyT on the apparent rise in cytoplasmic Ca++ in Figure 6 is interpreted as caused by an artifact of high Zn concentrations. However, it is not clear that 0.05 uM PyT would necessarily increase cytoplasmic Zn to the point where FURA-2 fluorescence would increase. A simpler interpretation is that PyT allows sufficient Zn to enter the cell and keeps the IP3-R channels open causing a sustained rise in cytoplasmic Ca and preventing oscillations in Ca++. This interpretation would also preclude inhibitory effects of high Zn concentrations as shown in Figure 7 which may or may not be present but are simply speculation.</p>
<p>Overall, this study significantly advances our understanding of egg activation and could lead to better ways of in vitro egg activation in women undergoing assisted reproduction.</p>

<p>This study investigated the role of Zn2+ on the maintenance of Ca2+ oscillation upon fertilization. TPEN was used to reduce the level of available Zn2+ in fertilized oocytes and different inhibitors were used to pinpoint the mechanistic involvement of intracellular Zn2+ on the maintenance of Ca2+ oscillation. As also stated in the manuscript, previous studies have demonstrated the role of Zn2+ for the successful completion of meiosis/fertilization. The manuscript expands our understanding of fertilization process by describing how the level of Zn2+ regulates Ca2+ channels and stores. The manuscript is well-organized and the topic is important in early embryo development fields.</p>
<p>The authors added more information to the manuscript based on reviewers' comments. The quality of the manuscript has been improved and the study addresses important questions in mammalian fertilization.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our manuscript. We have closely examined the issues raised, and below we offer a point-by-point response to each comment. In the revised manuscript below, all the introduced changes are marked with red font.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. There may be a general typo concerning micromolar and millimolar…</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response 1: The reviewer is correct, and during the reformatting of the manuscript, in some portions of the manuscript, the units used to indicate TPEN concentrations, always µM, were switched to mM. We have corrected those mistakes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 1C/Lines 150-152, the authors use DTPA and EDTA as extracellular chelators for zinc… Was the amount of zinc in the media measured and determined to be below the amount of chelator used? Additionally, these chelators are not specific for zinc, but can bind other divalent cations including calcium. Even though zinc binds more tightly than calcium to these chelators, by mass action calcium and magnesium ions may outcompete DTPA and EDTA, leaving zinc availability unperturbed. How do the authors take these interactions into account to determine that chelation of extracellular zinc has no effect on intracellular calcium oscillations? The best way to test this is to use zinc responsive fluorescent probes in a sample of the calcium- and magnesium-replete medium and see if the addition of the DTPA or EDTA alters zinc fluorescence in the cuvette.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response 2: We tested several conditions to determine the effect of chelators on the zinc concentration of the monitoring media using commercially available Zn2+ probes. The fluorescent zinc probe FluoZin3 added extracellularly shows high fluorescence, consistent with trace amounts of zinc and possibly non-specific bindings of other cations.</p>
<p>Further, the media tested was replete with the concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in TLHEPES. To establish if the non-permeable external chelators we used could bind external Zn2+ despite the high concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+, we followed the reviewer’s suggestion of adding the chelators to the complete media in the presence of FluoZin3. The addition of EDTA caused a protracted, ~5 min, but significant decrease in FluoZin3’s fluorescence, suggesting it is effective at removing external Zn2+ despite the presence of other divalent cations (Author response image 1A). We used a second approach where we added the chelator in the presence of nominal concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ to increase the chelators’ chances to find and chelate Zn2+ (Author response image 1B). Then, we injected mPlcζ mRNA, which initiated persistent but low-frequency oscillations, as expected due to the lack of external Ca2+. Remarkably, upon restoring it, the responses became of high frequency, and upon increasing Mg2+, they acquired the regular pattern, consistent with Mg2+’s inhibition of channels that mediate Ca2+ influx. These results show that the chelation of extracellular zinc does not replicate TPEN’s effect, which suggests that TPEN’s abrupt and inhibiting ability on Ca2+ oscillations is most likely due to the 43 chelation of internal Zn2+.</p>

<p>Noteworthy, low EDTA concentrations, 10-µM, have been used to enhance in vitro culture conditions of mammalian embryos. In fact, it is the key ingredient to overcome the two-cell block that initially prevented the in vitro development of zygotes srom inbred strains. It is unknown how EDTA mediates this effect, which is detectable in Ca2+ and Mg2+ replete media and is only effective when placed extracellularly, but it has been attributed to its ability to chelate toxic metals introduced as impurities by other media components; one study demonstrated that the Zn2+ present in the oil used to overlay the culture medium micro drops was the target (Erbach et al., Human Reproduction, 1995, 10, 3248-54). We included some of these points in the revised version of the manuscript and added this figure as Supplementary Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The reviewer noted that while dKO eggs showed reduced labile zinc levels, the amount of total zinc is not determined. Further, the response to thapsigargin in dKO eggs didn’t phenocopy the profile in eggs treated with TPEN. The reviewer argued that without further experimentation, such as comparing polar body extrusion and egg activation rate between WT and dKO, it seems to be a stretch to state that these eggs are zinc deficient.</p>
<p>Response 3: We agree that the statement, ‘zinc deficient,’ is an overstatement without determining the total zinc levels and associated phenotypes. Therefore, in the revised version of the manuscript, we referred to dKO-derived eggs and embryos as “low-level labile Zn2+ eggs”. Our follow-up studies show that eggs from dKO females seem to undergo egg activation events, such as the timing and rate of second polar body extrusion and pronuclear formation, with a similar dynamic to WT females. Hence, we estimate that the labile Zn2+ levels in dKO eggs are not as low as those of WT eggs treated with TPEN. Consequently, these intermediate zinc levels may have subtle effects, such as changing the Thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ release through the IP3R1 without causing widespread inhibition of cellular events observed after TPEN. We would argue that this approach is significant because it can distinguish how the different cellular events and proteins and enzymes have distinct affinities or zinc requirements and, in this case, start uncovering the channel(s) present in oocytes and eggs that may contribute to regulating zinc homeostasis.</p>
<p>1. The reviewer pointed out that since zinc is not redox active, it is unclear how zinc could be modifying cysteine residues of IP3R1.The reviewer suggested the possibility that excess zinc is binding to the cysteines and preventing their oxidation leading to the inhibition of the IP3R1 by blocking the channel, thereby preventing calcium release.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response 4: The reviewer correctly points out that the mechanism(s) whereby excess Zn2+ modifies the IP3R1 function is undetermined in our study. Further, our description of ‘modifying’ is ambiguous and could be misinterpreted. Data in the literature, some of which we cite in the manuscript, shows that “oxidation of cysteine residues enhances receptor’s sensitivity to ligands in various cell types”. Zn2+ preferentially binds to reduced cysteine residues, and thus, we agree with the proposed reviewer's suggestion that “excess zinc may occupy reduced cysteine residues, preventing their oxidization required to sensitize the receptor”. As noted by the reviewer, we cannot rule out that it might be directly blocking the IP3R1 channel. We have modified the corresponding paragraphs in the Discussion.</p>

<p>1. In Figure 1E/Table 1 the authors evaluated if TPEN supplementation affects meiosis and pronuclear formation; however, the timing of TPEN treatment is unclear. When was TPEN introduced? Were the eggs left in the same media containing TPEN following fertilization, or were they transferred to different media?</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>1. The reviewer raises the question of whether a more complex relationship could exist between the levels of zinc in MII eggs by indicating, “a more active relationship such that zinc efflux associated with each calcium spike could be necessary for terminating the Ca spike by depleting cytoplasmic zinc.” The reviewer also states, “Perhaps, rather than simply a permissive role, the normal Zn fluxes during activation may be acutely changing
IP3-R gating sensitivity.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response 1: We agree that the demonstration that TPEN dose-dependently delays and consistently terminates ongoing Ca2+ rises perhaps reflects a more nuanced relationship between cytoplasmic labile zinc concentrations, Ca2+ oscillations, and IP3R1 function. Uncovering the precise nature of this relationship would require additional studies, such as determining the impact of TPEN on IP3 binding to its cognate receptor, regulation of channel gating, and more in-depth functional-structural experiments. However, these studies will demand time and complex experimental design and are beyond the scope of the current work. Nevertheless, they are excellent suggestions for future studies.</p>
<p>We would argue against the reviewer’s suggestion that “zinc sparks directly contribute to shaping the oscillations.” Zn2+ released during the sparks is not labile, but Zn2+ bound to cortical granules-resident proteins, most of which are inaccessible to the cytosol and hence to IP3R1s and should not perturb its function. We examined (data not shown) that the levels of cytosolic labile Zn2+, as assessed with FluoZin3, remained steady for over three hours of Plcζ mRNA-initiated oscillations. Further, because the Zn2+ sparks cease after the third or fourth Ca2+ rise, it would mean, at the very least, that this mechanism only operates on the first few responses. Thus, while the change of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations triggers the Zn2+ sparks, we argue that the opposite influence is unlikely to hold true.</p>

<p>1. The reviewer also pointed out that the role of Trpv3 and Trpm7 in Zn2+ homeostasis seems to be minor and that the effects of genetic deletion of those channels are not as clear as those obtained by TPEN. Given that dKO eggs make it to the MII and release more but not less calcium upon thapsigargin than control despite the lowered labile Zn2+ level, the reviewer speculated that the loss of those channels changes calcium gating independent of Zn2+ concentration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response 2: TRPV3, TRPM7, and Cav3.2 are the three channels identified to permeate Ca2+ during oocyte maturation and egg activation in mice. We and other groups have observed that in oocytes and eggs, these channels partly compensate for the absence of each other because the deletion of these channels individually has a limited effect on Ca2+ oscillations and fertility. Thus, in the case of oocytes from Trpv3 and Trpm7 dKO animals, the other plasma membrane channel(s), most likely Cav3.2, is plausibly compensating, and its enhanced function underlies the increased Ca2+ response to Thapsigargin.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the slower time to the peak and the lesser steep rise of the Thapsigargin induced rise suggest a negative impact of the dKO environment on IP3R1’s ability to mediate Ca2+ release. Based on the rest of the results in the manuscript, we attribute this change to the lower levels of labile Zn2+ in dKO eggs.</p>

<p>1. Lastly, the reviewer noted the upregulation of the Fura-2AM following addition of ZnPT. The reviewer indicated that 0.05 uM ZnPT might not increase intracellular Zn2+ to change Fura-2 fluorescence, but it might be sufficient Zn2+ to enter the cell and keep the IP3R1 channels open causing a sustained rise in cytoplasmic calcium and preventing oscillations. Further, if this interpretation holds true, the inhibitory effects of high Zn2+ on IP3R1’s gating shown in figure 7 would be precluded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response 3: We acknowledge that the increased levels of Fura-2 fluorescence following the addition of ZnPT could be due to the increased Zn2+ levels acting on IP3R1, increasing its open probability, and elevating cytosolic Ca2+ levels. We have added this consideration to the discussion. Nevertheless, our evidence suggests that this is unlikely because, as shown in Figure 6 H, I, the ER-Ca2+ levels as assessed by D1ER recordings did not change following the addition of ZnPT, whereas Rhod-2 fluorescence did, suggesting that the two events are seemingly uncoupled. Further, constant leak from the ER and extended high cytosolic Ca2+ would lead to egg activation or cell death, neither of which changes were observed.</p>

<p>The reviewer noted that the present study deepened the understanding of the role of zinc in regulating calcium channels and stores at fertilization beyond the previously known Zn2+ requirement in oocyte maturation and the cell cycle progression. We appreciate these comments.</p>

<p>1. Fig. 1. The reviewer wondered why we selected 10 μM TPEN for most of the experiments in the manuscript. The reviewer noted this concentration only stopped the Ca2+oscillations in just half of the eggs after ICSI.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response 1: We used 10-μM TPEN throughout the study because it blocked ~50% of the oscillations of a robust trigger of Ca2+ responses such as ICSI and reduced the frequency in the remaining eggs. This concentration of TPEN abrogates and prevents the responses by milder stimuli, such as Acetylcholine and SrCl2. Importantly, thimerosal and Plcζ mRNA overcome the inhibition by 10μM but not 50-μM TPEN. However, 50μM TPEN inactivates Emi2, a Zn2+-dependent enzyme, causing parthenogenic activation and cell cycle progression, and we wanted to avoid this confounding factor. Therefore, we determined 10-μM is a “threshold” concentration and selected it for the remaining studies. We also reasoned that it would allow the detection of more subtle effects of reducing the levels of labile zinc, causing a milder inhibition of IP3R1 sensitivity and a progressive delay or modification of the responses to other agonists rather than fully abrogating them, which is the case with higher concentrations.</p>
