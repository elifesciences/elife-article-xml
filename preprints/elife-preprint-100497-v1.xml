<title>Abstract</title><p>Breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2), a core component of the hPrP19 complex, plays an important role in RNA-splicing and DNA damage. However, whether BCAS2 has other functions within the nucleus remains largely unknown. Here, we show that BCAS2 is essential for primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish and mouse embryos. The activation of Wnt/β-catenin signal, which is required for hematopoietic progenitor differentiation, is significantly decreased upon depletion of <italic>bcas2</italic> in zebrafish embryos and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency of <italic>bcas2</italic> has no obvious impact on the splicing efficiency of β-catenin pre-mRNA, while significantly attenuating β-catenin nuclear accumulation. Moreover, we find that BCAS2 directly binds to β-catenin via its coiled-coil domains, thereby sequestering β-catenin within the nucleus. Thus, our results uncover a previously unknown function of BCAS2 in promoting Wnt signaling by enhancing β-catenin nuclear retention during primitive hematopoiesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hematopoiesis refers to the lifelong process by which all blood cell lineages are generated. It begins at the early stage of embryonic development, providing the growing embryo with sufficient oxygen and nutrients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Evolutionarily conserved across vertebrate species, hematopoiesis consists of two successive and partially overlapping waves: primitive and definitive. In mammals, the first wave of hematopoiesis occurs in the yolk-sac blood islands, producing primitive erythroid, megakaryocyte and macrophage progenitors, which can be observed in mouse embryos as early as embryonic day 7.25 (E7.25).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> In zebrafish, primitive hematopoiesis initiates at around 11 hours post fertilization (hpf), when hemangioblasts emerge from the anterior lateral mesoderm (ALM) and posterior lateral mesoderm (PLM) and later differentiate into both hematopoietic and endothelial cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Breast cancer amplified sequence 2 (BCAS2), also known as pre-mRNA splicing factor SPF27, is a 26-kDa nuclear protein containing two coiled-coil (CC) domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> It was initially found to be overexpressed and amplified in human breast cancer cell lines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Further studies have identified BCAS2 as a vital component of the human Prp19/CDC5L complex, which forms the catalytic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core of spliceosome and is required for the activation of pre-mRNA splicing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> In Drosophila, the function of BCAS2 in RNA splicing is essential for cell viability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> In mouse, disruption of <italic>Bcas2</italic> in male germ cells impairs mRNA splicing and leads to a failure of spermatogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Additionally, BCAS2 also plays an important role in the DNA damage response through the replication protein A (RPA) complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> Interestingly, it has been shown that BCAS2 is a negative regulator of p53 by directly interacting with p53 or modulating alternative splicing of Mdm4, a major p53 inhibitor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Zebrafish <italic>bcas2</italic> transcripts were enriched in the sites of both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis during embryonic development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> However, a previous study showed that p53 overactivation induced by zebrafish <italic>bcas2</italic> depletion did not affect primitive hematopoiesis, but impaired definitive hematopoiesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> In recent years, several studies have highlighted the importance of regulating the expression and activity of p53 in primitive erythroid cell differentiation in both mouse and zebrafish embryos.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Thus, it is necessary to reexamine the exact function of BCAS2 in primitive hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>Wnt signaling, usually categorized into canonical and non-canonical pathways, is involved in the process of hematopoiesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Notably, the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is dependent on the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin to regulate gene transcription, controls primitive hematopoietic progenitor formation and promotes definitive hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) specification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> For instance, it has been demonstrated in <italic>Xenopus</italic> that, Wnt4-mediated activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays a critical role in the induction and maintenance of primitive hematopoiesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> Moreover, transient inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling in zebrafish embryos impairs embryonic blood formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> However, previous studies utilizing human pluripotent stem cells revealed an opposite role of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in primitive progenitor generation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> Therefore, the impact of Wnt/β-catenin signaling on primitive hematopoiesis remains elusive and even controversial. Moreover, it has been suggested that BCAS2 is important for neural stem cell proliferation and dendrite growth in mice by regulating β-catenin pre-mRNA splicing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> As a nuclear protein, it is unclear whether BCAS2 can modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in a splicing-independent manner.</p>
<p>In this study, we generated two zebrafish <italic>bcas2</italic> mutant lines, both of which exhibited defects in male fertility and embryonic HSC formation, similar to what was previously reported in mice and zebrafish.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> More importantly, loss-of-function experiments suggest that BCAS2 is necessary for primitive hematopoiesis in both zebrafish and mouse embryos. We further find that <italic>bcas2</italic> is dispensable for the survival and proliferation of hematopoietic cells, but plays a crucial role in the differentiation of the hematopoietic lineage from hemangioblasts. Using a comprehensive approach, we reveal that BCAS2 is a nuclear retention factor for β-catenin during primitive hematopoiesis. Subsequent biochemical and functional experiments demonstrate that BCAS2 directly binds to β-catenin and suppresses its nuclear export to promote Wnt signal activation and hematopoietic progenitor differentiation. Furthermore, the CC domains on BCAS2 and the Armadillo (ARM) repeats on β-catenin are responsible for their interaction. Collectively, we have uncovered a novel function of BCAS2 in regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling by sequestering β-catenin within the nucleus during primitive hematopoiesis.</p>

<title>BCAS2 is necessary for primitive hematopoiesis</title>
<p>To confirm that <italic>bcas2</italic> is expressed in the posterior intermediate cell mass (ICM) where primitive hematopoiesis occurs in zebrafish, we first examined the spatiotemporal expression pattern of <italic>bcas2</italic> during zebrafish embryo development by performing whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH). The results showed that <italic>bcas2</italic> was ubiquitously expressed from 1-cell stage to 10-somite stage (Supplemental Figure 1A). Its expression in the ICM became detectable at 18 hours post fertilization (hpf) and was significantly elevated at 22 hpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We further observed that <italic>bcas2</italic> was co-expressed with the primitive erythropoietic marker <italic>gata1</italic> in the ICM at 22 hpf by fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>bcas2</italic> was hardly detectable in the ICM in <italic>cloche</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants that lack both endothelial and hematopoietic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These results demonstrate a dynamic expression of <italic>bcas2</italic> in the ICM and imply a potential role of this gene in primitive hematopoiesis.</p>

<p>To gain insight into the developmental function of <italic>bcas2</italic>, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate <italic>bcas2</italic> mutants. Two mutant lines were obtained, designated <italic>bcas2Δ7</italic> (with a 7-base deletion) and <italic>bcas2Δ14</italic> (with a 14-base deletion). These mutations led to premature translation termination, which resulted in truncated Bcas2 proteins lacking the C-terminal CC domains (Supplemental Figure 2A-B). <italic>bcas2Δ7</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>bcas2Δ14</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mutants were identified by T7 endonuclease I assay or restriction enzyme analysis (FspI) (Supplemental Figure 2C). We found that nearly 85% of the embryos derived from crossing <italic>bcas</italic>2<sup>+/-</sup> males with <italic>bcas</italic>2<sup>+/-</sup> females did not develop to the cleavage stage (Supplemental Figure 2D). Only 3% of the living embryos were homozygotes. In contrast, embryos obtained by crossing between wild-type males and <italic>bcas</italic>2<sup>+/-</sup> females were viable and showed normal morphology, with a heterozygosity rate consistent with Mendelian inheritance. This could be explained by male infertility as previously documented in <italic>Bcas2</italic> knockout mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> Combining the above findings, we propose that Bcas2 may have an evolutionarily conserved role in spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>Given the difficulty of obtaining homozygous mutants, embryos lacking one copy of <italic>bcas2</italic> gene were produced from crosses between heterozygous females and wild-type males. We observed a significant decrease of <italic>bcas2</italic> expression in the ICM region in <italic>bcas2Δ7</italic><sup>+/-</sup> or <italic>Δ14</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mutants, likely resulting from nonsense-mediated RNA decay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In line with a previous report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> a marked reduction in the expression of the HSC marker <italic>cmyb</italic> and T-cell marker <italic>rag1</italic> was found in <italic>bcas2Δ7</italic><sup>+/-</sup> or <italic>Δ14</italic><sup>+/-</sup> embryos at 5 hpf, indicating an essential role of <italic>bcas2</italic> in definitive hematopoiesis (Supplemental Figure 3A-B).</p>
<p>To explore whether <italic>bcas2</italic> is required for primitive hematopoiesis, we first examined the expression of primitive erythropoietic markers <italic>gata1</italic> and <italic>hbbe3</italic> in <italic>bcas2Δ7</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Δ14</italic><sup>+/-</sup> embryos at 22 hpf, and observed a marked decrease in the expression of these genes in the mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>o</italic>-dianisidine staining showed similar hemoglobin contents in the <italic>bcas2Δ7</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Δ14</italic><sup>+/-</sup> embryos at 48 hpf compared with control embryos, suggesting that the defect in primitive hematopoiesis induced by haploinsufficiency of <italic>bcas2</italic> was alleviated at later developmental stages. In order to further explore the role of BCAS2 in primary hematopoiesis, we identified several <italic>bcas2Δ14</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants from about 100 embryos from the mating of <italic>bcas2Δ14</italic><sup>+/-</sup> male and female. These homozygous mutants display a severe decrease in hemoglobin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Similarly, injection of a translation-blocking MO into wild-type embryos to downregulate <italic>bcas2</italic> expression resulted in severe defects in erythropoiesis at 22 hpf and 48 hpf (Supplemental Figure 4A-D). These results indicate that <italic>bcas2</italic> is indispensable for primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish. In addition, to induce the deletion of Bcas2 in mammalian endothelial/hematopoietic cells, transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>Flk1</italic> promoter were crossed to <italic>Bcas2<sup>F/F</sup></italic>animals. We found that red blood cells were eliminated in the yolk sac of <italic>Bcas2<sup>F/F</sup>;Flk1-Cre</italic> mice at E12.5 despite the presence of vessels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Therefore, Bcas2 has a conserved role in vertebrates to regulate primitive hematopoiesis.</p>

<title><italic>bcas2</italic> deficiency impairs hematopoietic progenitor differentiation</title>
<p>The decrease of primitive hematopoietic cells in <italic>bcas2</italic> deficient animals may be attributed to a number of possible causes: excessive apoptosis, hampered proliferation of hematopoietic cells, or impaired differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. To shed light on this issue, we first performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay in <italic>Tg(gata1:GFP)</italic> embryos at the 10-somite stage to examine DNA fragmentations in apoptotic cells, and found no obvious apoptotic signal in the <italic>gata1<sup>+</sup></italic> hematopoietic cells in either <italic>bcas2Δ14</italic><sup>+/-</sup> embryos or their wild-type siblings (Supplemental Figure 5A).

Then we extended our analysis to include the markers of hematopoietic and endothelial progenitors. Consistent with the decrease in primitive hematopoietic cells in <italic>bcas2</italic> deficient mutants, a marked reduced expression of erythrocyte progenitor markers <italic>gata1</italic> and <italic>hbbe3</italic> was observed in the posterior lateral mesoderm of <italic>bcas2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> embryos at the 10-somite stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of myeloid progenitor marker <italic>pu.1</italic> was also dramatically decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, overexpression of human BCAS2 enhanced the expression of <italic>gata1</italic> in both wild-type and mutant embryos at the 10-somite stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).

<title>BCAS2 promotes β-catenin nuclear accumulation independently of protein stability regulation</title>

<p>To test the above hypothesis, we evaluated nuclear β-catenin level by performing immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting experiments. Upon tamoxifen exposure, nuclear accumulation of β-catenin induced by LiCl was greatly inhibited in <italic>Bcas2</italic>-cKO MEFs, while nuclear/cytoplasmic fractionation suggested that cytoplasmic β-catenin level remained relatively unchanged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-E</xref>). Similarly, silencing <italic>BCAS2</italic> with shRNA led to reduced nuclear β-catenin in the human colon cancer cell line SW480, in which β-catenin was activated because of mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC), an integral component of the β-catenin destruction complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> Next, MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, was applied to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in <italic>Bcas2</italic>-cKO MEFs by inhibiting β-catenin degradation. In the absence of tamoxifen and MG132, endogenous β-catenin was localized almost exclusively in the cytoplasm; MG132 treatment dramatically triggered β-catenin accumulation in the nuclei (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). However, in <italic>Bcas2</italic>-cKO MEFs exposed to tamoxifen, MG132 treatment was not able to induce nuclear accumulation of β-catenin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). These findings indicate that BCAS2 promotes β-catenin nuclear accumulation in a manner that is independent of β-catenin stability regulation.</p>

<title>BCAS2 sequesters β-catenin within the nucleus</title>
<p>In addition to be affected by protein stability, the nuclear level of β-catenin is also fine-tuned by the opposing actions of nuclear export and import.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> To examine the effect of BCAS2 on the nuclear import and export of β-catenin, fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments was carried out in HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged S37A-β-catenin. After photobleaching the nucleus, no significant difference was found in the recovery of nuclear GFP signals between the cells with and without overexpression of BCAS2 (Supplemental Figures 6A, A’, and C), suggesting that BCAS2 does not regulate β-catenin nuclear import. Conversely, after photobleaching the cytoplasm, BCAS2 overexpressed cells showed a much slower recovery of cytoplasmic fluorescence (Supplemental Figures 6B, B’, and C), indicating that BCAS2 inhibits β-catenin nuclear export.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that the nuclear exit of β-catenin can be either dependent or independent on CRM1, a major nuclear export receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> To shed light on the mechanism underlying BCAS2 mediated β-catenin nuclear retention, we treated <italic>Bcas2</italic>- cKO MEFs with the CRM1-specific export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> Regardless of the presence or absence of endogenous BCAS2, LMB treatment could effectively increase the level of β-catenin in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

<title>BCAS2 directly interacts with β-catenin in the nucleus</title>
<p>To investigate whether BCAS2 inhibits the nuclear export of β-catenin through physical binding, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged β-catenin and HA-tagged BCAS2 constructs. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments showed that Flag-β-catenin was precipitated with HA-BCAS2 as well as endogenous BCAS2, indicating an interaction between these two proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref>). In addition, the interaction was enhanced upon Wnt3a stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Given that Wnt ligand stimulation ultimately induces β-catenin nuclear accumulation, this enhanced interaction implies that BCAS2 associates with β-catenin within the nucleus. Therefore, we performed the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay to visualize the interaction of BCAS2 and β-catenin in living cells. In this assay, the N-terminal fragment of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was fused to BCAS2 (YN-BCAS2), while the C-terminal fragment was fused to β-catenin (YC-β-catenin) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). As expected, the YFP fluorescence was specifically observed in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have divided the β-catenin protein into three distinct domains, including the N-terminal domain (residues 1–133), the central domain with 12 ARM repeats (residues 134–670), and the C-terminal domain (residues 671–781).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> To identify the BCAS2 binding site, constructs expressing various truncated forms of β-catenin were generated and co-transfected with BCAS2 into HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Co-IP assays revealed that deletion of the N-terminal or C-terminal domain of β-catenin did not alter the interaction between β-catenin and BCAS2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, when the ARM repeats 1-12 of β-catenin were deleted, the resulting deletion mutant showed virtually no interaction with BCAS2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). GST pull-down assay also demonstrated a direct interaction between BCAS2 and the ARM repeats of β-catenin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). These results indicate that BCAS2 physically binds to the ARM repeats of β-catenin. Furthermore, we found that the ARM repeats 9-12, but not 1-8, bound to BCAS2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).</p>

<title>BCAS2 enhances β-catenin nuclear accumulation through its CC domains</title>
<p>To determine which domain of BCAS2 binds to β-catenin, we constructed a series of deletion mutants of BCAS2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Notably, we observed that among these truncated mutants, only the one lacking both CC1 and CC2 domains lost the ability to interact with β-catenin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, these two CC domains alone or together could interact with β-catenin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that BCAS2 binds to β-catenin via its CC domains.</p>

<p>We next examined whether the CC domains is required for BCAS2 to promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>, overexpression of BCAS2 without the CC domains failed to increase LiCl-induced TOPflash activity in HEK-293T cells. Likewise, overexpression of the full-length BCAS2, but not BCAS2 lacking the CC domains, could restore the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in <italic>bcas2</italic> morphants and <italic>gata1</italic> expression in <italic>bcas2</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E-F</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that BCAS2 positively regulates Wnt signaling through sequestering β-catenin within the nucleus via its CC domains during primitive hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>As BCAS2 is involved in the Prp19-CDC5L spliceosome complex that regulates RNA splicing during spermiogenesis, neurogenesis, and definitive hematopoiesis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> we wondered if this protein participates in primitive hematopoiesis via mRNA alternative splicing. To this end, we performed RNA sequencing of 10-somite stage embryos to identify abnormal events in alternative splicing in <italic>bcas2Δ14</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mutants. However, upon haploinsufficiency of <italic>bcas2</italic>, neither the number of five major types of alternative splicing events, nor the typical forms of alternative splicing were significantly affected (Supplemental Figure 7A-B). Additionally, haploinsufficiency of <italic>bcas2</italic> did not result in the alternative splicing of <italic>mdm4</italic> that predisposes cells to undergo p53-mediated apoptosis in definitive hematopoiesis, as reported previously by Yu <italic>et al.</italic> (Supplemental Figure 7C).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> Furthermore, the splicing efficiency of β-catenin pre-mRNA remained almost unchanged in <italic>bcas2Δ14</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mutants (Supplemental Figure 7C).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>BCAS2 is a 26-kDa nuclear protein involved in a multitude of developmental processes, such as Drosophila wing development, dendritic growth, and spermatogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> In our study, we generated <italic>bcas2</italic> knockout zebrafish. The heterozygotes not only showed male infertility, resembling the phenotype of <italic>Bcas2</italic> germ cell-specific knockout mice reported previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> but also exhibited impaired definitive hematopoiesis, consistent with the earlier study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Importantly, we found a marked decrease in the expression of the primitive erythroid progenitor markers <italic>gata1</italic> and <italic>hbbe3</italic> in these heterozygous mutants, which was rescued by overexpression of BCAS2. Moreover, the defective primitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish mutants was phenocopied in hemangioblast-specific <italic>Bcas2</italic> knockout mice. While the reason(s) for the discrepancy between our data and the observations made by Yu <italic>et al.</italic> regarding the role of <italic>bcas2</italic> in the development of primitive erythroid and myeloid cells remains to be determined,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> our findings in zebrafish and mouse embryos provide solid evidence that BCAS2 plays a conserved role in primitive hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in previous studies, BCAS2 is involved in various developmental events by regulating pre-mRNA splicing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> However, our data showed that haploinsufficiency of <italic>bcas2</italic> did not affect alternative splicing during primitive hematopoiesis. These results imply that one copy of the <italic>bcas2</italic> gene is sufficient to support mRNA splicing in zebrafish. Instead, we find that Bcas2 promotes primitive hematopoiesis by sequestering β-catenin within the nucleus. It has been reported that the <italic>bcas2</italic> deletion in zebrafish embryos induces alternative splicing of <italic>mdm4</italic> that predisposes cells to undergo p53-mediated apoptosis in HSPCs during definitive hematopoiesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Intriguingly, we found that the loss of one copy of <italic>bcas2</italic> gene in zebrafish also resulted in severe impairment of HSPCs and their derivatives. It is possible that Bcas2 might also have a role in definitive hematopoiesis independent of its splicing regulatory function.</p>
<p>For the past decades, given the contradictory conclusions obtained from various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, the function of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in primitive hematopoiesis remains elusive and controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> In the present study, we have provided several lines of evidence supporting that Wnt/β-catenin signaling positively regulates primitive hematopoiesis: (1) Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin by overexpression of the canonical Wnt inhibitor Dkk1 disrupts the formation of erythrocyte progenitors at the 10-somite stage. (2) Defects in primitive hematopoiesis in <italic>bcas2</italic> morphants and mutants are readily restored by overexpression of ΔN-β-catenin, a constitutively active β-catenin. (3) Overexpression of the full-length BCAS2, but not the CC domain-deleted BCAS2, restores the formation of the primitive erythroid progenitor in <italic>bcas2</italic> mutants. (4) BCAS2 overexpression enhances the development of primitive blood cells in wild-type embryos. All these data suggest that BCAS2-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signal activation is necessary for primitive hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>The nuclear translocation of β-catenin is a key event in canonical Wnt signal activation. However, the precise mechanism for the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of β-catenin is not completely understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that β-catenin can transit into and out of nucleus using distinct molecular interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> In some physiological contexts, β-catenin binds to APC and/or Axin proteins, which are actively co-exported from the nucleus by the nuclear export factor CRM1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> Furthermore, CRM1 can bind directly to and function as an efficient nuclear exporter for β-catenin independently of APC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> Our FRAP experiments reveal that BCAS2 is not involved in β-catenin nuclear import, but inhibits the nuclear export of β-catenin. Treatment of LMB, a CRM1-specific export inhibitor, could rescue the defect in β-catenin nuclear accumulation in BCAS2-deficient cells, implying that BCAS2 has an inhibitory role in CRM1-mediated nuclear export of β-catenin. We further show that BCAS2 interacts directly with β-catenin and enhances β-catenin nuclear accumulation through its CC domains. In the future, it will be interesting to investigate whether BCAS2 competes with APC, Axin, and/or CRM1 for binding to β-catenin.</p>
<p>In summary, we uncover a novel role of BCAS2 in primitive hematopoiesis through enhancing the nuclear retention of β-catenin. Our study provides new insights into the mechanism of BCAS2-mediated Wnt signal activation during primitive hematopoiesis. Given that BCAS2 and Wnt signaling are well documented to contribute to cancer development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> it is appealing to further explore whether our findings can be applied to future cancer research.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Ning et al. reported that Bcas2 played an indispensable role in zebrafish primitive hematopoiesis via sequestering β-catenin in the nucleus. The authors showed that loss of Bcas2 caused primitive hematopoietic defects in zebrafish. They unraveled that Bcas2 deficiency promoted β-catenin nuclear export via a CRM1-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. They further validated that BCAS2 directly interacted with β-catenin in the nucleus and enhanced β-catenin accumulation through its CC domains. They unveil a novel insight into Bcas2, which is critical for zebrafish primitive hematopoiesis via regulating nuclear β-catenin stabilization rather than its canonical pre-mRNA splicing functions. Overall, the study is impressive and well-performed, although there are also some issues to address.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study unveils a novel function of Bcas2, which is critical for zebrafish primitive hematopoiesis by sequestering β-catenin. The authors validated the results in vivo and in vitro. Most of the figures are clear and convincing. This study nicely complements the function of Bcas2 in primitive hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A portion of the figures were over-exposed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Ning and colleagues present studies supporting a role for breast carcinoma amplified sequence 2 (Bcas2) in positively regulating primitive wave hematopoiesis through amplification of beta-catenin-dependent (canonical) Wnt signaling. The authors present compelling evidence that zebrafish bcas2 is expressed at the right time and place to be involved in primitive hematopoiesis, that there are primitive hematopoietic defects in hetero- and homozygous mutant and knockdown embryos, that Bcas2 mechanistically positively regulates canonical Wnt signaling, and that Bcas2 is required for nuclear retention of B-cat through physical interaction involving armadillo repeats 9-12 of B-cat and the coiled-coil domains of Bcas2. Overall, the data and writing are clean, clear, and compelling. This study is a first-rate analysis of a strong phenotype with highly supportive mechanistic data. The findings shed light on the controversial question of whether, when, and how canonical Wnt signaling may be involved in hematopoietic development. We detail some minor concerns and questions below, which if answered, we believe would strengthen the overall story and resolve some puzzling features of the phenotype. Notwithstanding these minor concerns, we believe this is an exceptionally well-executed and interesting manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The study features clear and compelling phenotypes and results.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript narrative exposition and writing are clear and compelling.</p>
<p>(3) The authors have attended to important technical nuances sometimes overlooked, for example, focusing on different pools of cytosolic or nuclear b-catenin.</p>
<p>(4) The study sheds light on a controversial subject: regulation of hematopoietic development by canonical Wnt signaling and presents clear evidence of a role.</p>
<p>(5) The authors present evidence of phylogenetic conservation of the pathway.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors present compelling data that Bcas2 regulates nuclear retention of B-cat through physical association involving binding between the Bcas2 CC domains and B-cat arm repeats 9-12. Transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes by B-cat requires physical association between B-cat and Tcf/Lef family DNA binding factors involving key interactions in Arm repeats 2-9 (Graham et al., Cell 2000). Mutually exclusive binding by B-cat regulatory factors, such as ICAT that prevent Tcf-binding is a documented mechanism (e.g. Graham et al., Mol Cell 2002). It would appear - based on the arm repeat usage by Bcas2 (repeats 9-12)-that Bcas2 and Tcf binding might not be mutually exclusive, which would support their model that Bcas2 physical association with B-cat to retain it in the nucleus would be compatible with co-activation of genes by allowing association with Tcf. It might be nice to attempt a three-way co-IP of these factors showing that B-cat can still bind Tcf in the presence of Bcas2, or at least speculate on the plausibility of the three-way interaction.</p>
<p>(2) A major way that canonical Wnt signaling regulates hematopoietic development is through regulation of the LPM hematopoietic competence territories by activating expression of cdx1a, cdx4, and their downstream targets hoxb5a and hoxa9a (Davidson et al., Nature 2003; Davidson et al., Dev Biol 2006; Pilon et al., Dev Biol 2006; Wang et al., PNAS 2008). Could the authors assess (in situ) the expression of cdx1a, cdx4, hoxb5a, and hoxa9a in the bcas2 mutants?</p>
<p>(3) The authors show compellingly that even heterozygous loss of bcas2 has strong Wnt-inhibitory effects. If Bcas2 is required for canonical Wnt signaling and bcas2 is expressed ubiquitously from the 1-cell stage through at least the beginning of gastrulation, why do bcas2 KO embryos not have morphological axis specification defects consistent with loss of early Wnt signaling, like loss of head (early), or brain anteriorization (later)? Could the authors provide some comments on this puzzle? Or if they do see any canonical Wnt signaling patterning defects in het- or homozygous embryos, could they describe and/or present them?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript utilized zebrafish bcas2 mutants to study the role of bcas2 in primitive hematopoiesis and further confirms that it has a similar function in mice. Moreover, they showed that bcas2 regulates the transition of hematopoietic differentiation from angioblasts via activating Wnt signaling. By performing a series of biochemical experiments, they also showed that bcas2 accomplishes this by sequestering b-catenin within the nucleus, rather than through its known function in pre-mRNA splicing.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is well-performed, and the manuscript is well-written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several issues need to be clarified.</p>
<p>(1) Is wnt signaling also required during hematopoietic differentiation from angioblasts? Can the authors test angioblast and endothelial markers in embryos with wnt inhibition? Also, can the authors add export inhibitor LMB to the mouse mutants to test if sequestering of b-catenin by bcas2 is conserved during primitive hematopoiesis in mice?</p>
<p>(2) Bcas2 is required for primitive myelopoiesis in ALM. Does bcas2 play a similar function in primitive myelopoiesis, or is bcas2/b-catenin interaction more important for hematopoietic differentiation in PLM?</p>
<p>(3) Is it possible that CC1-2 fragment sequester b-catenin? The different phenotypes between this manuscript and the previous article (Yu, 2019) may be due to different mutations in bcas2. Is it possible that the bcas2 mutation in Yu's article produces a complete CC1-2 fragment, which might sequester b-catenin?</p>
<p>(4) Can the author clarify what embryos the arrows point to in SI Figure 2D? In SI Figure 6B and B', can the author clarify how the nucleus and cytoplasm are bleached? In B, the nucleus also appears to be bleached.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your consideration and assessment. We really appreciate the generous comments from the reviewers on our manuscript entitled “BCAS2 promotes primitive hematopoiesis by sequestering β-catenin within the nucleus”. The comments are very helpful for the improvement of our work. We would like to provide the following provisional revision plan to address the public reviews:</p>
<p>1. To clarify if Bcas2 also promotes primitive myelopoiesis by enhancing nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, <italic>bcas2</italic> morpholino will be injected into the <italic>Tg(coro1a:EGFP)</italic> zebrafish embryos at 1-cell stage, and subsequently the β-catenin distribution in the myeloid cells will be examined. <italic>Tg(coro1a:EGFP)</italic> is commonly used to track both macrophages and neutrophils.</p>
<p>2. According to the reviewers’ comments, we will quantify the fluorescence intensity in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm in Figure 3H. Meanwhile, we will adjust the exposure of Figure 5C and Figure 7E, or replaced the figures with high-resolution ones.</p>
<p>3. Previous studies have reported that β-catenin can bind directly to CRM1 through its central armadillo (ARM) repeats region. β-catenin region containing ARM repeats 10 and the C terminus are essential for its nuclear export (Koike M, et al., The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2004). In our research, BCAS2 has been demonstrated to bind to the 9-12 ARM repeats of β-catenin. Therefore, it is highly likely that Bcas2 may compete with CRM1 for binding with the nuclear export signal peptide on β-catenin. To further test this possibility, we will transfect HEK293T cells with constructs expressing full-length or truncated forms of β-catenin, and then examine their nuclear distribution.</p>
<p>4. To validate if BCAS2 affects CRM1-dependent nuclear export of other classical factors, we plan to knock down or overexpress <italic>BCAS2</italic> in HeLa cells, and detect the distribution of ATG1 and CDC37L, which have been identified as CRM1 cargoes.</p>
<p>5. Considering that the ARM repeats bound by Bcas2 (repeats 9-12) and Tcf (repeats 2-9) might not be mutually exclusive, it is indeed appealing to investigate whether β-catenin can simultaneously interact with Tcf and Bcas2. We will follow review’s suggestion to perform a three-way co-immunoprecipitation assay. Plasmids encoding these three proteins will be co-transfected into cells. Cell lysates will be immunoprecipitated using antibodyspecific to the bait protein (e.g., β-catenin) and eluted proteins will be analyzed using antibodies specific to the other two proteins.</p>
<p>6. To elucidate that canonical Wnt signaling regulates hematopoietic development by activating expression of <italic>cdx1a</italic>, <italic>cdx4</italic>, and their downstream targets <italic>hoxb5a</italic> and <italic>hoxa9a</italic> as previously reported, we intend to examine the expression of <italic>cdx4</italic> and <italic>hoxa9a</italic> in <italic>bcas2+/-</italic> embryos at 10 ss by performing <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization.</p>
<p>7. To further validate whether Wnt signaling is required during endothelial differentiation from angioblasts, wild-type embryos will be subjected to treatment with Wnt inhibitor CCT036477 and the expression of hemangioblast markers <italic>npas4l</italic>, <italic>scl</italic>, and <italic>gata2</italic> and endothelial markers <italic>fli1</italic> will be analyzed using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization.</p>
<p>8. In order to clarify whether coiled-coil (CC) domain 1-2 of Bcas2 is sufficient to interact with β-catenin and restore the primitive hematopoietic defect, we will overexpress CC1-2 in <italic>Tg(gata1:GFP)</italic> embryos injected with <italic>bcas2</italic> morpholino, and then investigate the distribution of β-catenin, as well as <italic>gata1</italic> expression at 10 ss in these embryos.</p>
