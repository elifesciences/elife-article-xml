<title>Summary</title>
<p>Maintenance of pluripotency is a multifactorial process in which NF-κB is a negative regulator. Our previous work identified a chromatin role for IκBα, the master regulator of NF-κB signaling, that is critical for the proper regulation of various tissue stem cells. Here, we found that IκBα accumulates specifically in the chromatin fraction of pluripotent embryonic stem cells. IκBα depletion does not affect NF-kB-dependent transcription, but causes a profound epigenetic rewiring in pluripotent stem cells, including alterations in H3K27me3, a histone mark catalyzed by Polycomb repression complex 2. Chromatin changes induced by IκBα depletion affect a subset of pluripotency genes and are associated with altered gene transcription. At the cellular level, IκBα-deficient embryonic stem cells are arrested in a naive pluripotency state when cultured in serum/LIF conditions and fail to exit pluripotency under differentiation conditions. By constructing separation-of-function mutants, we show that the effects of IκBα in regulating stem cell pluripotency are NF-κB-independent, but mainly rely on its chromatin-related function. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which IκBα participates in the regulation of the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells and shed light on the interplay between inflammatory signals and the regulation of pluripotency.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) pluripotency is characterized by the capacity to generate all somatic and germline lineages both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, depending on the culture conditions. When cultured in serum plus Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) (Serum/LIF), murine ESCs (mESCs) include cells interconverting to different metastable states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> that either resemble preimplantation blastocyst (naïve pluripotency) or post-implantation (primed pluripotency) embryonic stages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The heterogeneity of mESCs in Serum/LIF is reduced by culturing them in the presence of GSK3β and MEK1/2 inhibitors (CHIR99021 and PD0325901, respectively) along with LIF (2i/LIF). Under these conditions, mESCs enter a ground state of naïve pluripotency characterized by self-renewal activity while suppressing any pro-differentiating signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This pluripotent state closely resembles the inner cell mass of the E4.0 mouse preimplantation blastocyst <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. After implantation, pluripotent capability of the mouse embryo (E5.5) becomes restricted to Epiblast Stem Cells (EpiSCs), which represent a primed pluripotent state, characterized by coexpression of pluripotency and lineage specification markers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. EpiSCs can give rise to cells from the three germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm), albeit their contribution to chimeras or to germ cells is greatly compromised <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. EpiSCs can be derived <italic>in vitro</italic> from naïve pluripotent cells when cultured in a medium supplemented with Nodal and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Different epigenetic features distinguish naïve from primed pluripotent states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, such as changes in the X chromosome inactivation in female cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, histone post-translational modifications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> or a global DNA hypomethylation profile observed in naïve pluripotent stem cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. These epigenetic changes are a prerequisite for the subsequent activation of gene circuits associated with pluripotency exit and germ layer specification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Crucial regulatory elements for the transition from naïve to primed pluripotency state are located in distal DNA regions or enhancers to facilitate the resolution toward the primed state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, identifying novel players to fine-tune the equilibrium between ground and primed states is crucial for preserving both pluripotency stability and differentiation capability in mESCs.</p>
<p>There is now strong evidence that inflammatory signals are critical for stem cell development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, with NF-κB being the main effector. Different strategies to inhibit or attenuate NF-κB in ESCs lead to increase pluripotency gene expression and impair cell differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, or it facilitates reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Canonical NF-κB signaling is triggered by the IKK kinase complex, which induce the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, leading to nuclear translocation of the NF-κB factors (e.g. p50/p65) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, we have previously identified a nuclear IκBα function, which is critical for tissue stem cell homeostasis and the proper differentiation of epidermal, intestinal and hematopoietic stem cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. IκBα chromatin function is mediated by the interaction with histone deacetylases (HDACs), core elements of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2) and histone H2A and H4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We have now investigated the role of IκBα in the context of pluripotent stem cells. Whereas cytoplasmic IκBα is detected in the different states and its levels decrease after differentiation, in agreement with NF-κB activity as a promoter of differentiation, we specifically detected chromatin-bound IκBα in the naïve pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, IκBα depletion in ESCs did not affect NF-κB activity but it stabilizes the naïve (2i/LIF-like) state of pluripotency under Serum/LIF conditions, displaying an epigenetic rewiring, including changes in the PRC2-dependent H3K27me3 histone mark and impacting in proximal and distal regulation of pluripotent genes. Using a new Separation-Of-Function (SOF) IκBα mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, we have now definitively demonstrated that chromatin-bound IκBα is required for naïve pluripotency exit of mESCs in an NF-κB-independent manner. Overall, we identified IκBα as a novel key player in the regulation of the exit from naïve-to-primed pluripotency and essential for the activation of gene programs involved in germ layer specification.</p>

<title>IκBα and NF-κB have opposite expression dynamics in naïve pluripotent cells</title>
<p>Due to the prominent role of NF-κB signaling in mESCs regulation, we analyzed the expression pattern of the different NF-κB members including the IκB inhibitors in the three defined pluripotent stages: ground state of naïve pluripotency (2i/LIF), naïve pluripotency (Serum/LIF), and primed pluripotency (Epiblast Stem Cells or EpiSCs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In agreement with NF-κB being a pro-differentiation factor, canonical NF-κB inhibitors including IκBα (<italic>Nfkbia</italic>), IκBβ (<italic>Nfkbib</italic>) and IκBε (<italic>Nfkbie</italic>) were all expressed in the naïve pluripotency state (both 2i/LIF and Serum/LIF), with <italic>Nfkbia</italic> levels gradually reduced upon naïve pluripotency exit towards EpiSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Rela, Nfkb1 and Nfkb2</italic> genes, codifying for the NF-κB factors p65/RelA, p105 and p100, respectively, showed opposite expression dynamics increasing the levels in EpiSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We further characterized the distribution of IκBα in the cytoplasm, nucleus and chromatin fractions of the three states of pluripotency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Total IκBα protein levels correlated with the detected RNA levels in the three different cellular states being highest in the 2i/LIF condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), with a large accumulation in the cytoplasm. A fraction of IκBα protein was detected in the chromatin of naïve pluripotent cells, being highest in cells cultured in Serum/LIF conditions compared to 2i/LIF and absent in the EpiSCs. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The dynamics of IκBα RNA and protein levels from naïve pluripotent ESCs to EpiSCs was further corroborated by analysis of an additional database that includes both naïve and primed pluripotent states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we studied IκBα expression in differentiated embryoid bodies (EBs) from mESCs (Serum/LIF) (see materials and methods) and analyzed the expression levels of different pluripotency, differentiation-linked, and NF-κB genes by RNA sequencing. <italic>Nfkbia</italic> (IκBα gene) was expressed at higher levels specifically in mESCs (Serum/LIF) whereas cells undergoing differentiation (48h and 96h) displayed a reduction in its expression levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>Nfkbia</italic> was similar to the pluripotency genes whereas most of the NF-κB genes were upregulated upon differentiation, clustering together with developmental genes, as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.

<p>Taken together, these data show that, unlike the other NF-kB inhibitors and target genes, the expression of <italic>Nfkbia</italic> is high in the naive pluripotent state, with IκBα protein present in the cytoplasm and chromatin of naive pluripotent cells.

<title>IκBα is required in mESCs to exit the naïve pluripotency state</title>
<p>To investigate the functional implication of IκBα in naïve pluripotency, we knocked-out (KO) IκBα protein in mESCs by CRISPR-Cas9 (IκBα-KO mESCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A</xref> and materials and methods). Notably, IκBα KO mESCs have an impaired ability to undergo differentiation and cannot properly switch off the pluripotency program after 216h (9 days) of pro-differentiation signals, as it is demonstrated by high levels of pluripotency markers OCT3/4 and NANOG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1C</xref>), higher number of alkaline phosphatase cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1</xref>) and higher percentage of SSEA-1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1B</xref>) within the 216h EBs. These results were also supported by the detection of increased expression level of the naïve pluripotency genes <italic>Pou5f1 (Oct3/4 gene), Gbx2, Klf2, Sox2, Zfp42 (Rex1)</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> in IκBα KO EBs after 216h of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To shed light into the molecular mechanisms governing the differentiation impairment in IκBα KO EBs, we performed RNA-seq of IκBα WT and IκBα KO mESCs in the first stages of the embryoid body differentiation. Analysis of the data indicated that IκBα KO EBs cannot successfully evolve towards differentiation trajectories, as shown by principal component analysis (PCA) of IκBα-WT and IκBα-KO EBs at 48h and 96h in differentiation media (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Analysis of naïve pluripotency markers at 96h (<italic>Gab1, Sox2, Esrrb, Zfp42, Dppa4, Klf2, Prdm14, Klf4, Tfcp2l1</italic>) also showed higher expression levels in IκBα KO compared to their IκBα WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1F</xref>). Defective differentiation capacity of IκBα KO EBs involved programs associated with specification of all 3 germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E-G</xref>). Moreover, IκBα KO EBs were smaller in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1E</xref>), in agreement with the reduced developmental potential of IκBα-depleted mESCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. To further study the requirement of IκBα in pluripotency exit <italic>in vivo</italic>, we established teratomas by subcutaneous injection of IκBα-WT and IκBα-KO mESCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> and materials and methods) into NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcˢᶜⁱᵈ Il2rgᵗᵐ¹ᵂʲˡ/SzJ) mice. IκBα-KO teratomas showed a decreased differentiation potential, as indicated by higher number of OCT4<sup>+</sup> cells 6 weeks after injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2H-J</xref>). These observations further confirm the essential role of IκBα in the exit from the pluripotency state not only <italic>in vitro</italic> but also under <italic>in vivo</italic> differentiation signals. To understand the conditions in which IκBα is required for pluripotency exit, we differentiated IκBα-WT and IκBα-KO mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF (naïve pluripotency) towards EpiSCs (primed pluripotency) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, upper panel). IκBα-KO cells were not committed towards the primed pluripotency stage and maintained an elevated expression levels of naïve pluripotency genes (<italic>Dppa3, Nanog, Sox2, Rex1, Klf2, Klf4, Gbx2, Tbx3</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom panel).

To investigate how IκBα deficiency was affecting the exit of mESCs from naïve pluripotency, we performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using RNA-seq data from IκBα-KO and IκBα-WT mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF against gene signatures for 2i/LIF and Serum/LIF pluripotency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. GSEA results revealed a significant enrichment in Serum/LIF IκBα-KO mESCs transcriptome for genes specifically expressed in the naïve ground state (2i/LIF), while they negatively correlate with mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. These results agree with the fact that IκBα-KO mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF resemble 2i/LIF morphology, with homogeneous tight clusters of cells, whereas IκBα-WT mESCs retain the colony heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2B</xref>). Interestingly, the higher levels of ground-state-related genes <italic>Zfp42</italic> (<italic>Rex1</italic>), <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Tbx3</italic> in IκBα-KO mESCs were partially obtained when IκBα-WT mESCs were cultured in 2i/LIF for two consecutive passages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the key features of the naïve pluripotency state is its global DNA hypomethylation pattern <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.

We found that IκBα-KO mESCs contained much lower levels of 5mC compared to IκBα-WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, DNA methylation arrays confirmed a global pattern of DNA hypomethylation in IκBα-KO mESCs, which was maintained in 96h EBs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

<title>Lack of IκBα causes an epigenetic rewiring in pluripotent stem cells to resemble 2i/LIF naïve pluripotency in Serum/LIF culture</title>
<p>ChIP Enrichment Analysis (ChEA) of genes identified in our RNA-seq data of IκBα-KO and WT mESCs revealed that differentially expressed genes were putative targets of chromatin regulators including the PRC2 subunit SUZ12 and MTF2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

Since 2i/LIF and Serum/LIF states are characterized by important differences in epigenetic marks, we carried out an epigenetic profiling of IκBα-WT and IκBα-KO mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF. We performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) of histone modifications associated with gene activation (H3K4me3) and gene repression (H3K27me3) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3A-B</xref>). Overall, Serum/LIF IκBα-KO mESCs exhibited a general increased H3K4me3 status and redistribution of the PRC2-catalyzed H3K27me3 mark (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, gain of the H3K4me3 mark was associated with a reduction of H3K27me3 levels in genes associated with naïve pluripotency function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3A-B</xref>).

<p>To further investigate the relative impact of both IκBα functions in mESCs, we took advantage of recent results from our group that led to the identification of the specific IκBα protein residues that define NF-κB- or chromatin-binding through H2A/H4. Mutation of these residues allowed the generation of doxycycline-inducible (i) separation-of-function IκBα mutants that are specifically deficient in one or the other function, at least in the intestinal epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We called i-IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup> the i-SOF IκBα mutant that interacts with NF-κB but is deficient for H2A and H4 binding and i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> the one that interact with histones but is deficient for NF-κB subunits binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B and</xref> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>). The three different IκBα forms (i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup>, i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> and i-IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup>) were stably transfected in the IκBα KO mESCs and induced by 16h of doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>). We used these cells to investigate the biochemical properties and functional impact of SOF IκBα mutants in mESCs. By pull-down experiments, we found that i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> expressed in ESCs was able to interact with histone H2A but not with the NF-κB member p50. In contrast, i-IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup> interacts with p50 but not with H2A, while i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup> preserves both binding capacities (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In concordance with these results, i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup> and i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> were found in both the cytoplasmic and chromatin fractions of mESCs, whereas IκBα<sup>ΔCromatin</sup> was retained in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D-E</xref>). In multiple experiments, we noticed a significant reduction in protein levels of IκBα<sup>Δchromatin</sup> despite the mRNA expression levels of the different IκBα forms being comparable (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C-D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4A</xref>).</p>
<p>Then, we studied whether i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup> and/or the i-SOF IκBα mutants (IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> or IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup>) were able to reverse any of the phenotypes observed in the IκBα-KO mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4B</xref>). Induction of i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup> and i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> reduced the expression levels of the naïve pluripotent genes <italic>Zfp42, Klf2, Sox2</italic> and <italic>Tbx3</italic>, which were increased by i-IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition, the ground state-associated DNA hypomethylation was specifically reverted in i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup> and i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> mESCs but not in i-IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup> mESCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Finally, we addressed whether i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup>, i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> and i-IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup> mESCs were capable to revert the differentiation blockage of IκBα-KO ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4B</xref>). Induction of IκBα<sup>WT</sup> and IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> was enough to restore the differentiation potential of IκBα-KO mESCs into EBs, as indicated the increase in the number of differentiated cells (based on percentage of SSEA-1<sup>neg</sup> cells) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4C</xref>) and the reduced number of AP+ colonies (in the 216h IκBα-KO reconstituted EB assays), which was similar to the number of colonies obtained from IκBαWT EBs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5I</xref>). Lastly, the number of remaining pluripotent-like cells (defined by OCT3/4 NANOG staining) was also reduced in i-IκBα<sup>WT</sup> and i-IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup> 216h EBs, and only small and few regions of undifferentiated cells was observed. In contrast, induction of i-IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup> did not restore the differentiation potential of IκBα-KO mESCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4D</xref>).</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that the chromatin-dependent IκBα function, but not its NF-κB-related activity, is necessary for the proper regulation of chromatin marks at specific genomic regions that are linked to transcriptional changes that are likely at the base of the capacity of ESCs to exit the ground state of naïve pluripotency and differentiate.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have identified a new and unexpected function for the IκBα protein in the regulation of the naïve pluripotency exit. Using mESCs to investigate the role of IκBα in pluripotency maintenance and differentiation, we discovered that the absence of IκBα severely impairs the exit of pluripotency. Furthermore, IκBα-KO mESCs stabilizes the ground state of naïve pluripotency under Serum/LIF conditions, shedding light on its function as a critical regulator of the transition from naïve to primed pluripotency. While IκBα is commonly known for its role as an inhibitor of the NF-κB signaling pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, our laboratory has previously furnished compelling evidence of its alternative role through its interaction with histones and other chromatin components <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We have demonstrated that chromatin-bound IκBα plays a crucial role in regulating skin and intestinal stem cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, hematopoietic stem cell development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and it influences the regenerative capacity of these tissues, and in some cases, their susceptibility to neoplastic transformation. Disentangling the chromatin-related function of IκBα from its canonical role as an inhibitor of NF-κB has been challenging, making it difficult to determine its truly biological significance. To tackle this challenge, we engineered separation-of-function (SOF) mutants of IκBα, as detailed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, by identifying specific residues that are essential for binding either NF-κB elements or histones. Interestingly, we have shown that only the histone-binding proficient IκBα mutant (IκBα<sup>ΔNF-κB</sup>), which lacks the ability to bind to NF-κB, has the capability to reverse the stabilization of the ground state observed in IκBα-KO mESCs. This is sufficient to facilitate their exit from the state of naïve pluripotency, restoring their full differentiation potential (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The involvement of NF-κB in pluripotency has been a subject of prior investigation. Studies have revealed that pluripotent cells display a dampened inflammatory signaling pathway, which is induced upon pluripotency dissolution and activation of differentiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the attenuated status of NF-κB during this stage remain incompletely understood. A recent work has shed light on a potential regulatory axis involving ATG5-β-TrCP1-NF-κB, proposing it as a mechanism that diminishes NF-κB activity by stabilizing the IκBα protein in mESCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In any case, since modification of canonical NF-κB activity directly impacts on the levels IκBα expression, the previous NF-κB-associated phenotypes should be reevaluated considering this chromatin role of IκBα. Furthermore, the expression of IκBα<sup>ΔChromatin</sup>, which retains the inhibitory function of NF-κB, failed to mitigate the ground state stabilization observed in IκBα-KO mESCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This finding suggests that the observed role of IκBα in regulating the exit from naïve pluripotency is not due to NF-κB inhibition. In fact, there is evidence that the chromatin function of IκBα is an ancestral function preceding its role as NF-κB inhibitor. In Caenorhabditis Elegans (<italic>C.elegans</italic>), which lacks NF-κB orthologs but possesses two homologs of IκBα, the absence of IκBα orthologs has severe multi-organ differentiation defects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. This observation further supports the notion that the chromatin-related function of IκBα plays a fundamental role in developmental processes, independent of its canonical role in NF-κB signaling.</p>
<p>We have observed that IκBα-KO mESCs exhibit epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles resembling the ground state of naïve pluripotency under Serum/LIF culture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). In this regard, the fact that IκBα is preferentially located in the chromatin of mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF, when they exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity, suggests that IκBα might act as a regulator of this heterogeneity. One potential explanation might be that IκBα could be affecting the stability of fluctuating transcription factors, which is crucial to mediate the pluripotent-to-differentiation balance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Thus, the lack of IκBα might stabilize those transcription factors that would favor the ground-state observed in IκBα-KO mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF. Further experiments are required to demonstrate this hypothesis. Moreover, the differences in murine and human pluripotency <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> point out the necessity to address the real impact of IκBα modulation in the stabilization of the ground state in human pluripotent stem cells.</p>
<p>In summary, our work establishes that IκBα mediates the exit from naïve pluripotency by modulating the activation of naïve pluripotency genes. Importantly, this newly identified role of IκBα operates independently of its canonical function in inhibiting the NF-κB pathway. Our findings underscore the intricate interplay between inflammation and pluripotency status, revealing a previously unrecognized complexity in their interaction.</p>

A consensus peakset was obtained from the three biological replicates per histone mark and condition (IκBα-WT or IκBα-KO) by identifying overlapping peaks in at least two out of the three replicates.</p>
<p>Differential binding analysis (DBA) was conducted with DiffBind (v3.8.4) per histone mark <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Default parameters were used except for the summits parameter which was set to 500bp for all histone marks except for H3K4me3 (150bp) in order to consider, for testing, intervals of 1000bp or 300bp respectively. Summit values were selected to have interval widths between the minimum and first quartile peak width values for each histone mark. EdgeR was the statistical method used for all the three analyses. Differentially bound regions (DBRs) between IκBα-KO and IκBα-WT samples were called with adjusted p-values (FDR) &lt; 0.05. Identified DBRs with any annotated gene were plotted with EnrichedHeatmap R package (v1.18.1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>.

<title>Enhancers activity identification</title>
<p>Consensus peaksets derived from the three H3K27ac and H3K4me1 IκBα-WT mESCs replicates were used to identify poised and active enhancers in an IκBα-WT scenario. Putative poised enhancers were defined as those regions with H3K4me1 but no H3K27ac peaks. Putative active enhancers were defined as those regions with H3K27ac and presence/absence H3K4me1 peaks. To assess any differential enhancers activity in IκBα-KO vs IκBα-WT mESCs cultured in Serum/LIF, differentially bound regions and consensus peaksets (IκBα-KO) identified in H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were required. Putative gained or lost poised/active enhancers in IκBα <sup>-/-</sup> were obtained with following criteria: (i) for gained/lost poised enhancers in IκBα <sup>-/-</sup>: a differential H3K4me1 increase/decrease and absence of H3K27ac peaks in IκBα <sup>-/-</sup> consensus peakset, (ii) for gained/lost active enhancers (without H3K4me1) in IκBα-KO: a differential H3K27ac increase/decrease and absence of H3K4me1 in IκBα-KO consensus peakset and (iii) for gained/lost active enhancers (with H3K4me1) in IκBα-KO: a differential H3K27ac increase/decrease and presence of H3K4me1 in IκBα <sup>-/-</sup> consensus peakset.</p>
<p>A maximum gap of 1000bp was allowed for checking the overlap between two different histone marks. For this purpose, the ‘subsetByOverlaps’ function from the IRanges R package was used (v.2.34.1).</p>

Obtained BAM files with uniquely mapped reads were considered for further analysis. Raw gene expression was quantified using featureCounts tool from subRead software (v2.0.1) with exon as feature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. The raw counts matrix was imported into the R Statistical Software environment (v4.2.1) for downstream analysis. Raw expression matrix included 55,487 genes per 18 samples in total. Experimental design considered three timepoints: mouse ESCs, EBs at 48h and EBs at 96h. Each time point included 6 samples distributed in two conditions: 3 IκBα-WT and 3 IκBα-KO. Prior to statistical analysis, those genes with less than 10 raw counts across the 6 samples under test were removed. After pre-filtering, 21,843 genes (mESCs), 21,424 genes (EBs 48h) or 21,664 genes (EBs 96h) were available for testing. For visualization purposes, counts were normalized by the variance-stabilizing transformation method as implemented in DESeq2 R package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> (v1.38.3). Differential expression analysis (DEA) was conducted with DESeq2. Each time point was independently analyzed.

Briefly, raw signal intensities were obtained with GenomeStudio Software 2011.1 (Illumina) and DNA methylation beta values were computed from raw IDAT files using GenomeStudio default normalization with control probes and background subtraction. Quality control steps to remove erratic probe signals were performed within the R statistical environment (v4.0.3). We removed probes with detection p value &gt; 0.01, genotyping probes and manufacturing flagged (MFG) probes described in the Illumina manifest file (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.illumina.com/downloads/infinium-mouse-methylation-manifest-file.html">https://support.illumina.com/downloads/infinium-mouse-methylation-manifest-file.html</ext-link>).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study probes the role of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBa in the regulation of pluripotency in mouse embyronic stem cells (mESCs). It follows from previous work that identified a chromatin-specific role for IκBa in the regulation of tissue stem cell differentiation. The work presented here shows that a fraction of IκBa specifically associates with chromatin in pluripotent stem cells. Using three Nfkbia-knockout lines, the authors show that IκBa ablation impairs the exit from pluripotency, with embryonic bodies (an in vitro model of mESC multi-lineage differentiation) still expressing high levels of pluripotency markers after sustained exposure to differentiation signals. The maintenance of aberrant pluripotency gene expression under differentiation conditions is accompanied by pluripotency-associated epigenetic profiles of DNA methylation and histone marks. Using elegant separation of function mutants identified in a separate study, the authors generate versions of IκBa that are either impaired in histone/chromatin binding or NF-κB binding. They show that the provision of the WT IκBa, or the NF-κB-binding mutant can rescue the changes in gene expression driven by loss of IκBa, but the chromatin-binding mutant can not. Thus the study identifies a chromatin-specific, NF-κB-independent role of IκBa as a regulator of exit from pluripotency.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the manuscript lie in: (a) the use of several orthogonal assays to support the conclusions on the effects of exit from pluripotency; (b) the use of three independent clonal Nfkbia-KO mESC lines (lacking IκBa), which increase confidence in the conclusions; and (c) the use of separation of function mutants to determine the relative contributions of the chromatin-associated and NF-κB-associated IκBa, which would otherwise be very difficult to unpick.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this reviewer's view, the term &quot;differentiation&quot; is used inappropriately in this manuscript. The data showing aberrant expression of pluripotency markers during embryoid body formation are supported by several lines of evidence and are convincing. However, the authors call the phenotype of Nfkbia-KO cells a &quot;differentiation impairment&quot; while the data on differentiation markers are not shown (beyond the fact that H3K4me1, marking poised enhancers, is reduced in genes underlying GO processes associated with differentiation and organ development). Data on differentiation marker expression from the transcriptomic and embryoid body immunofluorescent experiments, for example, should be at hand without the need to conduct many more experiments and would help to support the conclusions of the study or make them more specific. The lack of probing the differentiation versus pluripotency genes may be a missed opportunity in gaining in-depth understanding of the phenotype associated with loss of the chromatin-associated function of IκBa.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the role of IκBα in regulating mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and differentiation. The authors demonstrate that IκBα knockout impairs the exit from the naïve pluripotent state during embryoid body differentiation. Through mechanistic studies using various mutants, they show that IκBα regulates ESC differentiation through chromatin-related functions, independent of the canonical NF-κB pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors nicely investigate the role of IκBα in pluripotency exit, using embryoid body formation and complementing the phenotypic analysis with a number of genome-wide approaches, including transcriptomic, histone marks deposition, and DNA methylation analyses. Moreover, they generate a first-of-its-kind mutant set that allows them to uncouple IκBα's function in chromatin regulation versus its NF-κB-related functions. This work contributes to our understanding of cellular plasticity and development, potentially interesting a broad audience including developmental biologists, chromatin biology researchers, and cell signaling experts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- The study's main limitation is the lack of crucial controls using bona fide naïve cells across key experiments, including DNA methylation analysis, gene expression profiling in embryoid bodies, and histone mark deposition. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate whether the observed changes in IκBα-KO cells truly reflect naïve pluripotency characteristics.</p>
<p>
- Several conclusions in the manuscript require a more measured interpretation. The authors should revise their statements regarding the strength of the pluripotency exit block, the extent of hypomethylation, and the global nature of chromatin changes.</p>
<p>
- From a methodological perspective, the manuscript would benefit from additional orthogonal approaches to strengthen the knockout findings, which may be influenced by clonal expansion of ES cells.</p>
<p>Overall, this study makes an important contribution to the field. However, the concerns raised regarding controls, data interpretation, and methodology should be addressed to strengthen the manuscript and support the authors' conclusions.</p>

<p>This important study reveals a role for IκBα in the regulation of embryonic stem cell pluripotency. The solid data in mouse embryonic stem cells include separation of function mutations in IκBα to dissect its non-canonical role as a chromatin regulator and its canonical function as NF-κB inhibitor. The conclusions could be strengthened by including better markers of differentiation status and additional controls or orthogonal approaches.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are thankful to the two reviewers and editors for their kind feedback and for highlighting the impact of NF-kB-independent IkBa function in stabilizing naïve pluripotency.</p>
<p>In order to address reviewer’s comments, we will perform further analysis of differentiation trajectories, as well as a deeper comparison of the epigenetic features in our IkBa-KO mESCs with the Serum/LIF and 2i/LIF conditions. Moreover, we recognize that some sentences need to be modified to soften our conclusions in terms of effects on block in the naïve state or the global epigenetic effects, as the reviewers pointed out.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study probes the role of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBa in the regulation of pluripotency in mouse embyronic stem cells (mESCs). It follows from previous work that identified a chromatin-specific role for IκBa in the regulation of tissue stem cell differentiation. The work presented here shows that a fraction of IκBa specifically associates with chromatin in pluripotent stem cells. Using three Nfkbia-knockout lines, the authors show that IκBa ablation impairs the exit from pluripotency, with embryonic bodies (an in vitro model of mESC multi-lineage differentiation) still expressing high levels of pluripotency markers after sustained exposure to differentiation signals. The maintenance of aberrant pluripotency gene expression under differentiation conditions is accompanied by pluripotency-associated epigenetic profiles of DNA methylation and histone marks. Using elegant separation of function mutants identified in a separate study, the authors generate versions of IκBa that are either impaired in histone/chromatin binding or NF-κB binding. They show that the provision of the WT IκBa, or the NF-κB-binding mutant can rescue the changes in gene expression driven by loss of IκBa, but the chromatin-binding mutant can not. Thus the study identifies a chromatin-specific, NF-κB-independent role of IκBa as a regulator of exit from pluripotency.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the manuscript lie in: (a) the use of several orthogonal assays to support the conclusions on the effects of exit from pluripotency; (b) the use of three independent clonal Nfkbia-KO mESC lines (lacking IκBa), which increase confidence in the conclusions; and (c) the use of separation of function mutants to determine the relative contributions of the chromatin-associated and NF-κB-associated IκBa, which would otherwise be very difficult to unpick.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this reviewer's view, the term &quot;differentiation&quot; is used inappropriately in this manuscript. The data showing aberrant expression of pluripotency markers during embryoid body formation are supported by several lines of evidence and are convincing. However, the authors call the phenotype of Nfkbia-KO cells a &quot;differentiation impairment&quot; while the data on differentiation markers are not shown (beyond the fact that H3K4me1, marking poised enhancers, is reduced in genes underlying GO processes associated with differentiation and organ development). Data on differentiation marker expression from the transcriptomic and embryoid body immunofluorescent experiments, for example, should be at hand without the need to conduct many more experiments and would help to support the conclusions of the study or make them more specific. The lack of probing the differentiation versus pluripotency genes may be a missed opportunity in gaining in-depth understanding of the phenotype associated with loss of the chromatin-associated function of IκBa.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Specific answer to weaknesses for Reviewer 1:</p>
<p>We have data showing the lack of expression of specific differentiation markers that we will add to the manuscript. Moreover, we will also globally analyse differentiation markers in our transcriptomic data to have a more accurate description of the phenotype.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates the role of IκBα in regulating mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency and differentiation. The authors demonstrate that IκBα knockout impairs the exit from the naïve pluripotent state during embryoid body differentiation. Through mechanistic studies using various mutants, they show that IκBα regulates ESC differentiation through chromatin-related functions, independent of the canonical NF-κB pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors nicely investigate the role of IκBα in pluripotency exit, using embryoid body formation and complementing the phenotypic analysis with a number of genome-wide approaches, including transcriptomic, histone marks deposition, and DNA methylation analyses. Moreover, they generate a first-of-its-kind mutant set that allows them to uncouple IκBα's function in chromatin regulation versus its NF-κB-related functions. This work contributes to our understanding of cellular plasticity and development, potentially interesting a broad audience including developmental biologists, chromatin biology researchers, and cell signaling experts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The study's main limitation is the lack of crucial controls using bona fide naïve cells across key experiments, including DNA methylation analysis, gene expression profiling in embryoid bodies, and histone mark deposition. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate whether the observed changes in IκBα-KO cells truly reflect naïve pluripotency characteristics.</p>
<p>- Several conclusions in the manuscript require a more measured interpretation. The authors should revise their statements regarding the strength of the pluripotency exit block, the extent of hypomethylation, and the global nature of chromatin changes.</p>
<p>- From a methodological perspective, the manuscript would benefit from additional orthogonal approaches to strengthen the knockout findings, which may be influenced by clonal expansion of ES cells.</p>
<p>Overall, this study makes an important contribution to the field. However, the concerns raised regarding controls, data interpretation, and methodology should be addressed to strengthen the manuscript and support the authors' conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Specific answer to weaknesses for Reviewer 2:</p>
<p>- As the reviewer pointed out, we have not performed all the analysis by comparing with cells in 2i LIF since our initial study was focused on Serum LIF and differentiation. However, it was the transcriptome analysis in Serum LIF which showed that KO cells resembled naïve ES cells in 2i LIF by GSEA. We have repeated key experiments with all conditions (Figure 1B, 1D, Figure 3C and 3), but we do not think that repeating all ‘omics’ experiments with 2i LIF conditions will add important information. Nevertheless, we will analyze different chromatin data (DNA methylation and different histone post-translational modifications) from previously published works in 2i/LIF and Serum/LIF and compare them with our IκBα-WT and IκBα-KO mESCs to better confirm the stabilization of the ground state pluripotency in IκBα-KO mESCs under Serum/LIF conditions.</p>
<p>- We agree about reducing the strength of the pluripotency exit block, extend of hypomethylation and the global nature of chromatin changes. There are many changes in the chromatin that we are trying to better characterize by HiC in ongoing studies that are out of the scope of this manuscript.</p>
<p>We have performed studies in 3 different IkBa KO and WT clones. In addition, the reconstitution studies with IkBa separation-of-function (SOF) mutants with differential effect after expressing the NFkB binding form (IkBaDChrom) or the chromatin binding form (IkBaDNFkB) also support the robustness of this phenotype.</p>
