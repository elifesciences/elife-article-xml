<title>Summary</title><p>Viruses rely on host cellular machinery for replication. After entering the nucleus, the HIV genome accumulates in nuclear niches where it undergoes reverse transcription and integrates into neighboring chromatin, promoting high transcription rates and new virus progeny. Despite anti-retroviral treatment, viral genomes can persist in these nuclear niches and reactivate if treatment is interrupted, likely contributing to the formation of viral reservoirs. The post-nuclear entry dynamics of HIV remain unclear, and understanding these steps is critical for revealing how viral reservoirs are established.</p>
<p>In this study, we elucidate the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and the domains of CPSF6 essential for this process. We also explore the roles of nuclear speckle scaffold factors, SON and SRRM2, in the biogenesis of these puncta. Through genetic manipulation and depletion experiments, we demonstrate the key role of the intrinsically disordered region of SRRM2 in enlarging nuclear speckles in the presence of the HIV capsid.</p>
<p>We identify the FG domain of CPSF6 as essential for both puncta formation and binding to the viral core, which serves as the scaffold for CPSF6 puncta. While the low-complexity regions (LCRs) modulate CPSF6 binding to the viral capsid, they do not contribute to puncta formation, nor do the disordered mixed charge domains (MCDs) of CPSF6. These results demonstrate how HIV evolved to hijack host nuclear factors, enabling its persistence in the host.</p>
<p>Of note, this study provides new insights into the underlying interactions between host factors and viral components, advancing our understanding of HIV nuclear dynamics and offering potential therapeutic targets for preventing viral persistence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the discovery of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barre-Sinoussi et al., 1983</xref>), the initial stages of the viral life cycle have been understood to primarily occur within the host cytoplasm. Only the pre-integration complex, carrying the fully reverse-transcribed viral DNA, was believed to enter the nucleus for integration into the host chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Suzuki and Craigie, 2007</xref>). Recent studies highlighted that the viral genome is transported in the nucleus via a shuttle that shields it from the hostile cellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</xref>). This shuttle is constituted by the viral capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blanco-Rodriguez and Di Nunzio, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanco-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Selyutina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yamashita and Emerman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zila et al., 2021</xref>), which comprises 250 hexamers and 12 pentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pornillos et al., 2009</xref>). Within the structure of the capsid, hydrophobic pockets exist between hexamers, which serve as targets for various nucleoporins, especially the ones carrying FG repeats, facilitating the translocation of the capsid through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buffone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Di Nunzio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Di Nunzio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lelek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matreyek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies suggest that HIV uses multiple FG regions of several nucleoporins to translocate through the NPC, acting as a chaperone by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dickson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fu et al., 2024</xref>). Using a reductionist system of Nup98 condensates, it has been demonstrated that FG-mediated phase partitioning identifies specific sites on the capsid that allow it to interact autonomously with these phases. These findings complement the evolving understanding of the early stages of HIV infection, which has been revisited in recent years. They unveil that crucial stages of early viral infection occur within the host nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burdick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dharan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Francis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Selyutina et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, it has been shown that the pre-integration complex forms within the host nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Muller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>), and incoming viral RNA genomes accumulate in nuclear niches containing, such as like cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 6 (CPSF6), RNA-binding protein SON and Splicing component, 35 kDa (SC35, also known as serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Francis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). However, the mechanistic requirements that govern post-nuclear entry phases, which are crucial for a successful viral infection and the establishment of viral reservoirs, remain enigmatic.</p>
<p>Specifically, the mechanism behinds the formation of nuclear niches containing viral components and nuclear speckle (NS) factors, such as SC35—traditionally used as a marker for nuclear speckles remains unclear. However, recent studies have revealed that SON and serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 2 (SRRM2) are essential for NS biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fu and Maniatis, 1990</xref>). Particularly, intrinsically disordered regions play a critical role in the NS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>). These membraneless organelles (MLOs) fulfil various cellular functions besides splicing. Recent evidence indicates a direct role of NSs in cellular transcription regulation, as their spatial proximity correlates with gene expression amplification, as demonstrated by live-cell imaging of heat-shock responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). HIV, being a virus capable of generating new particles through splicing and integrating into active host genes, finds NSs highly conducive for viral replication. HIV particles, along with their RNA genome, accumulate within nuclear MLOs enriched in NS factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, CPSF6, a paraspeckle factor first identified as a viral partner by KewalRamani’s laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), has been clearly detected in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Francis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Luchsinger et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). These puncta serve as hubs for nuclear reverse transcription (RT) and the formation of pre-integration complexes, which generate active proviruses detected outside but in close proximity to NSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, we aim to elucidate how these HIV-induced CPSF6 form and identify the NS factors involved in their formation. CPSF6, along with NS factors, contains intrinsically disordered regions that can guide HIV-1 to the correct nuclear location for successful infection or allow the virus to remain sequestered during drug treatment, forming reservoirs. Importantly, viral reservoirs are the major bottleneck for curing the infection.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate which disordered domain of CPSF6 is responsible for tracking the viral core and generating HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta in the host nucleus. Simultaneously, we elucidate the key component of NSs that, through its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), enable fusion with HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta, likely stabilizing them. Notably, we observed that the virus rebounds when anti-reverse transcription drugs are removed, but only if nuclear niches containing HIV, NS factors, and CPSF6 are present. If these niches are pharmacologically dismantled, viral rebound does not occur.</p>
<p>Overall, studying the biogenesis of HIV-induced nuclear niches is crucial for understanding how the virus navigates and persists in the nucleus of infected cells, and for designing new antiretroviral strategies.</p>

<title>Critical Role of HIV-Induced CPSF6 Puncta in Restoring Nuclear RT After Anti-RT Therapy Discontinuation</title>
<p>Upon nuclear entry, HIV enhances the formation of CPSF6 clusters, where RT ends. The treatment with the reversible RT inhibitor nevirapine (NEV) can trap the viral RNA genome in these nuclear niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). Once NEV is removed, the trapped vRNA can resume RT entirely within the nucleus, a process we term nuclear RT. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenon is dependent on the presence of CPSF6 puncta, as their disruption by high doses of PF74 (25 µM) significantly impairs nuclear RT, shown by the absence of luciferase expression, similar to full NEV treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>).</p>

<title>CPSF6 FG Domain is Required for HIV-Induced Puncta Formation</title>
<p>Formation of CPSF6 puncta upon HIV-1 infection hinges into two key events: the entry of the HIV-1 core into the nucleus and the binding of CPSF6 to the HIV-1 core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blanco-Rodriguez and Di Nunzio, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanco-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buffone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zila et al., 2021</xref>). To determine the contribution of CPSF6’s disordered domains for the formation of CPSF6 puncta upon HIV-1 infection, we correlated the binding of CPSF6 to the HIV-1 core with the formation of CPSF6 puncta. To this end, we first generated CPSF6 knockout (KO) THP-1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>) to eliminate the interference from the endogenous protein, which could affect the interpretation of results regarding the role of the analyzed CPSF6 domains. CPSF6 depletion in THP-1 cells was performed by CRISPR Cas9 technology. To completely eliminate the expression of the CPSF6 gene we selected single clones by limiting dilution. We identified a clone that was completely KO for CPSF6, confirmed through western blot and immunofluorescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>) and we infected this clone and the control clone with HIV. CPSF6 puncta were detected only in the control-infected cells and not in the KO clone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig.3A</xref>). The viral integrase (IN) was observed within CPSF6 puncta, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Francis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>), but absent in CPSF6 KO cells where viral IN was predominantly observed in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig.3A</xref>). Thus, we used KO cells for CPSF6 to assess the role of selected CPSF6 domains in HIV-induced condensates. We designed various CPSF6 deletion mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) to specifically assess the significance of the main disordered regions of CPSF6 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Figure 2A</xref>) such as, the FG motif, the low complexity regions (LCRs), and the mixed charge domain (MCD), in the ability of CPSF6 to bind to the core and facilitate the formation of CPSF6 puncta. We investigated the role of the FG peptide by generating a mutant that exclusively lacks the FG peptide (ΔFG). Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that the FG peptide binds to the hydrophobic pocket formed between capsid hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buffone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we want to investigate the role of FG peptide in the context of the protein.</p>

<p>To further explore this, we developed an alternative plasmid by expanding the FG peptide deletion to include surrounding prion-like LCRs (ΔFG ΔLCR). These regions, outside the CPSF6 context, have been identified as crucial for facilitating strong CPSF6 binding to capsid lattices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). In our study, we aim to evaluate their role within a more physiological setting. Additionally, we assessed a CPSF6 variant that carries the 15-mer FG peptide flanked by non-LCR sequences, such as those derived from Beta-adducin (ADD2), kindly provided by Mamuka Kvaratskhelia (ΔLCR+ADD2). These protein segments are known for their high flexibility, akin to the LCR of CPSF6. Furthermore, to elucidate the contribution of the LCRs of CPSF6 in the formation of CPSF6 puncta, we generated a mutant lacking both LCRs (ΔLCR) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Analysis of the MCD contribution to both the ability of CPSF6 to bind to the core and formation of CPSF6 puncta was achieved by deleting the MCD and adding 3 nuclear localization signals (3xNLS ΔMCD) since the deletion of the MCD results in a protein that localizes mainly into the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>To correlate the ability of CPSF6 to bind to the HIV-1 core with formation of CPSF6 puncta, we expressed wild type and mutant CPSF6 constructs in THP-1 cells knockout for CPSF6. Subsequently, we infected these cells with HIV-1 and analyzed the presence or absence of CPSF6 clusters at 24 hours post-infection. Importantly, for the imaging experiment we expressed CPSF6 WT and mutants without tags to avoid the formation of aggregates that could interfere with our conclusions. Our data show that HIV-induced CPSF6 clusters can form extremely rarely with the deletion mutant CPSF6 ADD2ΔLCR and with the mutant lacking the FG or both the FG peptide and the LCRs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig.3B</xref>). However, when we analyzed the role of the MCD domain in CPSF6 puncta formation, which was indicated to be important for condensing CPSF6 in NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Greig et al., 2020</xref>), comparing the number of CPSF6 WT puncta induced by HIV infection with CPSF6 mutants revealed that the MCD domain does not play a critical role in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>). In addition, we observed that the majority of analysed CPSF6 3xNLSΔMCD puncta contain vRNA inside, similar to CPSF6 WT puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), thus corroborating the lack of a role for this intrinsically disordered domain in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. Since the NLS domain from SV40, which replaces the MCD, is highly basic and could potentially induce condensates, we fused CPSF6 with a non-basic NLS (PY-NLS) or removed the NLS entirely. Even though these two proteins do not efficiently enter the nucleus, the few that do manage to reach the nucleus can host viral particles, as evidenced by the presence of IN. Many viruses are typically blocked in the cytoplasm due to the presence of these mutants that are mainly cytoplasmic. However, because we used a high viral dose, the blockage in the cytoplasm was not complete. As a result, the viruses that successfully entered the nucleus induced the formation of clusters associated with CPSF6-deleted mutants, indicating that the MCD is not critical for the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2H</xref>). Similar to the MCD, when we compared CPSF6 truncated for the LCRs with CPSF6 WT, we observed that the LCRs do not contribute to CPSF6 puncta formation. Therefore, the FG peptide alone, without the LCRs, is the only CPSF6 domain required for their formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-F</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig.3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we tested the ability of the different CPSF6 deletion mutants for their ability to bind the viral core using a previously described capsid binding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Selyutina et al., 2018</xref>). Wild type and mutant CPSF6 proteins were expressed in human 293T cells at similar levels (INPUT) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Extracts containing wild type and mutant CPSF6 proteins were incubated with stabilized HIV-1 capsid tubes for 1 h at 25° C in the presence of 10 µM of PF74, which is a small molecule that competes with CPSF6 for binding to the hydrophobic pocket formed between hexamers that constitute the viral core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buffone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Price et al., 2014</xref>). HIV- 1 capsid stabilized tubes were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted using Laemli buffer (BOUND). For every construct, the percentage of bound protein relative to input in the presence or absence of PF74 is shown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Our results revealed that the absence of the FG peptide (ΔFG) entirely abolished CPSF6’s ability to bind to the viral core. In agreement, simultaneous deletion of the FG motif and LCRs (ΔFG ΔLCR) resulted in a construct unable to bind to the viral core. Similar outcomes were observed when the LCRs were replaced with sequences derived from ADD2, even if the FG was present.</p>

<p>LCR-FG is notably more disordered than ADD2-FG, containing a high proportion of prolines (48 out of 98 residues), which makes it mostly non-foldable (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-L</xref>). Since proline is a structure-disrupting residue, LRC-FG is not expected to adopt any secondary structure. In contrast, ADD2-FG contains fewer prolines (15 out of 98 residues) but has many charged residues. It is predicted to form two short α helices and a ß strand, arranged as: α helix - FG – ß strand - α helix. ADD2-FG may form a flexible collapsed state, as its oppositely charged residues are evenly distributed, potentially allowing polyelectrostatic compaction. This suggests that FG within ADD2-FG may be less accessible for the interaction with the viral core’s hydrophobic pocket due to its involvement in this collapsed conformational ensemble (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">suppl. Fig.4</xref>). This aligns with the inability of CPSF6 carrying ADD2 in place of the LCRs to induce CPSF6 puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). On the other hand, the deletion of only the two LCRs, while keeping the FG peptide intact, resulted in unexpected findings. The ΔLCR mutant exhibited a stronger binding affinity for the viral core when compared to the wild-type protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These results suggest that the LCRs surrounding the FG motif are modulating the affinity of CPSF6 to the viral core, which might be important for function. By contrast, deletion of the MCD (ΔMCD) but retention of other regions, such as the FG peptide and the LCRs, demonstrated a binding affinity to the viral core similar to that of the wild-type protein. These results suggest that the MCD domain is not involved in the binding of CPSF6 to the viral core, which is not surprising since the CPSF6 (1-358), which does not have an MCD, binds to the viral core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus, the viral capsid, through the FG peptide of CPSF6, constitutes the scaffold of HIV- induced CPSF6 puncta.</p>
<p>In summary, our results suggest that the FG peptide is the main determinant involved in the binding of CPSF6 to the viral capsid. Interestingly, our work implies that the LCRs may be modulating the affinity of the FG motif for the viral core (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Recognition motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions, such as the FG motif of CPSF6, are usually embedded within longer intrinsically disordered regions that can modulate affinity of the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Karlsson et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, our data show that the FG peptide coordinates both the binding to the viral core and the induction of CPSF6 puncta. This coordination suggests that the FG peptide plays a critical dual role in recognizing the viral capsid and facilitating the cellular clustering of CPSF6, which may be part of the cellular response to viral entry.</p>

<p>The NS factor SC35, commonly used as a marker of NS, has been detected in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In this study, we investigated whether HIV-induced CPSF6 mutant puncta are associated with SC35. We infected cells expressing CPSF6 wild-type (WT), CPSF6 3xNLS ΔMCD, CPSF6 ΔLCR, CPSF6 ΔMCD, and CPSF6 PY NLS ΔMCD, and examined whether the nuclear puncta formed by the various CPSF6 proteins associate with SC35. Imaging analysis revealed no significant difference in the association of SC35 with CPSF6 WT or the CPSF6 mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), confirming that the disordered domains, LCRs, and MCDs are dispensable for the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta that localize in the canonical nuclear niche marked by SC35.</p>

<title>Biogenesis of HIV-Induced CPSF6 Puncta carrying Nuclear Speckle factors</title>
<p>Nuclear speckle factors, particularly those involved in their biogenesis, such as SON and SRRM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>), have been identified as constituents of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. However, the specific role of NSs in these puncta remains unclear. Most of the existing results have been obtained through immunofluorescence experiments conducted several days post-infection. In this study, we conducted a time course experiment to investigate the biogenesis of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta, which contain NS factors. Our goal was to capture the fusion event between the HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and NS, providing insights into the dynamics of how HIV manipulates host nuclear structures during infection. We hypothesized that NS factors might either be recruited during the initial formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta, shortly after the virus is released from the nuclear basket of the NPC, or later via the fusion between NSs and HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. To investigate this, we performed live imaging to track CPSF6-mNeonGreen and NSs in cells expressing endogenous SRRM2 fused with a Halo tag, using CRISPR Paint (courtesy of Roy Parker) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lester et al., 2021</xref>).We fixed and labeled samples at different time points post-infection, ranging from 6 h.p.i. to 30 h.p.i. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig.1G</xref>). At 6 h.p.i., 27% of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta were still individual, compared to only 9% at 30 h.p.i. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Concurrently, 61% of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta were fused with NS at 6 h.p.i., rising to 75% at 30 h.p.i. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This indicates a progressive increase in the number of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta fusing with NS over time (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Overall, we detected individual CPSF6 clusters (green) and NSs (red) that quickly fused, confirming that this fusion occurs within the two independent puncta, CPSF6 and SRRM2, rather than during the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>, movies 1A, 1B).</p>

<title>The IDR of SRRM2 is a crucial element for the fusion of HIV-Induced CPSF6 puncta to the nuclear speckles</title>

<p>Here, we investigate the role of IDRs within NS factors, with a specific emphasis on SRRM2, in the fusion and stabilization of HIV-induced CPSF6 clusters.

<p>As anticipated, the truncated form of SRRM2 displayed a more diffuse distribution within the nucleus, without recruitment to NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">suppl.

<p>HIV-1 capsid has transformed long-standing assumptions in the field. Previously considered an undruggable viral target due to the belief that it disassembled shortly after HIV entered target cells, whereas recent findings have revealed its essential role in nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ay and Di Nunzio, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blanco-Rodriguez and Di Nunzio, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blanco-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Taylor and Fassati, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yamashita and Emerman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zila et al., 2021</xref>).

While Lenacapavir improves patients’ quality of life with only two injections per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Link et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Segal-Maurer et al., 2022</xref>), no current antiretroviral drugs provide a cure. This may be due to our incomplete understanding of certain aspects of HIV biology. In this study, we shed light on the post-nuclear entry steps, a critical phase for the establishment of viral reservoirs, which represent the main barrier to a cure. Recent findings have shown that not only the HIV viral capsid translocates through the NPC, but that the viral nuclear entry also enhances the formation of CPSF6 puncta. Additionally, it has been revealed that RT is completed within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burdick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dharan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Selyutina et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, incoming viral RNA has been observed to be sequestered in nuclear niches in cells treated with the reversible reverse transcriptase inhibitor, NEV. When macrophage-like cells are infected in the presence of NEV, the incoming viral RNA is held within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rensen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Scoca et al., 2023</xref>). This scenario is comparable to what is observed in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Interestingly, we found that if CPSF6 puncta are pharmacologically dismantled, the nuclear reverse transcription cannot be restored, indicating that HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta play a crucial role in the viral life cycle, particularly for their potential role in forming viral reservoirs. Understanding the biogenesis of these puncta could be a significant step towards deepening our knowledge of HIV biology and providing additional tools to combat this pandemic virus.</p>
<p>Here we identify the disordered FG peptide essential for the binding with the viral capsid as the inducer of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. Notably, CPSF6 protein lacking the FG peptide is incapable of forming nuclear puncta. Moreover, we discovered that the two major intrinsically disordered regions of CPSF6, the MCDs and the LCRs, are dispensable for the formation of viral nuclear puncta. The MCDs of CPSF6 have been shown to provide cohesion for NS condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Greig et al., 2020</xref>). In the context of HIV infection, the viral capsid induces the formation of CPSF6 puncta that are depleted of MCDs carrying the viral RNA genome. These CPSF6 puncta are highly similar to those formed by wild-type CPSF6, suggesting that MCDs do not play a significant role in this process. Additionally, the LCRs of CPSF6 also do not appear to influence puncta formation, as their depletion does not reduce the number of CPSF6 puncta. This indicates that neither the MCDs nor the LCRs are involved in CPSF6 puncta formation during HIV infection. Surprisingly, when we assessed the ability of CPSF6 domains to bind to the viral capsid, we observed that the deletion of LCRs increases CPSF6’s ability to bind to the viral capsid. We hypothesize that a change in charges may alter the binding mechanism of CPSF6 when LCRs are absent. In scenarios where the FG motif is depleted, we observed a dramatic inhibition of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta formation and a lack of binding to the viral core <italic>in vitro</italic>. On the flip side, the linkage between CPSF6 entities is facilitated by the FG peptides’ interaction with certain hydrophobic CA pockets along adjoining hexamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, it’s conceivable that FG peptides, not involved in the capsid’s binding, could coalesce similarly to FG-Nups. These undergo phase separation, forming condensates with nuclear pore complex-like permeability barrier features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>We have also identified HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta formation independent of NS at early stages post-infection, with a progressive increase in CPSF6 puncta co-localizing with NS over time. These results were obtained by focusing our studies on two scaffold proteins involved in NS biogenesis: SON and SRRM2. Over the past approximately 0.6–1.2 billion years of metazoan evolution, these two factors have undergone significant lengthening, unlike many other proteins involved in splicing. This extension primarily occurred within their IDRs, which are commonly associated with liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and the formation of biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rai et al., 2018</xref>). Co-depleting SRRM2 with SON, or depleting SON in a cell line where it is deleted the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of SRRM2, abolished the formation of NSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>). However, the depletion of only one factor does not abolish NSs. Consistent with this finding, we observed that the depletion of SRRM2 does not affect the presence of SON nuclear clusters. Similar results were obtained with cells genetically modified to express the truncated form of SRRM2 lacking the IDRs. When the ΔIDR SRRM2- halo tag was detected by the halo ligand, there was no recruitment of the truncated SRRM2 form in NSs. However, if SC35 is used as a target for antibodies, it can still be detected, albeit with a much lower intensity signal than in cells expressing the full-length SRRM2. Additionally, we observed a significant reduction in the detection of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. The few CPSF6 clusters detected in these cells colocalized with the weak SC35 signal. These results suggest that the IDR of SRRM2 plays an important role in HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta stabilization, but rare clusters can appear, likely induced by redundant NS factors. This indicates that further investigation is needed to better understand the hijacking of NS by HIV.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results reveal the intricate interplay between individual CPSF6 domains and the viral capsid in dictating the nuclear fate of the virus. Concurrently, the IDR domain of SRRM2 contributes to the enlargement of particular nuclear speckles with the fusion of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta. Lastly, these HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta necessitate of FG peptide to engage the viral core.</p>
<p>Overall, this study could provide insights into the understanding of viral invasion and persistence within the host.</p>

<p>1 mL of monomeric capsid (3 mg/mL or 1 mg/mL) was dialyzed in SnakeSkin dialysis tubing 10,000 MWCO (Thermo Scientific) against a buffer that is high in salt and contains a reducing agent (buffer 1: 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol) at 4°C for 8 hours. Subsequently the protein was dialyzed against the same buffer without the reducing agent β- mercaptoethanol (buffer 2: 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 M NaCl) at 4°C for 8 hours. The absence of β- mercaptoethanol in the second dialysis allows formation of disulfide bonds between Cysteine 14 and 43 inter-capsid monomers in the hexamer. Finally the protein is dialyzed against buffer 3 (20 mM Tris, pH 8,0, 40 mM NaCl) at 4°C for 8 hours. Assembled complexes were kept at 4°C up to 1 month.</p>

<title>Capsid binding assay protocol</title>
<p>Human HEK293T cells were transfected for 24 h with a plasmid expressing the specified CPSF6 variant tagged with mNeonGreen. Cell media was completely removed and cells were lysed in 300 μL of capsid binding buffer (CBB: 10 mM Tris, pH 8,0, 1,5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl) by scrapping off the plate. Cells were rotated at 4°C for 15 min and then centrifuged to remove cellular debris ( 21,000 <italic>x g</italic>, 15 minutes, 4 °C). Cell lysates were incubated with stabilized HIV-1 capsid tubes for 1 h at 25 °C. Subsequently, stabilized HIV-1 capsid tubes were washed by pelleting the complexes by centrifugation at 21,000 x g for 2 min. Pellets were washed using by resuspension in CBB or PBS. Pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer 1X and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-p24 or anti-mNeonGreen antibodies.</p>

<title>Bioinformatics analysis of CPSF6</title>
<p>Intrinsic disorder propensity of CPSF6 was evaluated using the Rapid Intrinsic Disorder Analysis Online platform (RIDAO) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ridao.app/">https://ridao.app/</ext-link>) designed to predict disordered residues and regions in a query protein based on its amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dayhoff and Uversky, 2022</xref>). RIDAO yields results by combining the outputs of several commonly used per-residue disorder predictors, such as PONDR® VLXT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Romero et al., 2001</xref>), PONDR® VL3(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peng et al., 2006</xref>), PONDR® VLS2B(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Peng et al., 2005</xref>), PONDR® FIT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xue et al., 2010</xref>), as well as IUPred2 (Short) and IUPred2 (Long)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dosztanyi et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">b</xref>). RIDAO also computes a mean disorder score for each residue based on these. In the resulting intrinsic disorder profile, the disorder score of 0.5 is the threshold between order and disorder, where residues/regions above 0.5 are disordered, and residues/regions below 0.5 are ordered. The disorder score of 0.15 is the threshold between order and flexibility, where residues/regions with the disorder scores above 0.15 but below 0.5 are flexible, and residues/regions below 0.15 are highly ordered.</p>
<p>Amino acid compositions of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (residues 261-358) of human CPSF6 and its different variants (CPSF6 ΔFG ΔLCR, CPSF6 ΔLCR, CPSF6 ΔFG, and CPSF6 ADD2 ΔLCR) were analyzed to evaluate the relative abundance of prion-like low complexity region (LCR) defining uncharged, charged, and Pro residues in these protein regions. The corresponding values of the relative abundance of these residue groups were calculated by dividing numbers of prion-like LCR defining uncharged (Ala, Gly, Val, Phe, Tyr, Leu, Ile, Ser, Thr, Pro, Asn, Gln), charged (Asp, Glu, Lys, Arg), and Pro residues by total number of amino acids in the corresponding protein fragments. As references, we used the corresponding data for protein sequences deposited to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database that provides information on the overall distribution of amino acids in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bairoch et al., 2005</xref>); PDB Select 25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berman et al., 2000</xref>), which is a subset of structures from the Protein Data Bank with less than 25% sequence identity, biased towards the composition of proteins amenable to crystallization studies; and DisProt 3.4 that is comprised of a set of consensus sequences of experimentally determined disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sickmeier et al., 2007</xref>). Per-residue intrinsic disorder propensities of the LCR-FG and ADD2-FG sequences were evaluated by PONDR® VLXT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Romero et al., 2001</xref>), which is sensitive to local peculiarities of the amino acid sequences freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pondr.com/">http://www.pondr.com/</ext-link> (accessed on August 03, 2024).

<title>Imaging and statistical analysis</title>
<p>All images were analysed using Fiji Software. More in detail, for the count of the nuclear speckles a macro was computed to segment cellular nuclei and to select and count the nuclear speckles. For the nuclei segmentation a Gaussian Blur with sigma=2 was used and for the channel related to the nuclear speckles the set threshold was at 7000-46012 (min and max). For the counting, a “size =10 – Infinity summarize” was used for the nuclei, whereas for the nuclear speckles the size was reduced to “size=0-Infinity summarize”.</p>
<p>For live imaging analysis, Arivis software was used to reconstruct the 3D movies.</p>
<p>All data were statistically analyzed with GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>). Calculations were performed and figures were drawn using Excel 365 or GraphPad Prism 8.0. Statistical analysis was performed, with Wilcoxon matched paired t-tests or Mann–Whitney unpaired t-tests. Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were calculated using GraphPad Prism.</p>

<p>This manuscript provides <bold>valuable</bold> information about the genesis of CPSF6 condensates due to HIV-1 infection. However, the evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> as it is missing more functional assays. Furthermore, some data on the fusion between CPSF6 Aggregates and SC35 speckles are not novel.</p>

<p>In recent years, our understanding of the nuclear steps of the HIV-1 life cycle has made significant advances. It has emerged that HIV-1 completes reverse transcription in the nucleus and that the host factor CPSF6 forms condensates around the viral capsid. The precise function of these CPSF6 condensates is under investigation, but it is clear that the HIV-1 capsid protein is required for their formation. This study by Tomasini et al. investigates the genesis of the CPSF6 condensates induced by HIV-1 capsid, what other co-factors may be required, and their relationship with nuclear speckels (NS). The authors show that disruption of the condensates by the drug PF74, added post-nuclear entry, blocks HIV-1 infection, which supports their functional role. They generated CPSF6 KO THP-1 cell lines, in which they expressed exogenous CPSF6 constructs to map by microscopy and pull down assays of the regions critical for the formation of condensates. This approach revealed that the LCR region of CPSF6 is required for capsid binding but not for condensates whereas the FG region is essential for both. Using SON and SRRM2 as markers of NS, the authors show that CPSF6 condensates precede their merging with NS but that depletion of SRRM2, or SRRM2 lacking the IDR domain, delays the genesis of condensates, which are also smaller.</p>
<p>The study is interesting and well conducted and defines some characteristics of the CPSF6-HIV-1 condensates. Their results on the NS are valuable. The data presented are convincing.</p>
<p>I have two main concerns. Firstly, the functional outcome of the various protein mutants and KOs is not evaluated. Although Figure 1 shows that disruption of the CPSF6 puncta by PF74 impairs HIV-1 infection, it is not clear if HIV-1 infection is at all affected by expression of the mutant CPSF6 forms (and SRRM2 mutants) or KO/KD of the various host factors. The cell lines are available, so it should be possible to measure HIV-1 infection and reverse transcription. Secondly, the authors have not assessed if the effects observed on the NS impact HIV-1 gene expression, which would be interesting to know given that NS are sites of highly active gene transcription. With the reagents at hand, it should be possible to investigate this too.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>HIV-1 infection induces CPSF6 aggregates in the nucleus that contain the viral protein CA. The study of the functions and composition of these nuclear aggregates have raised considerable interest in the field, and they have emerged as sites in which reverse transcription is completed and in the proximity of which viral DNA becomes integrated. In this work, the authors have mutated several regions of the CPSF6 protein to identify the domains important for nuclear aggregation, in addition to the already-known FG region; they have characterized the kinetics of fusion between CPSF6 aggregates and SC35 nuclear speckles and have determined the role of two nuclear speckle components in this process (SRRM2, SUN2).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work examines systematically the domains of CPSF6 of importance for nuclear aggregate formation in an elegant manner in which these mutants complement an otherwise CPSF6-KO cell line. In addition, this work evidences a novel role for the protein SRRM2 in HIV-induced aggregate formation, overall advancing our comprehension of the components required for their formation and regulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the results presented in this manuscript, in particular the kinetics of fusion between CPSF6-aggregates and SC35 speckles have been published before (PMID: 32665593; 32997983).</p>
<p>The observations of the different effects of CPSF6 mutants, as well as SRRM2/SUN2 silencing experiments are not complemented by infection data which would have linked morphological changes in nuclear aggregates to function during viral infection. More importantly, these functional data could have helped stratify otherwise similar morphological appearances in CPSF6 aggregates.</p>
<p>Overall, the results could be presented in a more concise and ordered manner to help focus the attention of the reader on the most important issues. Most of the figures extend to 3-4 different pages and some information could be clearly either aggregated or moved to supplementary data.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors investigate the requirements for the formation of CPSF6 puncta induced by HIV-1 under a high multiplicity of infection conditions. Not surprisingly, they observe that mutation of the Phe-Gly (FG) repeat responsible for CPSF6 binding to the incoming HIV-1 capsid abrogates CPSF6 punctum formation. Perhaps more interestingly, they show that the removal of other domains of CPSF6, including the mixed-charge domain (MCD), does not affect the formation of HIV-1-induced CPSF6 puncta. The authors also present data suggesting that CPSF6 puncta form individual before fusing with nuclear speckles (NSs) and that the fusion of CPSF6 puncta to NSs requires the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of the NS component SRRM2. While the study presents some interesting findings, there are some technical issues that need to be addressed and the amount of new information is somewhat limited. Also, the authors' finding that deletion of the CPSF6 MCD does not affect the formation of HIV-1-induced CPSF6 puncta contradicts recent findings of Jang et al.

<p>We would like to extend our sincere thanks to you and reviewers at eLife for their thoughtful handling of our manuscript and their valuable feedback, which will greatly improve our study.</p>
<p>We are committed to performing the additional experiments as recommended by the reviewers. However, we would like to clarify our study's focus.</p>
<p>The novelty of our study lies in the highlights of our manuscript:</p>
<p>• The formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta is critical for restoring HIV-1 nuclear reverse transcription (RT).</p>
<p>• CPSF6 protein lacking the FG peptide cannot bind to the viral core, thereby failing to form HIVinduced CPSF6 puncta.</p>
<p>• The FG peptide, rather than low-complexity regions (LCRs) or the mixed charge domains (MCDs) of the CPSF6 protein, drives the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta.</p>
<p>• HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta form individually and later fuse with nuclear speckles (NS) via the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of SRRM2.</p>
<p>By focusing on these processes, we believe our study provides a critical perspective on the molecular interactions that mediate the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and broadens the understanding of how HIV manipulates host nuclear architecture.</p>

<p>First, we thank the reviewer for her/his appreciation of our study and to give to us the opportunity to better explain our results and to improve our manuscript. We appreciate the reviewer’s positive feedback on our study, and we will do our best to address her/his concerns. In the meantime, we would like to clarify the focus of our study. Our research does not aim to demonstrate an association between CPSF6 condensates (we use the term &quot;condensates&quot; rather than &quot;aggregates,&quot; as aggregates are generally non-dynamic (Alberti &amp; Hyman, 2021; Banani et al., 2017), and our work specifically examines the dynamic behavior of CPSF6 during infection, as shown in Scoca et al., JMCB 2022) and SC35 nuclear speckles. This association has already been established in previous studies, as noted in the manuscript.</p>
<p>About the point highlighted by the reviewer: &quot;Kinetics of fusion between CPSF6-aggregates and SC35 speckles have been published before (PMID: 32665593; 32997983).&quot;</p>
<p>Our study differs from prior work PMID 32665593 because we utilize a full-length HIV genome and we did not follow the integrase (IN) fluorescence in trans and its association with CPSF6 but we specifically assess if CPSF6 clusters form in the nucleus independently of NS factors and next to fuse with them. In the current study we evaluated the dynamics of formation of CPSF6/NS puncta, which it has not been explored before. Given this focus, we believe that our work offers a novel perspective on the molecular interactions that facilitate HIV / CPSF6-NS fusion.</p>
<p>For better clarity, we would like to specify that our study focuses on the role of SON, a scaffold factor of nuclear speckles, rather than SUN2 (SUN domain-containing protein 2), which is a component of the LINC (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton) complex.</p>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we will keep key information in the main figure and move additional details to the supplementary material.</p>

While the study presents some interesting findings, there are some technical issues that need to be addressed and the amount of new information is somewhat limited. Also, the authors' finding that deletion of the CPSF6 MCD does not affect the formation of HIV-1-induced CPSF6 puncta contradicts recent findings of Jang et al. (doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae769).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for her/his thoughtful feedback and the opportunity to elaborate on why our findings provide a distinct perspective compared to those of Jang et al. (doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkae769), while aligning with the results of Rohlfes et al. (doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.20.599834).</p>
<p>One potential reason for the differences between our findings and those of Jang et al. could be the choice of experimental systems. Jang et al. conducted their study in HEK293T cells with CPSF6 knockouts, as described in Sowd et al., 2016 (doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1524213113). In contrast, our work focused on macrophage-like THP-1 cells, which share closer characteristics with HIV-1’s natural target cells.</p>
<p>Our approach utilized a complete CPSF6 knockout in THP-1 cells, enabling us to reintroduce untagged versions of CPSF6, such as wild-type and deletion mutants, to avoid potential artifacts from tagging. Jang et al. employed HA-tagged CPSF6 constructs, which may lead to subtle differences in experimental outcomes due to the presence of the tag.</p>
<p>Finally, our investigation into the IDR of SRRM2 relied on CRISPR-PAINT to generate targeted deletions directly in the endogenous gene (Lester et al., 2021, DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2021.03.026). This approach provided a native context for studying SRRM2’s role.</p>
<p>We will incorporate these clarifications into the discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p>
