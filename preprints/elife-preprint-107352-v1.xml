<abstract>
<p>The earliest growing mouse follicles, wave 1, rapidly develop in the ovarian medulla, while the great majority, wave 2, are stored for later use as resting primordial follicles in the cortex. Wave 1 follicles are known to mostly undergo atresia, a fate sometimes associated with the persistence of steroidogenic theca cells, but this connection is poorly understood. We characterized wave 1 follicle biology using tissue clearing, lineage tracing and scRNAseq to clarify their contributions to offspring and to steroidogenesis. Wave 1 follicles lineage marked by E16.5 <italic>FoxL2</italic> expression in granulosa cells, reach preantral stages containing theca cell layers by 2 weeks. Atresia begins about a week later, during which 80-100% of wave 1 follicles degrade their oocytes, turn over most granulosa cells, but retain theca cells which expand in number together with interstitial gland cells in the medulla. During puberty (5 weeks), these cells ultrastructurally resemble steroidogenic cells and highly express androgen biosynthetic genes. Unexpectedly, the <italic>FoxL2</italic> lineage tag also marked about 400 primordial follicles, located near the medullar-cortical boundary, that become the earliest-activated wave 2 follicles. These “boundary” or “wave 1.5” follicles generate 70-100% of the earliest mature oocytes, while fewer than 26 wave 1 follicles with oocytes survive. Consistent with their largely distinct fates in steroid or oocyte production, granulosa cells of antral wave 1 and wave 2 follicles differentially express multiple genes, including <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Igfbp5</italic>.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>We studied the ovaries of juvenile mice 2-6 weeks (wk) of age using transcriptomics and cell lineage to characterize the earliest developing groups of follicles. Wave 1 follicles begin growing at birth in the ovarian medulla, but few produce mature oocytes. Instead, most undergo partial atresia and expand steroidogenic cells expressing androgenic genes at puberty. A newly identified primordial follicle subset located at the medulla-cortex boundary are the earliest to activate and grow. Their oocytes give rise to most early offspring, while no more than a few derive from surviving wave 1 follicles. Our results highlight the importance of spatially localized follicle subgroups and show that follicular waves aid reproduction in distinct ways, some of which involve substantial atresia and cellular remodeling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Gametes often begin development in subgroups known as “waves” that arise at specific times and gonadal locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hirshfield, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hirshfield and DeSanti, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gougeon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jiménez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">DeFalco and Capel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zheng et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">b</xref>). In mice, the earliest developing follicles, a small group known as “wave 1”, become growing primary follicles in the ovarian medulla by the time of birth without entering dormancy as primordial follicles. The remaining ∼90%, “wave 2”, enter quiescence before postnatal day 5 (P5) by forming primordial follicles within the ovarian cortex to support lifelong fertility (reviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Edson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McKey et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In the medulla, wave 1 follicles retain early arising bipotential granulosa cells (BPGs), which express <italic>Foxl2</italic> and <italic>Nr5a2</italic> beginning during early fetal development. In contrast, wave 2 follicles in the cortex acquire epithelial granulosa cells (EPGs), express <italic>Foxl2</italic> only after birth, and most express little <italic>Nr5a2</italic> as primordial follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mork et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zheng et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Niu and Spradling, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Meinsohn et al., 2021a</xref>). However, a small subset of non-growing primordial follicles was identified that did express <italic>Nr5a2</italic> and were proposed to be primed for activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Meinsohn et al., 2021b</xref>).</p>

<p>Once primordial follicles are signaled to grow, their granulosa cells (GCs) start to proliferate and soon form multiple GC layers surrounding the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Habara et al., 2021</xref>). Granulosa cells in secondary follicles send signals encoded by Desert hedgehog (<italic>Dhh</italic>) and Indian hedgehog (<italic>Ihh</italic>) that attract ovarian mesodermal precursors to form outer theca cell layers on follicles and to synthesize steroid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, ovarian medullary precursors generate thecal fibroblastic cells and perivascular smooth muscle cells that vascularize the thecal region and enable such follicles to collectively serve as a major systemic steroid hormone source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Guzmán et al., 2023</xref>). An ovarian cell type closely related to theca cells, interstitial gland cells, also coordinately form in mice and many other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jiménez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miyabayashi et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Nr5a2</italic> promotes theca cell vascularization that is essential for ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duggavathi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guzmán et al., 2022</xref>). Two classes of steroid hormone-producing Leydig cells, fetal and adult, also arise during testis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miyabayashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Follicular cells synthesize specific steroid hormones during their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Edson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Richards et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Niu and Spradling, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Meinsohn et al., 2021a</xref>). Thecal steroidogenic cells of late secondary and preantral follicles convert cholesterol to androgens through a series of enzymatic reactions involving steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1 (CYP11A1), hydroxy-delta-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 beta- and steroid delta-isomerase 1 (HSD3B1), cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 (CYP17A1), and steroid 5 alpha-reductase 1 (SRD5A1). <italic>Cyp17a1-iCre</italic> (<italic>Cyp17a1</italic> promoter driving codon-improved <italic>Cre</italic>) has been developed and used to label theca cells, the interstitial gland, and some granulosa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bridges et al., 2008</xref>). Ovarian androgen production by theca cells during juvenile development is essential for normal maturation and puberty onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Galas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Walters et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kelava et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, thecal androgens diffuse into neighboring GCs, where they are converted into estrogen by the action of hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 1 (HSD17B1) and cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1). Estrogen produced in this manner signals the hypothalamus to initiate gonadotropin production and is essential for subsequent follicular maturation. After ovulation, the oocyte-free follicle is further modified into a corpus luteum, and its remaining granulosa cells and theca cells undergo luteinization to generate progesterone.</p>
<p>The development and function of wave 1 follicles has remained controversial. Most wave 1 follicles undergo atresia after reaching early antral stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Byskov et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Erickson et al., 1985</xref>) during juvenile development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggested they do not primarily serve a direct reproductive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hirshfield, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hsueh et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eppig and Handel, 2012</xref>), although these follicles are capable of developing into functional oocytes following superovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lamas et al., 2021</xref>) and could support fertility in an irradiated rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Guigon et al., 2003</xref>). Theca cells of atretic follicles often survive and persist in the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Erickson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Magoffin, 2005</xref>), suggesting a function in steroid production. However, when <italic>Foxl2-CreERT2</italic> was used to lineage label the granulosa cells of wave 1 follicles, marked follicles substantially contributed to offspring during the initial months of fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zheng et al., 2014b</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we studied wave 1 follicle development and gene expression in detail to gain deeper insights into follicular waves. We found that lineage labeling using <italic>Foxl2-CreERT2</italic> activated in early fetal stages is not specific for wave 1 follicles. Granulosa cells in about 400 primordial follicles are also marked near the medulla-cortex boundary in 2week old mice, hence we termed them “boundary” or “wave 1.5” follicles. Marked boundary follicles produce more than 70% of early fertile oocytes, while no more than 26 intact wave 1 follicles survive to puberty. Boundary follicles probably correspond to the resting primordial follicle population expressing <italic>Nr5a2</italic> described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Meinsohn et al. (2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">b</xref>). Thus, most of the <italic>FoxL2-CreERT2</italic> labeled follicles contributing to offspring observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zheng et al. 2014a</xref> likely derived from boundary follicles rather than wave 1 follicles.</p>
<p>Ovarian developmental and gene expression studies during 2-6 wks provided molecular insight into gamete waves and follicular atresia. Wave 1 follicular oocytes and granulosa cells mostly turn over beginning at about 3 wk. However, their theca cells increase in number and join interstitial gland cells to form by puberty a mass of active steroidogenic medullar cells that retain morphological evidence of their origin from atretic follicles. These steroidogenic cells highly express androgenic genes when granulosa cells are still reduced in number by atresia. The granulosa cell gene expression in developing wave 2 follicles also shows differences from that of wave 1 follicles, indicating that the distinct developmental fates of wave 1 and wave 2 follicles may depend on intrinsic gene expression differences in addition to differing levels of gonadotropins.</p>

<title>Wave 1 follicle development</title>
<p>Advances that allow tissue clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Faire et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fiorentino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McKey et al., 2022</xref>), now make it possible to image an entire mouse ovary without sectioning. To better understand follicle waves, we employed whole mount staining combined with clearing-enhanced 3D (Ce3D) method to analyze wild type C57BL/6J ovaries at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Multiple ovaries were reconstructed during weeks (wk) 1-5 of development (Table S1). In C57BL/6J mice, puberty typically occurs between 4 and 5 wk of age, but the first ovulation, which signals sexual maturity, doesn’t take place until 7 wk (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hogan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nelson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>These studies allowed the number of wave 1 and wave 2 follicles to be accurately determined. Wave 1 follicles begin to grow into primary follicles around the time of birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A, B</xref>), as confirmed by gene expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Niu and Spradling, 2020</xref>). Following whole-ovary imaging using a confocal microscope, the samples were analyzed using Imaris software. Since nearly all oocytes are enclosed by granulosa cells by P5, it becomes feasible to accurately quantify the number of follicles. At P5 and P10, we counted approximately 3,822 and 3,304 total follicles, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>), and 278 and 293 wave 1 follicles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>). Despite variations in total follicle numbers among samples of the same age, the number of wave 1 follicles remained relatively consistent.</p>
<p>By 2 wk, wave 1 follicles in the medulla had developed into secondary follicles containing 2-4 layers of granulosa cells and 1–2 layers of theca cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1C</xref>). At 3 wk, some follicles further developed into antral follicles with multiple granulosa cell layers, within which granulosa cell apoptosis was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1D</xref>). Using the Imaris software surface modeling, we quantified oocyte volume from 1 wk to 3 wk and observed a significant increase during this period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G, H</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Wave 1 follicles undergo partial atresia with theca cell survival</title>
<p>Starting around 3 wk, rather than continuing to develop, wave 1 follicles begin to undergo atresia (Table S1; Supplemental Movies). We investigated the kinetics, cell specificity and completeness of cellular turnover from 3 wk to 5 wk. Atretic follicles initially showed oocyte distortion followed by loss, initially leaving behind disorganized granulosa within the basement membrane but without affecting the theca cell layers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Atretic follicles progressively decreased in size and developed a cavity beneath the granulosa layer where the oocyte had previously resided. Oocyte loss from wave 1 follicles increased significantly between 3 and 4 wk, exceeding 80% by 5 wk. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). Electron microscopy revealed that during atresia, as oocytes degenerate, microvilli from both oocytes and granulosa cells retract from the zona pellucida (ZP). The shrinking of the cavity is marked by folding of the ZP, and in atretic follicles, remnants of the ZP appear to prevent further collapse of the cavity structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A</xref>). ZP remnants in the follicular cavity have previously been used as a morphological indicator of atretic follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Myers et al., 2004</xref>). We confirmed that these events also occur in the DBA/2J strain, where atretic follicles are also first observed around 3 wk. By 7 wk, corpora lutea from ovulated oocytes and cavities left behind by wave 1 oocyte loss were evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2B</xref>). Thus, by combining whole mount staining with Ce3D clearing method, we found that the great majority of wave 1 follicles lose their oocytes prior to puberty and do not contribute to early ovulation.</p>
<p>The loss of oocytes from most wave 1 follicles is not simply due to atresia of follicles whose oocytes are defective, as superovulation at these stages can rescue many of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lamas et al., 2021</xref>). Etymologically, atresia originates from the Greek “a-” (meaning “no”) and “tresis” (meaning “perforation”), referring to the absence or closure of an opening, or cavity. Atresia is sometimes used simply to describe the complete turnover of follicles, which was not observed for wave 1 follicles. We prefer the terms ‘partial atresia’ or ‘remodeled follicles’ to emphasize the potential function of those structures that remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hsueh et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>To analyze the cell specificity of wave 1 partial atresia, we exploited <italic>Foxl2-CreERT2</italic> mouse line and <italic>R26R-LSL-EYFP</italic> reporter line to selectively lineage label GCs associated with wave 1 follicles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar genetic models have previously been used to study wave 1 follicle development and the duration of their fertility contribution based on tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mork et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zheng et al., 2014a</xref>). Following brief administration of Tamoxifen (TAM) at embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5), we observed a distinct labeling pattern along the medulla–cortex boundary. Most wave 1 follicles in the medulla showed mosaic EYFP-labeling of GCs at 2 wk (due to the incomplete efficiency of cre-lox recombination) while GCs in the largely cortical wave two follicles remained unlabeled (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C</xref>). On average, 201 preantral wave 1 derivatives—representing approximately 90% of wave 1 follicles—exhibited mosaic labeling in granulosa cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>).

Instead, we found that among secondary follicles at 5 wk, nearly 70% contained EYFP-positive GCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that boundary follicles activate at the time of the earliest known primordial follicles, and rise from 7% of quiescent to &gt;70% of early activating follicles imply they comprise most of the earliest activated primordial follicles.

<p>Between 2 wk to 5 wk, the number of tdTomato-labeled cells associated with nuclear cavities dramatically increases as wave 1 follicle atresia and remodeling proceeds to involve more such follicles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref>).

<p>Wave 1 follicles undergo remodeling during the peri-pubertal period to expand the population of androgen-producing theca and interstitial cells. Gradients between the medulla and cortex facilitate the sequential activation of primordial follicles, a process that continues into early adulthood. We refer to these sequentially activated follicles as boundary follicles (Wave 1.5). These follicles, whose granulosa cells are derived from bipotential pre-granulosa cells (BPGs), remain dormant in the medulla and cortex until recruiting signals—either positive or negative— become available. Boundary follicles are typically recruited around 2 weeks of age and constitute the majority of developing follicles by 5 weeks.

<title>Comparing gene expression in wave 1 vs wave 2 follicle development</title>
<p>Wave 1 and wave 2 follicles begin to differ in gene expression early in fetal development, as BPGs and EPGs express different genes as early as E14.5 and diverge further by P5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Niu and Spradling, 2020</xref>). To investigate whether gene expression differences at follicle formation persist and to look for additional wave-specific gene expression, we examined GC clusters gc2, gc7, gc10 and gc13 at 2wk, comprising all GC clusters scored as in antral follicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, C</xref>). As illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, only wave 1 antral follicles are present in significant numbers at wk2 and wk3, prior to widespread wave 1 remodeling. In contrast, because of extensive wave 1 granulosa cell turnover, by wk 5 nearly all these same antral follicle clusters come from developing boundary follicles. Consequently, we compared gene expression levels during these two-time intervals for all four antral granulosa cell clusters.</p>
<p>The nuclear receptor <italic>Nr5a2</italic>, is preferentially expressed 7.8-fold higher at P5 in BPGs within growing wave 1 follicles compared to EPGs in growth-arrested wave 2 follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Niu and Spradling, 2020</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Nr5a2</italic> expression is 11-fold higher in all wk2 antral follicle cell clusters compared to primordial follicle (gc11) granulosa cells. This difference reflects the early activation of wave 1, as <italic>Nr5a2</italic> turns on in all wave 2 GCs as they begin to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Meinsohn et al. 2019</xref>). We observed that <italic>Nr5a2</italic> expression increases in primary and secondary follicles and reaches similar levels in wave 1 and wave 2 antral follicles (ratio = 1.02+/- 0.23). Comparable expression ratios were likewise seen between wave 1 and wave 2 antral granulosa cells for other genes that were BPG/wave 1-preferential at P5, including <italic>Dhh</italic> (1.04+/- 0.41), <italic>Hsd17b1</italic> (0.61+/- 0.14), <italic>Ptgis</italic> (1.08+/- 0.26), <italic>Prlr</italic> (1.8+/- 0.80), <italic>Fshr</italic> (0.89+/- 0.21) and <italic>Igf1</italic> (0.86+/- 0.10).</p>
<p>However, some genes continued to be differentially expressed between wave 1 and wave 2 follicles at the same stage of development. Wave 1 wk2 antral GCs express <italic>Wnt4</italic> at much higher levels (4.8 +/- 1.0) compared to Wave 2 antral CGs at either wk 5 (0.17 +/- 0.069) or wk 6 (0.14 +/- 0.070). Other genes expressed more highly in wave 1 than wave 2 antral GCs are <italic>Igfbp5</italic> (ratio: 27 +/- 10); <italic>Itga6</italic> (ratio: 6.28 +/- 0.97) and <italic>Inha</italic> (ratio: 1.52 +/- 0.29). Genes expressed at lower levels in wave 1 than wave 2 include: <italic>Cald1</italic> (ratio: 0.20 +/- 0.089), <italic>Ghr</italic> (ratio: 0.16 +/- 0.027), <italic>Grb14</italic> (ratio: 0.23 +/- 0.092), and <italic>Mmp11</italic> (ratio: 0.46 +/- 0.23). Thus, gene expression is not entirely equivalent in wave 1 and wave 2 follicles at corresponding stages, as has often been assumed.</p>
<p>Clusters gc0 and gc6 showed indications they derived from remodeling wave 1 follicle. For example, the number of gc0 and gc6 cells is low at 2 and 3 wk before substantial atresia, but jumps 9.8-fold at wk 4 (Supplemental Dataset 6). Preferentially expressed genes in gc0 and gc6 include <italic>Cyp1b1</italic>, <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Bmp2</italic>, <italic>Apoe</italic> and <italic>Sox4</italic>. Metascape analysis identified vasculature development (-7.7; -4.0) cell cycle (-6.7; -9.2), and positive regulation of programmed cell death (-4.1; nd), where the numbers indicate (q values log10 for gc0; gc6). These findings suggest genes and pathways that GCs on remodeling wave 1 follicles use to stimulate vasculature development, and ultimately to promote GC population turnover during wk4.</p>

<title>Analyzing mesenchymal and steroidogenic gene expression</title>
<p>We also re-clustered the mesenchymal cells, including theca cells and stromal cells, yielding 21 new clusters to pursue a higher resolution picture of theca expansion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). The re-clustered mesenchymal cells fell into nine groups, late-expanding TCs (g9), early TCs (g2 and g11), <italic>Tagln</italic>-expressing fibroblasts (g1, g8, g14 and g17), <italic>Col14a1</italic>-expressing fibroblasts (g10 and g19), <italic>Cd24a</italic>-expressing fibroblasts (g4), <italic>Cxcl12</italic>-expressing fibroblasts (g3, g5 and g20), <italic>Hoxd9</italic>-expressing fibroblasts (g0), <italic>Col11a1</italic>-expressing fibroblasts (g6 and g7) and mitotic cells expressing <italic>Mki67</italic> (g12, g13, g15 and g18) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, S5D). The expression of genes in cluster16 is hard to be determined still and be named in TBD. Theca cells in g9 highly expressed steroidogenic genes such as <italic>Star</italic>, <italic>Cyp11a1</italic>, <italic>Hsd3b1</italic>, and <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> throughout wk2-wk6 and peaked in expression and cell number at w5. In contrast, TCs in cluster g11 exhibited relatively low levels of steroidogenic enzymes and stable cell numbers except at wk 5 where levels greatly increased to reach 20-50% of g9 levels. Both groups expressed LH receptor (<italic>Lhcgr</italic>) and prostaglandin E synthase 2 (<italic>Ptges2</italic>), previously implicated in TC androgen production (Erikson et al. 1985), but Lhcgr levels in g11 started lower and increased more dramatically at wk 5 than in g9.</p>
<p>Theca cells are not genetically capable of converting their androgen products into estrogen and usually rely on exporting them to granulosa cells for this purpose (Edstrom et al. 2007). <italic>Star</italic>, a crucial gene responsible for transporting cholesterol from the cytoplasm into mitochondria, is essential for steroidogenesis. The percentage of STCs expressing <italic>Star</italic> increased from approximately 50% to over 80% at wk 5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that STCs increase in number and acquire a full complement of androgen biosynthetic enzymes during peri-puberty. In contrast, GCs expressing <italic>Hsd3b1</italic>, <italic>Cyp19a1</italic>, and <italic>Hsd17a1</italic> indicating the potential to synthesize estrogen peaked at wk 6 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>), consistent with estrogen levels lagging androgen levels during puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Galas et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Trova et al. 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Wave 1 follicular remodeling generates a cluster of androgen-producing cells in the juvenile mouse ovary</title>
<p>Our work characterizes in detail the development of the first wave of mouse ovarian follicles at the cellular and gene expression levels. In agreement with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hirshfield and DeSanti, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gougeon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McGee and Hsueh, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eppig and Handel, 2012</xref>), 80-100% of these follicles turn over rather than generating fertilizable oocytes. We document the cellular and genetic changes within each major follicular cell type and detail the complex events that ultimately produce a large cluster of amplified steroidogenic theca cells and interstitial gland cells along with a residue of granulosa cells within the ovarian medulla by 5 wk. This process was previously termed wave 1 follicle atresia and was known to be associated with increased steroidogenesis and vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Magoffin, 2005</xref>). Our analysis characterizes the cellular and molecular programs in each wave 1 follicular cell type that cause them to turn over, remodel, change in number, associate with new mesenchymal cells and to modulate their gene expression to produce steroid hormones from the ovary in a timely fashion during juvenile development. Our findings show that wave 1 follicles play a role in steroid production during juvenile development, especially at the puberty.</p>

<title>Wave 1 follicles give rise to few mature oocytes that generate offspring</title>
<p>Boundary follicles as well as wave 1 follicles were labeled in our <italic>Foxl2</italic> lineage tracing experiments, and in early experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zheng et al. 2014a</xref>. Boundary primordial follicles activate as early as 2 wk and produce most of the first follicles to develop fully, ovulate and generate offspring (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). It remains possible that a small number of wave 1 follicles, ∼26 or fewer, do develop to maturity. However, their contribution of wave 1 to fertility is minor at most. Thus, early activated wave 2 follicles at the medulla-cortex boundary rather than wave 1 follicles are largely responsible for early fertility. Most non-boundary wave 2 follicles only begin to activate between puberty and sexual maturity, possibly in concert with the onset of pulsatile hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis activity.</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Wave 1 follicles may be a conserved feature in other animals including humans</title>
<p>The developing ovaries of many species produce follicles that do not complete oogenesis and ovulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jiménez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">DeFalco and Capel, 2009</xref>). For example, an early wave of germ cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites develop into sperm, while during adult life only oocytes are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pazdernik and Schedl, 2013</xref>). An initial wave of germ cells in the mouse testis develop during juvenile stages but break back down into individual cells, possibly to expand the stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lei and Spradling, 2013</xref>). Primordial germ cells in Drosophila pupal ovaries develop directly into the first ovulated oocytes, while all subsequent oocytes derive from germline stem cells that provide lifelong fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhu and Xie, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Human follicles begin developing, as in mouse, long before there is any prospect of ovulation. A fraction of primordial human follicles start to form during fetal stages, and 4-6% have progressed to the primary follicle stage prior to birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Forabosco and Sforza, 2007</xref>). Such early developing follicles have no prospect of surviving 8 to 13 more years until the onset of puberty when they might contribute to fertility. Juvenile human ovaries 3 mo to 8 yr in age also contained 2-13% of small growing follicles that had diverged from a normal developmental pattern. 50-60% of large follicles showed signs of atresia including loss of oocytes and most granulosa cells, but retention of some theca cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Himelstein-Braw et al., 1976</xref>). Currently, there is little understanding of the developmental mechanisms or logic underlying human fetal and juvenile follicle production. Early follicles in humans might undergo atresia and remodeling to enhance production of androgens or other steroid hormones to influence organ and brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bell, 2018</xref>). These studies on the development of mouse wave 1 follicles and their component cell types should aid in understanding early follicular waves in many species.</p>

<title>Identification of the earliest activating wave 2 follicles at the medullary-cortex boundary</title>
<p>A long-standing question in mammalian reproduction has been the activation order of quiescent wave 2 primordial follicles during the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McGee and Hsueh, 2000</xref>). In addition to over 250 wave 1 follicles in the medulla that begin rapid growth at birth, we identified more than 400 wave 2 primordial follicles near the medullar-cortical boundary whose GCs in 2 wk ovaries are also labeled in a mosaic fashion with <italic>Foxl2-CreERT2</italic> is activated at E16.5 or even earlier. Boundary follicles appear to correspond largely or entirely the primordial follicle subclass poised for early activation and located at the medulla-cortical boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Meinsohn et al. 2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">b</xref>). Our data show that his substantial class of early primordial follicles do begin developing shortly after 2 wk, giving them sufficient time to become secondary and antral follicles at 5 wk. It remains possible that a small number of wave 1 follicles, ∼26 or fewer, do develop to maturity. However, it seems clear that the great majority of early progeny derive from boundary or other early developing wave 2 follicles, rather than wave 1 follicles that escape atresia.</p>

<title>Mouse follicle waves express distinct genes</title>
<p>We found that differences in gene expression between wave 1 and wave 2 granulosa cells exist and may contribute or even control the different fates of mouse follicular waves. Previously, gene expression differences had been mapped beginning as early E14.5, and many were characterized between E16.5 to P5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Niu and Spradling, 2020</xref>). They suggested that wave 1 follicles in the medulla differentially express several genes involved in steroid hormone production, while wave 2 granulosa cells in the cortex express genes that might predispose follicles to enter quiescence. This study extends knowledge of differences in gene expression within follicular waves during juvenile development up to 6 wk. Wave 1 follicles express much higher levels of <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Igfbp5</italic> than wave 2 follicles. Wnt4 has been genetically linked in humans to Mullerian dysgenesis and hyperandrogenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Choussein et al. 2017</xref>) perhaps reflecting its known roles in promoting female vs male development. High <italic>Wnt4</italic> expression in wave 1 granulosa cells may indicate that <italic>Wnt4</italic>-mediated downregulation of androgen production at 2 wk becomes reduced by granulosa cell degradation, promoting the subsequent upregulation of androgen levels at puberty. <italic>Igfbp5</italic>, the most highly conserved of the Igfbp’s, is also a potent regulator of female reproductive tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schneider et al. 2002</xref>). Thus, while changing levels of gonadotrophins in young juvenile mice likely play a role in wave 1 atresia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Edson et al., 2009</xref>), intrinsic differences in gene expression within different follicular waves at the same stage exist and have the potential to be important.</p>

<sec id="s3f">
<title>The timing of follicular activation begins to be specified early in ovarian development</title>
<p>Finding that a subset of primordial follicles located near the medulla-cortex border comprise many of the earliest activated wave 2 follicles raised the question how early activation is controlled. It is well established that upregulation of insulin-mediated growth pathways accompanies follicle activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Edson et al., 2009</xref>). Boundary follicles may become poised to active before most other wave 2 follicles because their location close to the nutrient-rich medulla enhances growth signaling, weakens quiescence and activates <italic>Nr5a2</italic> and <italic>Foxl2</italic> expression, genes which are expressed in GCs of all growing follicles. Wave 1 granulosa cells in the medulla differentially express genes promoting growth like <italic>Igfbp5</italic>, <italic>Grb14</italic> and <italic>Ghr</italic>, and signaling genes like <italic>Itga6</italic> and <italic>Inha</italic>, relative to wave 2 follicles growing during wks 4 and 5.</p>
<p>However, evidence increasingly suggests that follicular waves do not simply depend on differences in their local microenvironments. These follicle groups form at times in fetal ovary development that overlap other critical events of gonad development. The progenitors of bipotential reproductive cell types like BPGs and and mesenchymal steroidogenic precursors that arise early in both male and female gonad development remain elusive (Meinsohn, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Edson et al. 2009</xref>). These cells include stem-like cells that give rise to theca cells and interstitial gland cells. We were able to preferentially mark both wave 1 follicles and boundary follicles using <italic>Foxl2-CreERT2</italic> as early as E14.5, suggesting that they are specified as early as bipotential and later progenitors, and involve intercellular signaling events linked to sex determination. Progress in understanding basic questions of gonad development would undoubtedly advance insight into how wave 1 and boundary follicles are specified.</p>

<title>Genetic studies of wave 1 follicles</title>
<p>We explored genotypes that reduce the number of wave 1 follicles in order to look for the genetic consequences of decreased wave 1 activity. In Turner syndrome, wave 1 follicle development is reported to be reduced significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miura et al. 2017</xref>). This imbalance might decrease androgen levels, potentially affecting juvenile development. Consistent with hormonal disruption, hormone replacement therapy significantly improves the development of individuals with Turner syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Klein et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, androgens are known to play an important role in this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zuckerman-Levin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Viuff et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>We examined mouse XO mice and looked for changes in wave 1 follicle numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7B-C</xref>). In our experiments, wave 1 follicle numbers were reduced relative to levels in XX control females at wk1 of development. However, the reduction was transient and by 2 wk, before remodeling and theca cell expansion, XO and XX females had regained a similar number of wave 1 follicles. Consequently, we could not draw any conclusions regarding the functional role of wave 1 follicles and their remodeling from these studies.</p>

<title>Steroid hormones mediate sexual development in juvenile mice and during peri-puberty</title>
<p>Steroid hormones influence the development of sexually dimorphic organs including the brain (review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Simerly, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arnold, 2009</xref>). They have multiple sources, including steroids in the maternal circulation during pregnancy, as well as subsequent systemic and local steroid production during juvenile stages. Wave 1-derived theca cell numbers are high during wk 4-5 of juvenile development. a period known as peri-puberty that has been associated with sexual behavior development and with high levels of androgens, as well as relatively low estrogen production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">François et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Trova et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Devillers et al., 2023</xref>). While the sensitivity of the brain to steroid influences is probably declining during this period, sexually dimorphic circuits are still being shaped in a manner that is important for sexually dimorphic behaviors in female and male rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sisk and Zehr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Templin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Trova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yoest et al., 2023</xref>). Potential targets of this influence include the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) which is larger in female than male rodents and helps regulate female reproductive functions such as ovulation and gonadotrophin production. Sex hormones produced in females during puberty also enhance cell death in the primary visual cortex, reducing its volume in females compared to males. Thus, wave 1 generated steroid production may influence the sexual development.</p>

<p>Tissue samples were first dissected in PBS and dissociated using 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA (Thermo Fisher, #25200056) at 37°C for approximately 20 minutes. Dissociation was halted by adding FBS (Thermo Fisher, #10439016) to a final concentration of 10%. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 100 μm strainer (Fisher, #22-363-549) to remove any remaining undissociated structures.

To further eliminate cell clumps, the samples were filtered through a 40 μm strainer (Fisher, #22-363-547), followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 minutes. The cells were then resuspended in PBSB and subjected to FACS sorting (BD FACSAria™ III Cell Sorter) to collect live cells, with SYTOX™ Orange Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher, S34861) used for viability selection. After a final centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 minutes, the cells were resuspended in appropriate volume of PBSB to achieve a concentration of 1000 cells/μl before proceeding with single-cell sequencing.</p>
<p>Libraries of the single cells were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3.1(PN-1000128) from 10X Genomics, with the goal of capturing 10,000 cells per sample.

The ovaries were then serially dehydrated using graded ethanol solutions: 30%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 95%, and 100% ethanol, followed by two exchanges of 100% acetone. After dehydration, the ovaries were infiltrated and embedded in EMbed 812 Epoxy resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Ultrathin sections at about 70 nm thick were cut on a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome and examined using a Hitachi HT7800 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Images were acquired with an AMT NanoSprint 12 camera.</p>

<p>Multiple waves of follicles have been proven to exist in multiple species, and different waves of follicles contribute differently to oogenesis and fertility. This work characterizes the wave 1 follicles in mouse comprehensively and compares different waves of follicles regarding their cellular and molecular features. Elegant mouse genetics methods are applied to provide lineage tracing of the wave 1 folliculogenesis, together with sophisticated microscopic imaging and analyses. Single-cell RNA-seq is further applied to profile the molecular features of cells in mouse ovaries from week 2 until week 6. While extensive details about the wave 1 follicles, especially the atresia process, are provided, the authors also identified another group of follicles located in the medullary-cortical boundary, which could also be labeled by the FoxL2-mediated lineage tracing method. The &quot;boundary&quot; or &quot;wave 1.5&quot; follicles are proposed by the authors to be the earliest wave 2 follicles, which contribute to the early fertility of puberty mice, instead of the wave 1 follicles, which undergo atresia with very few oocytes generated. The wave 1 follicle atresia, which degrades most oocytes, on the other hand, expands the number of theca cells and generates the interstitial gland cells in the medulla, where the wave 1 follicles are located. These gland cells likely contribute to the generation of androgen and estrogen, which shape oogenesis and animal development. By comparing scRNA-seq data from cells collected from week 2 until week 6 ovaries, the author profiled the changes in numbers of different cells and identified key genes that differ between wave 1 and wave 2 follicles, which could potentially be another driver of different waves of folliculogenesis. In summary, the authors provide a high amount of new results with good quality that illustrate the molecular and cellular features of different waves of mouse follicles, which could be further reused by other researchers in related fields. The findings related to the boundary follicles could potentially bring many new findings related to oogenesis.</p>
<p>This paper is overall well-written with solid and intriguing conclusions that are well supported. The reviewer only has some minor comments for the authors' consideration that could potentially help with the readability of the paper.</p>
<p>(1) The authors identify the wave 1.5 follicles at the medullary-cortex boundary, which begin to develop shortly after 2 weeks. Since the authors already collected scRNA-seq data from week 2 until week 6, could any special gene expression patterns be identified that make wave 1.5 follicle cells different from wave 1 and wave 2?</p>
<p>(2) Are Figures 1C and 1E Z projections from multiple IF slices? If so, please provide representative IF slice(s) from Figures 1C and 1E and clearly label wave 1 and wave 2 follicles to better illustrate how the wave 1 follicles are clarified and quantified.</p>
<p>(3) For Figure 3D, please also provide an image showing the whole ovary section, like in Figures 3A and 3C, to better illustrate the localization and abundance of different cells.</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 4H, expressions of HSD3B1 and PLIN1 seem to be detected in almost all medulla cells. Does this mean all medulla cells gain gland cell features? Or there is only a subset of the medulla cells that are actively expressing these 2 proteins. Please provide image(s) with higher magnification to show more clearly how the expression of these 2 proteins differs among different cells.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 5: The authors discussed cell number changes for different types of cells from week 2 to week 6. A table, or some plots, visualizing numbers of different cell types, instead of just providing original clusters in Dataset S6, at different time points, would make the changes easier to observe.</p>
<p>(6) Figure S7: It would be more helpful to directly show the number of wave 1 follicles.</p>
<p>(7) Did the fluorescence cryosection staining (Line 587 - 595) use the same buffers as in the whole-mount staining (Line 575 - 586)? Please clarify.</p>
<p>(8) In Line 618, what tissue samples were collected? Please point out clearly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores an important question concerning the developmental trajectory of wave 1 ovarian follicles, leveraging valuable tools such as lineage tracing and single-cell RNA sequencing. These approaches position the authors well to dissect early follicle dynamics. The study would benefit from more in-depth analysis, including quantification using the lineage-traced ovaries, and comparison of wave 1 and 2 follicular cells per stage within the single cell dataset.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study aims to address an important question regarding the developmental trajectories of wave 1 ovarian follicles and how they differ from wave 2 follicles that contribute to long-term fertility. This is an important topic, as many studies on ovarian follicle development rely on samples collected at perinatal timepoints in the mouse, which primarily represent wave 1 follicles, to infer later fertility. The research group has the tools and expertise necessary to tackle these questions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Wave 1 follicles are quantified based on the criteria of oocytes larger than 20 µm located within the medullary region, using whole-mount staining. However, the boundary between the medulla and cortex appears somewhat arbitrary. Quantification using FOXL2-lineage-traced ovaries provides a more reliable method for identifying wave 1 follicles. As the developmental trajectory of wave 1 follicles has been well described in Zhang et al. 2013, it would be valuable to provide a more detailed quantification of both labeled and unlabeled follicles by specific follicle stages. In fact, in Zhang et al. 2013, the authors demonstrated that lineage-labeled primordial follicles can be found at the cortex-medulla boundary, suggesting that the observation of labeled &quot;border follicles&quot; is not unexpected. Quantification by follicle stage would provide greater insight into the timing and development of these follicles.</p>
<p>Similarly, the analysis of wave 1 follicle loss should be performed on lineage-traced ovaries using cell death markers to demonstrate the loss of oocytes and granulosa cells, while confirming the preservation of theca and interstitial cells. In particular, granulosa cell loss should be assessed directly with cell death markers in lineage-traced ovaries, rather than from the loss of tamoxifen-labeled cells, as labeling efficiency varies between follicles (Figure 2G).</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing presents a valuable dataset capturing the development of first-wave follicles. The use of a 40µm cell strainer during cell collection for the 10x platform may explain the exclusion of larger oocytes. However, it is still surprising that no oocytes were captured at all. The central question, how wave 1 follicular cells differ from wave 2 cells, should be investigated in more depth, with results validated on FOXL2-lineage-traced ovaries (i.e., Wnt4 staining in wave 1 antral follicles versus wave 2 using lineage-traced ovaries). This analysis should span all stages of follicle development. It also appears to be a missed opportunity that the single-cell sequencing analysis was not performed on lineage-traced ovaries, which would have enabled more definitive identification of wave 1-derived cells.</p>
<p>Finally, this study does not directly assess fertility outcomes and should therefore refrain from drawing conclusions about the fertility potential of wave 1 follicles.</p>

<p>The eLife assessment states that our manuscript is important only as a source of data for others to use in the future. Our methods and analysis of wave 1 follicles were said to be &quot;incomplete&quot; because one of two reviewers claimed we did not prove that 80% of wave 1 oocytes turn over by 5 wk.</p>
<p>We believe that this assessment is simply wrong because critical supporting data already present in the existing manuscript was not understood by one reviewer. Wave 1 follicular oocyte turnover was said to be unproven and to remain uncertain because evidence of death was based only on a lack of Ddx4 staining. New experiments documenting expression of cell death markers, were said to be needed to show the oocytes died. However, our work was not based on the analysis of sectioned material, but used whole mount 3D reconstruction microscopy of cleared ovary preparations. Oocyte death was determined by the absence of an oocyte in fully reconstructed follicles and its replacement with an empty cavity, not just the absence of antibody staining. We included images and complete 3D reconstruction movies documenting these methods. The paper also documents that the holes frequently still contained zona pellucida remnants indicating the former presence of an oocyte. Moreover, we observed many intermediates of oocyte death- shrunken and deformed oocytes- and deformations of follicle structures due to the presence of the empty cavities. Controls showed that Ddx4 staining in the context of 3D imaging always revealed an obvious giant labeled oocyte in 100% of wave 1 follicles prior to death, and in wave 1.5 and wave 2 follicles at all stages. Thus, our methodology is already fully reliable. The reviewer is correct that the entire program of wave 1 development including their programmed turnover would be interesting to explore further. We already provided a large amount of new gene expression information, and documented the first examples of wave 1-specific gene expression. Further studies are not needed for the major conclusions of the paper and can wait for a follow up study.</p>
<p>Secondly, the existence of wave 1.5 is not &quot;speculative,&quot; as stated by the reviewing editor. We extensively validated and quantified the existence of wave 1.5 primordial follicles following Foxl2-cre activation at E16.5, and analysis at 2 wks in multiple experiments. Additionally, we showed wave 1.5 follicles were present at the medullar/cortex border at 2 wks even after activation of Foxl2-cre at E14.5. Our paper also connected for the first time wave 1.5 follicles to a population of non-growing, &quot;poised&quot; primordial follicles at this identical location near the medulla/cortex boundary by Meinsohn et al. in 2021. These follicles had not started to develop yet, and their ultimate fate was not known. We followed the development of these follicles and determined several differences in wave 1.5 follicle gene expression compared to wave 1. As noted in the assessment, our findings on wave 1.5 are now already being extended to other systems such as primate ovaries (adopting our name &quot;wave 1.5&quot; from our bioRxiv manuscript). The simultaneous claims that our discovery of wave 1.5 exists is speculative, and also that other people are finding wave 1.5 follicles in the species they are studying are logically incompatible.</p>
<p><bold>Response to reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 239-245: Please note that Zhang et al. 2013 also show that lineage-labeled primordial follicles can be found at the cortex-medulla boundary (see their Figure 1B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The single image in the Zheng et al. 2014 paper may or may not show mosaic primordial follicles, but it would not be surprising since the experiment was identical to experiments in the paper. However, that single picture is only meaningful in the context of our subsequent work reported in the current manuscript. There was no mention of these follicles in the text of Zheng et al. 2014, no documentation or quantitation of their numbers, and no discussion or understanding of their significance. The incorrect conclusions of the paper were that wave 1 follicles- meaning rapidly developing follicles in the medulla- give rise to most early offspring. This conclusion reversed the previously accepted (and essentially correct) view that wave 1 follicles did not contribute significantly to fertility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;Finally, this study does not directly assess fertility outcomes and should therefore refrain from drawing conclusions about the fertility potential of wave 1 follicles.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We showed by lineage marking that only about 25 of about 200 wave 1 follicles survive even to wk 5. This clearly does prove our conclusion that the great majority of wave 1 follicles do not contribute to fertility.</p>
