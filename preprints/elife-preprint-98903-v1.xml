<title>Abstract</title><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer, and the prognosis is poor due to distant metastasis and drug resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome cisplatin resistance and metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of PDE1A in NSCLC. The RIP assay, mRNA stability assay and LC- MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. We demonstrated that phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) promoted metastasis and EMT progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A- coexpresssed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A- containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting-RNAs, and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated STAT3 pathway. Moreover, PDE1A suppression sensitized anti-NSCLC activity of cisplatin via regulating NRF2 and MET. This work not only uncovers a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 pathway in NSCLC progression but also provides therapeutic strategies for treating NSCLC patients with metastasis or cisplatin- resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 85% of lung cancers and is the most common subtype of lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Despite rapid advances in the clinical treatment of NSCLC in recent years, the prognosis of NSCLC patients is still poor due to recurrence and distant metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for the majority of metastatic NSCLC cases, but drug resistance develops rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance and NSCLC metastasis are still poorly understood.</p>
<p>Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a class of enzymes that hydrolyse cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), reducing the signaling of these important intracellular second messengers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. PDEs consist of 11 family members, and each family member contains multiple subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. PDEs are being pursued as therapeutic targets in multiple diseases, including the cardiovascular system, metabolism, pulmonary system, nervous system, immunity, and cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. For example, PDE3 inhibitors are used to treat heart failure and peripheral artery disease, and PDE4 inhibitors are approved to treat inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Multiple studies have shown that PDEs, such as PDE4 and PDE5, play a vital role in the progression of tumors and are regarded as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. The PDE1 family member has three subtypes, including PDE1A, PDE1B and PDE1C, with different affinities for cAMP and cGMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The effect and mechanism of PDE1 in regulating cancer progression remain elusive.</p>
<p>N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) is the most abundant RNA modification, and the process of m<sup>6</sup>A modification is reversible: m6A is installed by “writers”, removed by “erasers”, and recognized by “readers” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. YT521-B homology domain family member 2 (YTHDF2), belonging to the YTH domain protein family, has been validated as m<sup>6</sup>A “reader” and regulates the stability of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. YTHDF2 promotes the progression of lung adenocarcinoma by recognizing m6A modification and influencing mRNA fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, YTHDF2 orchestrates the reprogramming of tumor- associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and YTHDF2 is an effective target to enhance cancer immunotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. In this study, we first demonstrated that PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis and cisplatin resistance via interacting with YTHDF2.</p>

<title>PDE1A overexpression predicts a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients</title>
<p>First, we found that PDE1A was highly expressed in lung cancer compared with normal lung tissue using immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, overexpression of PDE1A was also observed in three NSCLC cell lines compared with normal human lung fibroblasts (HELF cells). Additionally, the overexpression of PDE1A was also observed in lung cancer from high-risk patients compared with low-risk patients (p&lt;0.0001, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and lung cancer patients in the high-risk group had shorter survival times than those in the low-risk group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, lung cancer patients with high levels of PDE1A in their tumors had shorter overall survival than those with low PDE1A expression, indicating that PDE1A overexpression was correlated with a poor prognosis in lung cancer patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Thus, PDE1A might be a novel prognostic predictor in lung cancer treatment and contribute to lung cancer progression.</p>

PDE1A might also participate in mesenchyme development, angiogenesis, vasculature development, cellular response to VEGF stimulus, blood vessel morphogenesis and development (Figure S2A-C). Thus, we hypothesized that PDE1A might promote the metastatic potential of NSCLC cells.</p>
<p>First, PDE1A silencing did not cause a significant decrease in the proliferation of NSCLC cells relative to that in the control siRNA group (Figure S3A). Moreover, PDE1A overexpression had no significant effect on the proliferation of NSCLC cells (Figure S3B). As bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that PDE1A might promote the metastatic potential of NSCLC cells, wound healing and transwell assays were used to investigate the migration and invasion capacity of PDE1 family members. Knockdown of PDE1 family members suppressed the migratory ability of NCI-H1299 cells, and siPDE1A exerted a stronger suppression effect on the migration of NCI-H1299 cells than siPDE1B and siPDE1C transfection (Figure S4A). Meanwhile, siPDE1A resulted in more profound suppression of EMT progression in NCI-H1299 cells than siPDE1B and siPDE1C transfection (Figure S4B). Thus, PDE1 family members, particularly PDE1A, might be involved in the metastatic behavior of NSCLC cells.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, suppression of PDE1A markedly reduced the migratory and invasive capacity of NSCLC cell lines, and the wound healing assay also showed that NSCLC cells with PDE1A knockdown had a slower wound closure rate than control siRNA-transfected cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Furthermore, PDE1A knockdown increased E-cadherin expression and reduced N-cadherin expression, indicating that PDE1A silencing suppressed EMT progression in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Meanwhile, the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine significantly suppressed the migration and EMT of NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> - H). To determine the effects of PDE1A on NSCLC cell migration and invasion <italic>in vivo</italic>, nude mouse models were established using PDE1A- shRNA- and control-shRNA-treated NCI-H1299 cells. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref> and Figure S4C, the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules was decreased in the PDE1A-shRNA group compared with the control-shRNA group in nude mice.</p>

<title>PDE1A promotes the metastasis of NSCLC cells via the STAT3 signaling pathway</title>
<p>Then, we investigated whether PDE1A-enhanced metastasis was dependent on cAMP metabolism activity. As shown in Figure S6A, the cAMP inhibitor SQ22536 failed to rescue the migrative ability suppressed by siPDE1A in NSCLC cells, indicating that the basic molecular function might not be involved in the metastasis of PDE1A. To better explore the mechanism of PDE1A in NSCLC progression, we performed bioinformatic analysis of PDE1A coexpressed genes, which revealed that PDE1A might be involved in the JAK/STAT3, Hedgehog, and TGF-β pathways in NSCLC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Meanwhile, GSEA enrichment analysis demonstrated that PDE1A might participate in IL-6 production (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), thus we hypothesized that IL- 6/JAK/STAT3 signaling might be involved in PDE1A-promoted metastasis in NSCLC. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, PDE1A overexpression increased the phosphorylation level of STAT3 in NSCLC cells. In contrast, PDE1A knockdown or the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine suppressed the phosphorylation of STAT3 in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>).

In addition, the suppression of STAT3 inhibited PDE1A-induced EMT progression in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>). Thus, PDE1A promoted the metastasis of NSCLC cells via activating the STAT3 signaling pathway, but the direct interaction between PDE1A and STAT3 could not be observed in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). Moreover, PDE1A was mainly overexpressed in the cytoplasm in NSCLC cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>), and we next further explored the mechanism by which PDE1A in promotes the STAT3 signaling pathway in the cytoplasm.</p>

<title>PDE1A physically interacts with YTHDF2 and promotes the metastasis of NSCLC cells</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism by which PDE1A promotes NSCLC metastasis and activates the STAT3 pathway, the proteins interacting with PDE1A in NSCLC were determined using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis (Table S3). To identify the key proteins involved in PDE1A-mediated STAT3 activation, we generated a Venn diagram, which showed that there were 9 overlapping genes among those coexpressed with STAT3 in NSCLC clinical samples, PDE1A-interacting proteins, and overexpressed in NSCLC compared with normal tissues (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Meanwhile, GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A interacting genes was used to predict the molecular function of PDE1A, and PDE1A might participate in m6A-containing RNA binding in NSCLC progression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A- containing RNA binding during NSCLC progression.

<title>PDE1A suppression enhances the anti-NSCLC activity of cisplatin via regulating MET and NRF2 expression</title>
<p>As the PDE1A/ YTHDF2 complex might also regulate MET and NRF2, the activation of MET or NRF2 triggers NSCLC resistance to chemotherapy, such as cisplatin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>NSCLC is becoming a leading cause of death globally due to its fast progression and metastatic potential, and effective therapeutic targets are urgently needed to block NSCLC metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. PDEs are regarded as therapeutic targets for multiple diseases, but the feasibility of targeting PDEs to treat NSCLC metastasis may need further investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In this study, we showed for the first time that PDE1 promoted metastasis and EMT progression in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, the expression of PDE1A was closely correlated with the disease progression of NSCLC. These data first indicated with PDE1A might be an efficacious therapeutic target for patients with metastatic NSCLC.</p>
<p>The stimulation of the PDEs requires physiological concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide PDE1 is involved in the communication between the cyclic nucleotide and Ca<sup>2+</sup> second messenger systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. The increasing of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cancer cells stimulates exosome biogenesis and release under both physiological and pathological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. In this context, we assumed that PDE1A might be involved in exosome biogenesis and release in NSCLC cells and play a vital role in message communication in the TME. GSEA showed that PDE1A might be involved in angiogenesis, vasculature development, and blood vessel development. Indeed, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis in the TME, and PDE1A knockdown significantly suppressed angiogenesis of NSCLC <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, an exosome release inhibitor successfully reversed the angiogenesis promoted by NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A. Thus, this study first illustrated that PDEs might play an important role in angiogenesis and the TME via regulating exosome biogenesis and release in cancer cells.</p>
<p>During our attempt to reveal the downstream signaling pathway of PDE1A, we found that the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A coexpressed genes from NSCLC. Furthermore, PDE1A promoted the metastasis of NSCLC cells via the STAT3 signaling pathway. Targeting the IL- 6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway is considered as a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. However, the direct interaction between PDE1A and STAT3 could not be observed in NSCLC cells. Thus, we next explored the mechanism by which PDE1A promotes the STAT3 signaling pathway. In our study, we demonstrated that PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2 and participated in NSCLC progression, and our data first verified the interaction between YTHDF2 and PDE1A in NSCLC cells. Meanwhile, YTHDF2 might act as an m6A RNA “reader” by interacting with PDE1A, but the mechanism might need further investigation. YTHDF2 destabilizes mRNAs via degrading target transcripts, but it also stabilizes important oncogenic drivers, such as <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>VEGFA</italic> transcripts, in an m6A- dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. We demonstrated that YTHDF2 destabilized SOCS2 mRNA and stabilized MET and NRF2 mRNA via interacting with PDE1A, but the mechanism by which YTHDF2 sorts mRNA might need further investigation.</p>
<p>Treatment with cisplatin frequently develops chemoresistance leading to therapeutic failure, and the exploitation of chemosensitization strategies have significant clinical implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that PDE1A positively regulated the expression of MET and NRF2 in NSCLC cells, and the expression of PDE1A was closely correlated with the anti-NSCLC activity of cisplatin. Our findings are the first to indicate that the expression of PDEs might be involved in NSCLC resistance to cisplatin treatment. Vinpocetine has been clinically used to treat stroke, senile dementia, and memory disturbances; no significant side effects or toxicity of vinpocetine have been reported at therapeutic doses, and it is safe for long-term use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Vinpocetine is also regarded as a PDE1 inhibitor and increases the levels of cAMP and cGMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. This study first revealed that vinpocetine sensitized cells to cisplatin treatment via regulating MET and NRF2. Thus, vinpocetine plus cisplatin might be a novel therapeutic regimen for treating NSCLC patients with cisplatin resistance. Our finding was supported by the observations that cAMP signaling increases histone deacetylase 8 expression and augments cisplatin-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p>
<p>Collectively, the results of this study suggest that PDE1A promotes metastasis and cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, PDE1A overexpression is correlated with angiogenesis and poor outcomes of NSCLC patients. In addition, PDE1A interacts with YTHDF2 and regulates the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway via degrading SOCS2 mRNA. Meanwhile, PDE1A regulates cisplatin resistance via stabilizing MET and NRF2. Therefore, this study reveals the effect and mechanism of PDE1A in promoting HCC metastasis and cisplatin resistance, this work not only uncovers a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 signaling pathway in NSCLC progression but also provides novel therapeutic strategies to treat NSCLC patients with metastasis or cisplatin resistance.</p>

<p>This manuscript provides <bold>valuable</bold> mechanistic insight into NSCLC progression, both in terms of tumour metastasis and the development of chemoresistance. The authors draw upon a range of techniques and assays and although the evidence shown is <bold>solid</bold>, suggestions by the two reviewers will strengthen the message. The work presented will be of interest to cancer biologists and more broadly to those interested in NSCLC translational studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Phosphodiesterase 1A Physically Interacts with YTHDF2 and Reinforces the Progression of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer&quot; explores the role of PDE1A in promoting NSCLC progression by binding to the m6A reader YTHDF2 and regulating the mRNA stability of several novel target genes, consequently activating the STAT3 pathway and leading to metastasis and drug resistance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses a novel mechanism involving PDE1A and YTHDF2 interaction in NSCLC, contributing to our understanding of cancer progression.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The following issues should be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) The body weight changes and/or survival times of each group in the in vivo metastasis studies should be provided.</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 7, the direct binding between YTHDF2 and the potential target genes should be further validated by silencing YTHDF2 to observe the half-life of the mRNA levels of target genes, in addition to silencing PDE1A.</p>
<p>(3) In Figure 7, the potential methylation sites of &quot;A&quot; on the target genes such as SOCS2 should be verified by mutation analysis, followed by m6A IP or reporter assays.</p>
<p>(4) In Figure 6G, the correlation between the mRNA levels of STAT3 and YTHDF2 needs clarification. According to the authors' mechanism, the STAT3 pathway is activated, rather than upregulation of mRNA levels (or protein levels, as shown in Figure 6F). Figure 7 does not provide evidence that STAT3 is a bona fide target gene regulated by YTHDF2.</p>
<p>(5) The final figure, which discusses sensitization to cisplatin by PDE1A suppression, does not appear to be closely related to the interaction or regulation of PDE1A/YTHDF2. If the authors claim this is an m6A-associated event, additional evidence is needed. Otherwise, this part could be removed from the manuscript.</p>

<p>This manuscript aims to investigate the biological impact and mechanisms of phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) in promoting non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression. They first analyzed several databases and used three established NSCLC cell lines and a normal cell line to demonstrate that PDE1A is overexpressed in lung cancer and its expression negatively correlated with the outcomes of patients. Based on this data, they suggested PDE1A could be considered as a novel prognostic predictor in lung cancer treatment and progression. To study the biological function of PDE1A in NSCLC, they focused on testing the effect of inhibition of PDE1A genetically and pharmacologically on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. They also used an experimental metastasis model via tail vein injection of H1299 cells to test if PDE1A promoted metastasis. By database analysis, they also decided to investigate if PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by co-culturing NSCLC cells with HUVECs as well as assessing the tumors from the subcutaneous xenograft model. However, in this model, whether PDE1A modulation impacted tumor metastasis was not examined. To address the mechanism of how PDE1A promotes metastasis, the authors again performed a bioinformatic and GSEA enrichment analysis and confirmed PDE1A indeed activated STAT3 signaling to promote migration. In combination with IP followed by Mass spectrometry, they found PDE1A is a partner of YTHDF2, the cooperation of PDE1A and YTHDF2 negatively regulated SOCS2 mRNA as demonstrated by RIP assay, and ultimately activated STAT3 signaling. Finally, the authors shifted the direction from metastasis to chemoresistance, specifically, they found that PDEA1 inhibitions sensitized NSCLC cells to cisplatin through MET and NRF2 signaling.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript was well-written and the majority of the data supported the conclusions. The authors used a series of methods including cell lines, animal models, and database analysis to demonstrate the novel roles and mechanism of how PDE1 promotes NSCLC invasion and metastasis as well as cisplatin sensitivity. Given that PDE1A inhibitors have been perused to use in clinic, this study provided valuable findings that have the translational potential for NSCLC treatment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The role of YTHDF2 in PDE1A-promoted tumor metastasis was not investigated. To make the findings more clinical and physiologically relevant, it would be interesting to test if inhibition of PDE1A impacts metastasis using lung cancer orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft models. It is also important to use a cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cell line to test if a PDE1A inhibitor has the potential to sensitize cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, this study relied heavily on different database analyses, although providing novel and compelling data that was followed up and confirmed in the paper, it is critical to have detailed statistical description section on data acquisition throughout the manuscript.</p>
