<title>Abstract</title><p>The accuracy of crucial nuclear processes such as transcription, replication, and repair, depends on the local composition of chromatin and the regulatory proteins that reside there. Understanding these DNA-protein interactions at the level of specific genomic loci has remained challenging due to technical limitations. Here, we introduce a method termed “DNA O-MAP”, which uses programmable peroxidase-conjugated oligonucleotide probes to biotinylate nearby proteins. We show that DNA O-MAP can be coupled with sample multiplexed quantitative proteomics and next-generation sequencing to quantify DNA-protein and DNA-DNA interactions at specific genomic loci.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Eukaryotic cells store their genetic material in the form of chromatin, a DNA-protein complex. The function of a eukaryotic DNA locus is executed through the cooperation between its nucleotide sequence and the hundreds of protein factors assembled around it. DNA-protein interactions thus play a fundamental role in regulating both the genome’s structure and message storing functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, developing methods to decipher DNA-protein interactions in cells has been a focus of technology development efforts for decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. For instance, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>), which has emerged as a core technology for epigenomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, surveys the genome-wide binding profile of a target DNA-associated protein. ChIP-seq and related technologies (e.g., DamID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, CUT&amp;Tag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>) have produced an abundance of high-quality datasets that enabled the establishment of database consortia such as ENCODE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and IHEC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and significantly accelerated chromatin state annotation efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Such methods, which profile DNA-protein interactions through a protein-centric lens, require the <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of which protein(s) to target and rely on the availability of suitable reagents such as antibodies or genetically engineered cell lines. By targeting a single protein at a time, these methods also inherently ignore the context of protein complexes or transient interactions that may be present at a given locus.</p>
<p>In addition to methods that profile the DNA bound by specific proteins, efforts have been dedicated to addressing the inverse problem—identifying the full collection of proteins assembled on a given DNA locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Such methods include the foundational proteomics of isolated chromatin segment (PICh) technology, which uses a biotinylated oligonucleotide (oligo) probe to affinity label specific genomic DNA intervals via <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. To enhance the stability of probe-chromatin interactions throughout the purification workflow, PICh utilizes oligos containing locked nucleic acid residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which are highly efficient as hybridization probes against repetitive DNA targets but cost-prohibitive to use to target non-repetitive intervals that require dozens to hundreds of probes to produce visible signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. As noted in follow-up work, PICh was effective for repeat sequences but would require significant additional work to extend to more complex genomic sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Additionally, even with the increased stability gained from the use of locked nucleic acid probes, the probe-chromatin hybrids can be difficult to maintain when coupled with stringent purification washes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, limiting detection sensitivity. As a consequence, an input of one trillion cells was required for one purification and successful identification of proteins interacting with telomeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To reach a higher degree of enrichment, which is critical for lower abundance DNA targets, an alternative strategy is to directly biotinylate the proteins that occupy a target DNA locus. This biotinylation can be achieved via targeted proximity labeling using promiscuous biotin ligases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> or the engineered ascorbate peroxidase (APEX/APEX2) enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Since the development of APEX, several methods including C-BERST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and GLoPro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, have combined APEX with CRISPR genome targeting to endow it with locus specificity. This involves fusing APEX to a catalytically dead RNA-guided nuclease, Cas9 (dCas9) and directing the fusion enzyme to a specific locus of interest by single guide RNAs (sgRNAs). The locus-docked dCas9-APEX biotinylates the neighboring proteins on electrophilic amino acid side chains, such as tyrosine, enabling protein purification and subsequent identification by mass spectrometry (MS). In the case of GLoPro, APEX-based proximity labeling enhanced protein detection sensitivity, reducing the input required for each replicate analysis to ∼300 million cells—a 10-fold reduction in cell input compared to PICh, which used 3 billion cells. Nevertheless, a notable limitation of CRISPR-guided proximity labeling is requiring the introduction of the fusion dCas9-APEX enzyme and sgRNAs into a suitable host cell line. Since a successful locus purification canonically requires tens to hundreds of millions of cells, if not more, most current methods aim to create stable cell lines for this purpose. These requirements limit the use of previous locus proteomics methods since efficient and well-tolerated gene delivery remains a major challenge and considerable effort in primary cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, the labeling reagents necessary for APEX-based proximity labeling—hydrogen peroxide and biotin phenoxyl radicals—are toxic to cells and living organisms, limiting the use of CRISPR-based proximity labeling to cell lines amenable to genetic engineering. Owing to the large numbers of cells required and the need to maximize sensitivity, previous methods often compared only 1–2 biological replicates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In some cases, this was limited by the use of stable-isotope-based quantification methods that can only multiplex up to three samples per analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Thus, an unmet need exists for extensible methods capable of scaling and profiling multiple genomic loci. Moreover, these methods would ideally be capable of scaling and multiplexing comparisons between multiple local proteomes or one local proteome in response to multiple stimuli or perturbations.</p>
<p>We address these pressing technical limitations by introducing DNA O-MAP, a locus purification method that uses oligo-based ISH probes to recruit peroxidase activity to specific DNA intervals. DNA O-MAP builds on our previously introduced RNA O-MAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and pSABER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> techniques, which target peroxidase activity to specific RNAs and RNAs/DNA intervals for purification or visualization, respectively. Here, we describe a cost-effective and scalable bulk hybridization and biotinylation workflows capable of processing millions of cells in parallel in just a few days, and demonstrate the recovered material is compatible with sample multiplexed proteomics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We benchmark the specificity of our approach by recovering telomere-specific DNA binding proteins after targeting telomeric DNA. We further showcase the scalability and sample multiplexing capacity of DNA O-MAP by distinguishing the DNA-associated proteomes around human pericentromeric alpha-satellite repeats, telomeres, and mitochondrial genomes in quadruplicates using tandem mass tags<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Finally, we establish that DNA O-MAP can be used to capture functionally relevant DNA-DNA interactions, read out by DNA sequencing, from intervals as small as 20 kilobases. We anticipate that the flexible targeting, scalable protocol, and robust labeling capabilities provided by DNA O-MAP will lead to its adoption as a platform technology for uncovering locus-specific chromatin interactions.</p>

<title>Design of DNA O-MAP</title>
<p>DNA O-MAP is a molecular profiling methodology that combines the targeting flexibility of oligo-based (ISH) with the ability of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to catalyze the localized deposition of small biomolecules at sites where it is bound. DNA O-MAP works by recruiting a ‘secondary’ HRP-conjugated oligo to sites where the primary ISH probes are bound. HRP-mediated deposition of biotin at specific genomic sites then enables the pull-down and purification of chromatin associated proteins and DNA from <italic>trans</italic>-interacting genomic loci. As in RNA O-MAP, the specificity of ISH and/or biotinylation can be assessed by microscopy using a small sample of cells immobilized on solid support before the cell pellets enter affinity purification downstream. Importantly, the HRP-conjugated oligo is available via several commercial sources, allowing researchers without the expertise to perform their own conjugations to utilize DNA O-MAP.</p>

<title>DNA O-MAP deploys a scalable in-solution hybridization-biotinylation workflow</title>
<p>During the development of DNA O-MAP, it became clear that performing <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on samples adhered to solid substrates such as microscope slides or well plates would create significant scaling challenges, both in terms of reagent costs and sample processing time. We addressed these challenges by developing a suspension-based hybridization workflow for cost-efficient genomic labeling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We began with adherent cells grown on multi-layer flasks, each yielding 90-120 million cells, and subsequently released and fixed (4% PFA) in order to be compatible with DNA ISH. Samples can be processed in parallel, thereby increasing the number of samples that could be handled in parallel by one experimentalist. Critically, this approach reduces reagent costs by ∼1,000-fold relative to conventional ISH protocols performed on solid substrates, making the labeling of millions or more cells with oligo-based ISH probe sets, including those targeting non-repetitive DNA, cost-feasible.</p>

<title>DNA O-MAP reveals the organization of the telomeric proteome</title>
<p>To demonstrate that O-MAP can successfully purify proteins from small genomic viewpoints, we selected human telomeres for initial testing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Mammalian telomeres are several kilobases of tandemly repeated arrays of 5’-TTAGGG-3’ hexamers with terminal 3’ single-stranded overhangs at the ends of chromosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Telomeric DNA is specifically bound by a proteinaceous cap that protects the natural chromosome ends from being recognized as damaged DNA—the shelterin complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Shelterin is a six-subunit complex, which is comprised of the telomeric repeat-binding factor 1 (TERF1), telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TERF2), protection of telomeres protein 1 (POT1), adrenocortical dysplasia protein homolog (ACD), TERF2-interacting protein 1 (TERF2IP), and TERF1-interacting nuclear factor 2 (TINF2). Due to the unique telomeric sequence and characteristic DNA structure, the shelterin proteins accumulate exclusively at the ends of the chromosomes. Accordingly, this well-defined set of proteins has been widely accepted as goalposts for a successful locus-specific enrichment experiment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In the near-diploid HCT-116 cells, telomeres have an average length of 5.6 kb and their cumulative length approximates 0.017% (∼500kb) of the human genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Compared to other repetitive elements in the human genome, telomeres are relatively short in HCT-116 cells and thus serve as a rigorous test case for DNA viewpoints of around 500 kb in aggregate across the genome.</p>
<p>We performed a DNA O-MAP experiment in which we either targeted telomeric DNA or omitted the primary hybridization probe (negative control). We purified biotinylated proteins from &lt;60 million cells in three technical replicates followed by imaging of biotinylation and identification of proteins using label-free quantitative proteomics. By streptavidin staining, the punctate fluorescence pattern of biotin-labeled biomolecules closely mimicked telomere FISH, whereas we did not observe patterns of these puncta in the negative control samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). From our label-free proteomics analysis, we identified 163 proteins as significantly enriched at telomeres. As expected, gene set enrichment analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> identified significant enrichment of telomeric chromosomal components, chromatin, and protein-DNA complexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>). Importantly, we identified all six shelterin proteins in the telomere sample and these proteins were completely absent from the control samples. Of the six shelterin proteins, four (TERF1, TERF2, TERF2IP, POT1) passed stringent false-discovery rate control while ACD and TINF2 did not due to low spectral intensity. To benchmark DNA O-MAP, we compared the full set of telomeric proteins to proteins observed in five established telomeric datasets (PICh, C-BERST, CAPLOCUS, CAPTURE, BioID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We then overlaid each called interactor on direct protein interaction data and found that DNA O-MAP enabled greater coverage of known protein interactors, even those not previously identified as enriched at telomeres by other methods. In addition to shelterins, we identified multiple heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) previously annotated as telomere-associated, including HNRNPA1 and HNRNPU. HNRNPA1 has been demonstrated to displace replication protein A (RPA) and directly interact with single-stranded telomeric DNA to regulate telomerase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, HNRNPU belongs to the telomerase-associated proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> where it binds the telomeric G-quadruplex to prevent RPA from recognizing chromosome ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Taken together, this data supports the effectiveness of DNA O-MAP for sensitively and selectively isolating loci-specific proteomes.</p>

<title>DNA O-MAP enables multiplexed detection of locus proteomes</title>
<p>We next evaluated the utility of DNA O-MAP to quantitatively delineate locus-specific proteomes. We integrated sample multiplexing quantitative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> proteomics downstream of DNA O-MAP to enable spectral quantification of all samples simultaneously (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In our experimental design, we selected three well-characterized DNA loci with distinct protein occupants in the human genome: 1) telomeres, 2) peri-centromeric alpha satellite repeats; 3) the mitochondrial genome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Centromeres are epigenetically defined chromosomal loci where kinetochore proteins assemble for spindle microtubule attachment to ensure equal chromosome segregation during cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Human centromeres are located within the AT-rich alpha satellite repeats, which are higher-order repeats composed of 171-base-pair monomeric units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Due to the sequence independence of centromeres, we utilized a previously described probe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> that targets a subset of alpha satellite repeats to represent centromeres, hereafter denoted as the ‘Pan Alpha Sat.’ probe. The predicted genome-wide binding profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> of the pan-alpha probe closely overlaps with centromeres (<bold>Figure S1</bold>). Mitochondria are intracellular organelles of eukaryotic cells with their own genome (mtDNA). The mtDNA is a circular double-stranded DNA molecule of about 16.6 kb, located in the mitochondrial matrix associated with the inner membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. To demonstrate the locus-specificity of biotinylation using the new oligo/oligo pools, we performed DNA O-MAP in human HCT-116 cells with a co-hybridization of both fluorescent oligos and HRP oligos in order to observe fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH) and <italic>in situ</italic> biotinylation signals in the same cell. Biotinylation patterns of the pan-alpha, telomere, and mtDNA probes showed strong concordance with FISH (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). To quantify the local proteomes corresponding to each of these biotinylated patterns, we prepared replicate (n=4) samples for each probe and control. After <italic>in situ</italic> HRP-mediated labeling, we performed thermal reversal of fixation of cells prior to lysis, enrichment of biotinylated proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, tryptic digestion, and labeling with isobaric TMTpro barcodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We note that artificial lysine alkylation due to cellular fixation with PFA may affect TMTpro labeling of protein, thus we tracked artificial lysine modifications during mass spectrometric analysis to ensure minimal effects of alkylation on protein quantification (1.38% of lysines were alkylated).</p>

<p>In total we quantified 3,055 proteins across all four conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D–E</xref>). We observed consistent proteome enrichment by principal component analysis and correlation analyses, with tight clustering of replicates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D–E</xref><bold>, S2</bold>). Based on Human Protein Atlas annotations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, we observed significant enrichment of mitochondrial proteins with the mtDNA-probe proteomes and proteins from nuclear locations such as nuclear speckles, nucleoplasm, and nucleoli enriched by the telomere and pan-alpha probes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref><bold>, S3</bold>). Notably, the pan-alpha probe enriched proteins from the nucleoli, consistent with the known nucleoli-centromere associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>; chromosomal passenger complex member AURKB, consistent with the centromeric localization of AURKB in early mitosis to ensure faithful chromosome segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> and the localization of chromosomal passenger complex members to pericentromeric heterochromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. We also observed pericentromeric enrichment of spindle and chromosomal segregation associated proteins TPX2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> and KIF20A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> (<bold>Figure S3, S4</bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we explored the enrichment of several multi-unit protein complexes across the examined loci. To dissect the differences between enriched proteomes for each probe, we chose a subset of proteins of interest and measured the fold change of the two nuclear targets compared to mitochondria. RNA Polymerase I,II,III subunits were all higher in the nuclear probes than mitochondria, however in contrast to RNA Polymerase II and III, POLR1 proteins are significantly enriched in pan-alpha compared to telomere (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). This enrichment is likely due to clustering of centromeres around nucleoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, the location of ribosomal RNA synthesis by RNA Polymerase I. Conversely, mitochondrial RNA Polymerase POLRMT abundance was significantly lower in the nuclear probe proteomes compared to the mitochondrial probe proteome (log2 Pan-Alpha Sat./Mito.= −2.51; log2 Telomere/Mito.= −1.88). Similarly, we observed enrichment of mtDNA-packaging nucleoid components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> with the mtDNA probes (TFAM, SSBP1, POLG, POLRMT, Lon, ATAD3A/B, and PHB/PHB2; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G–H</xref>). As above, we observed consistent enrichment of shelterin components at telomeres (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). We also observed CENP-A nucleosomal complexes enriched in the pan-alpha proteomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Histones were enriched with our nuclear probes and a subset (H2A1C, H2AX, and H4C1) were significantly enriched by the pan-alpha probe compared to the telomere probe (<bold>Figure S4</bold>). We also observed enrichment of catenins CTNNB1 and CTNND1 at telomeres (<bold>Figure S3</bold>). The transcription factor CTNNB1 has been observed at the transcriptional start site of h<italic>TERT</italic> where it regulates h<italic>TERT</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The h<italic>TERT</italic> gene is located in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 5 (chr5:1,253,167-1,295,068) and expressed in HCT-116 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Collectively, these results demonstrate the sensitivity and subcompartment specificity of DNA O-MAP and highlight how coupling quantitative proteomics with DNA O-MAP can distinguish differential compartment components even for ubiquitous chromatin constituents like histones.</p>

<title>DNA O-MAP can uncover DNA-DNA interactions from non-repetitive DNA loci</title>
<p>Beyond repetitive regions in the human genome, we explored whether DNA O-MAP can recover material from small, single-copy DNA intervals. To this end, we designed an experiment in which we performed <italic>in situ</italic> biotinylation followed by chromatin extraction, affinity purification, and sequencing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The human genome is folded into thousands of chromatin loops where two loci on the same chromosome are tethered to each other (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The anchors of the loops are bound by the insulator protein CTCF. The ring-shaped cohesin protein complex is thought to to often stall at CTCF-bound sites while dynamically moving along the genome, creating contact domains of preferential DNA-DNA interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. In HCT-116 cells, these contacts between chromatin loop anchors have been captured genome-wide with <italic>in situ</italic> Hi-C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Normally present in two copies per genome, these 20–25 kb loop anchor intervals are considerably less abundant than telomeres.</p>

<p>We first evaluated whether DNA O-MAP can specifically biotinylate loop anchors with microscopy by a co-hybridization of both fluorescent oligos and HRP oligos at four anchors: chr3 left (chr3:187,729,712-187,749,712), chr3 right (chr3:188,939,711-188,964,711), chr19 left-2 (chr19:33,425,000-33,450,000), and chr19 right (chr19:33,750,000-33,775,000). DNA O-MAP specifically biotinylated the biomolecules proximal to these small DNA intervals, as observed in the co-localizing patterns of FISH and streptavidin staining in the same cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We next evaluated whether DNA O-MAP could recover the DNA interactions originally discovered by Hi-C. We targeted a pair of intervals with high contact frequency—chr3 left and chr3 right anchors, one non-looping interval (chr10:123,187,984-123,207,984), and no-primary-probe control. We performed DNA O-MAP to biotinylate these DNA intervals, subjected the labeled cells to chromatin solubilization and desthiobiotin purification, and sequenced the eluate DNA. As expected, all three probed DNA intervals were highly enriched compared with other genomic regions, indicating efficient purification of the loci (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref><bold>, S5A</bold>). Furthermore, chr3 left and chr3 right anchors reciprocally recovered each other, indicating that DNA O-MAP was able to recover known DNA interactions mediated by proteins. In contrast, the non-looping chr10 anchor did not enrich any other peak except itself (<bold>Figure S5B</bold>). Lastly, in the cells that received no primary oligos, no pronounced enrichment was observed genome wide (<bold>Figure S5B</bold>).</p>
<p>To examine the multiplexability and reproducibility of DNA O-MAP, we simultaneously targeted three chromatin loop anchors: chr3 left, chr10 right (chr10:123,957,984-123,977,984), and chr19 right anchors in duplicates and subjected the cell pellets to purification and DNA sequencing. All three targeted anchors, chr3 left, chr10 right, and chr19 right anchors were successfully enriched (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E–F</xref><bold>, S6A</bold>), whereas no pronounced enrichment was observed in the no-primary-probe controls genome-wide (<bold>Figure S6B</bold>). Furthermore, chr10 left (contacting chr10 right), chr19 left-1, and chr19 left-2 (both contacting chr19 right) were also efficiently recovered, accurately matching the Hi-C contact maps and the signals from two replicates was consistent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E–F</xref>). These imaging and genomics data demonstrate that DNA O-MAP is capable of labeling small, single-copy DNA intervals with high specificity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By combining the versatility of hybridization-based genome targeting with robustness of proximity biotinylation, DNA O-MAP offers a scalable approach to study DNA-associated proteomes through a locus specific lens. The liquid-phase hybridization-biotinylation workflow allows for efficient processing of samples and is compatible with both proteomic and genomic readouts. Integration with multiplexed quantitative proteomics enables simultaneous analysis of multiple loci or conditions, increasing data completeness and throughput. Label-free analysis of the telomeres shows strong concordance of labeling with in-situ hybridization and recapitulates previous similar proteomic datasets. Our tri-locus experiment was able to differentiate proteins with a quantitative profile suggesting general nuclear location from those specifically associated with telomeres and peri-centromeres. DNA O-MAP’s ability to target single-copy loci, as evidenced by the chromatin loop anchor experiments, opens up possibilities for studying protein-mediated DNA interactions at a finer resolution than previously possible.</p>
<p>O-MAP has now been shown to be a highly flexible technology for the exploration of biomolecular interactions with RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and DNA loci. Using oligos to target the DNA locus, DNA O-MAP can be theoretically adapted for use in any sample types amenable to <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, including cultured cells, tissue sections, and primary tissue samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. As the purification tag is decoupled from the probe oligos, labeled chromatin fragments can undergo stringent washes to achieve efficient purification with minimal background. Moreover, without the need to genetically modify the biological system at hand, the probes in this dataset alone could be used to explore telomeric remodeling in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, spindle-associated proteome dynamics at the pericentromere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, and molecular drivers of hetero- or euchromatin formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> at nearly any locus in the human genome (O-MAP probes can feasibly cover &gt;99% of the human genome)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While this work has laid the foundation for generalized and extensible locus proteomics, further work will be required to achieve the sensitivity required for small, single copy locus proteomics. By taking a comparative quantitative approach, we remove the need to pre-define the local context of probe localization, but experimental design is critical and novel interactors likely need further validation to confirm their co-localization at a given locus (e.g., with imaging/FISH). With developments in automation and instrument sensitivity, DNA O-MAP has the potential to expand to locus specific post-translational modifications and be used for large-scale chromatin perturbation screens. We anticipate that DNA-OMAP will have broad utility for research questions seeking to understand the intricate relationships between DNA sequence, chromatin structure, and cellular function.</p>

<title>Cell culture and fixation</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells were grown in ATCC-formulated McCoy’s 5A Medium Modified (ATCC 30-2007) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For each purification, 20 million HCT-116 cells were seeded into one T-500 flask (Thermo Scientific 132867) to culture for 36-48 hours to reach 90–120 million cells. Before collection, cells were briefly rinsed once with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) and then incubated with 25 ml of TrypLE Express Enzyme (Gibco 12604-021) at 37°C for two minutes or until loosely attached. The cell suspension was collected into two 50 ml conical tubes and the T-500 flask was rinsed with DPBS. The wash was combined with the cell suspension and centrifuged at 300 G for 5 minutes. After a DPBS wash to remove remaining TrypLE, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (wt/vol) (Electron Microscopy Sciences 15710) in PBS in suspension at room temperature for 10 minutes with rotation, followed by 125 mM Glycine quenching for 5 minutes at room temperature with rotation and 15 minutes on ice. Fixed cells were collected by centrifugation at 350G for 5 minutes, and stored in fresh DPBS at 4°C until liquid-phase hybridization. Fixed cells were used within 3-5 days.</p>

<p>Confocal imaging was performed using a Yokogawa CSU-W1 SoRa spinning disc confocal device attached to a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2 microscope. Excitation light was emitted at 30% of maximal intensity from 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, or 640 nm lasers housed inside of a Nikon LU-NF laser unit. Laser excitation was delivered via a single-mode optical fiber into the CSU-W1 SoRa unit. Excitation light was directed through a microlens array disk and a SoRa spinning disk containing 50 um pinholes to the rear aperture of a 100x N.A. 1.49 Apo TIRF oil immersion objective lens by a prism in the base of Ti2. Emission light was collected by the same objective and directed by a prism in the base of Ti2 back into the SoRA unit, where it was relayed by a 1x lens (conventional imaging) or 2.8x lens (super-resolution imaging) through the pinhole disk and then directed to the emission path by a quad-band dichroic mirror (Semrock Di01-T405/488/568/647-13X15X0.5). Emission light was then spectrally filtered by one of four single-bandpass filters (DAPI:Chroma ET455/50M; ATTO488: Chroma ET525/36M; ATTO565:Chroma ET605/50M; Alexa Fluor 647: Chroma ET705/72M) and focused by a 1x relay lens onto an Andor Sona 4.2B-11 camera with a physical pixel size of 11 um, resulting in an effective resolution of 110 nm (conventional), or 39.3 nm (super-resolution).

Each cell pellet was resuspended in roughly 0.9 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 200 mM EPPS with protease inhibitors (Roche 11836170001). The cell mixture was boiled at 95°C for 30 minutes. The boiled cell mixture was sonicated at 4°C using a Covaris LE-220 focused ultrasonicator with the following protocol: 300W peak incident power, 50% duty factor, 200 cycles per burst, with a treatment time of 420 seconds in 1-ml milliTUBEs with AFA fiber (Covaris 520135). The sonicated cell mixture was boiled for a second time at 95°C for 30 minutes. The boiled lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 21130 G for 30 minutes in an Eppendorf 5424 Microcentrifuge at room temperature. The supernatants were transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube. To prevent any remnants of cell debris, the supernatants were cleared for a second time by centrifuging at 21130 G for 30 minutes and the supernatants were transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube. The supernatants were stored in −80°C until protein quantification.</p>
<p>The cleared cell lysates were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher 23225). Pierce Streptavidin Magnetic Beads (Thermo Fisher 88817) were washed using 1% SDS, 200 mM EPPS lysis buffer three times before use. From each labeled cell pellet, 2.17 milligrams of protein was used to couple with 500 μg of streptavidin beads in a Protein Lo-Bind tube (Eppendorf EP022431081). The lysates were incubated with the bead slurry for one hour at room temperature with nutation allowing biotinylated proteins to bind. The coupled beads were collected and separated from the flow-through using a magnetic rack (Sergi Lab Supplies 1005a). After the flow-through was removed, the beads underwent the following washes: 2% SDS with 20 mM EPPS twice, 0.1 M Na2CO3, 2 M urea, and 1 M KCl with 20 mM EPPS twice. All washes were performed as follows: after immobilizing the beads on a magnetic rack for 5 minutes, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were resuspended in the new wash buffer and incubated for 5 minutes with nutation. Finally, the beads were rinsed once with 20 mM EPPS to remove the excess salt.</p>
<p>The washed streptavidin beads were resuspended in 50 μl of 5 mM TCEP, 200 mM EPPS, pH 8.5 for a 20-minute on-bead protein reduction. The proteins were alkylated on-bead using 10 mM iodoacetamide for one hour in the dark. Then DTT was added to the final concentration of 5 mM to quench the alkylation for 15 minutes. The beads were rinsed twice with 200 mM EPPS for on-bead digest. Assuming 20 μg of eluate protein, 200 ng LysC (Wako) was added to the beads in a 50-ul volume and incubated for 16 hours with vortexing. The next day, 200 ng of trypsin (Promega V5113) was added to the beads and incubated for six hours at 37°C at 200 rpm. After digestion, the peptide-containing supernatant was collected in a fresh 0.5-ml Protein Lo-Bind tube. The beads were rinsed once with 100 μl 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid and the wash was combined with the peptides. Peptides were desalted via the stop and go extraction (StageTip)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> method and dried in a vacuum concentrator.</p>
<p>For label free telomere-enriched samples, one sample consisted of HCT-116-Rad21-mAID cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. For samples intended to be multiplexed, dried, desalted peptides were reconstituted in 4 μl of 200 mM EPPS, pH 8.5. The peptides were labeled using 25 μg of TMTpro 16plex Label Reagents (Thermo Fisher A44520) at 33.3% acetonitrile for one hour at room temperature. The labeling reaction was quenched with the addition of 1 μl of 5% hydroxylamine and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. The pooled sample was acidified using formic acid and peptides were desalted using a StageTip cartridge. Peptides were eluted in 70% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid and dried by vacuum centrifugation</p>

<title>Mass Spectrometry Data Acquisition Methods and Analysis</title>
<p>Samples were resuspended in 5% acetonitrile/2% formic acid prior to being loaded onto an in-house pulled C18 (Thermo Accucore, 2.6 Å, 150 μm) 30 cm column. Peptides were eluted over 180 min gradients running from 96% Buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.125% formic acid) and 4% buffer B (95% acetonitrile, 0.125% formic acid) to 30% buffer B. Sample eluate was electrosprayed (2700 V) into a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer for analysis. High field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) was set at “standard” resolution, 4.6 L/min gas flow, and 3 CVs: −40/–60/–80 were used. MS1 scans were conducted at 120,000 resolving power with a 50 ms max injection time, and the AGC target set to 100%. Peaks from the MS1 scans were filtered by intensity (minimum intensity &gt;5 × 103), charge state (2 ≤ z ≤ 6), and detection of a monoisotopic mass (monoisotopic precursor selection, MIPS). Dynamic exclusion was used, with a duration of 90 s, repeat count of 1, mass tolerance of 10 ppm, and the “exclude isotopes” option checked. For each MS1, 8 data-dependent MS/MS scans were collected. MS/MS scans were conducted in the linear ion trap with the “rapid” scan rate, 50 ms max injection time, AGC target set to 200%, CID collision energy of 35% with 10 ms activation time, and 0.5 m/z isolation window. For TMTPro labelled samples, an MS3 scan was also included in the method. Unless otherwise noted in the methods, the real-time search filter was enabled<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Using a human fasta downloaded from Uniprot, fixed modifications for the TMTpro mass (+304.207146) were added to n-terminal residues and lysines. Carbamidomethly (+57.021464) was added for cysteines. Oxidation (+15.9949) was added as a variable modification on methionines. Missed cleavages were set to maximum of 1. “TMT mode” was enabled and thresholds of 1 and 0.05 for Xcorr and dCn respectively were used as minimums to trigger SPS-MS3 scans. SPS ions were set to 10 and MS3 scans were performed at a resolving power of 50,000, with an HCD collision energy of 45%, AGC of 200%, with a maximum injection time of 200 ms.</p>
<p>Label-free mass spectrometry data was analyzed with MSFragger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> search algorithm searched against a full human protein database with forward and reverse protein sequences.

<p>Multiplexed raw mass spectrometry data was analyzed using the Comet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> search algorithm, searched against a full human protein database with forward and reverse protein sequences (Uniprot 10/2020). Precursor monoisotopic peaks were estimated using the Monocle package. Fixed modifications included TMTpro (+304.207146) on n-terminal residues and lysines and Carbamidomethyl (+57.021464) on cysteines. Variable modifications included were Oxidation (+15.9949) on methionine and formylation (+27.994915) on lysines. Peptides up to 2 missed cleavages were included. Peptide spectral matches and proteins were filtered to a 1% false discovery rate using the rules of parsimony and protein picking. Protein quantification was done using signal-to-noise estimates of reporter ions. Samples were column normalized for total protein concentration. After filtering for contaminants, we performed a two-sided t-test comparing each O-MAP condition using Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p values (i.e. q-values). Log2 fold changes of the mean of the biological replicates were also calculated for each biological condition. Human Protein Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> subcellular locations were downloaded and the “main location” was assigned to each protein with a supported or enhanced reliability level. SAINT scores and interaction false discovery rates were calculated with the SAINTexpress software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>.

<title>Preparation of soluble chromatin for affinity purification followed by next generation sequencing</title>
<p>For confirmation of single-copy O-MAP labeling, loop anchor-biotinylated pellets of 10-20 million cells were removed from −80°C to thaw at room temperature. Each cell pellet was resuspended in an SDS lysis buffer consisting of 1% SDS and 200 mM EPPS with protease inhibitors. The cell mixture was sonicated at 4°C using a Covaris LE-220 focused ultrasonicator with the following protocol: 300W peak incident power, 15% duty factor, 200 cycles per burst, with a treatment time of 20-30 minutes in 130-μl microTUBEs with AFA fiber (Covaris 520077). After the samples had returned to room temperature, the sheared fixed chromatin was transferred to fresh 1.5-ml Protein Lo-Bind tubes and centrifuged at 21130 G for 10 minutes to pellet cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred to a new set of tubes. The cleared chromatin samples were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher 23225). Next, 50 μl of sheared chromatin was sampled for reverse crosslinking, DNA extraction, and gel electrophoresis to verify that a significant amount of DNA had been sheared to &lt;700 base pairs. A sample of 10 μg sheared chromatin was reserved and stored at −20°C as immunoprecipitation input. 200 μg of chromatin was used to couple with 200 μg of streptavidin beads for one hour in a Protein Lo-Bind tube at room temperature with nutation. The coupled beads were collected and separated from the flow-through using a magnetic rack. After the flow-through was removed, the beads underwent the following washes:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>2% SDS with 20 mM EPPS</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>2% SDS with 20 mM EPPS</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>High Salt Buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM of HEPES pH7.5, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% TritonX-100</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>LiCl Buffer containing 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 0.5% of IGEPAL CA-630</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>TE Buffer with 10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>TE Buffer with 10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA</p></list-item>
</list>
The washes were performed as follows: briefly spin and immobilize the beads on a magnetic rack, pipette out the supernatant as much as possible, resuspend the beads in 0.8 ml of wash buffer, and incubate for 5 minutes with nutation. The washed beads were resuspended in 300 ul of reverse crosslinking buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 1 mM EDTA. Both the eluate beads and the input chromatin were incubated at 65°C for 16 hours for reverse crosslinking. The next day, 4 ul of 20 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche 3115836001) was added to the eluates and inputs and incubated at 50°C for 2 hours to cleave away proteins. The DNA was isolated from the mixture using phenol chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Before sequencing library generation, the precipitated DNA was further purified using SPRI beads. The purified DNA was used to generate next-generation sequencing libraries using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB E7645S) and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina Index Primers Set 1 and 3 (NEB E7335S, E7710S) and PCR-amplified for 15 cycles. The sequencing libraries were quantified using the Qubit 4 fluorometer and library sizes were quantified using the D1000 ScreenTape assay (Agilent 5067-5582) on the TapeStation 4200 automated electrophoresis platform.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe a method to probe both the proteins associated with genomic elements in cells, as well as 3D contacts between sites in chromatin. The approach is interesting and promising, and it is great to see a proximity labeling method like this that can make both proteins and 3D contacts. It utilizes DNA oligomers, which will likely make it a widely adopted method. However, the manuscript over-interprets its successes, which are likely due to the limited appropriate controls, and of any validation experiments. I think the study requires better proteomic controls, and some validation experiments of the &quot;new&quot; proteins and 3D contacts described. In addition, toning down the claims made in the paper would assist those looking to implement one of the various available proximity labeling methods and would make this manuscript more reliable to non-experts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The mapping of 3D contacts for 20 kb regions using proximity labeling is beautiful.</p>
<p>(2) The use of in situ hybridization will probably improve background and specificity.</p>
<p>(3) The use of fixed cells should prove enabling and is a strong alternative to similar, living cell methods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A major drawback to the experimental approach of this study is the &quot;multiplexed comparisons&quot;. Using the mtDNA as a comparator is not a great comparison - there is no reason to think the telomeres/centrosomes would look like mtDNA as a whole. The mito proteome is much less complex. It is going to provide a large number of false positives. The centromere/telomere comparison is ok, if one is interested in what's different between those two repetitive elements. But the more realistic use case of this method would be &quot;what is at a specific genomic element&quot;? A purely nuclear-localized control would be needed for that. Or a genomic element that has nothing interesting at it (I do not know of one). You can see this in the label-free work: non-specific, nuclear GO terms are enriched likely due to the random plus non-random labeling in the nucleus. What would a Telo vs general nucleus GSEA look like? (GSEA should be used for quantitative data, no GO). That would provide some specificity. Figures 2G and S4A are encouraging, but a) these proteins are largely sequestered in their respective locations, and b) no validation by an orthogonal method like ChIP or Cut and Run/Tag is used.</p>
<p>You can also see this in the enormous number of &quot;enriched&quot; proteins in the supplemental volcano plots. The hypothesis-supporting ones are labeled, but do the authors really believe all of those proteins are specific to the loci being looked at? Maybe compared to mitochondria, but it's hard to believe there are not a lot of false positives in those blue clouds. I believe the authors are more seeing mito vs nucleus + Telo than the stated comparison. For example, if you have no labeling in the nucleus in the control (Figures 1C and 2C) you cannot separate background labeling from specific labeling. Same with mito vs. nuc+Telo. It is not the proper control to say what is specifically at the Telo.</p>
<p>I would like to see a Telo vs nuclear control and a Centromere vs nuc control. One could then subtract the background from both experiments, then contrast Telo vs Cent for a proper, rigorous comparison. However, I realize that is a lot of work, so rewriting the manuscript to better and more accurately reflect what was accomplished here, and its limitations, would suffice.</p>
<p>(2) A second major drawback is the lack of validation experiments. References to literature are helpful but do not make up for the lack of validation of a new method claiming new protein-DNA or DNA-DNA interactions. At least a handful of newly described proximal proteins need to be validated by an orthogonal method, like ChIP qPCR, other genomic methods, or gel shifts if they are likely to directly bind DNA. It is ok to have false positives in a challenging assay like this. But it needs to be well and clearly estimated and communicated.</p>
<p>(3) The mapping of 3D contacts for 20 kb regions is beautiful. Some added discussion on this method's benefits over HiC-variants would be welcomed.</p>
<p>(4) The study claims this method circumvents the need for transfectable cells. However, the authors go on to describe how they needed tons of cells, now in solution, to get it to work. The intro should be more in line with what was actually accomplished.</p>
<p>(5) Comments like &quot;Compared to other repetitive elements in the human genome....&quot; appear to circumvent the fact that this method is still (apparently) largely limited to repetitive elements. Other than Glopro, which did analyze non-repetitive promoter elements, most comparable methods looked at telomeres. So, this isn't quite the advancement you are implying. Plus, the overlap with telomeric proteins and other studies should be addressed. However, that will be challenging due to the controls used here, discussed above.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Liu and MacGann et al. introduce the method DNA O-MAP that uses oligo-based ISH probes to recruit horseradish peroxidase for targeted proximity biotinylation at specific DNA loci. The method's specificity was tested by profiling the proteomic composition at repetitive DNA loci such as telomeres and pericentromeric alpha satellite repeats. In addition, the authors provide proof-of-principle for the capture and mapping of contact frequencies between individual DNA loop anchors.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>Identifying locus-specific proteomes still represents a major technical challenge and remains an outstanding issue (1). Theoretically, this method could benefit from the specificity of ISH probes and be applied to identify proteomes at non-repetitive DNA loci. This method also requires significantly fewer cells than other ISH- or dCas9-based locus-enrichment methods. Another potential advantage to be tested is the lack of cell line engineering that allows its application to primary cell lines or tissue.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The authors indicate that DNA O-MAP is superior to other methods for identifying locus-specific proteomes. Still, no proof exists that this method could uncover proteomes at non-repetitive DNA loci. Also, there is very little validation of novel factors to confirm the superiority of the technique regarding specificity.</p>
<p>
The authors first tested their method's specificity at repetitive telomeric regions, and like other approaches, expected low-abundant telomere-specific proteins were absent (for example, all subunits of the telomerase holoenzyme complex). Detecting known proteins while identifying noncanonical and unexpected protein factors with high confidence could indicate that DNA O-MAP does not fully capture biologically crucial proteins due to insufficient enrichment of locus-specific factors. The newly identified proteins in Figure 1E might still be relevant, but independent validation is missing entirely. In my opinion, the current data cannot be interpreted as successfully describing local protein composition.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors could have discussed the limitations of DNA O-MAP and made a fair comparison to other existing methods (2-5). Unlike targeted proximity biotinylation methods, DNA O-MAP requires paraformaldehyde crosslinking, which has several disadvantages. For instance, transient protein-protein interactions may not be efficiently retained on crosslinked chromatin. Similarly, some proteins may not be crosslinked by formaldehyde and thus will be lost during preparation (6).</p>

<p>Significance of the Findings:</p>
<p>The study by Liu et al. presents a novel method, DNA-O-MAP, which combines locus-specific hybridisation with proximity biotinylation to isolate specific genomic regions and their associated proteins. The potential significance of this approach lies in its purported ability to target genomic loci with heightened specificity by enabling extensive washing prior to the biotinylation reaction, theoretically improving the signal-to-noise ratio when compared with other methods such as dCas9-based techniques. Should the method prove successful, it could represent a notable advancement in the field of chromatin biology, particularly in establishing the proteomes of individual chromatin regions - an extremely challenging objective that has not yet been comprehensively addressed by existing methodologies.</p>
<p>Strength of the Evidence:</p>
<p>The evidence presented by the authors is somewhat mixed, and the robustness of the findings appears to be preliminary at this stage. While certain data indicate that DNA-O-MAP may function effectively for repetitive DNA regions, a number of the claims made in the manuscript are either unsupported or require further substantiation. There are significant concerns about the resolution of the method, with substantial biotinylation signals extending well beyond the intended target regions (megabases around the target), suggesting a lack of specificity and poor resolution, particularly for smaller loci. Furthermore, comparisons with previous techniques are unfounded since the authors have not provided direct comparisons with the same mass spectrometry (MS) equipment and protocols. Additionally, although the authors assert an advantage in multiplexing, this claim appears overstated, as previous methods could achieve similar outcomes through TMT multiplexing. Therefore, while the method has potential, the evidence requires more rigorous support, comprehensive benchmarking, and further experimental validation to demonstrate the claimed improvements in specificity and practical applicability.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe a method to probe both the proteins associated with genomic elements in cells, as well as 3D contacts between sites in chromatin. The approach is interesting and promising, and it is great to see a proximity labeling method like this that can make both proteins and 3D contacts. It utilizes DNA oligomers, which will likely make it a widely adopted method. However, the manuscript over-interprets its successes, which are likely due to the limited appropriate controls, and of any validation experiments. I think the study requires better proteomic controls, and some validation experiments of the &quot;new&quot; proteins and 3D contacts described. In addition, toning down the claims made in the paper would assist those looking to implement one of the various available proximity labeling methods and would make this manuscript more reliable to non-experts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The mapping of 3D contacts for 20 kb regions using proximity labeling is beautiful.</p>
<p>(2) The use of in situ hybridization will probably improve background and specificity.</p>
<p>(3) The use of fixed cells should prove enabling and is a strong alternative to similar, living cell methods.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) A major drawback to the experimental approach of this study is the &quot;multiplexed comparisons&quot;. Using the mtDNA as a comparator is not a great comparison - there is no reason to think the telomeres/centrosomes would look like mtDNA as a whole. The mito proteome is much less complex. It is going to provide a large number of false positives. The centromere/telomere comparison is ok, if one is interested in what's different between those two repetitive elements. But the more realistic use case of this method would be &quot;what is at a specific genomic element&quot;? A purely nuclear-localized control would be needed for that. Or a genomic element that has nothing interesting at it (I do not know of one). You can see this in the label-free work: non-specific, nuclear GO terms are enriched likely due to the random plus non-random labeling in the nucleus. What would a Telo vs general nucleus GSEA look like? (GSEA should be used for quantitative data, no GO). That would provide some specificity. Figures 2G and S4A are encouraging, but a) these proteins are largely sequestered in their respective locations, and b) no validation by an orthogonal method like ChIP or Cut and Run/Tag is used.</p>
<p>You can also see this in the enormous number of &quot;enriched&quot; proteins in the supplemental volcano plots. The hypothesis-supporting ones are labeled, but do the authors really believe all of those proteins are specific to the loci being looked at? Maybe compared to mitochondria, but it's hard to believe there are not a lot of false positives in those blue clouds. I believe the authors are more seeing mito vs nucleus + Telo than the stated comparison. For example, if you have no labeling in the nucleus in the control (Figures 1C and 2C) you cannot separate background labeling from specific labeling. Same with mito vs. nuc+Telo. It is not the proper control to say what is specifically at the Telo.</p>
<p>I would like to see a Telo vs nuclear control and a Centromere vs nuc control. One could then subtract the background from both experiments, then contrast Telo vs Cent for a proper, rigorous comparison. However, I realize that is a lot of work, so rewriting the manuscript to better and more accurately reflect what was accomplished here, and its limitations, would suffice.</p>
<p>(2) A second major drawback is the lack of validation experiments. References to literature are helpful but do not make up for the lack of validation of a new method claiming new protein-DNA or DNA-DNA interactions. At least a handful of newly described proximal proteins need to be validated by an orthogonal method, like ChIP qPCR, other genomic methods, or gel shifts if they are likely to directly bind DNA. It is ok to have false positives in a challenging assay like this. But it needs to be well and clearly estimated and communicated.</p>
<p>(3) The mapping of 3D contacts for 20 kb regions is beautiful. Some added discussion on this method's benefits over HiC-variants would be welcomed.</p>
<p>(4) The study claims this method circumvents the need for transfectable cells. However, the authors go on to describe how they needed tons of cells, now in solution, to get it to work. The intro should be more in line with what was actually accomplished.</p>
<p>(5) Comments like &quot;Compared to other repetitive elements in the human genome....&quot; appear to circumvent the fact that this method is still (apparently) largely limited to repetitive elements. Other than Glopro, which did analyze non-repetitive promoter elements, most comparable methods looked at telomeres. So, this isn't quite the advancement you are implying. Plus, the overlap with telomeric proteins and other studies should be addressed. However, that will be challenging due to the controls used here, discussed above.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Liu and MacGann et al. introduce the method DNA O-MAP that uses oligo-based ISH probes to recruit horseradish peroxidase for targeted proximity biotinylation at specific DNA loci. The method's specificity was tested by profiling the proteomic composition at repetitive DNA loci such as telomeres and pericentromeric alpha satellite repeats. In addition, the authors provide proof-of-principle for the capture and mapping of contact frequencies between individual DNA loop anchors.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>Identifying locus-specific proteomes still represents a major technical challenge and remains an outstanding issue (1). Theoretically, this method could benefit from the specificity of ISH probes and be applied to identify proteomes at non-repetitive DNA loci. This method also requires significantly fewer cells than other ISH- or dCas9-based locus-enrichment methods. Another potential advantage to be tested is the lack of cell line engineering that allows its application to primary cell lines or tissue.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The authors indicate that DNA O-MAP is superior to other methods for identifying locus-specific proteomes. Still, no proof exists that this method could uncover proteomes at non-repetitive DNA loci. Also, there is very little validation of novel factors to confirm the superiority of the technique regarding specificity.</p>
<p>The authors first tested their method's specificity at repetitive telomeric regions, and like other approaches, expected low-abundant telomere-specific proteins were absent (for example, all subunits of the telomerase holoenzyme complex). Detecting known proteins while identifying noncanonical and unexpected protein factors with high confidence could indicate that DNA O-MAP does not fully capture biologically crucial proteins due to insufficient enrichment of locus-specific factors. The newly identified proteins in Figure 1E might still be relevant, but independent validation is missing entirely. In my opinion, the current data cannot be interpreted as successfully describing local protein composition.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors could have discussed the limitations of DNA O-MAP and made a fair comparison to other existing methods (2-5). Unlike targeted proximity biotinylation methods, DNA O-MAP requires paraformaldehyde crosslinking, which has several disadvantages. For instance, transient protein-protein interactions may not be efficiently retained on crosslinked chromatin. Similarly, some proteins may not be crosslinked by formaldehyde and thus will be lost during preparation (6).</p>
