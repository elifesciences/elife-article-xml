<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Numerous studies have identified travelling waves in the cortex and suggested they play important roles in brain processing. These waves are most often measured using macroscopic methods that are unable to assess the local spiking activity underlying wave dynamics. Here we investigated the possibility that waves may not be travelling at the single neuron scale. We first show that sequentially activating two discrete brain areas can appear as travelling waves in EEG simulations. We next reproduce these results using an analytical model of two sequentially activated regions. Using this model, we were able to generate wave-like activity with variable directions, velocities, and spatial patterns, and to map the discriminability limits between travelling waves and modular sequential activations. Finally, we investigated the link between field potentials and single neuron excitability using large-scale measurements from turtle cortex ex-vivo. We found that while field potentials exhibit wave-like dynamics, the underlying spiking activity was better described by consecutively activated spatially adjacent groups of neurons. Taken together, this study suggests caution when interpreting phase delay measurements as continuously propagating wavefronts in two different spatial scales. A careful distinction between modular and wave excitability profiles across scales will be critical for understanding the nature of cortical computations.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Below we list the revisions we made in the manuscript following peer review:
1. We reformatted the manuscript according to eLife guidelines and introduced minor textual corrections.
2. To emphasize the experimental results, we switched between the analytical results and the experimental results. Correspondingly, figure 2 now illustrates the more intriguing experimental results and figure 3 the analytical results. In addition, we added subtitles to the different sections of the results to ease the navigation through the paper and to enable the readers to access the different sections more easily.
3.In the revised manuscript we added the reviewers comment about stochasticity, and we discuss its possible origins: The transition was also not clear when examining spiking responses in some of the trials (as indicated by high DIP scores, Figure 2K). However, the observation that temporal grouping became more pronounced when using ALSA (a more robust estimate of local excitability) (Figure 2L,N), suggests that high DIP values may result from variability in the spike times of single neurons, and not necessarily from the lack of modular activation. Such issues can be resolved by denser sampling of spiking activity in the tissue.
4. We added a sentence explaining the relevance of our preparation.
5. We agree with the reviewer that macroscopic waves could be composed of smaller modules (or single neurons at the smallest scale). Our results suggest that modular patterns can be classified as wave patterns both at large scales (of brain areas) and smaller scales of local neural circuits. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to make this distinction across different scales. We sharpened this point in the first paragraph of the discussion.
6. Following the referees suggestion, to ease the reading of the methods, we moved the mathematical derivation and related equations to appendix 1.
7. Following the reviewers suggestion we discuss the idea that synaptic potentials could spread like waves, but spikes more in a modular fashion. In addition, to emphasize our discussion on synaptic potentials, we reorganized the paragraphs in the discussion to separate between our discussion on sub-threshold excitability (which is mostly synaptic) and supra-threshold excitability which is the focus of the second part of the discussion.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cortical traveling waves are considered a ubiquitous feature of cortical dynamics and are suggested to play important roles in cortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). These waves are observed across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and exhibit a wide repertoire of propagation patterns. Travelling waves can propagate to specific directions (plane wave) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Senseman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Xu et al., 2007</xref>), outwards from a center locus (radial waves) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Muller et al., 2014</xref>) or rotate around a phase singularity (spiral waves) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Muller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>). Waves also range in their spatial extend from mesoscale waves spanning a single cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ferezou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jancke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Reimer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Xu et al., 2007</xref>), to macroscale waves propagating through multiple brain areas and even across the two hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alexander et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Goldman et al., 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Muller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Patten et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, cortical waves are characterized by different propagation velocities (from millimeters to meters per second) and frequency bands. For example, <italic>Î±</italic>-band oscillations (8-12Hz) travel from occipital to frontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hughes, 1995</xref>); band (30-80Hz) auditory induced oscillations travel from anterior-to-posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Ribary et al., 1991</xref>); and slow wave oscillations (0.1-1Hz), occurring during sleep, travel from anterior to posterior cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is unclear how the abundance of travelling waves across large areas of cortex fits its modular structural and functional organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meunier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Sporns and Betzel, 2016</xref>). Tangential cortical connectivity is not uniform. It is higher within cortical areas (e.g., V1) or regions (e.g., visual cortex) then between areas (V1 and V2 or visual cortex and auditory cortex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hilgetag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Markov et al., 2011</xref>). This modularity is observed across multiple scales. Within single cortical areas, neurons are segmented into columns with high intra-column connectivity and sparser inter-column connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>). Such non-uniform connectivity is likely to restrict the spread of activity rather than to support smooth propagation of waves across the cortical sheet during which action potentials are sequentially activated in neurons as the wavefront passes. Indeed, it was suggested that one of the roles of modularity is to segregate circuits and computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shein-Idelson et al., 2016</xref>) and prevent uncontrolled spread of excitability, as is evident in pathological conditions such as epileptic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Martinet et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding in which scenarios travelling waves ignore cortical modularity requires defining the spatial granularity with which waves are examined and performing experimental measurements with the corresponding resolution. For example, determining whether a travelling wave entails a spreading excitation at the single neuron level requires single cell resolution measurements. In contrast, travelling waves are commonly measured with low spatial resolution technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hindriks et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mak-McCully et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Muller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Ribary et al., 1991</xref>). This is especially true for extracranial recording such as EEG in which brain current sources are distant from the measurement electrodes and separated by diffracting elements such as the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Michel and Murray, 2012</xref>). Even in more local intracranial measurements such as Electrocorticography (ECoG), volume conduction through low impedance media, such as the cerebro-spinal fluid, may result in substantial contribution of distant areas to local measurements and effective spatial lowpass filtering that blur out possible spatially segregated activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">BuzsÃ¡ki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herreras, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>). Imaging waves with more local reporters of excitability such as voltage sensitive dye (VSD) reduces the limitations imposed by large electrodes. While the spatial resolution of this method is higher, VSD measurements mostly reflect subthreshold potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chemla and Chavane, 2010a</xref>) with strong contribution from upper layers and long-range inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chemla and Chavane, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Stepanyants et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, VSDs integrate inputs from both local and distant spiking activities rather than represent local spiking excitability profiles. In addition, VSD signals may be contaminated by contribution from non-neuronal sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">PÃ¡l et al., 2015</xref>). For example, the velocities of some travelling waves correspond to axonal propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>). However, such axonal propagations do not necessarily activate the neurons in the target tissue and single cell excitability may remain modular. While in specific cases the existence of travelling waves in single cells was measured in high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Voufo et al., 2023</xref>), this existence cannot be unambiguously generalized to all reported travelling waves, especially given the large diversity of reported wave patterns across different brain areas.</p>
<p>In addition to the lack of understanding of the nature of excitability underlying waves, previous studies raised the possibility that measured propagating patterns may be biased by the limitations of experimental technique used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Muller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2023</xref>). For example, when considering a scenario in which the intensity of a stationary source with a spatially decaying profile increases over time. In this scenario, additional regions cross the detection threshold at progressively longer times and may result in a false measurement of a propagating wave. To address this caveat, Muller et al introduced the Phase Latency Map (PLMs) allowing them to discriminate between a stationary bump and a travelling wave and to conclude that propagating waves were measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Muller et al., 2014</xref>). While PLMs address this specific caveat, measured travelling wave-like patterns (WLPs), that are not underlined by spatially continuous propagation, can be found in additional scenarios. For example, it was recently shown that a mixture of stationary sources can result in WLPs in EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2023</xref>). Similarly, current source density reveals WLPs following sequential activation of different cortical lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Orczyk et al., 2021</xref>). These studies raise important concerns about the propagation profiles in some systems. Despite these concerns, the criteria for differentiating WLPs from travelling waves remains unknown. Further, evidence for the existence of WLPs on the single neuron level is missing. Thus, we lack a classification of different identified travelling waves in terms of their underlying microscale excitability patterns.</p>
<p>Here, we use large-scale spiking measurements and simulations to examine the possibility that sequential activation of adjacent modules can be falsely identified as a travelling wave. Specifically, we first illustrate, using EEG simulations, that sequentially activating two adjacent cortical areas results in phase latency profiles resembling travelling waves. To link single neurons activation profiles with field potentials, we utilize the ex-vivo eye-brain preparation of turtle cortex in which travelling waves have been previously reported in response to visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Senseman and Robbins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shein-Idelson et al., 2017a</xref>). Using dense multi electrode array (MEA) recordings, we compare local spiking activity with local field potentials (LFP) over several mm<sup>2</sup> of cortex. We show that while low frequency oscillations in LFP appear to propagate as a smooth travelling wave, the underlying spiking activity is better described by a sequential activation of separate cortical populations. Finally, using an analytical model, we map the conditions for identifying sequential stationary activations as traveling waves and describe the high diversity of resulting WLPs.</p>

<title>Sequential activation of two discrete brain areas appears as travelling waves in simulated EEG phase latency maps</title>
<p>Travelling waves are commonly reported in EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>) but the cortical activations profiles underlying these waves remain unclear. We used simulations to test if sequential but spatially stationary activations can appear as travelling waves in EEG recordings. Specifically, we simulated the sequential activation (with time delay of ÎT) of two separate cortical areas in the parietal lobe (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and calculated the scalp EEG signals emanating from these activations using a forward model implemented in âbrainstormâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tadel et al., 2011</xref>) (Methods). We modeled signal sources in each area as a set of randomly distributed and periodically activated dipoles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We first calculated the phase latency of the EEG signals across electrodes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a continuous range of delays gradually increasing along the anterior-posterior axis. Thus, phase delays did not reflect the modular construction of two spatially restricted sources. Rather, continuous propagation was observed for both large (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) or small sources (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). A standard approach for quantifying the existence of travelling waves is computing phase latency-distance correlation (PLDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Muller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) which is the linear correlation between a defined phase crossing time (e.g., peak time) and the spatial location along the waveâs trajectory. Applying this calculation to the data in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> along the posterior-anterior axis resulted in a value of 0.98, indicative of wave propagation. We next examined if such wave-like patterns (WLPs) are also detected if the distance between areas or the time delay between activations changes. Repeating the simulations for a range of distances and delays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) revealed high PLDC values in all distances which only slowly decay with time delay. Furthermore, filtering the measured EEG signals with a narrow band filter (a common practice when analyzing specific oscillatory bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wu et al., 2008</xref>)) further increased PLDC (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). These results suggest that detection of WLPs following sequential activation of spatially localized modules is abundant across parameters.</p>

<title>Wave-like patterns in LFP are underlined by sequential activation of spatially discrete neuronal populations in multi-electrode array recordings from turtle cortex</title>
<p>Our next aim was to examine whether WLPs exist in cortical tissue. To do this, one needs a system with identified travelling waves across cortex, in which one can measure the microscopic tissue supra-threshold excitability, i.e., spikes. To achieve such measurements, we utilized the ex-vivo eye-brain turtle preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shein-Idelson et al., 2017a</xref>). In this preparation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), the whole brain with the eye attached is extracted, and the dorsal cortex - a three layered homolog of the mammalian cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tosches et al., 2018</xref>) - is flattened onto a multi electrode array (MEA). The advantage of this preparation is that it allows large-scale two-dimensional (in directions tangential to the cortical surface) sampling of both spiking and LFP activity. Furthermore, previous works with this preparation have shown the existence of waves that travel across cortex following visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Senseman and Robbins, 2002</xref>). Finally, while the layered organization of turtle cortex is different than that of mammalian cortex, the basic excitability features of both tissues are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Connors and Kriegstein, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hemberger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kriegstein and Connors, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Larkum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Shein-Idelson et al., 2017b</xref>), and substantial differences in the manner by which field potentials and spikes spread through the tissue are not to be expected.</p>

<p>Corresponding with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Prechtl et al., 2000</xref>), visual stimulation elicited increases in LFPs and spikes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> â gray and black traces respectively) across large regions of the visual cortex. Although responses varied in intensity between stimulations, they typically started â¼200ms post-stimulus and lasted for â¼2 seconds. Spectral analysis revealed that responses were characterized by high power at low frequencies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Specifically, applying a 2Hz low-pass filter captured the strong fluctuations in LFP following visual stimulations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> â blue trace). We next set to examine how this low frequency band propagates across cortex. Averaging over all trials revealed a clear propagation pattern travelling from anterolateral to posteromedial (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). This pattern was consistent with previous reports of waves travelling from area D2 to area D1 in turtle cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>). To illustrate this propagation on the time domain, we plotted the first oscillation cycle of the filtered LFP (2Hz lowpass, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> â red and blue dotted line) along a linear wave path (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The maximum showed a clear propagation pattern with a velocity of 1.8Â±0.35mm/s (meanÂ±std).</p>
<p>To quantitatively estimate the propagation trajectories during single oscillations cycles, we used the analytic signal of the Hilbert transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">le Van Quyen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Muller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Rubino et al., 2006</xref>) (Methods). We first identified the Ï/2 phase crossing times of all oscillation cycles. We then grouped phase crossings into events belonging to single oscillation cycles based on continuity of phases across space and time (Methods, <xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 1</xref>). The first oscillation cycle showed a clear propagating wavefront, but more importantly, intense spiking activity. We therefore focused our analysis on this cycle and calculated its propagation direction. To do so, we defined the wave center path, as the weighted spatial center of mass of all the channelsâ phase crossings for a given time point with weights given by the amplitude of the Hilbert envelope (Methods). Examining phase delays and the wave center path for a single trial (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2I</xref>) revealed a pattern that resembled the averaged propagation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) but varied between trials (<xref rid="fig2S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 2</xref>). We next calculated the PLDC values for the first oscillation cycle in response to visual stimulation across all trials and plotted their distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>-blue). PLDC values were close to 1 suggesting the existence of propagating waves. For comparison, calculating PLDC after shuffling the channelsâ phase latencies dramatically reduced PLDC to an average close to zero (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>-red).</p>
<p>To examine whether local spike dynamics propagated continuously across space as the LFP, we examined the timing of the first spikes (marking the onset of excitability) during the first oscillation cycle of the filtered LFP. Spikes were generally locked to the LFP oscillation with a peak spiking rate at a phase of 0.53Ï (<xref rid="fig2S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 3A</xref>). To compare the spatiotemporal spiking patterns with the LFP patterns, we reordered the electrodes according to the Ï/2 Hilbert phase. As expected, phase gradually advanced across electrodes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> â empty colored circles). In contrast, spiking activity was not continuous over space but clustered in discrete temporal bouts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> â black dots). To quantify this clustering in spike times, we assigned the neurons to channels according to their maximal amplitude channel and used the DIP-test to quantify temporal statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hartigan and Hartigan, 2007</xref>). The DIP-test measures the deviation of a distribution from unimodality and could well capture the differences in spike and LFP onsets. The LFP phase crossings were temporally continuous and therefore did not strongly deviate from a uniform distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> -top, p-value 0.85). In contrast, spike timings were segregated into temporal groups and were not unimodally distributed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> â bottom, p-value &lt; 0.0002). We applied this test on the first oscillation cycles across trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Since not all channels had active spikes in all trials, we ran the DIP test (for both spikes and LFP) only on the subset of channels with spikes within each trial. The results showed a consistently larger DIP for spikes vs. LFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref> â red vs blue areas). This difference was not only significant on the average level but was also evident when comparing the P-value of pairwise differences calculated for each trial separately (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref> â grey area). Finally, repeating this analysis for recordings in other animals reveal consistent results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>), indicating that while LFP activity along the wave path resembles a continuously propagating wave, the spiking activity â a marker of local excitability - is more consistent with sequentially-activated spatially-segregated modules.</p>
<p>The above analysis was limited to the subset of channels with spikes within the first cycle in every trial. To examine propagation wavefronts across a larger fraction of channels, we constructed a more robust estimate of local spiking excitability. Specifically, we calculated the Average Local Spiking Activity (ALSA), which is the weighted average of each channelâs spiking rate with its nearest neighborsâ spiking rates (Methods). The spiking onset time for each channel was defined as the time of the first maximum of the ALSA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>-red curve, 3G-red dots). Since many neurons did not exhibit spiking activity during the wave onset (e.g., <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> illustrates how for some channels, the first spikes in a cycle occur long after the activation has reached nearby channels), this measure allows estimating the wavefront propagation across many channels. Correspondingly, the ALSA phase distribution resembled that obtained with single spikes but was more sharply locked to the LFP oscillation phase (<xref rid="fig2S3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 3B</xref>). Comparing ALSA with LFP revealed stronger differences between spikes and LFP. In contrast to the LFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref rid="fig2S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 4A-C</xref>), the ALSA onset times did not evolve continuously across space but were organized in two separate and sequentially activated spatial groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref rid="fig2S4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 4D-F</xref>). Comparing the DIP test for LFP and ALSA revealed a consistent difference across trials in both the average DIP values as well as the difference in single trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>) that replicated over experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>). We note that we focused the above analysis on waves in the low frequency LFP band (0-2Hz) because these events recruited enough spikes to analyze their phase relations. However, propagating patterns were also detected in other frequency bands (<xref rid="fig2S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 5</xref>) and showed complex patterns including plane waves, radial waves and spiral waves.</p>

<title>A simple analytic model of sequentially activated Gaussians exhibits diverse wave-like patterns</title>
<p>We wanted to examine whether we can capture the basic activity properties following the sequential activation of two discrete regions, using a simple analytical model. We assumed that the potential <italic>V(x,t)</italic> is the sum of two one-dimensional Gaussians centered at <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> (with standard deviation <italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>), each multiplied by a temporal Gaussian centered around <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub> (with standard deviation <italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>), respectively:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
In this model, the degree of signal spread (e.g. the electric field dispersion in EEG) can be modeled by changing the spatial Gaussian width, Ï<sub>x</sub>. The dynamics of these Gaussians for <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>-x</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub><italic>=Ï</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub><italic>=Ï</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub><italic>=1</italic> and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub><italic>=-1, t</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>=1</italic> is plotted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>. For these values, the two sequentially activated Gaussians are characterized by a WLP whose peak moves from point <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub><italic>=-0</italic>.<italic>5 to x</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>=0</italic>.<italic>5</italic>. Importantly, this moving peak is always concave (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>-yellow curve). As the distance between Gaussians <italic>(Îx=x</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic>-x</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub><italic>)</italic> increases, this WLPs will look more like two discrete events and for large enough distances the peak will be replaced by a minimum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> â blue curve), spatially separating the two Gaussians (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> â video 1). To calculate the condition distinguishing between these two scenarios, we calculated the position of the propagating peak by equating the spatial derivative of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref> to zero (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> â black line, Appendix 1). The concavity of the propagation profile can be determined by calculating the sign of the second spatial derivative at x=0 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. For <italic>Îx&lt;2Ï</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, this sign in negative (Appendix 1) indicating that V(x) has a concave propagating peak which does not allow identifying two Gaussian peaks. This result is consistent with calculated PLDC values which are very high for <italic>Îx&lt;2Ï</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Even for <italic>Îx&gt;2Ï</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, when <italic>V(x)</italic> has a convex center point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>-blue trace), PLDC values remain high suggesting that the values of PLDC may not be a good metric for detecting waves under these conditions. Temporal considerations can also be important for understanding the propagating maximumâs dynamics. Calculating the peak dynamics at x=0 at times surrounding <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> shows that as long as the Gaussians are sequentially activated within a time frame of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> the maximum has a single temporal peak (Appendix 1).</p>

<p>Given the wide range of travelling wave velocities in the literature, we calculated the velocity of WLPsâ peak, <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, and examined how it varies with model parameters under the condition of <italic>Îx&lt;2Ï</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (Appendix 1). This derivation reveals that the velocity is maximal at <italic>x=0</italic>, and at that point can be described by the following equation (Appendix 1):
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
At small distances <italic>Îx&lt;&lt;Ï</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, the velocity linearly grows with distance between gaussians (<italic>Îx</italic>). Interestingly, as <italic>Îx</italic> grows towards the value 2Ï<sub>x,</sub> propagation velocity sharply increases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, when the temporal overlap between the two Gaussians increases (<italic>Ît</italic> decreases or <italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> increases), the velocity decreases with a stronger contribution of <italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. Thus, propagation velocity can vary depending on the distances between activated areas, their standard deviation and the activation delay.</p>
<p>Travelling waves are often reported as propagating phase delays when tissue excitability is oscillatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). We therefore examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of two Gaussians with a temporal periodic activation profile with frequency f and phase delay Ï between sources:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Similarly to the temporal Gaussian model, the periodic model exhibits a WLP with a travelling maximum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Calculating the propagation velocity of the waveâs peak (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> â black line) results in the following relation (Appendix 1):
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
This equation reveals two interesting properties: First, the sign of the peakâs velocity, <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, depends on the phase difference between the two Gaussians (ÎÏ=Ï<sub>2</sub>-Ï<sub>1</sub>). Thus, the peak can travel either forward or backward following small changes in phase delays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Second, the position of the peak (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>), and therefore the propagation speed (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref>), increases with the oscillation frequency.</p>
<p>The spatial activation spread (<italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) of a cortical module can result from the measurement techniques (due to passive conductance) but also from the spatial organization of inputs and outputs patterns and their associated synaptic currents. We hypothesized that changing these patterns can produce different phase latency maps. We therefore extended the periodic model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Equation 3</xref> to two dimensions (Appendix 1) and to Gaussians with different shapes (different covariance functions) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). When sequentially activated Gaussians had been placed one next to the other <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> their propagation patterns and phase latency map resembled a plane wave (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>-top). When Gaussians overlap spatially, with the first Gaussian having a smaller <italic>Ï</italic>, their sequential activation resembled a radial wave (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>-middle). Interestingly, calculating PLDC, which was developed to discriminate between a radial wave and a bump with increasing amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>), resulted in a value of 0.92, indicative of a travelling wave. Finally, by positioning two Gaussians with one longer axis such that their major axes are perpendicular to one another, a pattern with features of a spiral-like wave was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>-bottom). These examples illustrate that using a combination of only two sequentially activated Gaussians, a wide range of phase latency profiles corresponding to plane, radial and spiral-like waves could be generated. We note that while we used simple activation profiles, spatial modules in brains (e.g., cortical columns or spatially localized projection patterns) can be more diverse and potentially facilitate a large repertoire of phase latency patterns which, despite being seemingly discrete, might be classified as travelling waves.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we investigated the link between electrophysiological measurements of travelling waves and their underlying neuronal activations. To do so, we used common approaches for detecting travelling waves in neural data at different scales and contrasted these results with ground truth neural excitability. We showed that LFP measurements indicative of waves propagating across turtle cortex are underlined by discrete and consecutively activated neuronal populations, and not by a continuously propagating wavefront of spikes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Similarly, activation profiles that resemble continuous travelling waves in EEG simulations can be underlined by consecutive activation of two discrete cortical regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We replicated these results using an analytical model and demonstrated that a simple scenario of sequentially activated Gaussians can exhibit WLPs with a rich diversity of spatiotemporal profiles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Our results offer insight into the scenarios and conditions for WLP detection by identifying failure points that should be considered when identifying travelling waves and therefore suggest caution when interpreting continuous phase latency maps as microscopically propagating wave patterns. Such failure points may exist both when examining activity at the scale of brain regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and smaller neural circuits (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that the discrepancy between modular and wave activation should be examined across spatial scales. Specifically, it is not necessarily the case that at the fine grained (single neuron) scale activation patterns are modular, but, following coarse graining, smooth wave patterns emerge. Rather, modular activation may hierarchically exist across scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meunier et al., 2010</xref>) and may be masked by smeared spatial supra-threshold excitability boundaries. Below we discuss these limitations across techniques and their implications.</p>
<p>Our analytical results suggest that the main parameter affecting the detection of WLPs in a sequentially activated modular system is the distance between modules relative to their spatial spread. In contrast to the distance between modules, the spatial spread can be strongly affected by the experimental approach used for measurements. For potential-based measurements, the spread will markedly increase with medium conductance and distance from the source, as predicted from the volume conductance theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">BuzsÃ¡ki et al., 2012</xref>). Our simulations show that spatial spread will be large in EEG measurements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) where the distance between the sources and the electrodes is large, and the skull and meninges disperse the electrical field generated by localized cortical currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Akalin Acar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>). Dispersion can also be substantial in intracranial measurements such as ECoG due to the high conductivity of the cerebro-spinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">BuzsÃ¡ki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Herreras, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, large spread was also observed in our MEA LFP recordings, where no meninges separate between the electrodes and tissue. Further, the small distance between the tissue and the electrodes limits conductance through the artificial cerebro-spinal fluid. Despite this, propagation appeared spatially continuous in LFP, suggesting contributions from volume conduction through the tissue and non-local current sources, for example, activated synaptic terminals from axons of distant neurons. This spread is aligned with theoretical studies calculating spatial decay constants of hundreds of micrometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">LindÃ©n et al., 2010</xref>) and with experiments reporting contributions from sources millimeters away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Travelling waves were also measured using VSD imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Muller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Senseman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Slovin et al., 2002</xref>), a method that does not suffer from passive electric field spread as it measures transmembrane potentials. However, light scatters in optical signals, especially in wide field imaging. More importantly, VSD measurements report subthreshold potentials integrating excitability from large areas due to synaptic currents originating from long distance neurons in addition to local ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chemla and Chavane, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>). Correspondingly, deflection of a single whisker results in cortical activation that extends beyond the corresponding barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ferezou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Petersen et al., 2003</xref>). From measuring VSD alone, it is unclear which component of this extended signal reflects supra-threshold activation. If supra-threshold activity is mostly restricted to the barrel and the extended spread mostly reflects sub-threshold activity, sequentially activating two nearby whiskers will result in WLPs. Similarly, sequential activation of two areas in visual space can appear to elicit a wave in the visual cortex, as observed for anesthetized cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jancke et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Increased spatial spread and WLP may not only result from non-local measurement but also from data analysis. For EEG specifically, amplitudes are relatively small, and consequently waves are often reported using averaged data. In combination with the inherent variability in neuronal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fox et al., 2006</xref>), averaging may smooth the boundaries between modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mouraux and Iannetti, 2008</xref>), effectively increase the spatial spread and therefore promote the identification of WLPs. Such a spread may explain the smoother LFP profiles after averaging (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) relative to single trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G,I</xref>) in turtle cortex.</p>
<p>In addition to spatial factors, temporal factors and filtering may promote WLPs. Our analytical results suggest that a single maximum during dynamics will emerge when sequentially activated Gaussians considerably overlap in time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Thus, discriminability between Gaussian activations will decrease with increase in Ï<sub>t</sub>, for example, following filtering. Indeed, filtering into narrow frequency bands is a common practice in EEG research and is bound to smooth sharp transients. Correspondingly, our EEG simulations indicate that filtering markedly increased PLDC by effectively smoothing the activation boundaries between modules (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). We note that the detection of WLPs is not restricted to specific frequency bands; our simulation and analytic results are not band dependent. Our turtle data also contained waves in other bands (<xref rid="fig2S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 5</xref>). The low spike rates in our preparation prevented us from performing a significant statistical analysis to compare these waves with underlying spiking patterns. Such examinations will be critical for understanding the propagation patterns of spikes during waves across multiple frequency bands. To do so, spatial characterization of single trials dynamics, rather than calculating average spiking locking across space (Ray and Maunse ll, 2011), will be required.</p>
<p>Analysis techniques can potentially resolve the discrepancy between waves and modular activation for different levels of granularity. Phase latency maps and correlations are a valuable step towards differentiating between single stationary bumps and travelling waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Muller et al., 2014</xref>) and continues to be used to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2016</xref>). The underlying assumption of this approach is that a stationary bump is characterized by a flat latency map because every channel reaches its maximum at the same time, in contrast to increase in a particular direction, in case of a wave. However, this approach does not consider the possibility of sequentially activated local populations. Indeed, our results show how activity profiles resulting from two sequentially activated Gaussians meet the phase latency conditions for waves. Developing good methods for separating travelling waves from WLPs will require validating these methods using experimental paradigms providing information about spiking activity across space. In addition, more frequent usage of available techniques to decrease the spread of signals and increase localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Babiloni et al., 1996</xref>) will increase the separability between waves and modular activation.</p>
<p>Our results can explain some of the reported variability in travelling propagation directions and velocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>). We showed that the propagation direction of WLPs is determined by the location of sequentially activated modules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and the propagation speed of WLPs by the distance between modules and their temporal delay (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equation 2</xref>). In addition, when calculating propagation speeds for narrow-band signals, velocities increase with frequency band and may even reverse direction as a function of the phase lag between oscillatory areas (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3G-H</xref>). These results are interesting given that cortical waves in the same tissue can propagate both in forward and backwards directions and that higher frequencies propagate faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bahramisharif et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Halgren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Variability in propagation speed could also be detected when examining single oscillations in our turtle recordings (<xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 1</xref> vs <xref rid="fig2S5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 5C</xref>). The above results echo findings in a recent study showing that cortical responses to similar stimuli vary in propagation profile for EEG and MEG recordings and that this discrepancy can be accounted by modelling sequentially activated sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lozano-Soldevilla and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Variability in responses may also be explained by differences in propagation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). Several reports suggest that waves are underlined by propagation along axonal collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">2014</xref>). Both the transmembrane voltage-gated currents excited during action potentials as well as the post-synaptic currents along axonal boutons can potentially contribute to measured signals. However, such waves travel at high propagation speeds and are not compatible with the wide diversity of wave velocities and mechanisms of local neuronal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Feller et al., 1996</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that such axonal waves prime neuronal excitability by sub-threshold inputs that later result in modular supra-threshold activation. The ability to experimentally discriminate between axonal inputs and local spiking excitability (e.g. by reporters with different wavelengths) can potentially resolve such discrepancies.</p>
<p>Our turtle cortex results (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) exemplify how contrasting sub-threshold LFP measurements with supra-threshold spiking measurements can yield different conclusions about the nature of activity spread. Specifically, measuring spiking activity revealed the segregation of turtle cortex into modules. While modularity in turtle cortex connectivity structure was not systematically mapped, the temporal grouping of spike timings across two regions of turtle cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>) is spatially aligned with structural transition between areas D1 and D2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Desan, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Prechtl et al., 1997</xref>). This transition was not evident in the LFPs, possibly due to the longer decay constants of slow potentials and the existing connection between D2 and D1. Such connections elicit sub-threshold synaptic currents following D2 activations which can further contribute to LFP spread. The transition was also not clear when examining spiking responses in some of the trials (as indicated by high DIP scores, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). However, the observation that temporal grouping became more pronounced when using ALSA (a more robust estimate of local excitability) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L,N</xref>), suggests that high DIP values may result from variability in the spike times of single neurons, and not necessarily from the lack of modular activation. Such issues can be resolved by denser sampling of spiking activity in the tissue.</p>
<p>Similarly, sequentially activating adjacent cortical regions, which are functionally correlated and structurally connected (e.g., as activity travels across visual regions from V1 to V4), may be activated in a modular fashion but identified as travelling in VSD signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gu et al., 2021</xref>) due to mesoscale connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yan et al., 2022</xref>). Such modularity would be harder to detect for fast waves (in contrast to the slow waves in turtle cortex). Monitoring wave dynamics at a single cell resolution across connectivity boundaries (e.g., across two adjacent cortical regions or column), will be instrumental in identifying the granularity of propagating patterns in other cortical regions.</p>
<p>The above discussion calls for a better classification of dynamical phenomena into supra-threshold wave or modular excitability. In some neural systems, wave activity patterns clearly dominate. A very prominent example is developing systems. Measurements from retinas ex-vivo were performed across large areas with single cell resolution using both calcium imaging and dense electrode arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Newman and Zahs, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Voufo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). In such measurements, spatially adjacent neurons were shown to be activated sequentially in two-dimensional spreading patterns. Travelling waves were also detected in developing cortex, thalamus, and other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hanganu et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, in mature circuits, and specifically in cortex, connectivity and possibly excitability profiles are replaced by modules and by segregated excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meunier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>). Functional modular organization may result from control of neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shein-Idelson et al., 2016</xref>) in combination with modular connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Meunier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mountcastle, 1997</xref>). Accordingly, travelling waves may dominate in specific conditions of reduced consciousness such as anesthesia or sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liang et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Massimini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, waves are also reported under pathological conditions such as epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">van den Berg et al., 2012</xref>). In such states, inhibition in the network is reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sloviter, 1987</xref>) which may lead to a replacement of modular segregated activation by large-scale propagation of excitability crossing modular boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shein-Idelson et al., 2016</xref>). The abundance of travelling waves suggests that they are important components of the repertoire of neural network activity patterns. However, clear evidence for waves in some systems, for example during development, does not imply their existence in other systems. Indeed, wave propagation patterns on the single cell level are only scarcely reported during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>) leaving the microscopic correlates of most travelling wave unknown.</p>
<p>A promising technique for mapping the dynamics of microscopic local excitability is Calcium imaging. The data provided by this method supports both localized sequential activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Nietz et al., 2023</xref>) as well as travelling motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Afrashteh et al., 2017</xref>). However, to the best of our knowledge, no analysis was performed to discriminate between waves and sequentially activated sources and sinks. In addition, the temporal resolution of Calcium imaging is low, making it hard to detect temporal boundaries, especially for fast oscillating waves (e.g., in the gamma range). Further, wide point spread functions, axonal projections, or sparse activation of adjacent populations may mask circuit modularity and promote wave-detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ali and Kwan, 2019</xref>). On the other hand, the advancement of fast imaging techniques and analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) in combination with cell-body-targeted Calcium indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Shemesh et al., 2020</xref>) and high optical sectioning methods chart a promising direction for systematic investigations into the granularity of propagating patterns in the brain. Such measurements together with new analysis approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Afrashteh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chemla et al., 2017</xref>) will be required to disambiguate travelling waves from WLPs. Understanding the degree and the scale of functional modular organization in the brain will be important to revealing the true nature of cortical dynamics and its contribution to neural computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Pang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Eye-brain preparation and recording</title>
<p>Ex-vivo experiments were performed as in Shein-Idelson et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shein-Idelson et al., 2017a</xref>) at the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research in Frankfurt and Tel-Aviv University. Briefly, the brain of adult <italic>trachemys scripta elegans</italic> turtles was explanted as a whole, while still attached to the eye through the optic nerve. After anterior and posterior transverse incisions, the 3-layered medial and dorsal cortices, which overlay the ventricular cavity directly, were flattened and placed on top of a multi electrode array (MEA) ventricular side down (with L3 facing the MEA). 120- or 252-channel systems (MEA2100, MEA256 by Multichannel Systems, MCS) were used for recording with titanium-nitrate electrode grids with 100Î¼m spacing and 30Î¼m electrode diameter (120MEA100/30iR-ITO, 256MEA100/30iR-ITO, MCS). During experiments, the tissue was constantly superfused at 10 ml/min with oxygenated turtle ACSF solution (96.5 mM NaCl, 2.6 mM KCl, 4 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 31.5 mM NaHCO3, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.4) at 18 Â°C which was bubbled with carbogen gas (95% O2, 5% CO2). Glutamine (0.5 mM) and HEPES (10 mM, H3375 Sigma) were added for increased retinal viability. Experiments were approved by Tel Aviv University ethical committee (Approval number: 04-18-016). Experiments and analysis were performed until further analysis yielded no new knowledge.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Visual stimulation</title>
<p>The eye cup was pinned to a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer inside a MEA well. The visual stimulation was displayed on the screen, its size was reduced using an inverted Galilean telescope and it was focused onto the retina using a convex lens. The stimulation position and focus on the retina were adjusted using a set of 4 LEDs positioned at the edges of the screen and visible on the retina. These LEDs were turned off during the experiment. Stimulations were presented using a custom Matlab code and the psychophysics toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brainard, 1997</xref>). Stimulations consisted of sequentially presented full field flashes, squares flashing on the screen, natural images, or natural movies. In all stimulation, onset elicited a cortical response. Exact visual stimulation times were determined by changing the intensity of a small rectangle at the corner of the screen for every frame change and measuring this change using a photodiode.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Spectral Analysis</title>
<p>Spectral analysis was performed using Welchâs method (<italic>pWelch</italic>, Matlab). For each trial, the power spectra were extracted for a time window starting 250ms post-stimulus and lasting 2 seconds. The 2 second window was divided into three 1 second blocks with 500ms overlap.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Hilbert transform and phase crossing</title>
<p>The analytic signal was calculated using Matlabâs <italic>hilbert</italic> method after filtering (8<sup>th</sup> order Butterworth after zero padding). The signalâs envelope was extracted from the norm of the analytic signal. The instantaneous phase was used to determine the oscillationâs phase crossing events from the time the Analyticâs angle crosses a specific phase. To remove noise from phase crossing statistics, we assessed the noise level of the phase crossings. We calculated the distribution of pre-stimulus (500 â 1000 ms) phase crossingsâ amplitude of 100 random trials. Phase crossings with amplitudes lower than mean+4 STDs of this distribution were ignored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4e">
<title>Wave Detection</title>
<p>Phase crossings during single oscillation cycles were grouped into waves using an algorithm which identified the progression of a given phase crossing across multiple channels. We start by selecting a seed, which is a specific phase crossing event in one channel. We next go through all nearest neighboring channels. If phase crossings within a 100ms (for 0-2Hz band or 2ms for 12-35Hz Band) temporal window are detected, the channel is added to the wave. This process is repeated for the added channels until no more spatiotemporally connected phase crossings are found. Only phase crossing events with Hilbert amplitudes above noise level were considered. ALSA analysis was focused on large waves recruiting many channels (2/3 for 0-2Hz band and 5/6 for 12-35Hz band). For first spike analysis, due to data sparseness, waves recruiting &gt;30 channels were used.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Phase latency maps and correlations</title>
<p>Maps were calculated similarly to Muller et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Muller and Destexhe, 2012</xref>). The phase latency for each channel was defined as the time to reach a specific instantaneous phase for the ex-vivo experiment, or to the first maximum for the EEG simulations. When maps were calculated on single detected waves, and a given channel had more than one phase crossing in a single cluster, only the first phase crossing was used for the latency analysis. The phase latency distance correlations (PLDCs) for the ex-vivo preparation were calculated by first calculating the Euclidian distance of all electrodes from the wave starting point (the position of the first electrode having a phase crossing in the given wave) and calculating their Pearson correlation coefficient with the phase latencies. The PLDC for the EEG simulations were taken to be the correlation of the phase latencies with the electrodesâ positions on the caudal-rostral axis.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Wave center path (WCP)</title>
<p>WCP was calculated from the time-weighted âCenter of Massâ position on the electrode array for every time sample starting and ending in the first and last phase crossing, respectively. In each time sample (t), center of mass was calculated as follows:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the summation is over all phase crossings of a wave, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the position of the iâth phase crossing and <italic>Ai</italic> is its Hilbert amplitude. The temporal weight was taken to be a Gaussian of the time difference between the time of the iâth phase crossing, and the time sample for which the X<sub>cm</sub>(t) is calculated. To compensate for edge effects, the width of the Gaussian, Ï, was varied according to progression along the wave:
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>n</italic><sub>s</sub> is the number of samples and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the mean temporal difference between consecutive phase crossings, calculated by averaging over all time differences between consecutive crossing times of the wave. With this scaling in Ï, the samples at the beginning and end are less biased towards future or past crossings, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h">
<title>Spike Sorting</title>
<p>Spikes were sorted using a custom-designed algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shein-Idelson et al., 2017a</xref>). After sorting, all spikes were associated with a specific channel (determined by the channel in which the averaged spike amplitude was maximal). The spiking firing pattern of each channel was comprised by merging all spikes associated with the channel.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i">
<title>ALSA Calculation</title>
<p>To calculate the average local spiking activity (ALSA), each channelâs firing pattern was convolved with a constant window of 100ms, and then smoothed using a gaussian window of the same temporal width. The ALSA was then taken to be the spatially weighted average of these smoothed firing rates. Only the nearest neighbors were considered (up to 4 neighbors), with the weight of each neighbor being half the weight of the center channel. Therefore, the ALSA value of channel i at time t is given by:
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The ALSA onset times were taken to be the time of the first maximum in each channelâs ALSA.</p>
<p>To reduce noise even further, only ALSA onsets that occurred around the time of the detected LFP wave were considered â from half of the wave duration before the start of the wave, to half of the wave duration after it ended.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4j">
<title>DIP Test</title>
<p>The DIP-Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hartigan and Hartigan, 2007</xref>) is a statistic used to quantify the deviation of a distribution from unimodality. We used the MATLAB implementation by F. Mechler (DIP-test and DIP-test significance). The P-value was calculated by comparing the DIP statistic to a bootstrap sample (n=500) of the DIP statistic calculated for a uniform probability distribution function of sample size of the empirical distribution (the uniform distribution has been shown to be the âworst caseâ unimodal distribution). Since our data is one dimensional (first spike times, ALSA onsets or LFP phase crossings), we use the DIP-test directly on these one-dimensional distributions. In DIP analysis of first spikes, the following exclusion criteria were pre-established. We only considered large enough waves (having at least 5/6 channels participating in the LFP wave). In addition, we only examined the first spikes (marking activity onset) and therefore only analyzed channels with spikes occurring during the waves (i.e., during the interval [T-W, T+W] where T is each waveâs middle time and W is its width). When running the analysis on ALSA, were analyzed all trials with at least 4/6 channels.</p>

<title>EEG Simulations</title>
<p>Simulations were performed using Brainstorm (version 3.220616) in Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tadel et al., 2011</xref>). Electrical field and consequent EEG recordings flowing defined activation profiles were simulated based on a human anatomical MRI scan. Activity sources were synchronized groups of dipoles located at the cortex surface and oriented normally to it. These grouped dipoles (red and blue dots in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) are called scouts in the Brainstorm jargon and were manually marked on the cortical surface using the Brainstorm GUI. Each scout is comprised of 160 adjacent dipoles and has an average area of 27 cm<sup>2</sup> (20 dipoles of area 0.187cm<sup>2</sup> for small scouts). In each simulation, two scouts were activated with the same temporal Gaussian function (amplitude 1; standard deviation (sd) 0.2 seconds). This Gaussian was repeated consecutively five times with a period of 8sd, simulating activity for 580 ms (5800 samples; 10KHz sampling rate). To simulate activation lags between modules (as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), the temporal mean of one of the scouts was shifted by 0.2sd in every independent simulation, resulting with temporal differences ranging from 0.2sd to 2sd. In the same fashion, we repeated the simulation for varying spatial distance between the scoutâs centers (along the posterior-anterior axis) divided by the standard deviation. The distances were the Euclidean distance between the scoutsâ centers (mean position of each scoutsâ dipoles), and the standard deviation was calculated along the posterior-anterior axis for each scout (the mean of the two scouts was taken as the final value). In Brainstorm we used the default MRI anatomy (ICBM_152), with 15002 vertices (or 306716 for small scouts) and the âICBM152â -&gt; âACA 10-05 343â EEG headset device (with 343 electrodes). We only analyzed the activity of the top 63 electrodes (35 for small scouts) at the vicinity of the sources. In the small scouts simulation (<xref rid="fig1S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), we duplicated the sources such that they are symmetric across the two hemispheres. We modeled the electromagnetic properties of the head and the EEG device (forward model) using the OpenMEEG BEM method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gramfort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kybic et al., 2005</xref>) without inserting noise to the process (identity noise covariance matrix).</p>

<p>(A) Latency to peak as measured across electrodes following the sequential activation of two sets of localized dipoles (green and red, as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) simulating the activation of small cortical areas. A wave like delay pattern is observed. (B) Phase latency distance correlations (PLDC) for different distances and different delays between two activated areas (as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). PLDC remains close to 1 (indicating wave propagation) for a wide range of values. (C) Activation dynamics before and after filtering into a narrow band frequency range (10-12Hz).

The amplitude [A.U.] of two sequentially activated Gaussians is shown as a function of time (according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref>). The distance between Gaussian centers was Îx=2Ïx (left) and Îx=3Ïx (right) (Ïx being the standard deviation) and Ît=Ït.

<label>Appendix 1</label>
<title>Theoretical model</title>
<p>Sequential activation of modules was represented by the sum of two one-dimensional Gaussians centered at <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> and and <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub> and multiplied by a temporal Gaussian centered around <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, respectively:
<disp-formula id="ueqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
with spatial and temporal widths. By moving to center coordinates: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and setting the average position to zero we get:
<disp-formula id="ueqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
To calculate the time at which the wave passes through the midpoint between Gaussians, we calculate the temporal derivative at x=0 and equate it to zero. This yields the following relation which is satisfied at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>
<disp-formula id="ueqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
To track the wave frontâs peak, we calculate the spatial extremum by equating the first spatial derivative to zero at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>
<disp-formula id="ueqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
This equation is satisfied at x=0. We calculate the second derivative to determine whether the extremum is concave or convex.
<disp-formula id="ueqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Since the sign of this expression depends only on the last multiplicand, we conclude that the extremum at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, <italic>x</italic> = 0 will be a maximum when Î<italic>x</italic> &lt; 2<italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub> and a minimum for when Î<italic>x</italic> &gt; 2<italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>Similarly to the spatial domain, we can calculate the conditions for identifying two Gaussians over the temporal domain. We require that no minimum appears at x=0 during the period between the two peaks reaching their maximum. i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. This results in the following equation:
<disp-formula id="ueqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
By separately considering the case of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, one can show that:
<disp-formula id="ueqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Plugging in t=t<sub>1</sub> or t=t<sub>2</sub> (in which the left hand side is maximal) yields a tight bound of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>To calculate the velocity profile of the peak, we find <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and equate it to zero. This yields the following relation between <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> and <italic>t</italic>, depicting the coordinates in which the profile is at its peak:
<disp-formula id="ueqn11">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
From this equation, one can isolate t = g(<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>)
<disp-formula id="ueqn12">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
From this equation we calculated <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and under the condition that Î<italic>x</italic> &lt; 2<italic>Ï</italic><sub><italic>X</italic></sub>, we can use the inverse function theorem to get <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>:
<disp-formula id="ueqn13">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
A similar approach was taken for calculating the velocity of the peak for an oscillating sources model:
<disp-formula id="ueqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
To calculate the peak velocity, we change coordinates to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, Î<italic>x</italic> = <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub> â <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>ÎÏ</italic> = <italic>Ï</italic><sub>1</sub> â <italic>Ï</italic><sub>2</sub>, and equate the spatial derivative to zero:
<disp-formula id="ueqn15">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Giving rise to the condition:
<disp-formula id="ueqn16">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
We next calculate the partial derivative with respect to <italic>t</italic>, to get:
<disp-formula id="ueqn17">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
For examining phase latency maps under different spatially distributed Gaussians, we used a simplistic representation in which two 2D spatial gaussians were each multiplied by a temporal squared sine:
<disp-formula id="ueqn18">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>w</italic> = Î (<italic>t</italic>) Î (<italic>Ï</italic> â <italic>t</italic>) is a window function (Î is the Heavyside step function) and <italic>ti</italic> is the time in which pulse <italic>i</italic> starts. For generating phase WLPs with different spatial arrangements, we used the following parameters. Plane wave: <italic>t</italic>1 = 1; <italic>t</italic>2 = 30 (70% temporal overlap); (<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>,<italic>y</italic><sub>1</sub>) = (3,3); (<italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>,<italic>y</italic><sub>2</sub>) = (9,9); <italic>Ï</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>Ï</italic><sub>2</sub> = 6 ; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Radial wave: <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1; <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> = 30; (<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub>,<italic>y</italic><sub>1</sub>) = (3,3); (<italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>,<italic>y</italic><sub>2</sub>) = (9,9); <italic>Ï</italic><sub>1</sub> = 3; <italic>Ï</italic><sub>2</sub> = 6. For the spiral-like wave we used two Gaussians with non-zero covariance:
<disp-formula id="ueqn19">
<graphic xlink:href="552978v2_ueqn19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> being the spatial coordinates, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="552978v2_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> the center of the iâth Gaussian and Î£<italic>i</italic> is its covariance matrix.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this interesting work, the authors investigated an important topical question: when we see travelling waves in cortical activity, is this due to true wave-like spread, or due to sequentially activated sources? In simulations, it is shown that sequential brain module activation can show up as a travelling wave - even in improved methods such as phase delay maps - and a variety of parameters is investigated. Then, in ex-vivo turtle eye-brain preparations, the authors show that visual cortex waves observable in local field potentials are in fact often better explained as areas D1 and D2 being sequentially activated. This has implications for how we think about travelling wave methodology and relevant analytical tools.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the discussion. The authors are careful in their claims, and point out that some phenomena may still indeed be genuine travelling waves, but we should have a higher evidence bar to claim this for a particular process in light of this paper and Zhigalov &amp; Jensen (2023) (ref 44). Given this careful discussion, the claims made are well-supported by the experimental results. The discussion also gives a nice overview of potential options in light of this and future directions.</p>

<p>We are glad the reviewer found our manuscript âinterestingâ, the questions we raise âimportantâ, our claims âwell-supported by the experimental resultsâ, and our methods âdetailed and clearly structuredâ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The details of the sequentially activated Gaussian simulations give some useful results, but the fundamental idea still appears to be &quot;sequential activation is often indistinguishable from a travelling wave&quot;, an idea advanced e.g. by Zhigalov &amp; Jensen (2023). It takes a while until the (in my opinion) more intriguing experimental results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To emphasize the experimental results, we switched between the analytical results and the experimental results. Correspondingly, figure 2 now illustrates the more intriguing experimental results and figure 3 the analytical results. In addition, we added subtitles to the different sections of the results to ease the navigation through the paper and to enable the readers to access the different sections more easily.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>One of the key claims is that the spikes are more consistent with two sequentially activated modules rather than a continuous wave (with Fig 3k and 3l key to support this). Whilst this is <italic>more</italic> consistent, it is worth mentioning that there seems to be stochasticity to this and between-trial variability, especially for spikes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript we added the reviewerâs comment about stochasticity, and we discuss its possible origins:</p>
<p>&quot;The transition was also not clear when examining spiking responses in some of the trials (as indicated by high DIP scores, Figure 2K). However, the observation that temporal grouping became more pronounced when using ALSA (a more robust estimate of local excitability) (Figure 2L,N), suggests that high DIP values may result from variability in the spike times of single neurons, and not necessarily from the lack of modular activation. Such issues can be resolved by denser sampling of spiking activity in the tissue.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p>The eye-cortex turtle preparation is not the most common. I would add more context about how specific the results are to this preparation vs how comparable it is to human data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a sentence explaining the relevance of our preparation: âFinally, while the layered organization of turtle cortex is different than that of mammalian cortex, the basic excitability features of both tissues are similar (Connors and Kriegstein, 1986; Hemberger et al., 2019; Kriegstein and Connors, 1986; Larkum et al., 2008; Shein-Idelson et al., 2017b), and substantial differences in the manner by which field potentials and spikes spread through the tissue are not to be expected.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Philosophical question: when does a 'module' become small enough for it to count as a travelling wave? More on this could be added to the discussion. I think we are in the very early days for a true understanding of travelling waves, and I wonder if these sequentially activated modules will functionally correspond to the known cortical segregation, or if it varies by area/task.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that macroscopic waves could be composed of smaller modules (or single neurons at the smallest scale). Our results suggest that modular patterns can be classified as wave patterns both at large scales (of brain areas) and smaller scales of local neural circuits. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to make this distinction across different scales. We sharpened this point in the first paragraph of the discussion:</p>
<p>&quot;â¦We showed that LFP measurements indicative of waves propagating across turtle cortex are underlined by discrete and consecutively activated neuronal populations, and not by a continuously propagating wavefront of spikes (Figure 2). Similarly, activation profiles that resemble continuous travelling waves in EEG simulations can be underlined by consecutive activation of two discrete cortical regions (Figure 1). We replicated these results using an analytical model and demonstrated that a simple scenario of sequentially activated Gaussians can exhibit WLPs with a rich diversity of spatiotemporal profiles (Figure 3). Our results offer insight into the scenarios and conditions for WLP detection by identifying failure points that should be considered when identifying travelling waves and therefore suggest caution when interpreting continuous phase latency maps as microscopically propagating wave patterns. Such failure points may exist both when examining activity at the scale of brain regions (Figure 1) and smaller neural circuits (Figure 2). Therefore, our results suggest that the discrepancy between modular and wave activation should be examined across spatial scales. Specifically, it is not necessarily the case that at the fine grained (single neuron) scale activation patterns are modular, but, following coarse graining, smooth wave patterns emerge. Rather, modular activation may hierarchically exist across scales (Kaiser and Hilgetag, 2010; Meunier et al., 2010) and may be masked by smeared spatial supra-threshold excitability boundaries. Below we discuss these limitations across techniques and their implications.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I would advise the authors to focus on the experimental data, perhaps by putting the simulations second, and by putting some of the equation details that are in Methods into the Supplementary Information. Whilst the simulation parameter space is well-explored, the fundamental idea of spreading Gaussians is relatively simple, and the current manuscript organization detracted from the main message for me a little bit.â</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the refereeâs suggestion, we switched between the section with experimental data and the one with the analytic model (see response to comment 1). In addition, to ease the reading of the methods, we moved the mathematical derivation and related equations to appendix 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Things I thought about that you may also enjoy thinking about:
Could we tell something about sequential sources vs travelling waves by the nature of the wave - e.g. shape or dispersion? If some wave properties are conserved whilst travelling, this could be evidence for travelling vs two sources.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a wonderful suggestion. We are currently working on a follow up publication with a new approach to do exactly that! We think that this new body of work is outside the scope of this paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Could synaptic potentials spread like waves, but spikes more in modular bursts? This would also explain the LFP vs spikes difference - maybe travelling waves of EPSPs are there priming the network, 'looking' for suitable modules to activate, which then activate sequentially. The current discussion is quite spike-focused - could some information be in synaptic potentials after all?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting idea with intriguing functional implications. We added this idea to our discussion (see paragraph below). In addition, to emphasize our discussion on synaptic potentials, we reorganized the paragraphs in the discussion to separate between our discussion on sub-threshold excitability (which is mostly synaptic) and supra-threshold excitability which is the focus of the second part of the discussion.</p>
<p>âVariability in responses may also be explained by differences in propagation mechanisms (Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001; Muller et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2008). Several reports suggest that waves are underlined by propagation along axonal collaterals (Muller et al., 2018, 2014). Both the transmembrane voltage-gated currents excited during action potentials as well as the post-synaptic currents along axonal boutons can potentially contribute to measured signals. However, such waves travel at high propagation speeds and are not compatible with the wide diversity of wave velocities and mechanisms of local neuronal interactions (Ermentrout and Kleinfeld, 2001; Feller et al., 1996). An intriguing possibility is that such axonal waves prime neuronal excitability by sub-threshold inputs that later result in modular supra-threshold activation. The ability to experimentally discriminate between axonal inputs and local spiking excitability (e.g. by reporters with different wavelengths) can potentially resolve such discrepancies.</p>
<p>Our turtle cortex results (Figure 2) exemplify how contrasting sub-threshold LFP measurements with supra-threshold spiking measurements can yield different conclusions about the nature of activity spreadâ¦.â</p>
