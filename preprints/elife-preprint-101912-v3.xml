<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Human fertility is suboptimal in part by error-prone divisions during early cleavage stages, which frequently result in chromosomal aneuploidy. Most human pre-implantation embryos are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells, yet those with a low proportion of aneuploid cells can develop to term at rates similar to fully euploid embryos. How embryos manage aneuploidy during early development remains poorly understood – yet this knowledge is crucial for improving fertility outcomes and reducing developmental defects. To investigate these mechanisms, we established a new mouse model of chromosome mosaicism to trace the fate of aneuploid cells during pre-implantation development. We previously used the Mps1 inhibitor reversine to induce aneuploidy. Here, we demonstrate that the more specific Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 similarly disrupts chromosome segregation but supports higher developmental potential than reversine. AZ3146-treated embryos transiently upregulate Hypoxia Inducible-Factor-1A (HIF1A) without triggering p53 activation. Given that pre-implantation embryos develop in a hypoxic environment <italic>in vivo</italic>, we further explored the role of oxygen tension. Hypoxia exposure <italic>in vitro</italic> reduced DNA damage in response to Mps1 inhibition and increased the proportion of euploid cells in mosaic epiblast. Conversely, HIF1A inhibition decreased the proportion of aneuploid cells. Together, these findings uncover a role for hypoxia signaling in modulating the response to chromosomal errors and suggest new strategies to improve the developmental potential of mosaic human embryos.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Humans have relatively low fertility compared to other mammals, with only ∼30% of conceptions resulting in live birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Palmerola et al., 2022a</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>). A striking feature of early human development is the high frequency of chromosome segregation errors during cleavage stage divisions, leading to aneuploidy – the gain or loss of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allais &amp; FitzHarris, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Currie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Palmerola et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pauerova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>). This high incidence of aneuploidy is thought to underlie low human fecundity and many developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Palmerola et al., 2022a</xref>). Both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) frequently results in embryos that are chromosomally mosaic, containing a mixture of diploid and aneuploid cells. It is estimated that ∼60% of pre-implantation IVF embryos exhibit this form of mosaicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>). Despite its prevalence, our understanding of how embryos respond to and cope with aneuploidy during early development remains limited.</p>
<p>The incidence of aneuploidy declines at development progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shahbazi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), but the mechanism underlying this decline remains unclear. Remarkably, mosaic human embryos can develop to term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, embryos classified as low- or medium-grade mosaics - defined by presence of 20-30% or 30-50% aneuploid cells in the trophectoderm – have implantation and birth rates comparable to fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>). These observations raise a fundamental question: how do some mosaic embryos maintain developmental potential despite chromosomal abnormalities? Uncovering the mechanisms that support the viability of mosaic embryos is essential for improving reproductive outcomes and embryo selection strategies.</p>
<p>Mouse models of chromosome mosaicism provide a powerful system to investigate mechanisms that cannot be ethically studied in human embryos. Importantly, mouse and human pre-implantation development are highly similar: both undertake cleavage divisions, compaction, blastocyst cavity formation and hatching, albeit with slightly different timings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mole et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). During this period, outer cells differentiate into the extra-embryonic trophectoderm (TE), whereas inner cells form the inner cell mass (ICM), which further segregates into the embryonic epiblast (EPI) or extra-embryonic primitive endoderm (PE). The TE will form the placenta, the PE will form the yolk sac and the EPI will form the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhu &amp; Zernicka-Goetz, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, our group developed the first mouse model of chromosome mosaicism by inducing aneuploidy using the small-molecule inhibitor reversine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). Reversine is a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor that also antagonizes the A3 adenosine receptor and inhibits mitotic kinase monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">D’Alise et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Santaguida et al., 2010</xref>). We found that reversine-treated mosaic embryos exhibit widespread aneuploidy and upregulation of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos are progressively eliminated from the EPI, beginning around the time of implantation. Consistent with findings in human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>), murine mosaic embryos containing at least 50% of euploid cells had a similar developmental potential to fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Singla et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>However, because reversine affects p53 and may compromise cellular fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">D’Alise et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Santaguida et al., 2010</xref>), we sought to establish a complementary model using a more specific Mps1 inhibitor, AZ3146 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hewitt et al., 2010</xref>). Although both AZ3146 and reversine interfere with the spindle assembly checkpoint, they bind to Mps1 in a different manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lan &amp; Cleveland, 2010</xref>). In mouse embryos, AZ3146 treatment was shown to double the occurrence of micronuclei, indicative of chromosome segregation defects, but without impairing overall cellular fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Vazquez-Diez et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we use both AZ3146- and reversine-treated embryos to dissect the mechanisms governing aneuploid cell elimination and survival during pre-implantation development.</p>

<title>AZ3146 treatment induces chromosome segregation defects in pre-implantation embryos</title>
<p>To generate distinct models of aneuploidy, we treated 4- to 8-cell stage mouse embryos with AZ3146 (20 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Vazquez-Diez et al., 2019</xref>), as well as with reversine (0.5 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>) as a positive control, or DMSO (vehicle) as a negative control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We evaluated how the different Mps1 inhibitors affect chromosome segregation by detecting nuclei and kinetochores in 8-cell embryos and counted chromosomes <italic>in situ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pauerova et al., 2020</xref>). Micronuclei were identified as small DAPI-stained chromosomes that were clearly distinct from the nuclei (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). We examined 32 DMSO-treated control embryos and observed only 22 cells with micronuclei out of a total of 256 cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). In contrast, we observed 82 cells with micronuclei in a total of 144 individual cells from 18 reversine-treated embryos, and 182 cells in a total of 304 individual cells from 38 AZ3146-treated embryos (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). After normalization, the average of aneuploidy in DMSO-treated 8-cell embryos was 12.5%, compared to 75% in the reversine-treated embryos and 62.5% in the AZ3146-treated embryos (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). We also detected non-dividing nuclei as rounded circles with distinct DAPI intensities in embryos treated with reversine and AZ3146. Specifically, we observed 28 non-dividing cells (19%) in reversine-treated embryos and 24 non-dividing cells (7.9%) in AZ3146-treated blastomeres, but none in DMSO-treated blastomeres (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). The increased frequencies of micronuclei and non-dividing cells in response to Mps1 inhibition are consistent with elevated aneuploidy and chromosomal instability (Daughtry and Chavez, 2016; Vazquez-Diez et al., 2016), as we showed previously for reversine-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>Given these distinct responses to reversine and AZ3146, we examined how these treatments impact the lineages in the blastocyst. To this end, we treated embryos with DMSO, reversine or AZ3146 from the 4- to 8-cell stage, and then washed and cultured them until the late blastocyst stage (E4.5). We assessed lineages by immunofluorescence (IF) to detect the TE marker CDX2, the EPI marker NANOG, and the PE marker SOX17. We found that all lineages segregated normally, and that blastocyst morphology was similar in all three conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We quantified the number of cells in the blastocysts and found that DMSO-treated controls had a median of 93 cells in total, whereas reversine- and AZ3146-treated embryos had a median of only 79 and 82 cells, respectively (n=28 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). DMSO-treated blastocysts contained a median of 15 EPI, 11 PE, and 67 TE cells, whereas reversine-treated blastocysts contained 12 EPI, 8 PE and 59 TE cells, and AZ3146-treated blastocysts had 11 EPI, 7 PE and 64 TE cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These data suggest that reversine treatment compromises the development of all three lineages, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>), whereas AZ3146 mainly compromises ICM (EPI and PE) development (Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test).</p>
<p>To compare the developmental potential of blastocysts that had been treated with AZ3146 or reversine, we transfer ∼7 embryos per treatment into opposite uterine horns of the same mouse and counted decidua, which reflect successful implantation, as well as viable embryos at E9.5. Although two (8%) reversine-treated blastocysts developed decidua (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>), none gave rise to viable E9.5 embryos. In contrast, seven (30%) AZ3146-treated blastocysts developed decidua (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>) and five (21%) generated viable E9.5 embryos (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref>). Thus, AZ3146-treated embryos appear to have a higher developmental potential than reversine-treated embryos.</p>
<p>Considering that cellular fitness and aneuploid stress are related to DNA damage and DNA repair, we first sought to understand if these parameters were affected in our drug treatments. We used IF to quantify the levels of the DNA repair marker PARP1 and of the DNA damage marker, phosphorylated H2A.X (γH2A.X) at the 8-cell and morula stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We observed elevated γH2A.X levels in reversine- and AZ3146-treated 8-cell embryos compared to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) (n=∼15 embryos per treatment, ∼120 cells. Collection was made during three independent experiments. Statistical test: t-test), which eventually returned to normal in AZ3146-treated blastocysts, but not in reversine-treated blastocysts (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>).</p>
<p>PARP1 was specifically enriched in the EPI lineage in normal blastocysts, as assessed by IF (n&gt;21 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test) and re-analysis of published scRNA-seq data (Deng et al., 2014) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). Intriguingly, PARP1 levels were reduced at the 8-cell and morula stages in reversine-treated embryos compared to controls and to AZ3146-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D-E). Moreover, late morula stage embryos treated with the PARP inhibitor Olaparib (10 µM) (Hou et al., 2022; Prasad et al., 2017) developed into smaller blastocysts with only 78 total cells, reflecting a relatively low number of ICM cells, only 8 EPI and 4 PE cells in DMSO-treated embryos (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C-E</xref>). Treatment with reversine, but not AZ3146, further reduced the number of cells in the EPI lineage of Olaparib-treated embryos (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>) (n=15 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments. Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test). Overall, these data suggest that PARP1 is required for proper development of the ICM, and that its reduced levels after reversine treatment may negatively impact development.</p>

<title>Reversine and AZ3146 activate distinct stress response pathways in pre-implantation embryos</title>
<p>Chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy are associated with different cellular stress pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, p53 is frequently activated following DNA damage, which can limit proliferation and trigger apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abuetabh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Soto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Thompson &amp; Compton, 2010</xref>). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) can also be activated following DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Thompson and Compton, 2010</xref>). In aneuploid cells, p38 promotes apoptosis by inhibiting the transcription factor Hif-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Simoes-Sousa et al., 2018</xref>), which otherwise promotes cell survival, proliferation, and metabolic changes in aneuploid cells and in response to hypoxia in different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Simoes-Sousa et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate how treatment with reversine or AZ3146 affect <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>Hif1a</italic> expression in mouse embryos, we performed RT-qPCR at the morula and blastocyst stages. We normalized to <italic>Ppia</italic> (Peptidylprolyl Isomerase A) mRNA, which is a stable reference gene in diploid and polyploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gu et al., 2014</xref>). Reversine-treated embryos displayed a significant increase in <italic>p53</italic> transcript levels at the morula (7-fold) and blastocyst (1.3-fold) stages compared with DMSO-treated embryos (Sample: 3 biological replicates and 2 technical replicates per experiment with each replicate having a minimum of 16 embryos. Statistical test: Welch’s t-test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), as we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, reversine-treated embryos showed reduced expression of <italic>Hif1a</italic> at the blastocyst stage, which would be consistent with p38 activation. In contrast, AZ3146-treated embryos did not show upregulation of <italic>p53</italic> at either the morula or blastocyst stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, AZ3146-treated embryos showed a transient increase in <italic>Hif1a</italic> mRNA levels (3-fold) at the morula stage compared to DMSO- and reversine-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), which returned to normal levels at the blastocyst stage. HIF1A protein was present in DMSO- and reversine-treated embryos and elevated at the morula and blastocyst stages in AZ3146-treated embryos (n=∼20embryos per treatment. Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test, error bars represent s.e.m) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). HIF1A appeared to be mostly nuclear in morula, but mostly cytoplasmic in blastocysts, under all three conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that treatment with reversine, but not AZ3146, induces multiple stress pathways in pre-implantation embryos. These differences may contribute to the increased developmental potential of embryos treated with AZ3146 versus reversine.</p>

<title>HIF1A activity is required for proper blastocyst formation after Mps1 inhibition</title>
<p>It was previously shown that Hif1α<sup>−/−</sup> embryos undergo developmental arrest and lethality by E11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Iyer et al., 1998</xref>). To assess the role of HIF1A in the embryo’s response to reversine and AZ3146, we used a pharmacological approach to inhibit its function. Briefly, we tested two different small molecules that have been shown to inhibit HIF1A activity, PX-478 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lee &amp; Kim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>) and IDF-11774 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ban et al., 2017</xref>). We treated control zygotes with DMSO, PX-478 (2 µM), or IDF-11774 (20 µM) until the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). Unlike PX-478, IDF-11774 treatment did not significantly affect the total number of cells in the TE or the whole blastocyst compared to the control (n=∼12 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments. Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). Therefore, we used IDF-11774 to inhibit HIF1A in subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>Next, we treated embryos with DMSO, reversine, or AZ3146 from the 4- to 8-cell stage, washed them, and then inhibited HIF1A with IDF-11774 from the 8-cell to blastocyst stage (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Inhibition of HIF1A did not abolish cavitation but dramatically lowered the number of TE and especially PE cells in AZ3146-treated embryos compared to DMSO-treated controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) and compared to AZ3146-treated embryos not exposed to IDF-11884 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Inhibition of HIF1A also lowered the number of cells in reversine-treated embryos compared to controls, but the effect was smaller (n=20 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments. Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Overall, our data suggest that elevated HIF1A activity from the 8-cell stage onwards is particularly important to promote the survival of aneuploid TE and PE cells after AZ3146 treatment.</p>
<p>Taken together, our data suggest that AZ3146 and reversine have distinct effects on the pre-implantation embryo. Compared to reversine-treated embryos, AZ3146-treated embryos appear to have increased developmental potential, lack upregulation of p53, and show transient upregulation of <italic>Hif1a</italic>. Moreover, AZ3146-treated embryos have a greater dependence on HIF1A activity to form the TE and PE.</p>

<p>First, we examined lineage specification by quantifying the cell numbers in all three lineages at the blastocyst stage. We found that DMSO-treated blastocysts cultured under hypoxia had a median of 74 cells, representing 14 EPI cells, 6 PE cells and 54 TE cells (n=18 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments. Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test)(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). These data suggest that, under our conditions, the cell number in the pre-implantation mouse blastocyst is reduced when cultured in hypoxia compared to normoxia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), particularly in the TE and PE. Notably, reversine and AZ3146 treatment did not further reduce cell numbers for embryos cultured under hypoxia, except for in the PE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate how hypoxia exposure affects DNA damage and repair in mouse embryos, we again performed IF for γH2A.X and PARP1 in 8-cell embryos and morula (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>) (n=25 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments. Statistical test: t-test). We found that treated embryos with reversine and AZ3146 under hypoxia generated lower levels of γH2A.X (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>) compared with the same treatments under normoxia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Whereas PARP1 levels at the 8-cell stage are reduce in reversine-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), similar to normoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Importantly, at the morula stages, the levels of PARP1 are relatively low compared to morula stage in normoxic conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).

<title>Hypoxia increases the proportion of euploid cells in the epiblast of mosaic blastocysts</title>
<p>Despite the high incidence of mosaicism in human pre-implantation embryos, the fate of aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos is incompletely understood. We previously used reversine to generate a mouse model of pre-implantation chromosome mosaicism and found that aneuploid (Reversine-treated) cells are eliminated in the EPI of mosaic embryos via apoptosis, starting from the mature blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). Whether this response reflects reversine treatment specifically, or aneuploidy more generally, is not known. Moreover, how hypoxia versus normoxia affects the outcomes is also not clear.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we created aggregation chimeras at the 8-cell stage that contained a 1:1 ratio of AZ3146-treated and control blastomeres (DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras), which is expected to reflect low-grade mosaicism, or of AZ3146-treated and reversine-treated blastomeres (reversine/AZ3146 chimeras), which is expected to reflect medium-grade mosaicism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We cultured these chimeric embryos in normoxia and hypoxia, and followed the fate of individual blastomeres by using transgenic mouse lines with the membrane markers mTmG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Muzumdar et al., 2007</xref>) and E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Christodoulou et al., 2019</xref>). DMSO/AZ3146 and reversine/AZ3146 blastocysts displayed proper lineage allocation, embryo morphology and cavitation in both normoxia and hypoxia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-C</xref>). In addition, DMSO/AZ3146 and reversine/AZ3146 embryos had comparable total cell numbers in their blastocysts, and blastocysts grown in hypoxia were again smaller than those grown in normoxia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>). Intriguingly, despite having fewer total cells, DMSO/AZ3146 blastocysts had more EPI cells when they were cultured in hypoxia compared to normoxia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Hypoxia affects cell competition between diploid and aneuploid cells during pre-implantation development.</title>
<p>(A) Graphic representation of the cell competition experiments. Embryos were treated at the 4-cell stage with DMSO or Mps1 inhibitors reversine and AZ3146. After washing, 8-cell stage embryos were disaggregated, and re-aggregated to form chimeras containing a 1:1 ratio of DMSO/AZ314-treated blastomeres and Reversine/AZ314-treated blastomeres. Following aggregation, chimeras were cultured to the mature blastocyst stage (E4.5) and analyzed for lineage specification. For identification of the treatment, we use transgenics lines with membrane markers. Immunofluorescence for CDX2, NANOG, and SOX17 was performed to test lineage specification and allocation during (B) normoxia and (C) hypoxia. Lineage allocation quantification was based on the above markers. Importantly, (D) in normoxia, both chimeras have the same number of cells in all the lineages except the EPI. In addition, AZ3146-treated blastomeres outcompete reversine-treated blastomeres in medium-grade mosaics in the TE and the EPI. (E) Under hypoxia, both chimeras have similar number of cells in all the lineages. Yet, AZ3146-blastomeres do not outcompete reversine-treated blastomeres. Quantification of the contribution of AZ3146-treated blastomeres to the chimeras showed that, (F) under normoxia, compare with DMSO-treated cells, no preferential allocation of aneuploid cells occurs in the TE. In contrast, AZ3146-treated blastomeres increased their contribution when compare with reversine-treated blastomeres, but only for the EPI and the PE. (G) During hypoxia, in DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras no preferential allocation of aneuploid cells occurs in the TE. But preferential allocation of diploid cells to the EPI is observed. Whereas in Reversine/AZ3146 chimeras, AZ3146-treated blastomeres contribute similarly to reversine-blastomeres to the TE and PE but significantly increase contribution to the EPI. These results indicate that hypoxia favors the survival of reversine-induced aneuploid cells compared to their survival in normoxia(n&gt;7 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments.

</fig>
<p>We quantified the proportion of AZ3146 cells in each lineage for each chimera. In DMSO/AZ3146-treated blastocysts, we found that 46.75% of the TE and 42.88% of the EPI originated from AZ3146-treated blastomeres, compared to only 28.57% of the PE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). In reversine/AZ3146 chimeras, 63% of the TE and 78.4% of the EPI originated from AZ3146-treated cells, compared to only 40% of the PE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Thus, under normoxia, DMSO cells appear to outcompete AZ3146-treated cells, which in turn outcompete Reversine-treated cells in the TE and EPI. AZ3146-treated cells appeared to be at a competitive disadvantage in the PE in both contexts. Culturing DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras in hypoxia increased the representation of AZ3146-treated blastomeres in the TE (49.06%) and PE (50%) but, strikingly, reduced their representation in the EPI (33.3%) (n&gt;7 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments. Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). These altered frequencies reflect a higher number of DMSO-treated cells in the EPI and a lower number in the PE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Hypoxia exposure of reversine/AZ3146 embryos lowered the contribution of AZ3146-treated blastomeres to the TE (55.94%) and EPI (50%) but not the PE (46.43%) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). We found that there was no correlation between the proportion of AZ3146-treated cells in the TE and the EPI in DMSO/AZ3146 and reversine/AZ3146 aggregation chimeras, under hypoxia or normoxia, and that hypoxia seemed to have a greater impact on the proportion of AZ3146 cells in reversine/AZ3146 aggregation chimeras (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that hypoxia has lineage-specific effects on competitions between aneuploid and euploid cells and increases the contribution of euploid cells to the EPI.</p>
<p>Blastomeres in the 4-cell stage embryo display a lineage bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Goolam et al., 2016</xref>). We considered that mosaicism generated before the 4-cell stage might influence lineage allocation. To test this possibility, we treated zygotes with reversine or AZ3146 during the first cleavage division. Importantly, reversine treatment at the zygote stage seems to strongly affect the morphology of the blastocysts (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). Consistent with this change in morphology, reversine-treatment reduced the number of cells in all lineages, particularly in the TE and PE (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). In contrast, AZ3146 treatment did not affect morphology or cell number in any of the lineages (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A-B</xref>) (n=∼27 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments. Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test). To evaluate how early generation of aneuploidies in the embryos affect cell competition, we generated DMSO/AZ3146, Reversine/DMSO, and Reversine/AZ3146 aggregation chimeras at the 2-cell stage and cultured them under normoxia until the blastocyst stage (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>). We found that all three 2-cell stage aggregation chimeras developed into blastocysts with proper lineage segregation and the presence of a cavity (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D</xref>). Interestingly, the reversine-treated cells were extruded from the blastocyst in 54% of the reversine/DMSO chimeras and in 33% of the AZ3146/reversine chimeras, whereas no cell extrusion was observed in the DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras. Quantification of the proportion of AZ3146-treated cells in 2-cell stage derived chimeras (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>) showed similar results as 8-cell stage derived chimeras (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F-G</xref>). In DMSO/AZ3146-treated blastocysts, we found that 49.28% of the TE, 39% of the EPI and 33.33% of the PE originated from AZ3146-treated blastomeres (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>). In reversine/AZ3146 chimeras, 68.24% of the TE, 68.83% of the EPI, and 66.67% of the PE originated from AZ3146-treated cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>). In DMSO/reversine chimeras, 22.27% of the TE, 26.98% of the PE, and 31.7% of the EPI originated from reversine-treated cells. Overall, these results suggest that aneuploidy generated at different stages similarly affect the proportion of aneuploid cells in the blastocysts.</p>

<title>HIF1A inhibition reduces the frequency of aneuploid cells in DMSO/AZ3146 mosaic embryos</title>
<p>Our data suggest that hypoxia affects aneuploid-euploid cell competition in mosaic embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). To further assess the effect of HIF1A and, considering most human embryos are culture under hypoxic conditions, we decided to evaluate the effect of inhibiting HIF1A in mosaic embryos cultured in hypoxic conditions. We assembled DMSO/AZ3146 and Reversine/AZ3146 8-cell stage chimeras, treated them with the HIF1A inhibitor IDF-11774 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, S6A-B), and then assessed lineage allocation in blastocysts. Treatment of DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras with IDF11774 does not affect lineage segregation in the blastocyst but reduces the cavity diameter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-C</xref>). Additionally, diminish the contribution of AZ3146-treated cells to the TE, but DMSO-treated cells seem to compensate for this loss in the PE and EPI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>). Treating Reversine/AZ3146 chimeras with IDF11774 compromised blastocyst morphology and cavitation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E-F</xref>) and considerable increased the number of PE and EPI cells (n&gt;8 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Aneuploidy is a frequent outcome of early embryonic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allais &amp; FitzHarris, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Currie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Palmerola et al., 2022b</xref>). Here, we describe complementary strategies for inducing aneuploidy in mouse embryos and reveal how the embryo’s response varies depending on the nature of the insult, clel lineage, and environmental context. Our findings support four key conclusions: 1) the Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 induces aneuploidy while preserving DNA repair capacity and dampening stress responses, compared to the broader-acting inhibitor reversine; 2) Lineage specific responses to aneuploidy emerge during blastocyst development, consistent with our earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Singla et al., 2020</xref>); 3) HIF1A promotes survival of extraembryonic lineages (TE and PE) in AZ3146-treated embryos, whereas PARP1 is particularly required in the EPI of both AZ3146- and reversine-treated embryos; 4) Hypoxia enhances DNA repair and influences the competitive dynamics between aneuploid and euploid cells in mosaic embryos.</p>
<p>Reversine-treated embryos upregulate mRNA levels of senescent markers p53 and p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Singla et al., 2020</xref>) and fail to give rise to viable embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). Our current results further indicate that reversine downregulates PARP1, consistent with previous findings in glioma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hirakata et al., 2021</xref>), thereby exacerbating DNA damage and limiting DNA repair capacity. In contrast, AZ3146-treated embryos maintain PARP1 expression and exhibit increased HIF1A activity, which appears to support the survival of extra-embryonic lineages and improve overall developmental potential.</p>
<p>These findings intersect with a broader conversation about embryo culture conditions. It has been proposed that standard culture practices shift from normoxia (20% oxygen) to more physiological hypoxia (5% oxygen) to better recapitulate the <italic>in vivo</italic>-like oviductal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alva et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, hypoxic culture conditions have been shown to improve the quality of mammalian blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ciray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>), though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Studies in somatic cells suggest that hypoxia enhances DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pietrzak et al., 2018</xref>). In line with this, we observed reduced DNA damage in aneuploid embryos cultured under hypoxic conditions, consistent with prior reports of lower γH2A.X levels in mouse blastocysts recovered from the uterus or cultured in low oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Houghton, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Meuter et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, recent work in cancer cells indicates that hypoxia may promote HIF1A-PARP1 interactions, enhancing DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Marti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pietrzak et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these findings highlight the interplay between chromosomal stress, lineage context, and the embryonic microenvironment in shaping cell fate during early development. A deeper mechanistic understanding of how DNA repair is regulated at pre-implantation stages will be crucial for elucidating how embryos tolerate or eliminate aneuploid cells — with important implications for improving embryo culture systems and fertility treatments.</p>
<p>Confined placental mosaicism, in which the placenta is aneuploid while the foetus is euploid, is a common phenomenon in human pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">McCoy, 2017</xref>). In previous work, we showed that aneuploid TE cells exhibit prolonged cell cycles and signs of senescence, whereas aneuploid ICM cells have an increased frequency of apoptosis in reversine-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest that abnormal, yet viable TE cells, may contribute to confined placental mosaicism. In the present study, we found that in AZ3146-treated embryos cultured under normoxic conditions, aneuploid cells contributed predominantly to the TE, followed by the EPI, and were especially depleted from the PE. Under hypoxic conditions, however, we observed a shift: aneuploid cells were more frequently eliminated from the EPI and enriched in the PE. These observations suggest that hypoxia modulates lineage-specific cell competition in mosaic embryos, potentially promoting a higher proportion of euploid cells in the EPI relative to the PE and TE. Moreover, we confirmed that the proportions of aneuploid cells in the TE and EPI do not correlate, consistent with the preferential survival of aneuploid cells in the TE and their selective elimination from the ICM. This is in line with clinical data showing low concordance of aneuploidy between TE and ICM in human mosaic embryos (30–40%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dahdouh &amp; Garcia-Velasco, 2021</xref>). Lineage-specific elimination of aneuploid cells by apoptosis has been described in an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of human post-implantation development using reversine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings mirror this distinction and further suggest that mechanisms of DNA repair—possibly involving PARP1 and HIF1A—may underlie the differential survival of aneuploid cells across lineages. Investigating how these pathways operate during post-implantation development will be crucial for understanding the developmental trajectories of mosaic embryos and the basis of placental mosaicism.</p>
<p>Since low- and medium-grade mosaic human embryos have similar developmental potential to fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greco et al., 2015</xref>), understanding the molecular pathways that govern the response to aneuploidy holds important translational promise. Given that the extent and proportion of aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos impact embryo viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>), strategies that reduce the aneuploid cell burden at the blastocyst stage may enhance the likelihood of a successful pregnancy. In this study, we targeted HIF1A as a potential regulator of aneuploid cell persistence and found that treatment with the HIF1A inhibitor IDF-11774 increased the proportion of euploid cells in mosaic embryos. Taken together, our findings reveal that specific environmental and molecular factors can modulate the composition of mosaic embryos, with potential implications for improving embryo quality and reproductive outcomes.</p>

<title>Pre-implantation embryo culture</title>
<p>Mice were maintained according to national and international guidelines. Four- to six-week-old B6SJLF1/J female mice were injected with 7.5 IU PMSG followed by 7.5 IU hCG 48 h later, to induce superovulation. The females were then mated with B6CBAF1/J males or were indicated, with E-cadherin GFP or mTmG transgenic males. Pre-implantation mouse embryos were recovered 24 h and 40 h after the hCG injection to obtain zygotes and 2-cell stage embryos, respectively in M2 medium (Sigma, M7167). We incubate the embryos in KSOM until 4-cell stage for the aneuploid treatment, around 53 h post hCG. When recovering zygotes, cumulus cells were removed with 0.3% hyaluronidase (Sigma, H4272) in M2. Embryos were cultured in regular KSOM (Sigma. MR-106) at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/air (Normoxia) or with pre-mixed 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/ 5% O<sub>2</sub> balance with nitrogen, biologic atmosphere batch (Airgas #Z03NI9022000033) (Hypoxia). Normoxia in our study was defined as the standard atmospheric oxygen levels in culture incubators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alva et al., 2022</xref>), whereas hypoxia (5% oxygen concentration) was the standard level of oxygen in the IVF clinics and can be used to better model physiological oxygen (physoxia), which varies from ∼1.5% to 8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alva et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Knudtson et al., 2022</xref>).

Females were received at 3-4 weeks of age and were maintained in the CALTECH animal facility, where they were housed with 5 same-sex littermates on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The temperature in the facility was controlled and maintained at 21 °C. All experimental procedures involving the use of live animals, or their tissues were performed in accordance with the NIH guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and the Institutional Biosafety Committee at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech, protocol number 1772). Reversine (Sigma, R3904), AZ3146 (Sigma, SML1427), PX-478 (Selleckchem, S7612), IDF-11774 (Selleckchem, S8771) and olaparib (Selleckchem, S1060) were dissolved in DMSO (Sigma, D2650) before use to specific concentration. They were respectively used at following final concentrations: 0.5 µM, 20 µM, 2 µM, 20 µM and 10 µM. Control embryos were incubated in the equivalent DMSO concentration. Drugs were dissolved in regular KSOM to the concentration of use. DMSO concentration in media should never pass 0.4%.</p>

<title>Embryo transfers and post implantation recovery and biopsy</title>
<p>Embryo transfer were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bermejo-Alvarez et al., 2014</xref>). CD1 females and vasectomizes CD1 males were obtained from Charles River. Reversine and AZ3146-treated blastocyst were transfer into 2.5-days pseudopregnant CD1 females. Around 16 AZ3146-treated embryos were transfer in the right uterine horn, whereas around 16 reversine-treated embryos were transfer in the left uterine horn of the same female as control. To evaluate implantation and embryo survival potency, uterine horns were recovered 5 days after surgery. Deciduas were dissected and post implantation embryos at stage E9.5 were recovered into PBST on ice. Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA at RT for 1 h, followed by washes through PBST before imaging. Images were taken using an Olympus LS stereo microscope with a 10x objective.

<p>Chimeric embryos were generated following a previous publish protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eakin &amp; Hadjantonakis, 2006</xref>). Briefly, wild-type, E-cadherin GFP or mTmG 8-cell stage embryos were transfer to micro-drops of M2 after aneuploid treatment. Zona pellucida was removed by treatment with acidic Tyrode’s solution (Sigma, T1788). The embryos were then incubated in Ca2+/Mg2+-free M2 (made in house) for 5 min and then disaggregated into individual blastomeres by gentle mouth pipetting. Mosaic chimeras were form by aggregation of four and four (1:1) of each treatment. Low mosaicism DMSO/AZ3146-treated blastomeres (1:1). Whereas medium mosaicism Reversine/AZ3146-treated blastomeres (1:1). Culture of the chimeras were performed under normoxic and hypoxia condition in KSOM for 48 h to reach blastocyst stage.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper developed a model of chromosome mosaicism by using a new aneuploidy-inducing drug (AZ3146), and compared this to their previous work where they used reversine, to demonstrate the fate of aneuploid cells during murine preimplantation embryo development. They found that AZ3146 acts similarly to reversine in inducing aneuploidy in embryos, but interestingly showed that the developmental potential of embryos is higher in AZ3146-treated vs. reversine-treated embryos. This difference was associated with changes in HIF1A, p53 gene regulation, DNA damage, and fate of euploid and aneuploid cells when embryos were cultured in a hypoxic environment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In the current study, the authors investigate the fate of aneuploid cells in the preimplantation murine embryo using a specific aneuploidy-inducing compound to generate embryos that were chimeras of euploid and aneuploid cells. The strength of the work is that they investigate the developmental potential and changes in gene expression profiles under normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions. Further, they also assessed how levels of DNA damage and DNA repair are altered in these culture conditions. They also assessed the allocation of aneuploid cells to the divergent cell lineages of the blastocyst stage embryo.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1(Public review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We deeply appreciate the reviewer comments on our manuscript. Following up the revisions, our manuscript has been improved thanks to their insightful remarks. We have proceeded with all the required changes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have still not addressed the inconsistent/missing description for sample size, the appropriate number of * for each figure panel, and the statistical tests used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Description of sample size, specific <italic>P</italic> value and statistical test used has been added it both in the main text, figures and figure legends.</p>
<p>The authors assign 5% oxygen as hypoxia. This is not the case as the in vivo environment is close to this value. 5% is normoxia. Clinical IVF/embryo culture occurs at 5% O2. Please adjust your narrative around this.</p>
<p>We define in our manuscript “normoxia” as the standard atmospheric oxygen levels in tissue culture incubators, which range from about 20–21% oxygen. Our definition of hypoxia is 5% concentration of oxygen, taking into consideration the standard levels of oxygen in the IVF clinics. Physiological oxygen in mouse varies from ~1.5% to 8% (Alva et al 2022). Considering that these levels of oxygen are the standard levels in tissue culture practices, a paragraph has been added to the discussion and materials and methods for further clarification</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>Given that this is a study on the induction of aneuploidy, it would be meaningful to assess aneuploidy immediately after induction, and then again before implantation. This is also applicable to the competition experiments on page 7/8. What is shown is the competitiveness of treated cells. Because the publication centers around aneuploidy, inclusion of such data in the main figure at all relevant points would strengthen it. There is some evaluation of karyotypes only in the supplemental - why? Would be good not to rely on a single assay that the authors appear to not give much importance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent point. However, due to the stochasticity of the arising of aneuploidies when embryos are treated with AZ3146 and reversine (Bolton et al 2016), every treatment is likely to generate different levels of aneuploidy. Due to this, and to the technical limitations of generating single-cell genomic DNA sequencing at the blastocyst stage, we were unable to determine the karyotype of all cells after different conditions. Nevertheless, Regin et al 2024 (eLife) showed similar results on the overall transcriptome changes of different dosages of aneuploidy: high dosage embryos overexpress p53, like reversine-treated embryos; meanwhile, low dosage embryos overexpress the hypoxic pathway, including HIF1A, similar to embryos treated with AZ3146.</p>

<p>Line 126-127: Please add a description for the results (morula) in Fig 1D, e.g., It appears that YH2Ax persists from 8-cell to morula when treated with Reversine but not AZ3146&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At the morula stage, the levels of γH2A.X in reversine- and AZ3146-treated embryos are similar (Fig. 1E). However, at the blastocyst stage, high levels of γH2A.X are maintained in reversine-treated embryos and reduced in AZ3146-treated embryos, suggesting some level of DNA repair between the morula-to-blastocyst stages (Fig. S2A). In contrast, in hypoxia, the levels of γH2A.X are low in the three treatments at the morula stages, suggesting that DNA repair can be enhanced under hypoxic conditions. Similar results have been reported in somatic cells (Marti et al., 2021; Pietrzak et al., 2018).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 213: PARP1 levels were also similar under all conditions; but Fig3E, top right shows PARP1 was significantly lower with Reversine treatment; also please correct me if i am wrong, but does the phrase &quot;all conditions&quot; cross reference yH2AX and PARP1 between Fig 3 and Fig 1 to show the impact of hypoxia? Because from my understanding Fig 1 was done in 20% oxygen, but Fig 3 was done in 5% oxygen – hypoxia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is correct. Modification in the manuscript has been performed for clarification</p>

<p>Line 644: you don't have a control for IDF treatment, so how did you differentiate between impact of aneuploid drugs vs IDF treatment alone? Would the impact observed be due to compounding effect of aneuploidy drugs + IDF?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great observation. We previously demonstrated that IDF-1174 treatments in embryos do not affect pre-implantation development (Fig. S3).</p>

<p>Line 682-685: &quot;...hypoxia favours the survival of reversine-induced aneuploid cells.&quot; does it? the statement before this says in Rev/AZ chimeras, AZ blastomeres contribute similarly to reversine-blastomeres to the TE and PE but significantly increase contributions to the EPI.Wouldn't this mean hypoxia favours survival of AZ aneuploid cells in EPI?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In normoxic conditions, AZ3146 treated cells in Rev/AZ chimeras contributed mostly to the EPI and TE but not PE. In contrast, in normoxic conditions, Rev-treated cells contributed similarly to all the lineages. This result seems to be due to a better survival of Rev-treated cells under normoxic conditions (Fig. 4D-E)</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Lines 45-46 understanding of reduction of aneuploidy should mention/discuss the paper of attrition/selection, of the kind by the Brivanlou lab for instance, or others. As well as allocation to specific lineages, including the authors' work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A section in the discussion has been added in response to this recommendation. Comparison between models is debatable.</p>
<p>The response does not clarify whether other papers were cited instead, or the authors own work that has shown preferential allocation to TE.</p>
