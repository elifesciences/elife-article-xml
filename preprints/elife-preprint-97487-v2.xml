<title>Abstract</title><p>Since double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective for silencing a wide variety of genes, all genes are typically considered equivalent targets for such RNA interference (RNAi). Yet, loss of some regulators of RNAi in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. Here we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene, where only the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and their exploratory simulations led us to find that (1) changing <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, (2) animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells and (3) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, is enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA. Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can trigger the conserved mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi) to degrade mRNA of matching sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fire et al., 1998</xref>), and thus silence gene expression, in many organisms. This conservation has made dsRNA-based drugs useful in crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Das and Sherif, 2020</xref>), insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Vogel et al., 2019</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). While a dsRNA-based drug can be designed using just the mRNA sequence of any target gene, the intracellular effectiveness of the drug and the ease with which an organism could escape the drug by developing resistance are difficult to predict. Predicting both efficacy and susceptibility to resistance for each target could inform the selection of a suitable target from two or more equivalent candidates. Extensive characterization of RNAi in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Seroussi et al., 2022</xref>)) makes it a suitable system to examine how differences between target genes and reliance on specific regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance.</p>
<p>A skeletal pathway that is required for gene silencing in response to the addition of dsRNA has been worked out in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Long dsRNA is imported through the transmembrane protein SID-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feinberg and Hunter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Winston et al., 2002</xref>), after which it is bound by the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tabara et al., 2002</xref>), which recruits the endonuclease DCR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Knight and Bass, 2001</xref>) to cleave the long dsRNA into smaller dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Parker et al., 2006</xref>). The primary Argonaute protein RDE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Parrish and Fire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tabara et al., 1999</xref>) cleaves one strand of the smaller dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Steiner et al., 2009</xref>) and associates with the other, making it a 1° short interfering RNA (siRNA) that can guide the recognition of target mRNAs of matching sequence (siRNAs; processing, pink). After recognition by RDE-1-bound siRNAs, the target mRNAs are cleaved and the 5′ fragments are stabilized through the addition of 3′ UG-dinucleotide repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Preston et al., 2019</xref>) by the nucleotidyltransferase RDE-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>) to form pUG RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shukla et al., 2020</xref>), which act as templates for the amplification of 2° siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pak and Fire, 2007</xref>) by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. This amplification of silencing signals through the production of 2° siRNAs is facilitated by the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), and their interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Uebel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). These 2° siRNAs are bound by one of several Argonautes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>), resulting in the eventual degradation of target mRNAs in the cytoplasm, which requires a cytoplasmic Argonaute, and/or co-transcriptional silencing of the target gene in the nucleus, which requires a nuclear Argonaute (e.g., NRDE-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Guang et al., 2008</xref>) in somatic cells). Although it is difficult to compare the silencing of two different genes by controlling all relevant variables, past studies have highlighted gene-specific differences in the efficacy of RNAi under different conditions (e.g., when RNAi is enhanced through the loss of the exonuclease ERI-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kennedy et al., 2004</xref>), when nuclear silencing is blocked in somatic cells through loss of NRDE-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Raman et al., 2017</xref>), or when different concentrations of dsRNA are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhuang and Hunter, 2011</xref>)). Understanding the sources of such differences and the underlying mechanisms will improve our ability to design efficacious dsRNA drugs that are difficult to evade through the development of resistance.</p>

<p>(A) Overview of RNA interference in somatic cells. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA, blue) enters the cell through the importer SID-1 (import, teal), after which it is processed by the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 and the endonuclease Dicer into 1° short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are bound by the primary Argonaute RDE-1 (1° processing, pink). mRNA transcripts (green) recognized by these 1° siRNAs are modified after cleavage by the 3′ addition of UG repeats (pUG RNA) and act as templates for the amplification of 2° siRNAs aided by the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, the Maelstrom-domain containing protein RDE-10, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (2° amplification, orange). These 2° siRNAs can bind secondary Argonaute(s) (e.g., NRDE-3), which can then recognize additional complementary targets (2° recognition) and cause gene silencing. See text for details. (B) Gene schematics depicting the mutant alleles found in a genetic screen (black) and/or created using genome editing (blue). Black boxes indicate exons and red dots indicate locations of mutations. Allele names (e.g., <italic>jam139</italic>) and expected amino acid change in the corresponding proteins (e.g., mutation of a tyrosine codon to a stop codon, Y294*) are indicated. See <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1</xref> for details of genetic screen. (C and D) Response to <italic>bli-1</italic> or <italic>unc-22</italic> RNAi in different mutants. For each mutant, the fraction of animals that showed <italic>bli-1</italic> silencing or <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing (fraction silenced) and the numbers of animals scored (n) are shown. Asterisks indicate p &lt; 0.05 for each comparison (brackets) using Wilson’s estimates with continuity correction and error bars represent 95% confidence interval. (C) Of five isolates with a mutation in <italic>mut-16</italic>, four (<italic>jam138</italic>, <italic>jam140</italic>, <italic>jam141</italic>, and <italic>jam247</italic>) failed to silence <italic>bli-1</italic> (blue) but retained <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing (orange). The other mutant failed to silence both genes and additionally had a mutation in <italic>rde-10</italic> (<italic>mut-16(jam139) rde-10(jam248)</italic>). (D) Mutants created using genome editing recapitulated the selective silencing of <italic>unc-22</italic> in <italic>mut-16(-)</italic> single mutants (<italic>mut-16(jam148)</italic>) and the failure to silence both genes in <italic>mut-16(-) rde-10(-)</italic> double mutants (<italic>mut-16(jam148) rde-10(jam206)</italic>).

<p>Here we analyze the requirements for silencing two exemplar genes and use quantitative modeling to advance a parsimonious view of RNAi in somatic cells. We show that MUT-16, RDE-10, and NRDE-3 are each required for the silencing of <italic>bli-1,</italic> but any two of these proteins are sufficient for <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing. These differences can be explained by differences in the thresholds for silencing the two genes using an intersecting network of regulators but not by parallel pathways of regulation after primary mRNA recognition. The requirement for NRDE-3 but not for MUT-16 or RDE-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA, suggesting that loss of NRDE-3 has the least impact on the efficiency of silencing. A dynamic model of RNA changes during silencing by dsRNA reveals several criteria for efficient RNA silencing. Insights from modeling led us to discover the influence of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions on the requirements for RNAi, the recovery of animals from RNAi within non-dividing cells, and a dearth of pUG RNA production by 2° siRNAs.</p>

<title>Two genes with different thresholds for silencing reveal an intersecting network of regulators that mediate RNA interference</title>
<p>To identify regulators of RNA interference (RNAi), we performed a primary screen for mutants that disrupt the maintenance of mating-induced silencing of a transgene followed by a secondary screen for mutants that are also defective in the silencing of endogenous genes by ingested dsRNA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). Mating males with a transgene that expresses fluorescent proteins to hermaphrodites that lack the transgene can initiate silencing in progeny that lasts in descendants for hundreds of generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Devanapally et al., 2021</xref>), providing a stable strain that can be mutagenized to look for mutations that result in the recovery of expression from the fluorescent transgene. Of the 15 fertile mutants that showed re-expression, whole-genome sequencing followed by in silico complementation (see Materials and Methods), revealed five mutants that had premature stop codons in <italic>mut-16</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), a known regulator of RNAi that is required for the production of secondary siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Uebel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). MUT-16 is detectable in the germline localized within perinuclear foci, but it is also found throughout the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Uebel et al., 2018</xref>). MUT-16 is required for the silencing of all tested somatic targets except the muscle gene <italic>unc-22</italic>, which showed residual silencing (‘+++’ vs ‘+’ but not ‘-‘ in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>)) consistent with its early identification as a sensitive target for RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fire et al., 1998</xref>). While all five putative <italic>mut-16</italic> mutants failed to silence the hypodermal gene <italic>bli-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), only four of the five showed <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Upon further analysis of the mutant that failed to silence <italic>unc-22</italic>, we found that this mutant also contained a missense mutation in RDE-10, another known regulator of RNAi that is required for the production of secondary siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). This missense mutation (Ser228Phe) is expected to disrupt the Maelstrom domain of RDE-10 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C</xref>), and thus could result in a loss of RDE-10 function. Although the biochemical function of RDE-10 is unknown, it has structural homology with the 3’-5’ exonuclease ERI-1 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – Supplement 2</xref>). To eliminate possible confounding effects of multiple mutations in strains isolated from a genetic screen, we used Cas9-mediated genome editing to introduce mutations in <italic>mut-16</italic> (null) and/or <italic>rde-10</italic> (null or a missense mutation that encodes Ser228Phe) in a wild-type background (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). While the newly created <italic>mut-16(null)</italic> mutants showed <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing as expected, <italic>mut-16(null) rde-10(null)</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>right,</italic> Figure S2B) double mutants failed to silence <italic>unc-22</italic>. Since <italic>unc-22</italic> is a particularly sensitive target for RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fire et al., 1998</xref>), this lack of <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing in the absence of two regulators with roles in the amplification of 2° siRNAs suggests that 1° siRNA production and RDE-1-mediated recognition of the mRNA is likely not sufficient to cause silencing of most genes. These observations suggest that MUT-16 and RDE-10 are redundantly or additively required for silencing <italic>unc-22</italic> and that the Maelstrom domain of RDE-10 is required for this function. Since the primary Argonaute RDE-1 is required for the silencing of all somatic targets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Parrish and Fire, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tabara et al., 1999</xref>)), including <italic>unc-22</italic>, we propose that MUT-16 and RDE-10 act in parallel downstream of RDE-1 to promote the amplification of 2° siRNA. This branching of the RNAi pathway downstream of RDE-1 could result in strictly parallel pathways where MUT-16 and RDE-10 are used to silence different sets of genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>left</italic>) or in an intersecting network where both regulators contribute to the silencing of all genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <italic>right</italic>).</p>
<p>Additional observations suggest differences in the requirements for silencing <italic>bli-1</italic> and <italic>unc-22</italic>. Animals that lack MUT-16 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), RDE-10 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) or the somatic nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Raman et al., 2017</xref>) fail to silence <italic>bli-1</italic> but not <italic>unc-22.</italic> However, <italic>rde-10(-); nrde-3(-)</italic> double mutants fail to silence <italic>unc-22</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, if there were strictly parallel pathways downstream of MUT-16 and RDE-10, then NRDE-3 would be expected to function downstream of MUT-16 but parallel to RDE-10. To test this possibility, we generated <italic>nrde-3(-)</italic> mutants using genome editing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and compared silencing in single mutants and double mutant combinations using the newly generated mutants lacking MUT-16, RDE-10, or NRDE-3. As expected, all single mutants failed to silence <italic>bli-1</italic> but silenced <italic>unc-22</italic>. Surprisingly, all double mutants failed to silence both <italic>bli-1</italic> and <italic>unc-22</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). This requirement for any two of MUT-16, RDE-10, or NRDE-3 suggests that the RNAi pathway cannot be strictly parallel downstream of RDE-1 (see <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>The stark differences in the extents of silencing <italic>bli-1</italic> (∼0%) versus <italic>unc-22</italic> (∼100%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) in animals lacking MUT-16, RDE-10, or NRDE-3 suggest that there could be target-specific pathways for silencing, tissue-specific differences in the expressions of RNA regulators, or more parsimoniously, that each regulator contributes to the silencing of both targets as part of an intersecting network, through transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) and/or post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), with <italic>unc-22</italic> being more sensitive to silencing than <italic>bli-1</italic>. For such an intersecting network with quantitative contributions by multiple regulators of RNAi to explain the silencing of somatic targets, including targets like <italic>unc-22</italic> and <italic>bli-1</italic> that show dramatic differences, it should be possible to identify values for the relative contributions of each regulatory path (<italic>𝒩𝓂</italic> = from MUT-16 to NRDE-3<italic>, 𝒩𝓇</italic> = from RDE-10 to NRDE-3, <italic>𝒪𝓂</italic> = from MUT-16 to other Argonautes, and <italic>𝒪𝓇</italic> = from RDE-10 to other Argonautes in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>) and for gene-specific thresholds (<italic>T<sub>bli-1</sub></italic> = level of BLI-1 function below which a defect is detectable, and <italic>T<sub>unc-22</sub></italic> = level of UNC-22 function below which a defect is detectable) that are consistent with all experimental data (‘constraints’ in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Of the 100,000 sets of parameters simulated, 145 sets satisfied all experimental constraints (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These allowed parameter sets were obtained despite the conservative assumption that the levels of mRNA knockdown for detecting observable defects for <italic>bli-1</italic> and <italic>unc-22</italic> are similar. Relaxing this assumption will lead to a larger number of allowed parameter sets. These valid parameter sets included cases with different relative contributions from RDE-10 and MUT-16 to NRDE-3-dependent silencing for a range of threshold differences for silencing <italic>bli-1</italic> versus <italic>unc-22</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, left). Furthermore, extreme contributions of MUT-16 versus RDE-10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, middle) or NRDE-3 versus other Argonautes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, right) were absent. Finally, only thresholds for <italic>bli-1</italic> silencing that are less than ∼5.5x the threshold for <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing were supported despite the allowed range of up to 100x (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with different quantitative contributions to silencing by each regulator, reducing the availability of <italic>unc-22</italic> dsRNA revealed a graded silencing response: <italic>mut-16(-)</italic> &lt; <italic>rde-10(-)</italic> &lt; <italic>nrde-3(-)</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; ∼5% silencing in <italic>mut-16(jam148)</italic>, ∼15% in <italic>rde-10(jam206)</italic> and ∼70% in <italic>nrde-3(jam205)</italic>). Consistent with the possibility of differential contributions from each regulator for different targets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), while partial silencing is observable in the absence of NRDE-3 but not MUT-16 or RDE-10 when the muscle gene <italic>unc-54</italic> is targeted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), partial silencing is observed in the absence of MUT-16 but not NRDE-3 or RDE-10 when the hypodermal gene <italic>dpy-7</italic> is targeted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <italic>right</italic>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results are consistent with a single network for RNAi targeting somatic genes where intersecting regulatory pathways downstream of mRNA recognition provide quantitative contributions to silencing.</p>

<title>The genetic requirement for NRDE-3, but not for MUT-16 and/or RDE-10, can be bypassed by enhancing dsRNA processing</title>
<p>The production of pUG RNAs and 2° siRNAs requires the participation of mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), making the contributions of some steps during RNAi gene-specific. Therefore, genes could differ in their dependence on proteins required for steps downstream of dsRNA processing and 1° siRNA production. Such differential dependencies could in principle be overcome by increasing the amount of available processed dsRNA and/or 1° siRNA when alternative parallel paths are available (e.g., loss of NRDE-3, MUT-16, or RDE-10 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) but not when no alternative paths are available (e.g., loss of both MUT-16 and RDE-10 in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) or when the increase in dsRNA processing is insufficient. To test these predictions, we increased dsRNA processing and examined silencing in animals lacking different regulators required for the silencing of <italic>bli-1</italic> and/or <italic>unc-22</italic>.</p>
<p>One approach for increasing dsRNA processing is the release of factors such as the endonuclease DCR-1 from competing endogenous pathways by removing the exonuclease ERI-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to the increased availability of DCR-1 when ERI-1 is removed, downstream factors involved in siRNA amplification (e.g. MUT-16, MUT-2/RDE-3, RDE-10/11, etc.) and 2° Argonautes (e.g. WAGOs) would be more available to contribute to silencing in response to ingested dsRNA. We used available <italic>eri-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>mg366</italic>) and mutants generated using Cas9-mediated genome editing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>jam260</italic> to <italic>jam264</italic>) to test if requirements for silencing <italic>bli-1</italic> and/or <italic>unc-22</italic> could be bypassed. Loss of ERI-1 enabled <italic>bli-1</italic> silencing in animals lacking NRDE-3, but not in animals lacking RDE-10 or MUT-16 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, loss of <italic>eri-1</italic> was not sufficient for the complete rescue of <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing in animals lacking any two of these three regulators (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). An alternative approach for increasing dsRNA processing is the overexpression of the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4, which recruits dsRNA for processing by DCR-1 (8, 10). Minimal amounts of RDE-4 can support RNAi as evidenced by silencing in <italic>rde-4(-)</italic> adult progeny of <italic>rde-4(+/-)</italic> hermaphrodites (Figure S7E in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Marré et al., 2016</xref>)) and in <italic>rde-4(-)</italic> animals with trace levels of ectopic expression from multicopy <italic>rde-4(+)</italic> transgenes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Raman et al., 2017</xref>)). We found that even hemizygous males expressing <italic>rde-4(+)</italic> from a single-copy transgene driving expression in the germline and the intestine under the control of the <italic>mex-5</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Marré et al., 2016</xref>) was sufficient for rescuing both <italic>bli-1</italic> and <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Similar expression of <italic>rde-1(+)</italic>, however, was not sufficient for rescuing silencing in <italic>rde-1(-)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that small amounts of RDE-4 but not RDE-1 are sufficient for RNAi. RDE-4 can be selectively overexpressed in the hypodermis using a single-copy transgene with a <italic>nas-9</italic> promoter (overexpression evident in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> Supplement 1; and selectivity demonstrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Raman et al., 2017</xref>)). This hypodermal expression of <italic>rde-4(+)</italic> was sufficient to enable <italic>bli-1</italic> silencing in an otherwise <italic>rde-4(-); nrde-3(-)</italic> background (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, either loss of ERI-1 or overexpression of RDE-4 can bypass the need for NRDE-3 for silencing <italic>bli-1</italic>, suggesting that the requirement for this regulator does not reflect a specific need for a particular regulator (NRDE-3) but reflects a larger amount of silencing signals required for reducing <italic>bli-1</italic> function sufficiently to cause a detectable defect. However, loss of ERI-1 and/or overexpression of RDE-4 could not compensate for the loss of RDE-10 or MUT-16 for <italic>bli-1</italic> silencing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting that these regulators make a more substantial contribution to <italic>bli-1</italic> silencing than NRDE-3. These observations further support the idea that 1° siRNAs alone are not sufficient to cause silencing, consistent with the lack of <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing in <italic>mut-16(-) rde-10(-)</italic> double mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, 1D). One explanation for these results is that in <italic>eri-1(-); nrde-3(-)</italic> double mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), a different 2° Argonaute is able to compensate for the lack of NRDE-3, whereas in <italic>mut-16(-); eri-1(-)</italic> or <italic>rde-10(-); eri-1(-)</italic> double-mutants, the reduction of 2° siRNAs is too great to cause a detectable Bli-1 defect.</p>

<p>(A) An outline of the mechanism of RNAi (<italic>left</italic>) has been deduced from experiments dissecting the response of animal populations, changes in RNA populations, and biochemical sub-steps (e.g., 2° siRNA production using pUG RNA), each of which can be separately modeled (<italic>right</italic>).

<title>Quantitative modeling of RNA interference and mRNA production provides rationales for a variety of target-specific outcomes</title>
<p>The many protein regulators of RNAi drive changes in RNA metabolism, including the production of new RNA species (1° siRNA, 2° siRNA, and pUG RNA), that are associated with the targeted gene. Although these changes can be indicators of RNA silencing, the quantitative relationship between such RNA intermediates and the extent of gene silencing measured as a reduction in function of the targeted gene or its mRNA levels is unclear. A priori, reduction in the mRNA levels of a gene could depend on universal processing of imported dsRNA, production of secondary small RNAs with the participation of gene-specific mRNAs, and downregulation of pre-mRNA and/or mRNA influenced by pre-existing gene-specific RNA metabolism. To understand how these gene-specific factors could influence RNA silencing, we began by analyzing the impact of a few characteristics of a gene on mRNA (<italic>m</italic>) and pre-mRNA levels (<italic>p</italic>) after RNAi. We first used a sequential equilibrium model, where we assume each step must be completed before beginning the next, e.g. dsRNAs are fully processed into 1° siRNAs, then 1° siRNAs can recognize transcripts to result in the production of pUG RNAs, and so on (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1A</xref> and Supplemental Methods). We tested parameters that would result in varying levels of target RNA knockdown (790 of 1 million simulated parameters resulted in [<italic>m</italic>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &lt; [<italic>m</italic>], [<italic>m</italic>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &gt; 0, and [<italic>p</italic>]<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> &gt; 0; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1B</xref>). Under this simple model, we found that (1) RNAi can result in different residual concentrations of RNAs for different genes (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1C</xref>); (2) for a given gene, silencing can alter the ratio of pre-mRNA to mRNA (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1D-E</xref>); and (3) effective targeting of mRNA by primary or secondary small RNAs is required for strong silencing (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 1F</xref>). These observations hint at the influence of gene-specific factors on the functional outcome of RNAi and impel the exploration of a more detailed dynamic model.</p>
<p>A qualitative outline of the molecular mechanism for RNAi in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has been deduced based on a variety of studies over the last two decades (mechanism outline; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), but the cellular, subcellular, and kinetic details of every step remain obscure. Quantitative modeling of RNAi – or indeed any process of interest – could be done at many scales (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) based on the level of understanding sought and experimental data available for testing predictions. For example, the responses of different animals in a population to dsRNA exposure (population model; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) or the changes in key RNA species after entry of dsRNA into the cytosol (process model; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) could be modeled. At yet greater detail, one step such as the amplification of small RNAs using pUG RNA templates could be modeled by incorporating sequence bias, processivity of RdRP, etc. (biochemical model; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Of these scales, we focused on the process model because early process models of RNAi (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bergstrom et al., 2003</xref>)) were proposed before crucial discoveries on the biogenesis of 2° siRNAs without forming long dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pak and Fire, 2007</xref>) and the stabilization of mRNA templates as pUG RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Preston et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shukla et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we incorporated these recent developments and modeled how the addition of dsRNA could disrupt the steady-state RNA metabolism of the targeted gene using ordinary differential equations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). While there are many parameters that one could include in any model, we have used a conservative set of parameters for looking at the overall RNAi process without explicitly modeling sub-steps in detail. For example, production of 22G RNA is modeled as a single step rather than one that incorporates how the frequency of Cs in template mRNA, the subcellular localization of mRNA, secondary structure formation in mRNAs, etc. impact the efficiency of silencing. Similarly, genome sequence and its effect on transcription and/or splicing are modeled as a single step, rather than one that looks at frequency of repeats, sizes of introns, chromatin environment, etc. We expect that future studies will build upon this initial model hand-in-hand with the more sophisticated experiments needed to test such detailed hypotheses.</p>
<p>In this initial model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), the steady-state levels of pre-mRNA and mRNA – which depend on production, maturation, and turnover – could be altered upon the addition of matching dsRNA through the generation of new RNA species (1° siRNA, 2° siRNA, pUG RNA) that are also subject to turnover. To accommodate these known intermediates and interactions, we used six differential equations to describe the rate of change of key RNA species (dsRNA (<italic>ds</italic>), 1° siRNA (<italic>pri</italic>), pUG RNA (<italic>ug</italic>), 2° siRNA (<italic>sec</italic>), pre-mRNA (<italic>p</italic>), and mRNA (<italic>m</italic>)) with rate or binding constants for different processes (<italic>k1</italic> through <italic>k9</italic>), turnover rates for different RNAs (<italic>T<sub>pri</sub>, T<sub>ug</sub>, T<sub>sec</sub>, T<sub>p</sub>, T<sub>m</sub></italic>), and variables for the lengths of RNAs (<italic>l<sub>ds</sub></italic> – dsRNA; <italic>l<sub>m</sub></italic> – mRNA). For example, the rate of change over time for 1° siRNA is modeled as
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="527351v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which includes the idea that 1° siRNAs are cleaved into 22nt sequences at a certain rate dependent on the dsRNA concentration <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="527351v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the amount of 1° siRNAs that can bind target transcripts (𝑘2. [𝑝𝑟𝑖]. [𝑚]), and the turnover of the 1° siRNAs (𝑇<sub>𝑝𝑟𝑖</sub>. [𝑝𝑟𝑖]), which notably is dependent on the concentration of the 1° siRNAs.</p>
<p>To illustrate the relative dynamics of different RNA species upon the addition of dsRNA, we computed the concentrations of dsRNA, 1° siRNA, pUG RNA, 2° siRNA, pre-mRNA, and mRNA using the equations after assigning arbitrary values for the different constants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; see legend for parameter values). To account for the non-negative values of all RNA species within cells, we ensured that the values of incremental change <italic>dx</italic> for any species <italic>x</italic> was only added if (<italic>x+dx</italic>) &gt; 0 and set to be 0 if (<italic>x+dx</italic>) ≤ 0. This bounding of the rate equations allows for any approach to zero. As expected, the levels of dsRNA decrease (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, red) as it is processed into 1° siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, purple), which eventually decays because of turnover. This transient accumulation of 1° siRNA is followed by that of pUG RNAs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, green) and of 2° siRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, brown). Silencing of the target is reflected in the lowered levels of mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, blue) and pre-mRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, orange). However, these levels eventually recover upon turnover of the silencing intermediates (1° siRNA, pUG RNA, 2° siRNA). Although we assumed the turnover of 1° siRNA, 2° siRNA, and pUG RNA for the modeling, the experimental demonstration of recovery (either of individual RNA species or of the entire phenotype) from RNA silencing in non-dividing cells would be needed to support the existence of such turnover mechanisms for these different types of RNAs.</p>
<p>For any gene, the time to knockdown (t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic>) and the duration of knockdown (t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic>) could be used to evaluate the efficiency of RNAi (knockdown = 10% of initial mRNA concentration in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The different RNA species made downstream of 1° RNA binding in <italic>C. elegans</italic> provide the opportunity for multiple parameters to differ between genes. Therefore, we varied each parameter and examined t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> and t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> as indicators of efficiency (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 – figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> and t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> were uncorrelated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), with cases of rapid but transient knockdown, which would necessitate multiple dosing of dsRNA for sustained effects. While loss of function through the reduction of mRNA levels is often the intended goal of knockdown, RNA intermediates could serve as convenient and quantitative measures of molecular changes. For example, the abundant 2° siRNAs have been a widely used molecular indicator of silencing (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gu et al., 2009</xref>)). However, the maximal amount of 2° siRNAs that accumulate is not correlated with strong silencing as measured by the minimal amount of mRNA during knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Additionally, an increase in transcription generally resulted in poorer knockdown through changes in both t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> and t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), consistent with the obvious expectation that a gene with transcriptional upregulation during exposure to dsRNA will be more difficult to knockdown.</p>
<p>Efficient silencing using dsRNA is possible in many organisms, including mammals, despite silencing relying on mostly post-transcriptional degradation of mRNA without the production of pUG RNA or 2° siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sandy et al., 2005</xref>). To explore differences between genes that could impact the efficiency of RNA silencing universally in any system, we simulated knockdown through the post-transcriptional loss of mRNA alone by eliminating production of pUG RNAs, and thus downstream secondary small RNAs and transcriptional silencing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <italic>k3</italic> = 0). When a fixed amount of dsRNA was exposed to different genes with the same amount of mRNA at steady state, genes with higher mRNA turnover rates showed less efficient knockdown (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). This inverse relationship is expected because to maintain the same steady state levels, genes with higher mRNA turnover must also have higher mRNA production. As a result, for the same amount of added dsRNA and the same steady-state level of mRNA before exposure to dsRNA, the mRNA levels will recover faster for genes with higher production coupled with higher turnover.</p>
<p>In summary, varying a few gene-specific parameters clarified the diversity of outcomes that are possible in response to the same dose of dsRNA. Gene-specific differences make the time to knockdown and the duration of knockdown uncorrelated and reduce the utility of key intermediates of RNA silencing as predictors of knockdown efficiency. Increases in transcription during exposure to dsRNA and high turnover of mRNA coupled with high production at steady state reduce the efficiency of knockdown. While the predictions of the model include quantitative relationships that will require advances in the quantitative measurement of many steps during RNAi, the model also makes some qualitative predictions that can be immediately tested.</p>

<title>Changing <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of a gene impacts its requirements for silencing by dsRNA</title>
<p>A key realization from the exploration of the dynamic model for RNAi is that pre-existing RNA regulation of a gene impacts the response to dsRNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). However, the individual impacts of the many features of a gene that together set its RNA metabolism (e.g., promoter, 3′ <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, introns, genomic location, etc.) are usually unknown.

Yet, we were able to discern an enhancement upon addition of <italic>unc-22</italic> dsRNA. This enhancement was absent in animals lacking NRDE-3.

<title>Gene expression can recover after knockdown despite the presence of amplification mechanisms</title>
<p>The dynamic model (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) assumes that all key RNA intermediates (1° siRNA, 2° siRNA, and pUG RNA) are subject to turnover. If this assumption is true, animals should be able to recover from RNA silencing in non-dividing cells despite the production of abundant 2° siRNAs using RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Experimental detection of the re-establishment of wild-type phenotype after a pulse of RNAi would provide evidence not only for the recovery of mRNA levels but also the subsequent production of functional protein. To test this possibility, we exposed wild-type animals to a 1-hr pulse of dsRNA matching the sensitive target <italic>unc-22</italic> and examined them for the Unc-22 defect every 24 hours (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). With this limited exposure to dsRNA, we observed only ∼80% silencing after the first 24 hours, which reached ∼100% by day 3, suggesting that it takes a couple of days after exposure to small amounts of dsRNA to observe complete silencing. This delay could be driven by the time required for the buildup of RNA intermediates required for silencing (1° siRNA, 2° siRNA, and/or pUG RNA), for the turnover of UNC-22 protein, and/or for the dissipation of events downstream of the molecular role of UNC-22. Consistent with recovery, silencing was only observed in ∼50% of the animals on day 5, which dropped to ∼36% by the eighth day after RNAi. In contrast, animals that were continually fed <italic>unc-22</italic> RNAi showed ∼100% silencing even at day 7 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that the RNAi machinery remains functional in aging animals. Since the body-wall muscle cells – where <italic>unc-22</italic> functions – do not divide during adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krause and Liu, 2012</xref>), this observation of recovery from silencing cannot be explained by the dilution of dsRNA and/or RNA intermediates through cell division. Thus, these results support the turnover of all key RNA intermediates generated during RNAi – 1° siRNA, 2° siRNA, and pUG RNA, and highlights for the first time that a target gene can recover from RNAi even in non-dividing cells despite their use of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to amplify silencing signals.</p>

<title>Sequences in mRNA that match the trigger dsRNA are hot zones of pUG RNA production</title>
<p>Of the RNA intermediates generated during RNAi, pUG RNAs have been proposed to be used as stable templates to produce small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shukla et al., 2020</xref>). Sustained production of small RNAs could occur if the targeting of mRNA by 2° siRNA resulted in further pUG RNA production, subsequent 3° siRNA production, and so on, thereby providing a way for silencing to persist despite the turnover of all RNA species. However, the production of such 3° siRNA has been observed only when targeting a germline gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sapetschnig et al., 2015</xref>) and not when targeting a somatic gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pak et al., 2012</xref>). To examine whether such repeated rounds of pUG RNA production occur during RNAi of <italic>unc-22</italic>, we fed wild-type worms bacteria that express <italic>unc-22</italic> dsRNA or control dsRNA (L4440) and looked for the presence of pUG RNAs. These RNAs are detected as a heterogenous mixture using RT-PCR with a poly-CA 3′ primer and gene-specific 5′ primers. Consistent with the production of pUG RNAs upon targeting by 1° siRNAs, we detected pUG RNAs generated after cleavage within the <italic>unc-22</italic> mRNA sequence that matches the dsRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, 0kb 5′ primer). Since 2° siRNAs are made with a 5′ bias on the mRNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pak and Fire, 2007</xref>), pUG RNAs generated in response to targeting by 2° siRNAs are expected to include mRNAs cleaved upstream of the sequence matching the dsRNA. Surprisingly, all pUG RNAs detected using a 5′ primer ∼1kb upstream of the target sequence were larger than 1 kb (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, 1kb 5′ primer), suggesting that there is a dearth of pUG RNA formation through cleavage within 1 kb upstream of sequences targeted by dsRNA. Notably, this absence is despite the expected relative ease of amplifying shorter sequences when compared with amplifying longer sequences using the same primers. This lack of detectable pUG RNAs upstream suggests that, during RNAi in somatic cells, the addition of pUG tails is enriched within a zone on target mRNAs that share homology with the dsRNA trigger (“pUG zone”). This restricted production of pUG RNAs supports the idea that amplification is not perpetual and that mRNA levels can thus recover over time.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results suggest that an intersecting network of regulators formed by the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, the Maelstrom-domain protein RDE-10, the nuclear Argonaute NRDE-3, and other Argonaute proteins can explain silencing of somatic targets by RNA interference despite stark differences in the genetic requirements for silencing different genes. The requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing or by changing the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences of the target gene. However, the combined loss of both MUT-16 and RDE-10 eliminates all detectable silencing and this requirement cannot be overcome by enhancing dsRNA processing. Animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, which supports the turnover of all key RNA intermediates (1° siRNA, 2° siRNA, and pUG RNA). Consistent with the ability to recover from silencing, unlimited rounds of siRNA amplification are curbed by restricting the cleavage and tailing of mRNAs for making pUG RNAs to ‘pUG zones’ that match the dsRNA sequence (see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> for an overview of findings).</p>

<title>Universal and gene-specific requirements for RNAi</title>
<p>RNAi requires the entry of dsRNA into cells, the processing of dsRNA into small RNAs, recognition of target mRNA, generation of additional small RNAs, and downstream gene silencing mechanisms. The upstream processes of entry, processing, and recognition do not depend on the mRNA being targeted and are thus presumably universal. Consistently, the dsRNA importer SID-1, the endonuclease DCR-1, and the primary Argonaute RDE-1 are required for all RNAi. In contrast, since the mRNA is used as a template to generate the abundant secondary small RNAs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pak et al., 2012</xref>) or additional dsRNAs in other systems (e.g., in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sanan-Mishra et al., 2021</xref>)), the silencing of different mRNAs could diverge through the selective recruitment of different collections of regulators. In support of this possibility, the two model genes we analyze in this study, <italic>unc-22</italic> and <italic>bli-1</italic>, show stark differences in the requirements of some RNAi factors for silencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). While these differences could be attributed to their expression in different tissues, the ability to bypass some requirements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) argues against this possibility. Specifically, if the requirement for NRDE-3 for silencing <italic>bli-1</italic> (hypodermal gene) but not <italic>unc-22</italic> (muscle gene) is because of the lack of a parallel regulator in the hypodermis but not in the muscle, then enhancing dsRNA processing would be unable to bypass the NRDE-3 requirement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Neither the silencing of <italic>dpy-7</italic> nor the silencing of <italic>bli-1p::gfp</italic> requires NRDE-3 for silencing despite their expression in the hypodermis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Strikingly, changing the 3′<italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences of <italic>bli-1</italic> also made its silencing largely independent of NRDE-3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), providing direct evidence for the prior regulation of a gene dictating the genetic requirements for silencing in response to dsRNA. The fact that any two of MUT-16, NRDE-3, and RDE-10 – three structurally and functionally different proteins – are required for <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing suggests that each of these proteins could be contributing to silencing of any RNAi target. Despite this potential use of an intersecting network for silencing all somatic genes, different genes could critically depend on different regulators because of differences in their mRNA metabolism and/or subcellular localization (summarized as threshold differences in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Intermediate steps that require the participation of mRNA such as the production of 2° siRNA could have complex dependencies, making RNA intermediates poor predictors of silencing efficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). For example, the subcellular localization of mRNA could increase or decrease its interaction with RdRPs and thus influence the levels of 2° siRNAs made. Future studies that address the dynamics and subcellular localization of target mRNA before RNAi and the subcellular localization of components of the RNAi machinery are required to test these hypotheses.</p>

<title>Production of 2° siRNAs</title>
<p>Multiple small RNA species of defined lengths and 5′-nt bias have been detected in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Of these, 22G RNAs (2° siRNAs) are the most abundant and arise from amplification downstream of exposure to dsRNA and in multiple endogenous small RNA pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gu et al., 2009</xref>). Our results suggest that production of 2° siRNAs in response to dsRNA is eliminated in animals that lack both MUT-16 and RDE-10 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). While the precise mechanisms of amplification are unknown, MUT-16 is thought to nucleate perinuclear foci in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Uebel et al., 2018</xref>) that recruit many additional components – RDE-2, MUT-7, MUT-14, MUT-15, NYN-1, NYN-2, RDE-8, RDE-3/MUT-2 etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Phillips and Updike, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Uebel et al., 2018</xref>). Similar interactions may occur in somatic cells despite the lack of detectable perinuclear foci. The roles of most of these proteins remain obscure, but RDE-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>) and RDE-3/MUT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shukla et al., 2020</xref>) have demonstrated roles in the cleavage and pUGylation of mRNAs, respectively. Yet, the observation of silencing in the absence of MUT-16 that is eliminated upon additional loss of RDE-10 suggests that RDE-10 and associated proteins (e.g., RDE-11, RDE-12) play an independent role in the amplification of 2° siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). The subcellular localization of RDE-10 and whether small RNAs that require RDE-10 for production also rely on RDE-8 and RDE-3/MUT-2 as expected for amplification using pUG RNA templates remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Loss of RDE-10 reduces the production of 22G RNAs downstream of exogenous dsRNA and downstream of endogenous small RNAs called 26G RNAs that are 26-nt long and have a 5′ G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Current models for the production of 26G RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blumenfeld and Jose, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chaves et al., 2021</xref>) propose that the RdRP RRF-3 transcribes long antisense RNA from internal C nucleotides on template mRNA, the phosphatase PIR-1 converts the 5′ triphosphate of the RdRP product into 5′ mono phosphate, the template is then trimmed by the 3′-5′ exonuclease ERI-1 to generate a blunt-ended dsRNA, which is then cleaved by DCR-1 to generate the mature 26G RNAs that are bound by the Argonaute ERGO-1. While a similar preference by RdRPs can explain the 5′G bias of the downstream 22G RNAs, the mechanism(s) for generating RNA that are precisely 22 nucleotides long remain unclear. This precision could be achieved either through the trimming of template mRNAs into 22-nt long pieces or through the trimming of secondary small RNAs made by RdRPs into 22-nt long pieces. The detection of long pUG RNAs with no detectable shorter pUG RNAs upstream of sequences matching the dsRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) argues against the 3′ trimming of mRNA templates to generate shorter RNAs that then get pUGylated to become stabilized templates for RdRPs and against pUG RNA generation driven by successive rounds of 22G RNA production in somatic cells. Furthermore, potential 5′ trimming or endonucleolytic cleavage of long pUG RNA to generate a 22-nt template for RdRPs cannot explain the 5′G bias of 22G RNAs. Since Argonautes bind the 5′ end of small RNAs and can associate with RNAs of different lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ruby et al., 2006</xref>), we suggest a model whereby RDE-10 and downstream Argonautes together play a role in the maturation of 22-nt siRNAs from longer RdRP products.</p>
<p>RDE-10 has a conserved Maelstrom domain that shares homology with the DnaQ-H 3′–5′ exonuclease family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) and the mutation we identified as disrupting silencing by dsRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) alters a residue located near the highly conserved ECHC zinc-binding motif (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C</xref>). Intriguingly, the Maelstrom domain of RDE-10 shares high structural homology with the 3′-5′ exonuclease domain of ERI-1 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2C</xref>, <italic>left</italic>) but not the exonuclease domain of MUT-7 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2C</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). ERI-1 can trim single-stranded RNA overhangs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kennedy et al., 2004</xref>) and is required for the production of 26G RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duchaine et al., 2006</xref>) and for the maturation of rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gabel and Ruvkun, 2008</xref>). While no 3′–5′ exonuclease activity of RDE-10 or its orthologs has been demonstrated, Maelstrom domain-containing proteins in insects exhibit single-stranded RNA endonuclease activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Matsumoto et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, RDE-10 could interact with other parts of the RNA silencing machinery (e.g., the Argonaute ERGO-1 as seen using immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>)) to recruit nucleases (e.g., NYN family exonucleases such as ERI-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>)) that trim pre-22G RNAs to the 22-nt size preferred by Argonaute proteins. In support of such exonucleolytic trimming in conjunction with Argonaute binding, the 3′-5′ exonuclease SND1 has been shown to trim the 3′ ends of miRNAs bound to AGO1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, piRNA maturation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice suggests a model where piwi-type Argonautes bind the 5′ end of the pre-piRNA followed by endonucleolytic cutting and exonucleolytic trimming to generate consistently sized mature piRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stoyko et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, human ERI1 can trim Ago2-bound micro RNAs to 19-nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sim et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, we propose that the production of 22G RNAs in response to the addition of dsRNA occurs as follows: (1) non-processive RdRPs (e.g., RRF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aoki et al., 2007</xref>)) make a heterogenous mixture of short RNAs, (2) 2° Argonautes bind the 5′ end of these pre-secondary siRNA, (3) RDE-10 and/or associated protein(s) remove excess 3′ sequence to generate 22-nt siRNAs that are effectively retained by the mature siRNA-Argonaute complex. Similar mechanisms could be used to generate other 22G RNAs that are independent of RDE-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Future studies are needed to test each aspect of the model.</p>

<title>Trade-offs in RNA interference</title>
<p>RNAi is now a widely applied tool for gene silencing in plants, insects, and humans. Like <italic>C. elegans</italic>, plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sanan-Mishra et al., 2021</xref>) and some insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pinzón et al., 2019</xref>) have RdRPs that could be used to make 2° siRNAs, but many other animals, including humans, do not have RdRPs and thus are unlikely to produce 2° siRNAs. However, silencing can fade despite the production of 2° siRNAs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), highlighting the importance of dosage for all systems. Two parameters of importance for the acute efficacy of any dsRNA-based drug are the time to knockdown (t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) and duration of knockdown (t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The various values of t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> that are possible for each t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) cautions against using a rapid onset of silencing (low t<italic><sub>kd</sub></italic>) as the sole indicator of promise during early stages of drug development when long-term effects of a drug are often not evaluated in the interest of expedience. In short, a drug that takes longer to cause an effect could have a more long-lasting effect. Since a dsRNA drug can be synthesized for any target with equal effort, considerations for the choice of target could be worthwhile because differences in RNA metabolism between two targets of equal importance can influence the efficacy of the dsRNA drug in all systems. If two genes are at steady state, then the gene with higher mRNA turnover will be more difficult to knockdown because of higher rates of mRNA production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Similarly, in the absence of a steady state, a gene undergoing upregulation of transcription, splicing, and/or mRNA export during the administration of the drug will be difficult to knockdown (e.g., <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>In the longer term, a concern for any drug is the development of resistance. When a gene with a high threshold for silencing is targeted, it could rely on multiple regulators that act in parallel to contribute to silencing (e.g., <italic>bli-1</italic> in this study), making resistance through the mutation of any one regulator more likely and necessitating another round of drug development. In contrast, genes with a lower threshold may not require all the regulators for silencing (e.g., <italic>unc-22</italic> in this study), making them ideal targets that remain silenced despite single mutations in many regulators of RNAi (e.g., RDE-10, MUT-16, or NRDE-3 in this study). These trade-offs inform the choice of therapeutic targets and dosage for sustained use of dsRNA-based drugs in agriculture and in human health. Anticipating mechanisms for the development of resistance before widespread use of an RNAi-based drug or treatment will be crucial for avoiding futile cycles of innovation. The ideal drug would require a minimal dose and use multiple intersecting paths to silence the target gene.</p>

The <italic>lin-2</italic> mutation limits brood size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ferguson and Horvitz, 1985</xref>) and facilitates screening. Near-starved animals (P0) of all life stages were mutagenized using 1mM N-Ethyl-N-Nitrosourea (ENU, Toronto Research Chemicals) for 4-6 hours. Mutagenized animals were washed four times with wash buffer (0.01% Triton X-100 in M9) and 2-3 adult animals were placed on NG plates seeded with OP50. Over the next 3 weeks, F1, F2, and F3 progeny were screened to isolate mutants that show mCherry fluorescence. These animals were singled out (up to 7 animals from each P0 plate) and tested for the persistence of expression in descendants. Of the 15 fertile mutants isolated using this primary screen, five with mutations in <italic>mut-16</italic> were analyzed in this study.</p>

<title>Whole genome sequencing</title>
<p>Libraries were prepared using TruSeq DNA Library Prep kits (Illumina) and samples were sequenced at Omega Biosciences. The fastq files obtained after Illumina sequencing (1x PE 150 b, Omega Biosciences) were analyzed to identify candidate mutations responsible for the observed defects in the sequenced strains. For each strain, sequences were trimmed using cutadapt (v. 3.5), mapped to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (WBcel235/ce11) using bowtie2 (v. 2.4.2), sorted using samtools (v. 1.11), and the resulting .bam file was analyzed to call variants using snpEff (v. 5.0e). The variants classified as ‘HIGH’ or ‘MODERATE’ in the .ann.vcf file for each strain that were not shared by any two or more strains were culled as new mutations caused by mutagenesis in each strain. These new mutations in each strain were compared with those of all other strains (‘in silico complementation’) using a custom script to identify sets of strains with different mutations in the same genes.

<title>Rationale for inferences</title>
<sec id="s4k1">
<title>Prior knowledge</title>
<p>Gene-specific requirements for RNA silencing could reflect specialization along pathways, as is supposed for multiple endogenous small RNA pathways in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Reasons that impact the efficiency of silencing a gene are obscure because of a lack of a quantitative model for RNAi that incorporates recently discovered RNA intermediates.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4k2">
<title>Evidence supporting key conclusions</title>
<p>Three different proteins, MUT-16, RDE-10, and NRDE-3, play a role in RNAi such that each is singly required for silencing <italic>bli-1</italic> but any two are sufficient for silencing <italic>unc-22</italic>. Simulations support the parsimonious hypothesis that this difference in requirements can be explained by quantitative contributions from regulators within an intersecting network for silencing both genes but not by parallel pathways downstream of mRNA recognition. Consistently, the requirement for NRDE-3 for silencing <italic>bli-1</italic> is bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA through the loss of ERI-1 or the overexpression of RDE-4.</p>
<p>A quantitative model for RNAi of any gene at steady state reveals several ways that differences in genetic requirements could arise for silencing different genes. Experimental tests that confirm predictions of the quantitative models include changes in the requirement for NRDE-3 for silencing caused by altering <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions of the gene targeted by dsRNA; recovery from silencing in non-dividing cells after exposure to a pulse of <italic>unc-22</italic> dsRNA, which supports the turnover of all key RNA intermediates (1° siRNAs, 2° siRNAs, and pUG RNAs) through mechanisms that are currently unknown; and the dearth of pUG RNA generation by 2° siRNAs, consistent with a lack of 3° siRNAs.</p>

<p>SUMMARY:</p>
<p>The goal of Knudsen-Palmer et al. was to define a biological set of rules that dictate the differential RNAi-mediated silencing of distinct target genes, motivated by facilitating the long-term development of effective RNAi-based drugs/therapeutics. This work provides insights into how 1) cis-regulatory elements influence the RNAi-mediated regulation of genes; 2) determines that genes can &quot;recover&quot; from RNAi-silencing signals in an animal; and 3) pUGylation occurs exclusively downstream of the dsRNA trigger sequence, suggesting 3º siRNAs are not produced. In addition, the authors show that the speed at which RNAi-silencing is triggered does not correlate with the longevity of the silencing. Overall, the work presented supports the conclusions of the authors. The insights are significant because they suggest that if we understand the rules by which RNAi pathways effectively silence genes with different transcription/processing levels then we can design more effective synthetic RNAi-based therapeutics targeting endogenous genes.</p>
<p>MAJOR STRENGTH:</p>
<p>The authors use a combination of computational modeling, genetics, and RNAi function assays to reveal several criteria for effective RNAi-mediated silencing of two distinct targets.</p>
<p>WEAKNESS:</p>
<p>It may be beyond the scope of this study, but it would be interesting to know the typical expression levels and turnover rates of unc-22 and bli-1. Based on the results from the altered cis-regulatory regions of bli-1 and unc-22 in Fig 5, it seems like the transcription/turnover rates of each of these genes could also be used as a proof of principle for testing the model proposed in Figure 4. The strength of the model would be further increased if the RNAi sensitivity of unc-22 reflects differences in its transcription/turnover rates compared to bli-1.</p>

<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>This manuscript by Knudsen-Palmer et al. describes and models the contribution of MUT-16 and RDE-10 in the silencing through RNAi by the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 or others. The authors show that MUT-16 and RDE-10 constitute an intersecting network that can be redundant or not depending on the gene being targeted by RNAi. In addition, the authors provide evidence that increasing dsRNA processing can compensate for NRDE-3 mutants. Overall, the authors provide convincing evidence to understand the factors involved in RNAi in C. elegans by using a genetic approach.</p>
<p>MAJOR STRENGTHS</p>
<p>The author's work presents a compelling case for understanding the intricacies of RNA interference (RNAi) within the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans through a meticulous genetic approach. By harnessing genetic manipulation, they delve into the role of MUT-16 and RDE-10 in RNAi, offering a nuanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms at play in two independent case study targets (unc-22 and bli-1).</p>
<p>MAJOR WEAKNESSES</p>
<p>(1) It is unclear how the molecular mechanisms of amplification are different under the MUT-16 and RDE-10 branches of the regulatory pathway, since they are clearly distinct proteins structurally. It would be interesting to do some small-RNA-seq of products generated from unc-22 and bli-1, on wild-type conditions and some of the mutants studied (eg. mut-16, rde-10 and mut-16 + rde-10). That would provide some insights on whether the products of the 2 amplifications are the same in all conditions, just changing in abundance, or whether they are distinct in sequence patterns.</p>
<p>(2) In the same line, Figure 5 aims to provide insights to the sequence determinants that influence on the RNAi of bli-1. It is unclear whether the changes in transcript stability dictated by the 3'UTR are the sole factor governing the preference for the MUT-16 and RDE-10 branches of the regulatory pathway. In line with the mutant jam297, it might be interesting to test whether factors like codon optimality, splicing, ... of the ORF region upstream from bli-1-dsRNA can affect its sensitivity to the MUT-16 and RDE-10 branches of the regulatory pathway.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The goal of Knudsen-Palmer et al. was to define a biological set of rules that dictate the differential RNAi-mediated silencing of distinct target genes, motivated by facilitating the long-term development of effective RNAi-based drugs/therapeutics. To achieve this, the authors use a combination of computational modeling and RNAi function assays to reveal several criteria for effective RNAi-mediated silencing. This work provides insights into how (1) cis-regulatory elements influence the RNAi-mediated regulation of genes; (2) it is determined that genes can &quot;recover&quot; from RNAi-silencing signals in an animal; and 3) pUGylation occurs exclusively downstream of the dsRNA trigger sequence, suggesting 3º siRNAs are not produced. In addition, the authors show that the speed at which RNAi-silencing is triggered does not correlate with the longevity of the silencing. These insights are significant because they suggest that if we understand the rules by which RNAi pathways effectively silence genes with different transcription/processing levels then we can design more effective synthetic RNAi-based</p>
<p>therapeutics targeting endogenous genes. The conclusions of this study are mostly supported by the data, but there are some aspects that need to be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words and for appreciating the practical utility of our approach and discoveries.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The methods do not describe the &quot;aged RNAi plates feeding assay&quot; in Figure 2E. The figure legend states that &quot;aged RNAi plates&quot; were used to trigger weaker RNAi, but the detail explaining the experiment is insufficient. How aged is aged? If the goal was to effectively reduce the dsRNA load available to the animals, why not quantitatively titrate the dsRNA provided? Were worms previously fed on the plates, or was simply a lawn of bacteria grown until presumably the IPTG on the plate was exhausted?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have elaborated our methods section to describe that the plates were left at 4ºC for about 4 months before adding bacteria and performing the assay, with one possible reason for the weaker knockdown being that perhaps the IPTG in the RNAi plates is less effective. However, it is worth noting that the robustness of a feeding RNAi assay can vary from culture to culture and/or batch of plates. We therefore always perform RNAi assays with wild-type animals alongside test strains to gauge the strength of the RNAi assay for a given culture and batch of plates. We called the data in Figure 2E “weak” because of the response of wild-type animals was weak as evidenced by weak twitching in levamisole. Despite this reduced effect, we observed 100% penetrance in wild-type animals, enabling us to sensitively detect the reduced responses of the mutants.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Is the data presented in Figure 2F completed using the &quot;aged RNAi plates&quot; to achieve the partial silencing of dpy-7 observed? Clarification of this point would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No. The only occasion when plates were older was as in response to comment 1 above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Throughout the manuscript the authors refer to &quot;non-dividing cells&quot; when discussing animals' ability to recover from RNA silencing. It is not clear what the authors specifically mean with the phrase &quot;non-dividing cells&quot;, but as this is referred to in one of their major findings, it should be clarified. Do they mean the cells are somatic cells in aged animals, thus if they are &quot;non-dividing&quot; the siRNA pools within the cells cannot be diluted by cell division? Based on the methods, the animals of RNAi assays were L4/Young adults that were scored over 8 days after the initial pulse of dsRNA feeding. If this is the case, wouldn't these animals be growing into gravid adults after the feeding, and thus have dividing cells as they grew?</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the need to explain this point further. Our experiment test the silencing of the unc-22 gene, which is expressed and functions in body-wall muscle cells. Most of the body wall muscles in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are developed by the L1 stage (reviewed in Krause and Liu, 2012), and they do not divide between the L4 and adult stages. Therefore, during the duration of the experiment where we delivered a pulse of dsRNA and examined responses over days, none of these cells divide. We have added a statement in the main text to explicitly say that the recovery from silencing by dsRNA that we observed cannot be explained by dilution during cell divisions.</p>

<p>(4) What are the typical expression levels/turnover of unc-22 and bli-1? Based on the results from the altered cis-regulatory regions of bli-1 and unc-22 in Figure 5, it seems like the transcription/turnover rates of each of these genes could also be used as a proof of principle for testing the model proposed in Figure 4. The strength of the model would be further increased if the RNAi sensitivity of unc-22 reflects differences in its transcription/turnover rates compared to bli-1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We can get a sense of the relative abundances of <italic>unc-22</italic> and <italic>bli-1</italic> across development from the RNA-seq experiments that have been performed by others in the field (see below). However, these data cannot be used to infer either the production or the turnover rates. Future experiments that measure production (the combined rate of transcriptional run-on, splicing, export from the nucleus, etc.) will be required to define the production rates. Similarly, assays that detect the rate of degradation of transcripts without confounding presence from continued production will be needed to establish turnover rates. Future efforts to obtain values for these in vivo rates for multiple genes will help further test the model.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Knudsen-Palmer et al. describes and models the contribution of MUT-16 and RDE-10 in the silencing through RNAi by the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 or others. The authors show that MUT-16 and RDE-10 constitute an intersecting network that can be redundant or not depending on the gene being targeted by RNAi. In addition, the authors provide evidence that increasing dsRNA processing can compensate for NRDE-3 mutants. Overall, the authors provide convincing evidence to understand the factors involved in RNAi in C. elegans by using a genetic approach.</p>
<p>Major Strengths:</p>
<p>The author's work presents a compelling case for understanding the intricacies of RNA interference (RNAi) within the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans through a meticulous genetic approach. By harnessing genetic manipulation, they delve into the role of MUT-16 and RDE-10 in RNAi, offering a nuanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms at play in two independent case study targets (unc-22 and bli-1).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words and for appreciating our genetic analysis.</p>

<p>Major Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It is unclear how the molecular mechanisms of amplification are different under the MUT-16 and RDE-10 branches of the regulatory pathway, since they are clearly distinct proteins structurally. It would be interesting to do some small-RNA-seq of products generated from unc-22 and bli-1, on wild-type conditions and some of the mutants studied (eg. mut-16, rde-10 and mut16 + rde-10). That would provide some insights into whether the products of the 2 amplifications are the same in all conditions, just changing in abundance, or whether they are distinct in sequence patterns.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we highlight in the paper, MUT-16 and RDE-10 are indeed very different proteins. One possible hypothesis suggested by this difference is that different kinds of small RNAs are made when the underlying mechanism relies on MUT-16 versus on RDE-10. However, postulating such a difference is not necessary for explaining the data. Furthermore, since the amounts of 2º siRNAs do not have to be correlated with the strength of silencing (Figure 4E), this work raises caution against the over-reliance on small RNA sequencing for inferring gene silencing. Nevertheless, it is indeed an attractive possibility that the amounts of small RNA, their distributions along mRNA sequence, and/or the sequence biases of the accumulating small RNAs could be different when relying on MUT-16- or RDE-10-dependent mechanisms. Future work that directly examine the small RNAs that accumulate in different mutant strains after initiating RNAi can shed light on these possibilities.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the same line, Figure 5 aims to provide insights into the sequence determinants that influence the RNAi of bli-1. It is unclear whether the changes in transcript stability dictated by the 3'UTR are the sole factor governing the preference for the MUT-16 and RDE-10 branches of the regulatory pathway. In line with the mutant jam297, it might be interesting to test whether factors like codon optimality, splicing, ... of the ORF region upstream from bli-1-dsRNA can affect its sensitivity to the MUT-16 and RDE-10 branches of the regulatory pathway.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 5, we eliminated the possibility that any gene that is transcribed using the <italic>bli-1</italic> promoter would require NRDE-3, and showed using <italic>jam297</italic> that modifications to the 3’ <italic>cis</italic> regulatory regions of a target can alter the dependence on NRDE-3 for knockdown. We agree that future experiments that control individual aspects of <italic>bli-1</italic>, potentially one feature at a time, can reveal the separate contributions of each characteristic of the gene to the observed dependence on NRDE-3 of the wild-type <italic>bli-1</italic> gene. However, given the many ways that the same level of transcript knockdown can be achieved in our modeling (Figure 4 and its supplemental figures) we expect that multiple characteristics could contribute to NRDE-3 dependence.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) On page 5, the authors state that &quot;MUT-16 and RDE-10 are redundantly or additively required for silencing unc-22&quot;; however, based on their data in Figure 1D, it seems nearly 100% silencing of unc-22 is achieved in single mut-16 or rde-10 mutants. If this is the case, wouldn't it suggest that redundancy of MUT-16 and RDE-10, and not an &quot;additive effect&quot; of MUT-16 and RDE-10 function? Although, as the mutator complex nucleates around MUT-16, the data in Figure 1D suggests it is possible that the presence of MUT-16 or RDE-10 is sufficient for the recruitment of one or more factors that triggers the silencing of unc-22, and thus only one of these factors is necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Because we are seeing 100% silencing in wild-type, <italic>mut-16(-)</italic>, or <italic>rde-10(-)</italic> animals in Figure 1D, this assay (where the silencing response is strong) does not allow us to discriminate between differing levels of silencing. The “weak” RNAi assay in Figure 2E provides the opportunity to observe differences in the contributions made by MUT-16 or RDE-10, supporting the idea that the 2º siRNAs and relative contributions to silencing can indeed be additive, explaining the complete loss of silencing only in the double mutant. While MUT-16 has been shown to be required for the recruitment of other <italic>Mutators</italic> in the germline, <italic>Mutator</italic> foci are not detectable in the soma. Given that <italic>unc-22</italic> and <italic>bli-1</italic> are somatic targets, we are hesitant to assume a mechanism for the production of small RNAs that requires a similar MUT-16-dependent nucleation in somatic cells. MUT-16 is clearly required for full silencing. But, if it functions similarly in the soma and the germline remains an open question. Indeed the mechanism(s) for producing small RNAs in somatic cells could be different from that used for production of small RNAs in the germline because of known differences in the use of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (e.g. Ravikumar et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2019). Future studies that determine the subcellular localization(s) and potential biochemical function(s) of RDE-10 and MUT-16 in somatic cells are needed to further delineate mechanisms.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for identifying these figures as being particularly crowded. These panels are presented as single units because the left and right portions of each panel are intimately connected. In Fig. 4A, the outline of mechanism deduced on the left is based on experiments at various scales shown on the right. We have now clarified this in the figure legend. In Fig. 4B, the equations on the right define and use the constants depicted on the left and the definitions below apply to both parts. We have now adjusted both figure parts to make these connections clearer.</p>

<p>I would encourage the authors to follow up on some of the more mechanistic comments made above, that would strengthen and complement the genetic part of the work presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that additional work is needed to elucidate differences in molecular mechanisms for amplifying small RNAs in an MUT-16-dependent vs. RDE-10-dependent manner. We hope to address these extensions of our work in future manuscripts that focus on the biochemistry of these proteins and the populations of small RNAs generated using them.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I appreciate the efforts to computationally model the dynamics of the system, but I am not sure that it helps that the mathematical modelling treats both branches of the pathway as functionally equals, since they could have some mechanistic specialisation that is not yet elucidated by the current work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our assumption that both branches are equivalent is the most parsimonious. If we allowed for differences, even more values for the parameters of the model will agree with experimental data. The strength of the model is that despite such conservative assumptions, it agrees with experimental data. Biochemical elaborations that make the MUT-16 and RDE-10 branches qualitatively different could exist in vivo as suggested by the reviewer. Even with such qualitative differences in detail, the overall impact on gene silencing is a quantitative and additive one as demonstrated by our experiments. Future experimental work focused on biochemistry could elucidate how a Maelstrom domain-containing protein (RDE-10) and an intrinsically disordered protein (MUT-16) act differently to ultimately promote small RNA production.</p>
