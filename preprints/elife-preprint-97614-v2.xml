<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cerebellar dysfunction leads to postural instability. Recent work in freely moving rodents has transformed investigations of cerebellar contributions to posture. However, the combined complexity of terrestrial locomotion and the rodent cerebellum motivate new approaches to perturb cerebellar function in simpler vertebrates. Here, we adapted a validated chemogenetic tool (TRPV1/capsaicin) to describe the role of Purkinje cells — the output neurons of the cerebellar cortex — as larval zebrafish swam freely in depth. We achieved both bidirectional control (activation and ablation) of Purkinje cells while performing quantitative high-throughput assessment of posture and locomotion. Activation modified postural control in the pitch (nose-up/nose-down) axis. Similarly, ablations disrupted pitch-axis posture and fin-body coordination responsible for climbs. Postural disruption was more widespread in older larvae, offering a window into emergent roles for the developing cerebellum in the control of posture. Finally, we found that activity in Purkinje cells could individually and collectively encode tilt direction, a key feature of postural control neurons. Our findings delineate an expected role for the cerebellum in postural control and vestibular sensation in larval zebrafish, establishing the validity of TRPV1/capsaicin-mediated perturbations in a simple, genetically-tractable vertebrate. Moreover, by comparing the contributions of Purkinje cell ablations to posture in time, we uncover signatures of emerging cerebellar control of posture across early development. This work takes a major step towards understanding an ancestral role of the cerebellum in regulating postural maturation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In vertebrates, cerebellar activity underlies proper posture, defined as the relative orientation of body parts in space <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The cerebellum integrates sensory information from vestibular (balance), visual, and proprioceptive systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. These sensations are transformed into precise and coordinated adjustments in muscle tone and contraction allowing animals to control posture <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Disruptions to mature cerebellar function lead to instability, unsteady gait and a compromised sense of balance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Development of the cerebellum coincides with postural maturation, and early development of the cerebellum has been extensively studied <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Notably, changes to morphology and activity of the output neurons of the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cells, are thought to underlie the gradual refinement of motor control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To date, the contributions of developing Purkinje cells to postural control remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Kinematic quantification by pose estimation in rodents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>has opened a window into cerebellar contributions to postural behaviors in health and disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, terrestrial gait and locomotion are complex and especially difficult to study during development; tracking and analysis is often limited to measures such as the time of head elevation or the duration of walking stance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In contrast, the biophysical challenges of maintaining posture underwater are straightforward to define <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. For example, larval zebrafish balance in the pitch axis (nose-up/nose-down) by timing locomotion to countermand gravity-induced destabilization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and by coordinated use of paired appendages (fins) and axial musculature (trunk) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The small size and rapid development of the larval zebrafish allow high-throughput measurements of postural control (i.e. pitch-axis kinematics and fin/trunk coordination) from freely swimming subjects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The larval zebrafish is a powerful model to investigate cerebellar development and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Anatomically, the zebrafish cerebellum shares the same circuit structure as the mammalian cerebellum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The zebrafish cerebellum is compartmentalized into regions with distinct response properties and output targets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Multimodal representations were found in both cerebellar granule cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>and Purkinje cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Functional assays established a role for the larval zebrafish cerebellum in motor control, sensorimotor integration and predictive neural processing, particularly in response to visual input <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Finally, brain-wide imaging studies have established balance-relevant sensitivity in the cerebellum, identifying neurons that encode body angle and velocity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and neurons responsive to direct inner-ear stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Overwhelmingly, this work has been done in reduced or restrained preparations, limiting insight into the cerebellar contribution to natural behaviors.</p>
<p>Powerful new opto- and chemogenetic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> approaches allow control of particular cerebellar cell types, reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Recent work used such activation/inhibition to investigate cerebellar contributions to sensorimotor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and non-sensorimotor behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>in health and disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Both approaches come with technical hurdles: optogenetics requires targeting light to the cerebellum, a particular challenge when untethered animals can move freely in depth, while chemogenetics uses bioactive co-factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. A chemogenetic approach to cerebellar control with a non-bioactive ligand would be a welcome advance, particularly to study posture without visual interference (i.e. in the dark). One validated path forward is to express the rat non-selective cation channel TRPV1 and its ligand capsaicin in zebrafish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. The endogenous zebrafish TRPV1 channel is capsaicin-insensitive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, so targeted expression of rat TRPV1 allows cell-type specific control: low-doses of capsaicin can activate sensory and hypothalamic neurons while high-doses are excitotoxic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Capsaicin can be dissolved in water and is readily absorbed by freely-swimming larval zebrafish, sidestepping invasive procedures and the need for visible light. Finally, the conductance of a TRP channel is ∼1000x that of a channelrhodopsin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> suggesting that even low levels of TRPV1 expression will be biologically effective.</p>
<p>Here we used the TRPV1/capsaicin system to investigate the contribution of cerebellar Purkinje cells to postural behaviors as larval zebrafish swam freely in depth. Both activation and ablation of Purkinje cells could induce changes in pitch axis posture. Ablation in older larvae resulted in bigger disruptions to posture, allowing inference of the functional consequences of cerebellar development. Furthermore, ablation of Purkinje cells in older larvae disrupted the coordination of trunk and paired appendages (fins), impairing vertical navigation. Finally, we could reliably decode pitch-tilt direction from patterns of Purkinje cell activity. Taken together our results establish a clear role for the cerebellum in larval zebrafish postural control, even during the earliest stages of development. More broadly, our work establishes a new method to manipulate cerebellar output while performing quantitative high-throughput measures of unconstrained posture and locomotion. Our data are therefore a step towards defining an ancestral role for the highly-conserved cerebellum in postural control.</p>

<p>Endogenous zebrafish TRPV1 channels are insensitive to capsaicin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Previous descriptions of rat TRPV1 in zebrafish sensory and hypothalamic neurons establish dose-dependent chemogenetic manipulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. We expect low-doses of capsaicin to depolarize Purkinje cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, left), while high-doses should be excitotoxic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, right).</p>
<p>First, we assayed capsaicin concentrations and incubation times to identify a dose that would achieve long-term depolarization without cell death. We co-expressed a nuclear-targeted calcium indicator, GCaMP6f (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) in all neurons using the <italic>Tg(elavl3:h2B-GCaMP6f)</italic> line for longitudinal imaging of neuronal activity. Previous work used 1 µM of capsaicin for long-term activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. We therefore imaged the cerebellum of <italic>Tg(aldoca:TRPV1-tagRFP)</italic>;<italic>Tg(elavl3:h2B-GCaMP6f)</italic> fish prior to and 3, 6, and 9 hours after 1 µM capsaicin treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We screened fish for comparable brightness and selected fish that had clearly visible expression but were not overly bright (Methods).</p>
<p>Prolonged exposure to a low dose of capsaicin increased cerebellar activity (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figures S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1E</xref>). At each timepoint, TRPV1-expressing cells showed increased intensity relative to a pre-capsaicin baseline, while TRPV1-negative cells did not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, 3/6 hours post 1 µM capsaicin: 28%/20%/TRPV1+ cells F/F<sub>0</sub> &gt; 2; 40 cells from 3 fish vs. 0%/0%/TRPV1-cells F/F<sub>0</sub> &gt; 2; 44 cells from 4 fish; activated cells after 6 h of capsaicin treatment: 0/44 TRPV1-vs. 8/40 TRPV1+; Fisher’s exact test: p = 0.0018)</p>
<p>Different cells showed increased activity at the 3,6, and 9 hour timepoints, and the same cells were differentially active at different timepoints. We interpret this as evidence that 1 µM of capsaicin could sporadically activate subsets of Purkinje cells. Notably, in one fish that had particularly strong tagRFP expression we observed a small number of neurons at the 9 h timepoint with bright, speckled fluorescence suggestive of cell death (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). We did not observe any signs of cell death at the 6 h timepoints (6 TRPV1+ fish at 6 h post 1 µM capsaicin). We therefore set an upper limit of 6 h of exposure to 1 µM capsaicin for activation experiments.</p>
<p>Induced activation was reversible, even after prolonged exposure to 1 µM of capsaicin. We tested whether the elevated patterns of neuronal activity that we observed in the presence of capsaicin would return to baseline by imaging cerebellar Purkinje cells in <italic>Tg(elavl3:h2B-GCaMP6f)</italic> before exposure, after 6 h of 1 µM capsaicin, and 40 min after washout. Relative to baseline, fluorescent intensities increased after 6 h, as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>. Importantly, fluorescence returned to baseline levels after 40 min of washout (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>, 6h post 1 µM capsaicin: 40.9%/TRPV1+ cells F/F<sub>0</sub> &gt; 2; washout: 0%/ TRPV1+ cells F/F<sub>0</sub> &gt; 2; 22 cells from 3 fish; activated cells before 1 µM capsaicin treatment vs. after washout: Fisher’s exact test: p = 1). We conclude that capsaicin-induced activation is reversible after washout.</p>
<p>Exposure to high doses of capsaicin caused rapid axonal degeneration and cell death. We developed a protocol for Purkinje cell lesion: <italic>Tg(aldoca:TRPV1-tagRFP)</italic> larvae (without GCaMP6f) were imaged at 7 dpf, at 8 dpf after 1 h of 10 µM capsaicin treatment and again at 9 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Timelapse imaging of the Purkinje cell axons showed rapid degeneration already 15 min after capsaicin treatment started (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Cell numbers rapidly declined after 1 h of 10 µM capsaicin treatment and did not show any signs of recovery at 9 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>) (median [inter-quartile range]; 7 dpf: control 213 [195 – 271] cells vs. pre lesion 282 [255 – 366] cells; 9 dpf: control 218 [201 – 250] cells vs. post lesion 68 [52 – 70] cells; 3 control and 3 lesioned fish).</p>
<p>Consistent with prior work in other cell populations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, we found that chemogenetic use of the capsaicin/TRPV1 system can be used to reversibly activate or rapidly ablate cerebellar Purkinje cells in larval zebrafish.</p>

<title>Purkinje cells regulate postural control in the pitch axis</title>
<p>We used our Scalable Apparatus to Measure Posture and Locomotion (SAMPL) to measure posture and locomotion in freely swimming zebrafish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. SAMPL is a high-throughput videographic approach that measures kinematic parameters of posture and locomotion from fish swimming in a predominantly vertical arena that encourages navigation in depth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>) allowing us to analyze postural changes in the pitch (nose-up/nose-down) axis. Larval zebrafish locomote in discrete bouts of rapid translation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, grey lines). To navigate up/down, fish sequence these bouts while maintaining a nose-up/nose-down pitch <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Notably, climb/dive bouts are defined relative to the <italic>trajectory</italic> of the bout. Climb/dive bouts can therefore be initiated from either nose-up (positive) or nose-down (negative) <italic>postures</italic>.</p>

<p>Nose-up “climb” bouts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) engage both axial musculature of the body and the fins to produce a net upward trajectory while nose-down “dive” bouts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>) rely on axial musculature alone and have a net downward trajectory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

<p>We used the timing and capsaicin concentrations we had previously validated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) to design two behavioral paradigms: one to activate and one to ablate cerebellar Purkinje cells. Experiments were done from 7–9 dpf, and began with a single day without perturbations. Activation was then achieved by exposing <italic>Tg(aldoca:TRPV1-tagRFP)</italic>; <italic>Tg(elavl3:h2B-GCaMP6f)</italic> fish to two 6h periods of 1 µM capsaicin while they swam freely in the dark (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Alternatively, Purkinje cells were ablated by exposing <italic>Tg(aldoca:TRPV1-tagRFP)</italic> fish to 10 µM of capsaicin for 1h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). All fish were screened before experiments for comparable levels of tagRFP fluorescence and control and experimental groups were randomly selected. A single experimental repeat consisted of 1-3 apparatus run in parallel with fish from a single clutch of embryos (i.e. siblings). To maintain consistency with genotypes used for validation, the activation and ablation experiments had different backgrounds (i.e. the presence/absence of the <italic>elavl3:h2B-GCaMP6f)</italic> allele). Because of background variation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, all comparisons were restricted to control vs. experimental groups <italic>within</italic> an experimental paradigm over the same time period. We focused our analysis on the pitch axis as the current version of the SAMPL apparatus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> is not optimized for quantification of roll axis behavior. Across our datasets (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> to <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) we did not observe meaningful differences between the control and experimental groups in the pre-manipulation period. To avoid adding noise to our estimates of effect size, we therefore report comparisons between control and experimental groups after perturbation. We did not observe global consequences for swimming: swim speed, swim frequency and bout duration were unaffected during Purkinje cell activation (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2A</xref> and <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>) or after Purkinje cell lesion. Similarly, raw bout numbers were not different between the control and activation (median [inter-quartile range] 1256 [571 – 1454] bouts vs. 656 [444 – 1485] bouts; p-value 0.46) or lesion groups (2004 [1507 – 2471] bouts vs. 1913 [1556 – 2416] bouts; p-value 0.84, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p>

<p>Climbing postures were perturbed after both activation and ablation of Purkinje cells. During activation, fish adopted more nose-up postures before and throughout climb bouts. We observed a shift towards more positive values across the distribution of postures before fish initiated a climb bout (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The average climb posture of fish during depolarization was 29% higher than in control fish (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, median [95% confidence interval]: 14.7° [14.0 – 15.4°] vs. 19.0° [18.5 – 19.7°], p-value &lt; 0.001, effect size: 29%). Similarly, after Purkinje cell lesion, the average climb bout postural angle increased 36% relative to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>, 10.0° [9.5 – 10.7°] vs. 13.6° [13.1 – 14.3°], p-value &lt; 0.001, effect size: 36%).</p>
<p>We observed an unexpected decrease in the climb bout postural angles for control fish in the post-lesion period (from 18.0° [17.6 – 18.4°]to 10.0° [9.5 – 10.7°], <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We do not have an explanation for this particular change and we have confirmed that it is not due to a single outlier experiment (detected outliers: 0/15 pre-lesion control experiments; 0/14 post-lesion control experiments). Notably, if we assess the effect of adding 10 µM capsaicin by comparing the magnitude of the relative difference between pre- and post-lesion periods, normalized to the pre-lesion period, we still see a significant difference (control vs. lesion: -46% vs.-26%). We conclude that, even when accounting for observed changes between control fish at 7 vs. 8 dpf, Purkinje cell ablation modifies climb postures.</p>
<p>Dive bout postures were similarly perturbed after activation, but not ablation of Purkinje cells. Fish adopted more nose-down postural angles before and throughout dive bouts with a leftward shift of the distribution of postures before dive bouts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Average dive bout posture was 24% more negative than in control fish (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>, median [95% confidence interval]: -16.6° [-16.9 – -16.1°] vs. -20.5° [-20.9 – -20.1°], p-value &lt; 0.001, effect size = 24%). Purkinje cell lesions at 7 dpf did not shift the average posture for dive bouts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2M</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2N</xref> -11.7° [-11.9 – -11.5°] vs. -11.2° [-11.4 – -11.0°], p-value = 0.002, effect size = -4%).</p>
<p>We interpret these data as evidence that Purkinje cell activity is crucial to ensure that posture during climbs and dives is maintained within a normal range.</p>

<p>Similar to lesions at 7 dpf, we did not observe any differences in swim speed, frequency or bout duration (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). At 14 dpf, the effects of Purkinje cell lesions on postural angles were more widespread than at 7 dpf and also affected dive postures. We repeated our previous ablation experiments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) between 14–16 dpf, and analyzed climb (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>) and dive bouts (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref>). Loss of Purkinje cells created more widespread behavioral deficits. Specifically, climb bout posture was increased by 20% after Purkinje cell lesion (median [95% confidence interval]: 14.3° [13.8 – 14.8°] vs. 17.1° [16.2 – 17.8°]; p-value &lt; 0.001; effect size: 20%). At 14 dpf we also observed an effect on dive bout postures.

<title>Purkinje cells regulate speed-dependent fin engagement</title>
<p>To climb, larval zebrafish coordinate fin movements that generate lift with axial rotations that direct thrust (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The greater the axial rotation, the stronger the lift-producing fin movements; this relationship increases as larvae develop <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Our previous work suggested that Purkinje cells were necessary for such fin-body coordination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.

<p>After Purkinje cell ablation, 14 dpf fish produced less lift than expected when they swam fast. We divided swim bouts into three different bins according to their peak speed (slow: 5–7.5mm/s; medium: 7.5–15mm/s; fast &gt;15mm/s) for both control and fish treated with 10 µM capsaicin. We parameterized the relationship between upward rotation and lift by fitting a line to swim bouts for each speed. After capsaicin exposure, the slopes of the medium and fast speed bins were significantly lower (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>), reflecting a loss of speed-dependent modulation (median [95% confidence interval]: slope slow: 0.029 [0.028 – 0.031 mm/°] vs. 0.033 [0.032 – 0.034 mm/°], p-value = 0.341, effect size: 6%; slope medium: 0.041 [0.040 – 0.044 mm/°] vs. 0.018 [0.018 – 0.019 mm/°], p-value &lt;0.001, effect size: -34%; slope fast: 0.068 [0.067 – 0.071 mm/°] vs. 0.026 [0.026 – 0.027 mm/°], p-value &lt;0.001, effect size: -62%;).

<p>Next, to determine if lift was fin-dependent, we amputated the fins <sup>25,26</sup> and repeated our experiments. A detailed explanation of how fin amputation affects swim kinematics can be found here <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We observed a near total loss of lift at all speeds; regardless of the speed bin, the slope of the relationship between upward rotation and lift was indistinguishable from zero (slope slow: 0.036 [0.035 – 0.037 mm/°] vs. -0.005 [-0.005 – -0.004 mm/°], p-value &lt;0.00.1; effect size: -60%; slope medium: 0.055 [0.054 – 0.056] mm/° vs. -0.005 [-0.005 – -0.005 mm/°], p-value &lt;0.001; effect size: -88%; slope fast: 0.068 [0.067 – 0.069 mm/°] vs. 0.013 [0.013 – 0.013 mm/°], p-value &lt;0.001; effect size: -81%). Finally, we examined fin-body coordination in our 7 dpf activation and ablation datasets. In contrast to older larvae, we observed no meaningful changes after activation of Purkinje cells at 7 dpf. For Purkinje cell lesions at 7 dpf we found only the fin body coordination at fast bouts to be affected <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p>
<p>Our data show that loss of Purkinje cells disrupts the speed-dependent increase in fin-mediated lift in older, and to a lesser degree in younger fish. We interpret this finding as evidence that Purkinje cells are indispensable for normal coordination of the fins and body.</p>

<p>We used <italic>Tg(aldoca:GAL4)</italic>;<italic>Tg(UAS:GCaMP6s)</italic> to label Purkinje cells in the lateral parts of the cerebellum thought to receive vestibular input <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. To facilitate identification of the same cells from volumes imaged at both ±30°, we used doubly mono-allelic fish and screened for sparse expression of Purkinje cells. In total, we imaged 43 Purkinje cells from 8 fish. Of those, 31 cells could reliably identified at <italic>±</italic>30° and were included in the analysis.</p>
<p>We calculated a directionality index (DI) for all cells and categorized cells as either tuned (|DI| &gt; 0.35) or as untuned (|DI| &lt; 0.35). Some cells showed, on average, higher responses to one direction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), but due to highly variable responses (median [inter-quartile range] Up response range: 23.3 [18.3 – 29.5]; Down response range: 43 [23.7 – 49.2]), they did not exhibit consistent tuning as determined by the directionality index. Individual Purkinje cells showed either directionally-tuned (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, n=18) or untuned (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, n=13) patterns of responses. Tuned cells were distributed throughout the lateral cerebellum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), and showed a slight preference for nose-down stimuli (12 vs. 6, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). We did not observe any systematic differences in the response properties across each experiment from untuned cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>While untuned cells did not show overt directional preferences, pooling their responses allowed decoding of stimulus direction. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize the data and assess whether the trial types even for untuned cells exhibited distinct separation based on their trial identity (nose-up or nose-down). Principal component analysis of the integral of the full responses on each trial from untuned neurons showed near-complete segregation of trial types (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). To assay whether there was indeed directional information we trained a decoder (support vector machine) and tested its accuracy on pseudo-populations of untuned cells of different sizes ranging from 3 - 13 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). We focused only on untuned cells, as including even a single tuned cell for the population coding will lead to excellent results. Training and test trials were different to avoid over-fitting. Pseudo-populations with more than 3 cells achieved accurate decoding well above chance levels (determined by shuffling trial identity)(median [inter-quartile range] accuracy: 3/5/7/10/13 cells: 0.78 [0.68 – 0.91] / 0.88 [0.70 – 0.88] / 1 [0.84 – 1] / 1 [0.97 – 1] / 1 [1 – 1]). To ensure that the choice of cutoff for the directionality index (0.35) does not bias the decoding results, we also calculated the decoding accuracy using the 3, 5, and 7 least directionally tuned cells based on their directionality index. We again found that more than 3 cells achieve accurate decoding above chance level (3/5/7 least tuned cells: 0.67 [0.64 – 0.78] / 0.86 [0.73 – 0.88] / 0.88 [0.86 – 0.92]).</p>
<p>Older larvae showed additional changes to dive postures after Purkinje cell lesions. We therefore tested if: (1) Purkinje cells in older larvae exhibited differences in the numbers or direction of tuned cells or (2) if population-level decoding accuracy changed. We performed longitudinal TIPM, sampling from zebrafish larvae at 7 and 14 dpf. To improve throughput, we recorded the responses upon return from ±19° stimuli (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>) (7 dpf: 138/11 cells/fish; 14 dpf: 90/7 cells/fish; of those 23/3 cells/fish were imaged at both timepoints); previous work established that responses upon return to baseline are highly correlated with the response at the eccentric position <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. We observed increased fluorescence relative to baseline values in 7 dpf and 14 dpf Purkinje cells upon return from ±19° steps (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref> and <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>). To analyze directional tuning we compared the maximum fluorescence in the first second after return to baseline. The relative number of tuned cells per fish was comparable between 7 and 14 dpf larvae (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref>; median [inter-quartile range] at 7 dpf: 7 [6 – 34%]; 14 dpf: 8 [2 – 19%]; p-value = 0.7763). While most cells were not directionally selective, the preferred direction of tuned cells was different at 7 and 14 dpf: at 7 dpf more Purkinje cells were nose-down tuned (2/31 up/down) but at 14 dpf more cells were nose-up tuned (11/3 up/down <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5E</xref>; Fisher’s exact test, p-value &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>We next assayed accuracy of directional encoding of simultaneously recorded untuned cells. We performed principal component analysis for untuned cells at 7 (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5F</xref>) and 14 dpf (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5G</xref>) and tested decoding accuracy on the untuned cells of individual fish at 7 and 14 dpf. We did not observe differences in decoding accuracy between 7 and 14 dpf larvae (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5H</xref>; median [inter-quartile range] 7 dpf: 0.68 [0.63 – 0.83]; 14 dpf: 0.73 [0.65 – 0.79]; p-value = 0.9468). We conclude that cerebellar Purkinje cells can encode pitch direction both at the single neuron and population levels with similar encoding accuracy in young and older larvae.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used a validated chemogenetic tool to investigate the role of cerebellar Purkinje cells in postural behavior as larval zebrafish swam freely in depth. Activation of Purkinje cells could induce changes in pitch axis (nose-up/nose-down) posture. Purkinje cell ablation changed posture, with broader effects in older larvae. Ablation disrupted fin-body coordination responsible for proper climbing. Finally, we could reliably decode pitch-tilt direction from patterns of Purkinje cell activity. We did not observe developmental changes in population coding of direction but found a shift in the tuning direction of Purkinje cells. Taken together our results establish a role for the cerebellum in postural control even during the earliest stages of larval zebrafish development. Our work establishes a new method that combines bidirectional manipulation of cerebellar output and quantitative high-throughput measures of unconstrained posture and locomotion.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Contributions of Purkinje cells to posture</title>
<p>While activation and ablation manipulations both produced biologically meaningful behavior changes, the two experiments were run with different genetic backgrounds and on different generations of the SAMPL apparatus. Conse-quentially, our ability to define precisely what role Purkinje cells play in balance behaviors in larval zebrafish is limited. Activation experiments are particularly laborious as they require thorough pre-screening to ensure adequate brightness levels to achieve sufficient depolarization without excitotoxicity. To maintain consistency in depolarization effects, experiments involving different genetic backgrounds or developmental stages would require additional calcium imaging to confirm that 1 µM capsaicin elicits comparable responses. Hence, we restricted our experiments to 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) and did not extend the study to other developmental time points. Given that the primary purpose of this series of experiments was to establish TRPV1-mediated manipulation of Purkinje cells as a means to investigate postural control, it is beyond the scope of the work to repeat the experiments. Nonetheless, we consider the findings individually below in the context of prior work.</p>
<p>Purkinje cell ablations modifies postural stability. Importantly, the differences we observed were more widespread in older larvae, underscoring the developmental importance of Purkinje cells for balance. Purkinje cell output is inhibitory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, Purkinje cells in the lateral cerebellum project to vestibular nuclei <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, and Purkinje cells are tonically active <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. We propose that the net effect of Purkinje cell loss would be disinhibition of target nuclei responsible for encoding posture and parameterizing corrective pitch-axis behaviors. While the precise nature of the transformation between larval zebrafish pitch and posture control kinematics is not yet known, loss of cerebellar-targeted nuclei can disrupt postural behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The effects of ablations became more widespread in older larvae. During early development, larval zebrafish grow in volume by roughly an order of magnitude and shift their postural control strategies to better climb/dive as they navigate in depth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Unlike climb bouts, changes to postural stability during dives only emerge at 14 dpf. As activation of Purkinje cells produced meaningful changes during dives at 7 dpf, we infer that the delayed emergence of ablation effects does not reflect incomplete integration of Purkinje cells into dive-control circuits. Instead, we propose that this delay reflects the gradual, functional emergence of Purkinje cell control over dives as development progresses. This aligns with previous studies showing that Purkinje cell circuits mature at different rates during development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Notably, the basal posture during dive bouts decreases in older control fish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) — ablation shifts the posture comparable to its younger state. Future work with our system enables testing of the hypothesis that Purkinje cell output plays a role in setting the postures older fish adopt during dives.</p>
<p>Purkinje cell activation also modifies postural stability. Intriguingly, activation broadened the distribution of observed postures in the same way as ablation. Our imaging assay established that 1 µM of capsaicin would stochastically activate subsets of Purkinje cells. This stochasticity could reflect normal fluctuations in basal levels of activity, or it could arise from cells going in and out of depolarization block <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Synchronized/precisely-timed Purkinje cell output is thought to shape movements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>, though perhaps not for all behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. Our imaging suggests that the set of Purkinje cells activated at any one moment in time is limited and random. We therefore propose that the net effect of 1 µM of capsaicin is ultimately disruptive to Purkinje cell synchrony, and thus likely disruptive. Future work could test this hypothesis by intracellular recording from cerebello-recipient populations like the vestibular nuclei <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previously, we reported that larval zebrafish coordinate their fins and trunk to climb effectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The relationship between trunk-mediated changes to trajectory (upward rotation) and fin-mediated lift depends on locomotor speed. Here we observed that after Purkinje cell loss, speed-dependent increases in lift with greater trunk rotation are disrupted (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4A</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). In the fastest speed bin, we observed an increase in upward rotation and a decrease in average fin lift. In contrast, the medium-speed bin showed no significant changes in average fin lift or upward rotation, yet already displayed coordination deficits. Based on these observations, we argue that Purkinje cell lesions primarily affect coordination, rather than simply reducing one specific parameter such as lift or rotation. As we did not observe any change to locomotor speed after ablation (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>), we infer that Purkinje cell loss disrupts speed-dependent coordination for climbing. These results extend our original report where a lower-throughput method (photoablation) suggested that Purkinje cell loss impacted the fin-trunk relationship <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In larval zebrafish, the neuronal substrates for axial speed control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> and fin engagement <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> are known. The potential for whole-brain imaging in larval zebrafish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, particularly with high-speed voltage indicators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup> and cutting-edge modeling approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>, stands to reveal how Purkinje cell activity comes to coordinate body and fin movements. Importantly, since our behavioral data suggest that Purkinje cell activity impacts fin-trunk coordination more strongly in older larvae, longitudinal approaches will be key to understanding the developmental changes to cerebellar signaling that underlie effective coordination of trunk and limbs.</p>

<title>Encoding strategies for body tilt stimuli</title>
<p>Purkinje cell activity reflects both sensory and motor inputs. One limitation of TIPM is that larvae are immobilized in agarose during tilts. Consequentially, our measurements of Purkinje cell activity are artificially constrained. Nonetheless, a subset of Purkinje cells were unambiguously direction-selective, and a simple decoder could use the activity of non-selective cells to differentiate tilt direction. We infer that vestibular information directly related to pitch axis posture is represented by the Purkinje cell population targeted in our ablation/activation experiments, consistent with broader imaging of cerebellar responses to body tilt <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Similar to the behavior results, we observed an asymmetry in the tuning direction of Purkinje cells at 7 dpf, with more cells being tuned to the nose-down direction. This asymmetry shifted between 7 and 14 dpf, suggesting developmental changes in how navigation in the pitch axis is processed in the cerebellum. These changes underscore the importance of longitudinal measurements of Purkinje cell activity across early development to understand emergent control of posture.</p>
<p>The ability to decode tilt direction from the collective activity of “untuned” Purkinje cells suggests a role for population coding. Such mechanisms have been proposed for head/body motion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup> and eye movements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>in the primate cerebellum. Population coding requires that multiple Purkinje cells converge onto downstream targets, which is well-established in cerebellar target nuclei <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. In larval zebrafish, Purkinje cells involved in locomotion converge on eurydendroid cells; electrophysiological recordings confirm a many-to-one convergence scheme that could similarly support population coding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Vestibular-sensitive cells are located in the lateral cerebellum <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, which projects to hindbrain regions that contain vestibular nuclei <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.

<title>TRPV1/capsaicin as a tool to study cerebellar contributions to behavior</title>
<p>Our use of TRPV1/capsaicin complements a modern suite of molecular tools to target cerebellar Purkinje cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In fish, different experiments have used opsins to excite / inhibit cerebellar Purkinje cells with exceptional temporal precision, establishing functional topography <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and an instructive role in learning <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. TRPV1/capsaicin is a well-validated approach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> that permits parametric (i.e. dose-dependent) activation/ablation with a single transgenic line. It does not require light, facilitating dissociation of vestibular from visual contributions without requiring genetically-blind fish as in other studies using excitatory opsins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. Additionally, our approach of using TRPV1/capsaicin for cell ablation offers multiple advantages compared to other lesion methods. For example, Killer Red requires extended exposure to high light intensities and mounting of single fish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Nitroreductase ablation, while effective, requires extended pro-drug exposure, leading to slower and less precise results <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In contrast, TRPV1-mediated ablation is rapid and precise, with capsaicin triggering almost instantaneous cell death. This speed and simplicity make TRPV1 superior for experiments requiring quick, controlled ablation without the delays associated with other methods. Finally, chemogenetic approaches such as TRPV1/capsaicin permit prolonged experimentation in freely-moving animals, allowing us to collect large kinematic datasets necessary to rigorously study posture and locomotion.</p>
<p>Considerable progress has been made in recent years using new tools <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>and new perspectives <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup> to understand the cerebellar contributions to sensorimotor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>and non-sensorimotor behaviors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>in health and disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Underlying this considerable progress is an ever-improving ability to manipulate the cerebellum without compromising rigorous measures of behavior. Here — in support of similar goals — we validated a new chemogenetic approach (TRPV1/capsaicin-mediated activation and ablation) compatible with a high-throughput paradigm to measure behavior in freely swimming larval zebrafish (SAMPL). Our data uncover expected signatures of cerebellar contributions to posture and coordination, establishing the validity of our approach. Further, by comparing the impact of Purkinje cell ablation in time, we leverage the rapid maturation of the zebrafish to open a window into cerebellar control of posture and coordination across development. Our approach establishes a path forward for the larval zebrafish model to contribute to cerebellar mechanisms of postural control. The cerebellum emerged early in the evolution of vertebrates, when vertebrate life was underwater. Our work establishes a new tool to investigate ancient organizing principles of cerebellar function.</p>

<title>Confocal imaging of TRPV1-mediated activation / lesion</title>
<p>Images were collected using a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope using a 20x 1.0NA water immersion objective. Larvae were mounted in 2% low melting point agar (catalog #16520, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a dorsal up position. Anatomical images were acquired from fish anesthetized with 0.2 mg/ml ethyl-3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (MESAB, catalog # E10521, Sigma-Aldrich). To activate TRPV1-expressing Purkinje cells, fish were treated with 1 µM capsaicin in 0.2% DMSO in E3. To lesion Purkinje cells, fish were exposed to 10 µM capsaicin in 0.2% DMSO in E3. Control fish were treated with 0.2% DMSO in E3. Agar was removed around the tip of the tail to facilitate drug delivery. Fish were mounted throughout functional imaging experiments and kept in temperature controlled incubators between timepoints. Time series images were acquired with a 2 photon microscope (Thorlabs Bergamo equipped with a Mai Tai HP laser tuned to 920nm) with a framerate of 7.9fps. Images were analyzed in Fiji <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>; ROIs were drawn on nuclei of randomly selected Purkinje cells, which were then re-identified at each time point. Fluorescence for each cell and time point was normalized to the pre-capsaicin value. Cells with a dF/F0 of &gt; 2 were considered activated and analyzed at the pre capsaicin and +6h timpoint. A Fisher’s exact test was performed to determine significance of the activated cells.</p>
<p>To image the anatomy of Purkinje cells exposed to 10 µM of capsaicin across time, the cerebellum was imaged at 7 dpf from fish mounted as above. Fish were unmounted and kept in E3 medium until the next day (8 dpf). At 8 dpf, fish were placed in 0.2% DMSO in E3 (control) or 10 µM capsaicin in 0.2% DMSO in E3 for 40-60min, and imaged again after 1h of recovery in E3 post-treatment. Fish from both groups were imaged again at 9 dpf. Confocal images were analyzed in Fiji and Purkinje cell somata were counted in both hemispheres of the cerebellum. A conservative approach was taken for cell counting, with inclusion of any structures still resembling cells, regardless of potential non-functionality or signs of degradation.

<title>Zebrafish behavior recordings</title>
<p>All behavior was measured using the Scalable Apparatus for Measuring Posture and Locomotion (SAMPL) apparatus, consisting of a chamber where larvae could swim freely, an infrared illuminator, a camera, and software to process video in real time. A comprehensive description of the apparatus is contained in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Here we briefly describe the specific details of our experiments. Larvae were transferred to chambers at densities of 3-8 fish per chamber for 7 dpf experiments or 1-4 fish per chamber for 14 dpf experiments containing 25-30 ml of E3 or 0.2% DMSO / 1 µM capsaicin for activation experiments. After 24 h, behavior recordings were paused for 30-60 minutes for feeding (feeding pause) and 1-2 ml of rotifer culture was added to each chamber. Larvae were removed from the apparatus after 48h.</p>
<p>To monitor behavior before/during Purkinje cell activation, 7 dpf larvae were placed in chambers with E3. At 8 &amp; 9 dpf, control fish were placed in 0.2% DMSO in E3 and the condition fish were placed in 1 µM capsaicin in 0.2% DMSO in E3 for 6h. The recording started about 10-15min after adding the fish to the capsaicin solution. Fish were fed after the 6h activation period. Video was sampled at 40Hz in constant darkness. Control: 9626 bouts (63% climb bouts)/149 fish/8 experimental repeats; Activation: 9664 bouts (61% climb bouts)/155 fish/8 experimental repeats;</p>
<p>To monitor behavior before/after Purkinje cell lesions, 7 dpf/14 dpf larvae were placed in the chambers with E3. After feeding at 8 dpf/15 dpf, fish were placed in petri dishes with 0.2% DMSO in E3 (control) or 10 µM capsaicin in 0.2% DMSO in E3 for 40-60min. Fish were then returned to the chambers in E3 and behavior recording was started. Video was sampled at 160Hz in constant darkness. 7 dpf lesions: Control: 17895 bouts (61% climb bouts)/110 fish/14 experimental repeats; Lesion: 17819 bouts (57% climb bouts)/120 fish/14 experimental repeats; 14 dpf lesion: Control: 10666 bouts (58% climb bouts)/48 fish/7 experimental repeats; Lesion: 10708 bouts (54% climb bouts)/44 fish/7 experimental repeats;</p>
<p>Pectoral fin amputations were performed at 13 dpf. Two length-matched siblings were anesthetized in 0.2 mg/ml ethyl-3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (MESAB, catalog # E10521, Sigma-Aldrich) simultaneously and mounted in 2% low-melting temperature agar. Visualized under a stereomicroscope (Leica M80, 20x/12 eyepieces, 1.0x objective), the two pectoral fins from one larva were removed by pulling the base of the fin at the scapulocoracoid laterally with #5 Dumont forceps. After amputation, both fish were freed from the agar and allowed to recover in E3 until the next day, at which point half of the amputated and control fish were randomly selected for Purkinje cell lesions. Lesions were performed as above and behavior recorded for 48h. Behavior was recorded at a sampling rate of 160Hz with a 14/10h light-dark cycle.

<title>Behavior analysis</title>
<p>Comprehensive descriptions of behavioral kinematics and baseline data for different genetic backgrounds are detailed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Here we describe the specific parameters used for our experiments. Behavior data were analyzed using custom-written software in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick MA), which extracted individual swim bouts from the raw data (x/z position and pitch angle as a function of time). Only bouts during the circadian day were analyzed. Experimental repeats consisted of data collected across multiple SAMPL boxes from a single clutch of fish; the number of fish available determined how many apparatus were used (1-3). For comparisons across conditions (e.g. activation/control), fish from one clutch were randomly split into control and condition groups. As bout number is the fundamental unit of kinematic analysis, and different numbers of fish available would yield different numbers of bouts, we bounded our experiments to allow comparison across repeats. Specifically, if an experimental repeat contained less than 650 bouts it was excluded.</p>
<p>Between 22-27% of lesion experimental repeats contained less than 650 bouts and were not included in the analysis. For the activation experiments 56% (10 of 18) of experimental repeats were excluded with the 650 bouts threshold due to shorter recording times a higher fraction of experiments contained less than the threshold number of bouts. In subsequent analyses, the number of analyzed bouts was matched from both groups for a given experimental repeat to ensure an identical representation of control and condition bouts. Individual bouts were aligned at the time of peak speed. Bouts were excluded if their peak speed was &lt;5mm/s or the fish rotated more than 30°(120°/sec) during the acceleration. The fractions excluded were as follows: for 7 dpf ablation: ctrl 0.2% lesion 0.15%; 7 dpf activation: ctrl 1% activation 1.7%; 14 dpf ablation dark: ctrl 0.05% ablation 0.05%; 14 dpf ablation light: ctrl 0.02% ablation 0.02%. For each experiment between 0.02% and 1.7% of bouts were excluded based on those criteria. Data was recorded either at 40Hz (activation experiments) or 160Hz (all other experiments). Effect size was calculated as the difference between the control value and the condition value relative to the control value. For fin body slope effect size the control value of the fast bin (i.e. largest slope) was used for effect size calculations to avoid overestimation of changes due to small control values.</p>

E3 was placed over the agarose, and the galvanometer mirror was placed under the microscope.</p>
<p>A microscope (Thorlabs Bergamo) was used to measure fluorescence elicited by multiphoton excitation (920nm) from a pulsed infrared laser (Mai Tai HP). Fast volumetric scanning was achieved using a piezo actuator (catalog #PFM450E, Thorlabs) to move the objective. Each frame of the volume (224 × 96 pixels) was collected with a 0.6 µs pixel dwell time (19.1 frames/s) resulting in a sampling rate of 3.82 volumes/s. While this imaging rate might be too slow to distinguish single spikes, it is suitable to measure a difference in calcium transients upon pitch stimulation to nose-up or nose-down direction. To set the galvanometer to a specific angle, a corresponding voltage was applied. The total angular range of the galvanometer is 40°. For the 30°stimuli, the galvanometer was driven to either +15°or -15°and then rotated so that the mirror was horizontal which allowed allowing for a 30°deflection in one direction. For each cell, 21 trials were initially recorded for one stimulus direction. The galvanometer was then remounted to allow for a 30°stimulus in the opposite direction, and 21 trials were similarly recorded for this direction. The order of nose-up and nose-down blocks were alternated for different fish. After all 42 trials were recorded fish were anesthetized with 0.2 mg/ml MESAB; after 10min the baseline fluorescence at ±30°was recorded to establish a baseline that controlled for eccentricity. Analysis was done using Fiji and MATLAB. In total 43 Purkinje cells were imaged and 31 cells were kept from 8 fish. Only Purkinje cells that could be reliably identified at ±30°were analyzed. To map the anatomical locations of the recorded cells, we imaged overview stacks for each fish. These stacks were manually aligned in Illustrator, and the cells included in the analysis were identified and color-coded according to their tuning properties.</p>
<p>Regions of interest were drawn in Fiji and loaded into MATLAB to extract the intensity of fluorescence after motion correction was performed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>. The integral of each stimulus was calculated and trials of the same direction were averaged as the tonic response to ±30°pitch. To extract cells with directional information the directionality index (DI) was calculated by dividing the difference of the up and down responses by the sum of it. Cells with a DI greater than ±0.35 were considered directionally tuned. Only Purkinje cells that were not directionally tuned were used for principal component analysis and subsequent support vector machine decoding analysis.</p>
<p>To classify trial identity in the dataset, we used a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. The SVM model was trained using k-fold cross-validation, which splits the data into k subsets (folds). At each iteration, the model was trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold, ensuring that the model performance was evaluated on unseen data in each fold. Permutations were performed on randomized trial identity as a null hypothesis (5-fold cross-validation; 100 shuffles for randomization). Accuracy was calculated as 1 minus the classification loss.</p>
<p>For calcium imaging in 7 and 14 dpf larvae, a horizontal imaging protocol was used. In total 11 fish were imaged at 7 dpf and 7 fish at 14 dpf. A total of 138/90 (7/14 dpf) cells were recorded. Cells were imaged while the fish was horizontal. For horizontal imaging, we used a ±19°stimulus, enabling us to alternate between up and down trials without the need to remount the galvanometer. Before each trial, a 15 sec period was recorded; the average activity during this time was used as the baseline. Fish were pitched nose-down (-19°) for 15s and rapidly returned to horizontal, where-upon calcium activity was measured. This stimulus was then repeated in the nose-up (+19°) direction. The maximum dFF of the first second upon return was analyzed. Cells were classified into directional or non-directional based on the directionality index as described above. PCA and decoder analyses were performed using activity from non-directional cells. Decoding accuracy was tested for each fish individually.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All statistical testing was done in Matlab R2020a. Data across repeats was pooled for analysis. To assess the variability and determine whether pooling individual experimental repeats within each group was appropriate, we performed a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the interquartile ranges (IQRs) of the single experimental repeats for the 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) activation, the 7dpf lesion, and the 14dpf lesion experiments without excluding experimental repeats. The results of the ANOVAs and the IQRs for all experimental repeats are reported in <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Tables 6</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl11">11</xref>.</p>

<p>To estimate the spread of the data we resampled distributions 100 times with replacement from the data from each condition and computed the expected value for control and perturbed datasets. These permutations were then used to explicitly compute a p-value for fitted variables (slope and R<sup>2</sup> of fin body coordination).</p>
<p>For other variables two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests were performed. To correct for multiple testing the critical p-value was calculated based on <italic>α</italic> = 0.05 using Šidáks method. The critical p-value for each data set is reported in the respective table. Outliers were determined as deviating more than 3 times the scaled median absolute deviation (MAD) from the median. A scaling factor of 1.4826 was used to ensure that MAD-based outlier detection is consistent with other methods like Z-scores. Data is shown as median and 95% confidence interval of the median for measured parameters or as median with 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile for bootstrapped variables. The 95% confidence intervals of the median were bootstrapped using 1000 samples. The medians with 95% confidence intervals for all parameters are reported in the tables. For linear fits a robust regression model (bisquare) was used and fitted variables (slope and R<sup>2</sup> of fin body coordination) were bootstrapped (using 100 samples). To test speed dependency of the fin-lift/rotation ratio Spearman’s rank correlation was computed and control and lesion values were compared. First, the correlation coefficients where transformed using Fisher’s z-transformation to enable direct comparison of the z-scores. The difference between the z-scores was divided by the standard error and a z-test was performed. Additionally, we only considered effect sizes of ≥15% to be biologically relevant.</p>

<p>This study uses a variety of approaches to explore the role of cerebellum, and in particular Purkinje cells (PCs), in the development of postural control in larval zebrafish. A chemogenetic approach is used to either ablate PCs or disrupt their normal activity and a powerful, high-throughput behavioural tracking system then enables quantitative assessment of swim kinematics. Using this strategy, convincing evidence is presented that PCs are required for normal postural control in the pitch axis. Calcium imaging further shows that PCs encode tilt direction. Evidence is also presented that suggests the role of the cerebellum changes over the course of early development, although this claim is less robust. Finally, the authors build on their prior work showing that both axial muscles and pectoral fins contribute to &quot;climbs&quot; and show convincing evidence that PCs are required for speed-dependent engagement of the fins during this behavior. Overall, establishing a role for cerebellum in postural control is not very surprising. However, a clear motivation of this study was to establish a robust experimental platform to investigate the changing role of cerebellar circuits in the development of postural control in the highly experimentally accessible zebrafish larvae and in this regard the authors have certainly succeeded.</p>
<p>This revised version of the manuscript incorporates several improvements. In particular, additional analysis and methodological detail is provided regarding the chemogenetic manipulation, there is expanded analysis of the speed-dependency of pectoral fin engagement, and aspects of the decoding analysis are clearer. However, it is still not certain that the emergence of a dive phenotype over development (from 7 to 14 day post fertilisation) really represents changing role for the cerebellum as opposed to changing sensitivity of Purkinje cells to the chemogenetic treatment.</p>

<p>Franziska Auer et al. successfully applied the TRPV1/capsaicin tool to study the contribution of Purkinje cells to postural control. They leveraged the ability of this tool to both activate and ablate neurons within the same construct and tested its effects using their smart, high-throughput behavioral setup for postural control monitoring. With Purkinje cells ablated, balance did not appear to be disrupted; however, postural control was clearly modified along the pitch axis, with larval zebrafish maintaining, on average, a more nose-down posture compared to controls. While this effect is subtle, it is statistically robust and consistent with the group's previous findings using KillerRed-mediated ablation of Purkinje cells, where the observed postural angle change was explained by a disruption in cerebellar-mediated fin-trunk coordination. Here, the authors present a novel insight, demonstrating that this coordination is swim-speed dependent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors convincingly activated Purkinje cells at 7 dpf, and reported modifications in posture pitch angle comparable to those observed when ablating Purkinje cells. The authors suggest a potential desynchronization of Purkinje cells to explain this observation. Future characterization and application of this activation method to other developmental time points could be of major interest. The authors successfully validated the transfer of the TRPV1/capsaicin method for targeted cell ablation and activation to the study of cerebellar functions and reinforced our current understanding of the role of Purkinje cells in postural control.</p>
<p>This study also explores the developmental evolution of cerebellar function in postural control by comparing the effects of Purkinje cell ablation at 7 dpf and 14 dpf. Interestingly, only dive bout posture showed differential effects across these time points, with no significant impact at 7 dpf but a significant change in postural pitch angle at 14 dpf. In contrast, the effect of Purkinje cell ablation on the climbing bout postural angle remained comparable at both ages. Including additional developmental time points would further strengthen this critical characterization of cerebellar maturation in the context of postural control.</p>
<p>To examine whether Purkinje cell activity encodes postural tilt angle, the authors performed calcium imaging on 31 cells from 8 fish using their Tilt In Place Microscope (TIPM). They found that tilt-angle could be decoded from individual neurons with highly tuned responses, as well as from neurons that were not obviously tuned when pooling their data. The authors refer to this effect as pseudo-population coding because recordings were performed non-simultaneously across animals.</p>
<p>This study successfully integrates cutting-edge genetic tools, high-throughput behavioral assays, and advanced optical microscopy to investigate the role of populations of Purkinje cells in postural control. The authors have not only validated these powerful tools but have also provided novel insights into the cerebellar involvement in postural control, including the swim-speed dependence of fin-trunk coordination.</p>
<p>This work represents an important step toward a detailed understanding of cerebellar contributions to postural control and highlights the potential of combining genetically targeted perturbation with quantitative behavioral analysis.</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my previous concerns, and I congratulate them for their excellent work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper uses a new chemogenetic tool to investigate the role of cerebellar Purkinje cells in postural control. Using a high-throughput behavioral assay, they show that activation or ablation of Purkinje cells affects various aspects of postural control in zebrafish larvae during spontaneous swimming, and that the effects are more pronounced at later developmental time points, where the Purkinje cell number is much greater. Using a sophisticated imaging assay, they record Purkinje cell activity in response to tilt of the fish, and show that some Purkinje cells are tuned to tilt direction, and that the direction can even be decoded from untuned neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall the study is nice, using a variety of genetic tools and behavioral analysis to address a fundamental question about the role of the cerebellum in postural control in fish</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Franziska Auer et al. investigate the role of cerebellar Purkinje cells in controlling posture in larval zebrafish using the chemogenetic tool TRPV1/capsaicin to bidirectionally manipulate (i.e., activate or ablate) these cells. This tool has been developed for zebrafish previously but has not been applied to Purkinje cells.</p>
<p>High-throughput behavioral experiments are presented to monitor how body posture is affected by these perturbations. The analysis of postural control focuses on a specific subaspect of posture: the body tilt-angle relative to horizontal just before a swim bout is executed, quantified separately for pre-ascent and pre-dive bouts. They report a broad bimodal distribution of pre-ascent bout posture ranging from -20 to +40 degrees, while the pre-dive bout posture was more Gaussian, ranging between -40 and 0 degrees. The treatment effect is quantified as the change in the median of these distributions.</p>
<p>Purkinje cell activation and ablation in 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) fish shifted the median of the ascending bout posture distributions to positive values. The authors hypothesize that the stochastic nature of the activation process might desynchronize Purkinje cell activity, thus abolishing Purkinje cells' role in postural control, similar to ablation. However, this does not explain why dive bout posture decreased upon activation but was unaffected by ablation.</p>
<p>To test whether the role of Purkinje cells in postural control matures over development, the authors repeated the ablation experiments at 14 dpf. They state that &quot;at 14 dpf, the effects of Purkinje cell lesions on posture were more widespread than at 7 dpf.&quot; However, this effect size is comparable to that observed at 7 dpf, suggesting no further maturation of the role of Purkinje cells in pre-ascending bout postural control. The median pre-dive bout posture decreased at 14 dpf, contrasting with no effect at 7 dpf, yet this change was comparable in effect size to the activation effect on Purkinje cells at 7 dpf. The current data breadth may not be sufficient to conclude that signatures of emerging cerebellar control of posture across early development were uncovered.</p>
<p>The study's exploration of activating Purkinje cells in freely swimming fish using TRPV1/ capsaicin is of special interest, but the practicability of this method is unclear from the current presentation. It would be beneficial to present the distribution of the percentage of activatable Purkinje cells across animals and time points to provide insight into the method's efficiency. Discussing this limitation and potential improvements would aid in evaluating the method, especially since the authors report that the activation experiments were labor-intensive, limiting repeat experiments. This may explain why the activation experiment at 7 dpf is the only data presented with cell activation, with other analyses performed using the cell ablation capabilities of the TRPV1/capsaicin method.</p>
<p>Another data point at 14dpf would significantly strengthen the conclusions.</p>
<p>The authors analyze Purkinje cell-controlled fin-trunk coordination by examining ascending bout posture across different swim bout speeds. They make the important finding that pectoral fin movements contribute significant lift for median and fast swim bouts but not for slow ones, and that Purkinje cell ablation disrupts lift generation at all speeds.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors examined whether Purkinje cell activity encodes postural tilt-angle by performing calcium imaging on 31 cells from 8 fish using their Tilt In Place Microscope (TIPM). They report that they could decode the tilt-angle from individual neurons with a highly tuned response, and also from neurons that were not obviously tuned when pooling them and analyzing the population response. However, due to the non-simultaneous recordings across animals, definitive conclusions about populationlevel encoding should be made cautiously, it might be better to suggest potential population encoding that needs confirmation with more targeted experiments involving simultaneous recordings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The study introduces a novel application of the chemogenetic tool TRPV1/capsaicin to study cerebellar function in zebrafish.</p>
<p>- High-throughput behavioral experiments provide detailed analysis of postural control.</p>
<p>- The further investigation of Purkinje cell-controlled fin-trunk coordination offers new insights into motor control mechanisms.</p>
<p>- The use of calcium imaging to decode postural tilt-angle from Purkinje cell activity presents interesting preliminary results on neuronal population encoding.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The term &quot;disruption&quot; for postural control effects may lead to misleading expectations.</p>
<p>- The supporting data show only subtle median shifts in postural angle, raising questions about the significance of observed effects. Statistical methods that account for the hierarchical structure of the data might be required to support the conclusions.</p>
<p>- The study's data breadth may not be sufficient to conclude emerging cerebellar postural control across early development.</p>
<p>- The current presentation does not adequately detail the practicability and efficiency of the TRPV1/capsaicin method for activating Purkinje cells, and the labor-intensive nature of these experiments constrains the ability to replicate and validate the findings.</p>
<p>- Non-simultaneous recordings in calcium imaging necessitate cautious interpretation of population-level encoding results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper uses a new chemogenetic tool to investigate the role of cerebellar Purkinje cells in postural control. Using a high-throughput behavioral assay, they show that activation or ablation of Purkinje cells affects various aspects of postural control in zebrafish larvae during spontaneous swimming and that the effects are more pronounced at later developmental time points, where the Purkinje cell number is much greater. Using a sophisticated imaging assay, they record Purkinje cell activity in response to the tilt of the fish and show that some Purkinje cells are tuned to tilt direction and that the direction can even be decoded from untuned neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall the study is nice, using a range of tools to address a fundamental question about the role of the cerebellum in postural control in fish.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The data in Figure 1 that establishes the method seems to be based on a very small number of experiments and lacks some statistical analysis.</p>
<p>(2) The choice and presentation of the statistical and analysis methods used in Figures 2-5 could be improved.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Overall I think this is a great paper.</p>
<p>* Introduction and Discussion.</p>
<p>The Introduction (and Discussion) do little to explain what is understood about cerebellar control of posture and what major outstanding questions remain. The first paragraph of the Introduction seems to argue that the role of the cerebellum in control of posture is well established and line 24 attempts to motivate the present study by virtue of the fact that terrestrial locomotion is &quot;complex&quot;. This might be true but is not necessarily a major obstacle given the suite of powerful approaches available in rodent neuroscience. What are the major challenges that are hard to tackle in rodents and what specific questions can the larval zebrafish help to answer? What about development (which gets no mention at all)? I'm not suggesting a comprehensive review of every aspect of cerebellar physiology, but I think the Introduction should attempt to outline the current hypotheses in a little more detail and highlight what we still need to understand.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We take the Reviewer’s point that there is more to say in the Introduction. We feel that multi-dimensional limb biomechanics and proprioception are two aspects of terrestrial locomotion that support our use of the word “complexity.” However, we don’t dwell on this point because, as the reviewer correctly states, the suite of tools for rodent neuroscience &amp; behavior is expansive and, in our opinion, not a limiting factor. Instead, we said what we felt we could regarding the potential contribution of the larval zebrafish in the last paragraph of the Discussion. In the revision, we have added details about the development of cerebellum to the introduction (though this, of course, is an expansive topic and well-beyond the scope of the Introduction), highlighted some of the historical limitations in rodent posture analysis, and set up the .</p>

<p>* Abstract</p>
<p>In my opinion, the statement &quot;Here, we used a powerful chemogenetic tool (TRPV1/ capsaicin) to *define the role of Purkinje cells*...&quot; is too strong. Whilst the evidence that PCs are required for postural control is certainly strong, what exactly these cells do in the service of postural control is far from clear (as the authors indeed acknowledge in the Discussion). As such, I wouldn't say their role has been &quot;defined&quot;.</p>

<p>We change the word to “describe” to better reflect our findings</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>* aldoca transgenic.</p>
<p>This appears to be a beautiful transgenic line but the data showing the extent of its expression and evidence that in the cerebellum it exclusively labels PCs isn't clear enough.</p>
<p>(i) Ideally Figure 1A would show an image of a whole animal to provide an overview of transgene expression but instead it seems to be (the legend is unclear) a cartoon with a confocal projection of part of the brain overlaid.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the figure legend to be clearer that we show a cartoon of a larval zebrafish with the confocal image overlaid. The aldoca promotor has been previously described and exclusively labels Purkinje cells (10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3352-10.2010)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(ii) Figure 1B shows expression in the cerebellum, but how are we to understand that all the labelled cells are PCs? Are all PCs labelled, or only a subset? Perhaps a double labelling with a PC in situ marker could be done to demonstrate colocalisation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As above, the aldoca promotor has been previously described; to the best of our knowledge in the Hibi lab’s hands (and ours) it labels Purkinje cells exclusively, and it labels all of them (10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3352-10.2010)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>* Chemogenetic validation.</p>
<p>Overall, the chemogenetic approach to abrogate PC function looks to be very powerful. The authors state in several places that a contribution of this paper is in its &quot;establishing the validity of TRPV1/capsaicin-mediated perturbations&quot;. However, the data in Figure 1, along with various comments in other parts of the paper raise some questions:</p>
<p>(i) For experiments depolarising PCs with 1µM CSn, the same size is tiny: Two transgenic animals and one control. Moreover, it is stated 'in one fish ... we observed a small number of neurons at the 9h timepoint with bright, speckled fluorescence suggestive of cell death&quot;. Was this one out of two transgenics?! In the discussion, I didn't understand the statement &quot;ensure adequate brightness levels *to achieve sufficient depolarization without excitotoxicity*&quot;. Does this &quot;excitotoxicity&quot; relate to the specked fluorescence observation?</p>
<p>Overall, the very small sample size and comments about excitotoxicity and cell death raise concerns about the approach that I think warrant clearer treatment in the results (including information about the assessment of transgene expression, % embryos judged to have suitable expression), especially as this paper is seeking to establish the validity of the method.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We note first that the method has been previously validated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/">https://doi.org/10.1038/</ext-link> nmeth.3691) and that we build on this work. For the experiment described, the point was to identify an acceptable duration for exposure. To that end, we analyzed 6 animals for up to 6h (including the washout experiments in Figure S1B) where we never observed any speckled fluorescence; we limited our behavioral experiments to 6h accordingly. We thought it would be worth including the observation of speckled fluorescence at 9h timepoint for future reference. To directly address the comment we have increased the number of analyzed cells and fish for the 1uM capsaicin experiments and added statistical analysis (lines 65-67).</p>
<p>When screening for transgene expression we selected for fish that had clearly visible expression, but that did not look overly bright, and used the same criteria when screening fish for the GCaMP imaging and for behavior. Around a quarter of the fish that had aldoca:TRPV1-tagRFP expression had a usable expression level for the activation experiment. We have added this information to the Results (line 62) and Methods (line 369-372)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(ii) The authors note &quot;capsaicin could sporadically activate subsets of Purkinje cells&quot; and further speculate about PC activity and synchrony in the discussion. Figure 1 seems to rely on single images at widely spaced time points but given that they are set up to do 2-photon calcium imaging, why didn't they collect continuous time series data and analyse the temporal patterns of activity across the transgenic PC population?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added time series data for calcium imaging after 1uM of Capsaicin in TRPV1-  and TRPV1+ cells to Supplementary Figure S1A. Here too we see sporadic increases in calcium levels at similar rates: 0% for TRPV1- and 15-19% for TRPV1+ (see also Figure S1 legend)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(iii) The axonopathy and cell death resulting from 10 µM Csn is quite dramatic.</p>
<p>However, here the authors do not appear to have included a TRPV1 negative control (although oddly they did for 1 µM treatment) so it is currently unclear whether or not a high conc of Csn alone might be cytotoxic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Chen et al (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3691">https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3691</ext-link>) have established the TRPV1/capsaicin method in zebrafish with broad neuronal label and did not see any effect with high doses of capsaicin in TRPV1 negative fish.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>* Behavioural assessment - stats</p>
<p>Overall, the disruption of postural stability after PC manipulations is convincing.</p>
<p>However, I have a few queries about the statistics:</p>
<p>(i) In this section, the statistical unit was not clear. The tables, which are otherwise very useful, give no indication of N. The legend text does report &quot;8 repeats/149 control fish&quot; and &quot;across experimental repeats&quot; suggesting the statistical unit might be the repeats rather than animals, but this should be clarified. In Figure 2G, individual data points should be plotted if N=8, or a representation of the distribution (eg violin or box and whisker plots) if N = 149.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. Given the variable numbers of bouts, a single experimental repeat does not allow for an accurate estimate of expected value. Below we simulated how accurately the median can be estimated based on increasing sample sizes (Author response image 1). Given that large numbers of bouts are necessary to accurately estimate the median we pool the data for all experiments and use resampling statistics to estimate bias in our estimate.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(ii) Related to the above, I hope it might be easier to interpret the unexpected change in climb posture in ablation controls once the data for individual repeats is shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When we analyze the data as single repeats we see considerable variability between different repeats due to undersampling. We tested the medians for the single repeats for outliers to ensure that the shift is not due to a single repeat skewing the distribution. We did not detect any outliers in the pre-lesion control or in the post-lesion control group. (Outliers were determined as deviating more than 3 times the scaled median absolute deviation (MAD) from the median. A scaling factor of 1.4826 was used to ensure that MAD-based outlier detection is consistent with other methods like Z-scores.) We added this information to line 133-134 and the method section under Statistics.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(iii) In some parts of this section, including the Tables, the authors report the 95% CI of the median, rather than IQR. In this case, they should report the z-value used for 95% CI estimation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we are using resampling to estimate the 95% confidence interval of the median there is no z-value as in a traditional normal distribution based confidence interval; Instead, we explicitly define the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles from the bootstrapped sample distribution, which captures the middle 95% of the data, representing the 95% confidence interval.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>* It is stated that &quot;fish adopted more nose-up postures before *and throughout* climb bouts&quot;. Figure 2F seems to show posture before the climb, but where is the &quot;throughout&quot; data? It would be useful if Figure 2E, J could be extended to make a bit clearer these two phases of postural assessment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed the phrase ‘throughout climb bouts’ as we are not showing the posture throughout the bout and to avoid over complicating the interpretation.</p>

<p>* Why were PCs not activated at 14 dpf (eg using 1 µM Csn)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to shifts in priorities the first author will not be continuing this series of experiments, and so this additional experiment will have to wait for someone to pick up this line of inquiry</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>* The authors appear to claim that the difference in phenotype in 7 versus 14 dpf animals following high conc Csn treatment is indicative of a changing role for cerebellar PCs over this developmental period. For instance, in reference to the 14 dpf ablation phenotype, the authors write &quot;reveals the functional emergence of Purkinje cell control of dives&quot; and in the abstract they talk about &quot;emerging control of posture across early development&quot;. However, can they rule out that the phenotypic differences might instead reflect differential sensitivity of the relevant PC (sub)populations to CSn at the two ages? If this caveat cannot be discounted then I suggest it is acknowledged e.g. in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As previously established, all Purkinje cells are labeled in the aldoca line (10.1523/ JNEUROSCI.3352-10.2010). Fluorescence is brighter at 14dpf compared to 7dpf, suggesting higher levels of TRPV1. We therefore assume that at 14 dpf, the high concentration of Csn is sufficient to ablate Purkinje cells. At 14 dpf, cerebellar damage is visible under a standard dissecting microscope.The preponderance of evidence therefore speaks against a previously undiscovered subpopulation of TRPV1expressing Purkinje cells that are, by mechanisms yet unknown, resistant to high doses of capsaicin.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>* Fin-body &quot;coordination&quot;</p>
<p>The ideas and data around fin-body coordination are very intriguing.</p>
<p>(i) The statement &quot;fin engagement is speed-dependent&quot; would benefit from a stats test to show this is indeed significant. The data in Figure 4B suggest a rather high degree of variance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point; we appreciate the Reviewer’s attention. We have added statistics to show this is speed dependent to line 167-169 and show the corresponding plot in the supplement in Figure S4.  &quot;Here, we observed that fin engagement is speeddependent, with faster bouts producing greater lift for a given axial rotation (Spearman correlation coefficient: control 0.2193; 10uM capsaicin: 0.0397; Z-test after ztransformation: p &lt; 0.001)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(ii) The statement &quot;After capsaicin exposure, the slopes of the medium fast speed bins were significantly lower (Figure 4C), reflecting *a loss of speed-dependent modulation*&quot; is not convincing. The slope is likely a function of both speed and Csn treatment, and the comparisons in Figure 4C appear to be testing the latter, not the former.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s point. However, the slope for the slow bouts remains unchanged. We therefore conclude that the reduction in fin-body slope is speed dependent and not a speed independent reduction of slope overall.</p>
<p>We have made this more clear by adding Supplementary Figure S4 and changing the text in line 177-179.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(iii) I'd like to understand more about the phenotype of the fin-amputated animals. Were any &quot;bout&quot; parameters changed? Did the animals still attempt climbs and was the distribution of the upward rotation parameter similar to controls? The text states &quot;the slope of the relationship between upward rotation and lift was indistinguishable from zero&quot; but the stats reported in the text are comparisons between groups while Table 5 shows 95% CIs that don't span zero. Some clarification would be useful here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s interest. We’ve studied climbing in fin-amputated animals at length here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45839">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45839</ext-link> and here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/">https://doi.org/10.1016/</ext-link> j.celrep.2023.112573 and have added these references in line 183.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(iv) The authors repeatedly refer to fin-body *coordination* but it is not clear whether the loss of lift after PC ablation is a result of an explicit coordination defect (i.e. changes in the relative timing and/or kinematics between fins and axial motion components), versus a simple reduction in pectoral fin engagement. Either result could be interesting, but this should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing that out. In the fastest speed bin, we observed an increase in upward rotation and a decrease in average fin lift. In contrast, the medium speed bin showed no significant changes in average fin lift or upward rotation (see Author response image 2 and Tables 4 and 5), yet already displayed coordination deficits. Based on these observations, we argue that Purkinje cell lesions primarily affect coordination, rather than simply reducing one specific parameter such as lift or rotation (line 293-298).</p>
<p>We have added fin lift and rotation values from Author response image 2 for all speed bins to tables 4 and 5.</p>

<p>* PC activity and decoding of pitch direction.</p>
<p>The clever TIPM method is used to collect calcium data that convincingly shows that individual PCs can encode pitch-tilt direction. However, a population of &quot;not tuned&quot; cells are also identified, and here I found the analysis of their responses and the argument that they encode pitch direction at a population level difficult to follow.</p>
<p>(i) First, although the naming of the cells implies that individual neurons do not encode pitch direction, I did not find this convincing. Figures 5F/G suggest that several &quot;not tuned&quot; cells in fact show quite consistent differences in activity across trial types and indeed in terms of their average responses sit as far from the unity line as do several &quot;tuned&quot; cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer’s comment helped us clarify some key points. First, tuned and untuned cells were categorized based on a Directionality Index threshold of 0.35; some cells might look similar in 5F/G but the highly variable responses of Purkinje cells have highly variable response so overall there was no consistent tuning. We have clarified this in the text in line 203-207 Below we have plotted the Up versus Down responses for the 10 least tuned cells (sorted by directionality index). While some cells have higher responses on average to one direction we think that the variability makes it difficult to support a claim for “tuning.” We have also tested the support vector machine on the least tuned cells to confirm that the chosen cutoff for tuned/untuned is not affecting our claim that untuned cells can encode position.(see also Author response image 4)</p>

<p>(ii) It is therefore not very surprising that PCA (and the SVM decoder) distinguishes trial type. I would guess that PCA assigns the largest weights to these most tuned of the &quot;not tuned&quot; cells, and the 3-5 cell decoders do well when these cells happen to be sampled.</p>

<p>This was an interesting idea. To rule out that it is only the most tuned cells that contain the information, we tested the decoder on the 3/5/7 least tuned cells; here too, 5 and more cells are better able to accurately decode the direction. We have add the decoding accuracy to the text in line 221-224</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(iii) As I understand the analysis, Figure 5G shows responses for &quot;not tuned&quot; cells over 21 trials (of each type) but these are not the same trials for the different cells? How then is population coding being assessed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated the text and refer to this data as a “pseudo-population” in lines 216 and 218 for all experiments where we combined cells from different fish. For technical reasons, when we perform TIPM at eccentric angles we must use sparsely labelled fish to ensure that we can find the same cells over a 60 degree range. We have repeated our analyses for TIPM centered at the horizon, where we can record from entire populations from a single fish.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(iv) Furthermore, Figure S2 shows a somewhat different analysis with decoding accuracy measured on a fish-by-fish basis. In this case, are these decoders for simultaneously imaged neurons? Is this a cross-validated measure of decoding accuracy?</p>

<p>Yes, as above, Figure S4 (former S2) looks at fish-by-fish basis of simultaneous recorded neurons. Yes, it was 5-fold cross validated. We have updated the text in line 490-494.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>- Postural control involves various aspects such as balance, coordination, relative body part orientations, and stability. Discussing these and presenting in this context the specific subaspect characterized in this study would help clarify which aspect of postural control the work focuses on.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer makes an interesting point, but we think their description of what constitutes postural control is overly broad. Specifically, control of “relative body part orientations in space” by definition requires coordination, and subserves balance and stability. We acknowledge, of course, that different aspects can be and often are treated independently. While interesting, a full treatment of what comprises “postural control” is beyond the scope of the paper, as it would require reconciling the terms across taxa, effectors, environments and well over a century of experiments.</p>
<p>We contend that posture — particularly underwater — is best defined as the relative orientation of body parts in space. For fish, those parts consist of predominantly axial muscles and secondarily fins. We present these definitions in the Introduction and thank the Reviewer for encouraging us to more clearly shape our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Disruption of posture or postural control: The use of the word &quot;disruption&quot; could lead to misleading expectations. While it may not be incorrect, it suggests a significant loss of equilibrium, an obvious increase in postural variability, or at least a noticeable effect when observing an individual animal's behavior. However, the supporting data show only a subtle median shift in postural angle within a very broad distribution averaged over many individuals. This effect was only significant when comparing fish with a control group, not when comparing fish posture before and after the treatment.</p>
<p>Replacing &quot;disruption&quot; with &quot;modification&quot; would be more cautious.</p>

<p>We take the Reviewer’s point about the importance of conventions, however we have never found “more stars = more significant” to be all that helpful in evaluating claims. Instead, we’ve opted to have both a significance and effect size criteria; a “star” here reflects our considered confidence in the difference we observe.</p>
<p>We agree that the hierarchical nature of pooled data is worth considering/presenting.</p>
<p>We performed a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the interquartile ranges (IQRs) of the single experimental repeats for the 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) activation, 7dpf lesion, and 14dpf lesion experiments. The ANOVA revealed no significant main effects, supporting the strategy of pooling experimental repeats to estimate distributions.</p>
<p>The results of the ANOVA, along with the IQRs for all experimental repeats, are presented in Tables 6-11. We have also clarified this in the methods section in lines 505-509.</p>

<p>- Data representation: All data of postural angles should be represented in the form of violin plots to show the underlying distributions of the postural angles, especially given that the effect size is small relative to the dispersion of the distribution of the postural angle and that this distribution is also not Gaussian but bimodal, and different before and after the treatments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We take the Reviewer’s point that seeing the full distribution can be useful. We have added plots of the raw distributions for the data in Figure 3 as supplemental Figure S3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Showing the distributions will provide the necessary information for the reader to evaluate the importance of the effect. For all data shown in Table 1, the distributions should be presented in the supplementary information.</p>

<p>As requested, we have added the distributions of the data in Table 1 to the supplement (Figure S2)</p>

<p>- Roll posture: A statement about whether roll posture is perturbed by Purkinje cell manipulation would be a piece of important additional information helping to understand how strong the 'disruption' of posture is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We haven’t assessed roll posture, as this is not practical in the current version of the SAMPL apparatus. We have added this limitation to the results (line 116) but also note that as our manipulations are bilateral, we don’t anticipate any systematic changes to roll.</p>

<p>- Comparison with other methods: Add a discussion on how the TRPV1/capsaicin method compares with other methods, such as using nitroreductase (Ntr) for targeted pharmaco-genetic ablation of cells by treatment with metronidazole or the the possibility to to ablate Purkinje cells by KillerRed as the author lab has done previously. Both methods have been applied to ablate Purkinje cells in larval zebrafish. What are the advantages of the TRPV1 method compared to these when neglecting the activation possibility?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for that suggestion, we have added a section to the discussion where we compare the TRPV1/capsaicin lesion to other lesion methods (lines 334-336)</p>

<p>We have described the decoding algorithm in more detail in the methods under ‘Functional GCaMP imaging in Purkinje cells.’ Line 488+</p>
<p>We used a support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. The SVM model was trained using k-fold cross-validation, which splits the data into k subsets (folds). At each iteration, the model was trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold, ensuring that the model performance was evaluated on unseen data in each fold. Permutations were performed on randomized trial identity as a null hypothesis (5-fold cross-validation; 100 shuffles for randomization). Accuracy was calculated as 1 minus the classification loss.</p>

<p>- Electrophysiological Control: Including an electrophysiological characterization of the activation of Purkinje cells by the TRPV1/capsaicin would significantly strengthen the validity of the method.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We take the Reviewer’s point that electrophysiological characterization is a way to strengthen the validity of the method. However, Chen et al (h&quot;<ext-link>ps://doi.org/10.1038/</ext-link> nmeth.3691) have performed electrophysiology during neuronal activation and concluded that TRPV1 activation with capsaicin indeed increases neuronal activity and firing rates increased. Our calcium imaging and lesion experiments amply demonstrate that Purkinje cells are sensitive to TRPV1-mediated currents. We therefore do not believe that the additional information gained by arduous electrophysiological evaluation is merited here.</p>

<p>- Describe more in detail how climb and dive bouts are defined. The height difference between consecutive bouts measured 250ms before the bout of executions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Climb and Dive bouts are split by the angle of their trajectory. If the fish moves up (i.e. trajectory larger 0) it is considered a climb bout and vice versa for dive bouts. 250ms prior to the maximum speed is roughly the time the fish initiate a bout, so the pre-bout posture is measured when at this point. The time-courses of bouts are dissected extensively in Zhu et. al. 2023. We have added a definition for climb and dive bouts to the method section under ‘Behavior analysis’ line 453 and 454.</p>

<p>- Figure 1H: Why can't you ablate all Purkinje cells but only about 80%?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent question. We opted for an extremely conservative count, and included everything that was still resembling a cell, even if it might not be functional/ already dying. Our counts are therefore likely an underestimate of the percentage of cells that were lost. We have added this point to the text in lines 393 395</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) Lines 74-81. The data presented here and in later experiments to argue for an effect of capsaicin on neural activity lacks statistical rigor because of the apparently very small numbers of animals/cells assessed. For example, the control appears to involve 4 cells assessed from 1 animal, and the experimental group is just 2 animals. Given that the interpretation of the paper depends upon this result, it is worthwhile to show the result more clearly, and with some statistical analysis. They argue in the discussion that &quot;Our imaging assay established that 1 µM of capsaicin would stochastically activate subsets of Purkinje cells&quot; which seems a stretch from the data as presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this point, which was shared by Reviewer 1. We have added more data and performed statistical analysis (line 63 - 67 as well as Figure S1A)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I found the practice of sorting effects by a mixture of effect size and p-value to be a little arbitrary, although in this case, it seems likely that it identified the most relevant effects. I would have preferred to see some attempt to correct for multiple comparisons (e.g. by resampling with the identities of fish shuffled to estimate the distribution of each measurement for this population size), followed by filtering for effect size after establishing a corrected threshold for significance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We take the Reviewer’s point, though we note that critical values for effect size and pvalue are inevitably “a little arbitrary.” We can’t do the exact analysis the Reviewer suggests as we do not measure data from individual fish for these experiments. However, we did calculate new critical p-values (added to the Tables) that account for multiple comparisons using Šidák’s method.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 4. The data here is a little strange in that the slope in the control condition for medium speed is given as much larger than for slow, but the data in the two cases appears largely overlapping for most of the range of behavior, only diverging for the most extreme rotations. It seems perhaps that the measurement of slope is strongly dependent on these most extreme values. The authors might want to consider the use of robust regression methods which might mitigate these effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting observation and we appreciate the Reviewer’s thoughtful suggestion. We now use a robust regression method (bisquare weighting of residuals).</p>
<p>We have adjusted all values in lines 175 - 177  and added the regression method to the Methods section line 520.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 5. The 'principal component analysis' description is extremely unclear. The text says that PCA 'showed near-complete segregation of trial types' but it is not explained how this was achieved with PCA or how this was quantified. Figure panels show the data plotted using different pairs of PCs showing visual evidence of segregation. In the methods, it is stated that &quot;We performed principal component analysis&quot; and that &quot;cells were used for principal component analysis and subsequent support vector machine decoding analysis&quot;. What is meant exactly by 'performed PCA'? Was PCA used in a dimensionality reduction step? And if so, how many and which PCs were chosen and why? For visualization of the separation, the authors show arbitrary pairs of PCs. Could it be better to use a method more suited to that purpose such as linear discriminant analysis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>PCA was used to define a subspace to qualitatively evaluate if different trials could be separated. Once it became clear that it could, we next trained a binary decoder on the complete dataset (i.e. no dimensionality reduction). We did not perform linear discriminant analysis as the unsupervised PCA already showed separation of trial types.  We have made this clearer in lines 212 - 214.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Why does the decoding analysis use only untuned cells? Isn't it equally, or more, interesting to know how well tilt can be encoded using all cells? It is unclear to me what we learn by selecting only untuned cells for this analysis (although I agree it is interesting that this does work).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We focused exclusively on untuned cells because including even a single highly tuned cell for the population coding will lead to excellent results. By using untuned cells we test if there is some directionality information that is not visible just by looking at the up/ down responses of single cells. We have made this clear in lines 217 - 218</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points and corrections:</p>
<p>(1) Maybe consider losing the words 'powerful' (I think it is overused and not well defined) and 'reagent'. Reagent is normally used for something that participates in a reaction. It is a bit odd to use it to refer to a transgenic animal. Later it is called a 'tool' which seems better.</p>

<p>We have changed the wording and refer to it as tool for the whole paper.</p>

<p>(3) Saying that 'posture' increases is confusing, although the meaning can be inferred from the overall context and the definitions in the Methods - could Posture be capitalized to indicate a specific definition is being used rather than the general meaning?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This suggestion agrees with those made by Reviewer 2. We have changed the wording to “postural angle.”</p>
