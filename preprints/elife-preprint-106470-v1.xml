<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Preclinical studies of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell immunotherapies are often based on monitoring bioluminescent tumors implanted in mice to assess anti-tumor cytotoxicity. Here, we introduce maRQup (<bold>m</bold>urine <bold>a</bold>utomatic <bold>R</bold>adiance <bold>Qu</bold>antification and <bold>p</bold>arametrization), an easy-to-use method that automatically processes bioluminescent tumor images for quantitative analysis. We demonstrate the ability of maRQup to analyze CAR-T cell treatments over &gt;1,000 tumor-bearing mice. We compare CD19-targeting CAR-T cells comprising either a CD28 or a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, and found the former controlled the tumor burden better initially, while the latter reduced the frequency of tumor relapse. We also applied maRQup to demonstrate faster tumor growth during the initial growth phase as compared to the relapse phase and to spatiotemporally analyze the high variability in immunotherapeutic control of tumors, based on their anatomical location. maRQup provides quantitative and statistically-robust insights on preclinical experiments that will contribute to the optimization of immunotherapies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past decade, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell immunotherapy has emerged as a highly effective treatment for hematological malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McClory and Maude (2023)</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cappell and Kochenderfer (2023)</xref>. The field has seen the completion of numerous clinical trials — over 500 in the United States and nearly 1,000 in Asia and Europe as of early 2025 — exploring innovative constructs with therapeutic applications against cancer as well as in autoimmunity <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">Kyverna Thera-peutics (2023)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Juno Therapeutics, Inc., a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (2024)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Müller et al. (2024)</xref> and viral infections (eg HIV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Deeks (2023)</xref><bold><italic>, University of </italic></bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Pennsylvania (2023)</xref>. However, CAR-T cell therapies still face shortcomings. CAR-T cell toxicity is often limiting, and a lack of persistence of functional CAR-T cells is associated with tumor relapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cappell and Kochenderfer (2023)</xref>. Given the rapid and diverse developments in this field, it is essential to be able to quantify and standardize the preclinical data for testing the design of CAR-T cell constructs and for engineering anti-tumor T cell and non-T cell immune subsets, thereby optimizing clinical trials.</p>
<p>The present standard for the preclinical <italic>in-vivo</italic> evaluation of human CAR-T cells relies on the kinetic assessment of human tumor cells engineered to express the luciferase gene in immunod-eficient mice, generally NOD.Cg-<italic>Prkdc</italic><sup><italic>scid</italic></sup> <italic>Il2rg</italic><sup><italic>tm</italic>1<italic>W jl</italic></sup>/SzJ (NSG) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carceles-Cordon et al. (2016)</xref>. The growth and eradication of the tumor upon CAR-T cell adoptive transfer is then assessed by luminescence imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carceles-Cordon et al. (2016)</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhaumik and Gambhir (2002)</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Weissleder and Ntziachristos (2003)</xref>. This <italic>in-vivo</italic> assay, which assesses tumor growth <italic>vs</italic>. tumor eradication and mouse survival, is generally required by the FDA for any investigational new drug (IND) application of a novel CAR-T cell design. However, it is concerning that there is significant variability in how these data are reported, highlighting the urgent need for better quantification, spatiotemporal resolution, and statistical analyses.</p>
<p>A limiting step for many experimentalists and clinicians is the lack of a framework to automatically process large <italic>in-vivo</italic> experiments: visualization, quantitation, and analysis of these <italic>in-vivo</italic> assays are often handled by manual copying and pasting of images followed by visual inspection. Here, we introduce a Python pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/soorajachar/radianceQuantifier">https://github.com/soorajachar/radianceQuantifier</ext-link>) named maR-Qup (for <bold>m</bold>urine <bold>a</bold>utomatic <bold>R</bold>adiance <bold>Qu</bold>antification and <bold>p</bold>arametrization) that automates the processing, spatiotemporal quantification, and modeling of <italic>in-vivo</italic> bioluminescent tumor image data.</p>
<p>We applied this toolkit to assess the tumor dynamics of <italic>in-vivo</italic> CAR-T cell-based experiments performed on &gt;1,000 NSG mice. This systematic endeavor afforded the opportunity to carry out advanced statistical analyses and mathematical modeling to spatiotemporally resolve the responsiveness of leukemia-bearing NSG mice to CAR-T cell immunotherapies. Using our quantitative framework, we have built a repository with over 7,500 images, allowing for the large-scale and longitudinal evaluation of CAR-T cell therapy. Analysis and modeling of this database has revealed novel characteristics of CAR-T cell designs as well as novel dynamics of tumor responses that would not have been feasible from a manual evaluation of the data. Our quantitative method and repository will promote the identification of key differences in immune-based treatments in murine models, thereby leading to improved cancer immunotherapy trials for patients.</p>

<title>maRQup pipeline</title>
<p>All IVIS images were processed, annotated, and analyzed using a custom-built Python pipeline named maRQup (for <bold>m</bold>urine <bold>a</bold>utomatic <bold>R</bold>adiance <bold>Qu</bold>antification and <bold>p</bold>arametrization) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Each IVIS image contains 1 to 5 mice, as mice in the same experimental group are typically imaged at the same time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Thus, we developed an algorithm that automatically identifies and isolates each mouse from the group image to allow for further image processing and analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). In order to analyze tumor burden within different regions of each mouse (e.g., liver, lungs, bone marrow, and snout), all images were processed so that anatomical regions were aligned across mice: first, the tail of each mouse was automatically removed from each image as the positioning of the tail resulted in large variability in the length and width of each image; next, the images were scaled vertically to the same height to normalize mouse length and to ensure anatomical regions were horizontally aligned. Additionally, maRQup removes from analysis any mice that were slanted due to misplacement during image acquisition (&lt;1.2% (91/7633) of the images in our experience). After image processing and alignment of anatomical regions, the average radiance per pixel for each mouse in units of photons per second per cm<sup>2</sup> per steradian per pixel was calculated and used as a quantification of tumor burden. maRQup also allows the user to select a custom region of interest to calculate tumor burden across all mice. Further details about these steps can be found in the Supplemental Methods.</p>

<title>Dataset generation</title>
<p>Using our maRQup pipeline, we accrued a dataset consisting of 1,060 mice from 37 separate experiments conducted by nine different researchers. Information on the CAR-T cell constructs (extracellular binding domain and intracellular costimulatory domain), CAR-T cell doses, target tumors, and tumor doses for each experiment were appended to our dataset along with the measurements of tumor dynamics.</p>
<p>Of the 1,060 mice, almost all (n=908) were injected with an initial load of 0.8-1.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> tumor cells. NALM6, an acute lymphoblastic B cell leukemia (B-ALL) cell line, was the most common tumor studied (n=872). Tumors were treated with CAR-T cells targeting either CD19 and/or CD22 cell surface receptors (n=715). CD19-targeting CARs with either a 4-1BB (KYMRIAH-like, tisa-cel) or CD28 costimulatory domain (YESCARTA-like, axi-cel) were used in 382 and 209 mice, respectively. A CD22- targeting CAR with a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, granted FDA breakthrough therapy designation based on its efficacy in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory B-ALL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fry et al. (2018)</xref>, was used in 74 mice. An additional 55 mice were treated with a bicistronic CD19/CD22-targeting CAR containing CD28 and 4-1BB costimulatory domains, respectively, that are currently being assessed in a phase 1/2 clinical trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shalabi et al. (2022)</xref>. Mock transduced T cells (n=143) and no T cells (n=91) were used as controls. CAR-T cells were also evaluated against other B-ALL cell lines in 106 mice, and these mice were only included in the dataset to aid in the development of maRQup and to ensure its generalizability.</p>
<p>The dose of adoptively-transferred CAR-T cell was another variable: 126 mice were treated with &lt;1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells, 148 mice were treated with 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells, 42 mice were treated with 1.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells, 411 mice were treated with 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells, and 99 mice were treated with &gt;2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells. The distribution of these experimental conditions are summarized in Supplemental Figure S2.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Classification of tumor responses to CAR-T cells</title>
<p>From our processed experiments, we identified three phases of tumor dynamics: tumor growth, tumor decay, and tumor relapse. However, not all tumors progressed through all three of these phases. Thus, we used our simple automatic classification of tumor response to CAR-T cell therapy (see Methods <bold><italic>section</italic></bold>) with five different categories: (G) growth only; (G,D) growth and decay; (G,D,R) growth, decay, and relapse; (D) decay only; and (D,R) decay and relapse (Supplemental Figure S2).</p>
<p>Of the 1,060 mice, 602 mice had tumors that initially grew from Day 0. Of these mice with initial tumor growth, the tumors then decayed in 228 mice and did not decay in 374 mice. 218 of the 374 mice with no tumor decay (58.3%) represented control mice that were not treated with CAR-T cells. 167 mice had tumors that grew and decayed but eventually relapsed. Of the mice with tumors that decayed initially following CAR-T treatment (n=458, 43.2% of all mice), 355 mice had tumors that relapsed (77.5%). Only 103 mice had tumor that only decayed and never exhibited a growth (or relapse) phase. Hence, despite the tight range of immunotherapeutic parameters, we observed large variability in both tumor growth and eradication (Supplemental Figure S2d-e).</p>

<title>Comparison of 4-1BB and CD28 costimulatory domains in CD19-targeting CAR-T cells</title>
<p>We first focused our analysis to assess the effect of costimulatory domains in CD19 CAR-T cells harboring the same CD19-targeting FMC63 scFv: anti-CD19.4-1BB (KYMRIAH-like, tisa-cel) and anti- CD19.CD28 (YESCARTA-like, axi-cel) CAR-T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>).

</fig>
<p>In the preclinical settings evaluated here, we found the overall tumor behavior for all mice treated with either CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells or CD19.CD28 CAR-T cells to be indeed statistically different (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b-f</xref>). Of NSG mice with NALM6 tumors that were treated with CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells (n=377), 43.2% of tumors continued to grow initially even in the presence of CAR-T cells. However, only 29.7% of mice with NALM6 tumors treated with the CD19.CD28 CAR-T cells (n=209) continued to grow in the presence of CAR-T cells. Thus, once the CD19.CD28 CAR-T cells were injected into the mice, they were more likely than the CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells to immediately initiate tumor killing and prevent tumor growth. NALM6 tumors treated with CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells were still able to continue growing, suggesting that CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells are either slower to home to tumor and/or slower to induce cytotoxicity against NALM6 leukemia. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>)</p>
<p>Although CD19.CD28 CAR-T cells were initially better at killing NALM6 leukemia, 79.9% of mice eventually relapsed. While there was still significant relapse in mice treated with CD19.4-1BB CAR- T cells, only 58.6% of mice relapsed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). These observations, which were not previously reported in previous preclinical mouse experiments, were made statistically significant due to the very large size of the cohorts of mice processed through our maRQup pipeline. This is critical as our preclinical mouse data – demonstrating a more rapid cytotoxicity of CD19.CD28 CAR-T cells and a sustained persistence of CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells – is in accord with clinical trial outcomes showing higher efficacy of the former in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and prolonged persistence of the latter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Maude et al.

<title>Effects of CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cell dose on <italic>in-vivo</italic> cytotoxicity against NALM6 leukemia</title>
<p>We next investigated the impact of different doses of CAR-T cells on tumor eradication. We focused on the largest subset of mice with the same initial tumor burden (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> NALM6) treated with the same CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells (n=349 mice). As expected, increasing the dose of CAR-T cells from &lt;1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells to &gt;2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells resulted in an increased initial killing of the tumor and limited tumor growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d-e</xref>).</p>
<p>When the dose of CAR-T cells was &lt;1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells, leukemia growth initially continued in 90.3% (28/31) of mice. In 18 of these mice (64.3%), the leukemia was never controlled by the CAR-T cells and the mice rapidly succumbed. Increasing the dose to 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells resulted in a higher initial tumor control, with 54.2% (39/72) of tumors regressing immediately following treatment. Doubling the dose to 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells further increased efficacy to 68.4% (147/215), and at doses of &gt;2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells, 100% (10/10) of mice exhibited tumor regression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d-e</xref>).</p>
<p>Although higher doses of CAR-T cells led to a more significant initial tumor killing, it is interesting to note that the frequency of tumor relapse also increased. At doses of &lt;1 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells, 22.6% (7/31) and 50.0% (36/72) of mice eventually relapsed with leukemia, respectively, but at a dose of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR-T cells, there was a significantly higher frequency of relapse with 74.4% (160/215) of mice succumbing to leukemia (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, at higher doses of &gt;2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CAR- T cells, leukemic growth was better controlled with only 30% (3/10) of mice relapsing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d-f</xref>, p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>These results suggest an ideal dosing regimen that optimizes the trade-off between the highest level of initial tumor killing and the lowest level of tumor relapse. Our analysis also highlights the potential for a maximal immediate tumor killing to be associated with a higher level of relapse, at least in the context of an NSG mouse model. The observations from our maRQup pipeline reveal trade-offs in short-term and long-term CAR-T cell cytotoxicities that will be important to investigate further.</p>

<title>Tumor growth is slower during the relapse phase than the initial phase</title>
<p>In order to compare the rate of tumor growth during the relapse phase to the rate of tumor growth during the initial growth phase, we examined only mice with tumors that grew from the start, exhibited some control by CAR-T cells, and eventually relapsed (G,D,R). Control mice that did not receive CAR-T cells were excluded. A total of 335 mice were engrafted with NALM6 leukemia that initially grew after CAR-T cell administration. 156 of these mice exhibited leukemic relapse (46.6%). The rate of tumor growth during relapse was significantly slower than the rate of tumor growth during the initial phase for 81.4% of these mice (n=127) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>), highlighting the selective pressure that CAR-T cell cytotoxicity applies to the leukemia. Future studies will be needed to characterize these selective pressures at both the molecular and cellular levels.</p>

<sec id="s2h">
<title>Rates of initial leukemia growth predict the long-term behavior</title>
<p>We report the distribution of the initial growth rates for all 335 mice with NALM6 leukemia that continue to grow upon CAR-T cell treatment to be bimodal. Two classes of responses to CAR-T cells could be distinguished from the initial tumor growth phase: 170 mice (50.7%) had slow growing tumors (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>Growth</italic></sub> ≤ 0.85 days<sup>−1</sup>), while 165 mice (49.3%) had fast growing tumors (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>Growth</italic></sub> &gt; 0.85 days<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>Such dynamic differences in the initial phase of the preclinical experiments resulted in longterm differences. Slower growing leukemia were more likely to escape complete killing by CAR-T cells with 65.9% (112/170) of these leukemia never regressing. In contrast, only 18.2% (30/165) of fast growing leukemia escaped killing. Indeed, we detected regression in 81.8% (135/165) of fast growing tumors <italic>vs</italic>. 34.1% (58/170) of slow growing tumors. However, the faster growing tumors resulted in significantly more relapse than the slower growing tumors, with 66.1% (109/165) of tumors eventually relapsing. Interestingly though, the likelihood of relapse after regression was similar for the fast and slow growing tumors (80.7% (109/135) and 81.0% (47/58), respectively). These results suggest that slow growing leukemia may avoid being killed by CAR-T cells. While this may limit short-term expansion, it can lead to continued long-term tumor growth. In contrast, faster growing tumors are initially killed by CAR-T cells, but following this phase, the likelihood of relapse is similar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f-g</xref>). Hence our maRQup analysis reveals a quantitative paradox that leukemia that are initially better controlled by CAR-T cells may evade CAR-T cell killing in the long run.</p>

<title>Effects of CAR-T:Tumor cell numbers on <italic>in-vivo</italic> growth and killing</title>
<p>We also explored the effects of different ratios of CAR-T to tumor cells on <italic>in-vivo</italic> growth and killing rates. We split our dataset into two categories depending on whether mice were treated with more (CAR-T:Tumor ≥ 1) or fewer (CAR-T:Tumor &lt; 1) CAR-T cells than the original number of injected tumor cells. The distributions of tumor growth rates (initial and relapse) and CAR-T cell killing rates for these two groups are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>. The initial growth rate of tumors was significantly faster when fewer CAR-T cells were injected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>, left, p&lt;0.001), suggesting that the effects of the CAR-T cell dose contributes to the bimodal distribution of initial tumor growth rates seen in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>. Consequently, the rate of killing of the tumors by the CAR-T cells, as calculated as the difference in tumor growth rate in the presence and absence of CAR-T cells, was significantly greater when a higher number of CAR-T cells were adoptively transferred into tumor-bearing mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>, middle, p&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>Although the rate of initial tumor growth was modulated by the ratio of CAR-T cells to tumor cells, there was no significant difference in the growth rate of tumors during the relapse phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>, right) suggesting that tumor growth during the relapse phase is independent of the CAR-T cell dose. The distribution of tumor growth rates during the relapse phase was dependent on the classification of overall tumor behavior - growth, decay, and relapse (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>Growth</italic></sub> &gt; 0); and decay and relapse (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>Growth</italic></sub> = 0). The “growth, decay, and relapse” population could further be stratified by the rate of initial tumor growth (ie, fast <italic>vs</italic>. slow, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). We found that there was no difference in the rate of tumor growth during the relapse phase among tumors that were initially fast or slow growing. However, the rate of tumor growth during the relapse phase was significantly faster in tumors that regressed immediately following CAR-T cell administration as compared to tumors that continued growing upon adoptive transfer of CAR-T (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3i</xref>, p&lt;0.05).</p>

<title>Tracking of tumor burden across anatomical regions following adoptive transfer of CAR-T cells</title>
<p>Each pixel of the mouse tumor radiance image consists of three different layers of data: the tumor radiance value, a boolean value to distinguish the mouse from the background, and a brightfield image value (Supplemental Figure S4a). As described in <bold><italic>subsection</italic></bold>, all images were processed and aligned so that anatomical regions were located in the same area across all images. Supplemental Figure S4g shows the standard deviation of the boolean values of the merged images as well as the average radiance, mouse, and brightfield values across all 7,534 images. From the average radiance image, all pixel values within the same row were averaged, and a Principal Component Analysis was performed. The first four principal components accounted for greater than 90% of the overall variability (Supplemental Figure S5a, left). The same process was performed with the column pixels (Supplemental Figure S5a, right). By using the x-intercepts of the loading curves for row principal components 2 and 3, and column principal components 4 and 5, we were able to reliably demarcate nine distinct anatomical regions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>; Supplemental Figure S5a, middle/left). After quantifying tumor radiance within different anatomical regions, the tumor burden within these regions could be monitored separately over time. Intriguingly, the dynamics of tumor growth appeared to vary per region (representative example shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). We therefore systematically characterized the tumor growth patterns per region across all 872 NALM6 leukemiabearing mice in our dataset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, left) and found a remarkable level of divergence in the growth patterns of leukemic cells in individual regions compared to the overall mouse tumor burden (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, right and Supplemental Figure S5b-d): up to 40% of analyzed mice showed different growth patterns in an individual anatomical region compared to their overall tumor burden. Characterizing this divergence per anatomical region and growth pattern revealed that the snout and bone marrow regions show significantly different tumor growth dynamics than the overall tumor growth across the whole mouse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). Leukemia in the snout was much more likely to only grow over time (and never decay) in mice exhibiting bulk leukemia regression prior to relapse, indicating that snout-localized leukemic cells were more resistant to CAR-T cell immunotherapy. In direct contrast, leukemia in the bone marrow was more likely to regress and relapse even when the overall tumor burden in the mice would only grow or grow, decay, and relapse, suggesting that bone marrow-localized tumors can be more easily killed by CAR-T cells. This sharp deviation between the two regions could also be observed by the extremely low correlation of growth dynamics between snout and bone marrow tumors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e</xref>).</p>

<p>Thus, our spatiotemporal analysis of tumor growth dynamics derived from maRQup indicates that in many mice, the tumor in the bone marrow is eradicated by CAR-T cells and that a few tumor cells in the snout are resistant to killing by CAR-T cells. These tumor cells then circulate, resulting in global tumor relapse. These results suggest that CAR-T cells are either unable to access leukemia in the snout or that a subset of CAR-T cell resistant-leukemia inherently localize to the snout region. We presented these observations to illustrate the power of our maRQup pipeline to derive novel quantitative observations that call for further molecular and cellular analyses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have used maRQup to assemble a large dataset of preclinical experiments yielding important insights about the response dynamics of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumor cells to different CAR-T cell doses and constructs. From our data, we quantified differences between CD19 CAR-T cells harboring a 4-1BB as compared to a CD28 costimulatory signaling domain in <italic>in-vivo</italic> murine experiments. CD19.CD28 CAR-T cells initially were more effective at killing the tumor and preventing initial tumor growth. However, these CAR-T cells were associated with a high frequency of tumor relapse, consistent with limited long-term activation and/or exhaustion. Conversely, adoptive transfer of CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells was associated with a significantly greater frequency of initial tumor growth, but of note, there were fewer relapses as compared to mice treated with CD19.CD28 CAR-T cells. These results reveal that CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells require longer kinetics for initial homing and/or cytotoxic function, but they retain killing potential for more sustained periods of time. Importantly, while these types of conclusions were not able to be drawn from preclinical mice experiments prior to the maRQup analyses presented here, they are in accord with clinical findings in patients: CD19.CD28 CAR-T cells exhibit high efficacy in the context of lymphoma, but CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells persist for significantly longer periods of time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Maude et al.

<p>The potential for a time-controlled administration, resulting in a relay from exhausted CAR-T cells to CAR-T cells that function at a later time point can be of much interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Salazar-Cavazos and Altan-Bonnet (2022)</xref>. However, future experiments investigating the impact of such a strategy on severe adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome are needed. Our maRQup pipeline will aid in the optimization of this type of CAR-T cell regimen, facilitating preclinical testing and analysis.</p>
<p>Using maRQup, we have also documented the impact of CAR-T cell dose on tumor dynamics in a preclinical setting. As expected, administration of a higher number of CAR-T cells is associated with an increase in initial tumor killing. However, it was of interest to note that higher doses of CAR-T cells did not prevent relapse. We conjecture, that at higher doses, CAR-T cells do eradicate tumors too efficiently and rapidly, limiting the release of cytokines (eg IL-2) necessary to prolong and sustain CAR-T cell cytotoxicity. However, these data were observed in the context of NSG mice wherein homeostatic murine cytokines do not cross-react with human cytokine receptors; it will therefore be of interest to determine whether the data reported here are model-specific or whether relapse might be lower in humanized mice models engineered to express human cytokines such as MISTRG mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Strowig et al. (2011)</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ivic et al. (2017)</xref>. It is, however, notable that at very high doses of CAR-T cells, a complete eradication of tumor at early time points prevents relapse. In patients, the trade off between efficacy and severe adverse effects such as cytokine release syndrome and on-target/off-tumor effects needs to be carefully evaluated. This trade-off can be assessed as a “Pareto Front” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shoval et al. (2012)</xref> - balancing the need for tumor killing, cytokine secretion by CAR-T cells activated by tumor antigens, persistence, and lack of exhaustion to prevent long-term tumor relapse. Further detailed modeling of such Pareto optimization can be performed using the quantitative parameters derived from maRQup analysis.</p>
<p>Additionally, the image processing from maRQup enables for the spatiotemporal evaluation of tumor dynamics following treatment with CAR-T cells. Applying this pipeline to our dataset, we identified the snout as an anatomical region that has different tumor behavior as compared to the overall response of the tumor. Tumor in the snout appears to be more resistant to CAR-T cell therapy, either due to the snout being an immune-privileged site or a region where resistant tumor cells (ie, inherently resistant or resistant by down-regulating the target antigen) localize. Multiple case reports have been published describing similar observations in patients who have had B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia tumor relapse in the mandibles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bakathir and Al-Hamdani (2009)</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benson et al.

<p>We anticipate that systematic application of maRQup will allow investigators and clinicians to rigorously, comparatively, and rapidly optimize CAR-T cell design and dose regimens, leading to improved cancer immunotherapies for patients.</p>

<title>Classifying mouse outcomes to CAR-T cell therapies as a function of quantitative tumor dynamics</title>
<p>For each mouse, tumor radiance was calculated at all timepoints as a measure of responsiveness to CAR-T cells. We observed three qualitatively distinct phases of tumor dynamics upon reviewing our datasets: tumor growth, tumor decay, and tumor relapse. To automatically identify these three phases, consecutive timepoints were compared in a stepwise fashion until a threshold was met to signal the end of one phase and the start of the next phase (Supplemental Figure S2a): 1) The phase of “tumor growth” ended at the timepoint immediately prior to when tumor radiance was &lt;75% of the tumor radiance detected at the previous timepoint; 2) “Tumor decay” ended at the timepoint immediately prior to a tumor radiance increase of three-fold; 3) “Tumor relapse” was defined as all remaining timepoints (prior to sacrifice or death). Equations were then derived to automatically fit and delineate each phase (Supplemental Figure S2b). The tumor dynamics in the three aforementioned phases for each individual mouse in each experiment were manually inspected to confirm that the automated classification of tumor dynamics, based on the defined thresholds, was satisfactory.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Modeling each dynamic phase</title>
<p>We modeled the dynamics of each of these three phases using simple differential equations to examine the kinetic rates of tumors in the growth, decay, and relapse phases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Hence, we performed our parametrization of the tumor dynamics using a piecewise approach. These kinetic rates were then compared across mice that were treated with different CAR-T cell therapeutic parameters (eg dose or construct).</p>
<p>The tumor growth and relapse phases were modeled as logistic growth:

After removal of the outliers, the prior population used had a mean <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>Growth</italic></sub> = 0.84 days<sup>−1</sup> and standard deviation of 0.43 days<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>For the growth rate during relapse, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>Relapse</italic></sub>, the prior distribution of the fitting parameter was determined by removing outliers where <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>Relapse</italic></sub> &gt; 3 days<sup>−1</sup> as well. After removal of the outliers, the prior population used had a mean <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>Relapse</italic></sub> = 0.60 days<sup>−1</sup> and standard deviation of 0.32 days<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>Note that the fit for the decay rate, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>Decay</italic></sub>, yielded a bimodal population. Thus, we could not derive reliable Bayesian priors for the tumor decay phase. Such simple fitting procedure reduced the complex dynamics of tumor response to CAR-T cell treatment to a small set of quantitative parameters, allowing for additional statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Supplemental Figure S3 shows the Bayesian Priors method of removing and refitting outliers.</p>

<p>The authors developed a <bold>fundamental</bold> computational method, which is intended to automatically process bioluminescence imaging-derived tumour images across anatomical regions and over time. This allows quantitative analysis of such data, and the authors applied it to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of tumour cells in response to CD19-targeted CAR-T cells that contained either CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domains. Some operational limitations were identified, which relate to the pipeline's reliance on predefined regions of interest instead of aligning signal sites with anatomical information, scaling, and not taking animal pose into account. Overall, the authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence for the functionality of their computational approach towards automated analysis of bioluminescence imaging data, while applying it to a current topic of wide interest in cell therapy research.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper presents maRQup, a Python pipeline for automating the quantitative analysis of preclinical cancer immunotherapy experiments using bioluminescent imaging in mice. maRQup processes images to quantify tumor burden over time and across anatomical regions, enabling large-scale analysis of over 1,000 mice. The study uses this tool to compare different CAR-T cell constructs and doses, identifying differences in initial tumor control and relapse rates, particularly noting that CD19.CD28 CAR-T cells show faster initial killing but higher relapse compared to CD19.4-1BB CAR-T cells. Furthermore, maRQup facilitates the spatiotemporal analysis of tumor dynamics, revealing differences in growth patterns based on anatomical location, such as the snout exhibiting more resistance to treatment than bone marrow.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The maRQup pipeline enables the automatic processing of a large dataset of over 1,000 mice, providing investigators with a rapid and efficient method for analyzing extensive bioluminescent tumor image data.</p>
<p>(2) Through image processing steps like tail removal and vertical scaling, maRQup normalizes mouse dimensions to facilitate the alignment of anatomical regions across images. This process enables the reliable demarcation of nine distinct anatomical regions within each mouse image, serving as a basis for spatiotemporal analysis of tumor burden within these consistent regions by quantifying average radiance per pixel.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the pipeline aims to standardize images for regional assessment, the reliance on scaling primarily along the vertical axis after tail removal may introduce limitations to the quantitative robustness of the anatomically defined regions. This approach does not account for potential non-linear growth across dimensions in animals of different ages or sizes, which could result in relative stretching or shrinking of subjects compared to an average reference.</p>
<p>(2) Furthermore, despite excluding severely slanted images, the pipeline does not fully normalize for variations in animal pose during image acquisition (e.g., tucked body, leaning). This pose variability not only impacts the precise relative positioning of internal anatomical regions, potentially making their definition based on relative image coordinates more qualitative than truly quantitative for precise regional analysis, but it also means that the bioluminescent light signal from the tumor will not propagate equally to the camera, as photons will travel differentially through the tissue. This differing light path through tissues due to variable positioning can introduce large variability in the measured radiance that was not accounted for in the analysis algorithm. Achieving more robust anatomical and quantitative normalization might require methods that control animal posture using a rigid structure during imaging.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors developed a method that automatically processes bioluminescent tumor images for quantitative analysis and used it to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of tumor cells in response to CD19-targeting CAR-T cells, comprising CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domains. The conclusion highlights the dependence of tumor decay and relapse on the number of injected cells, the type of cells, and the initial growth rate of tumors ( where initial is intended from the first day of therapy). The authors also determined the spatiotemporal analysis of tumor response to CAR T therapy in different regions of the mouse body in a model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The analysis is based on a large number of images and accounts for many variables. The results of the analysis largely support their claims that the kinetics of tumor decay and relapse are dependent on the CAR T co-stimulatory domain and number of cells injected and tumor growth rates.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study does not specify how a) differences in mouse positioning (and whether they excluded not-aligned mice) and b) tumor spread at the start of therapy influenced their data. The study does not take into account the potential heterogeneity of CAR T cells in terms of CAR T expression or T cell immunophenotype ( differentiation, exhaustion, fitness...).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper &quot;The 1000+ mouse project: large-scale spatiotemporal parametrization and modeling of preclinical cancer immunotherapies&quot; is focused on developing a novel methodology for automatic processing of bioluminescence imaging data. It provides quantitative and statistically robust insights into preclinical experiments that will contribute to optimizing cell-based therapies. There is an enormous demand for such methods and approaches that enable the spatiotemporal evaluation of cell monitoring in large cohorts of experimental animals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is generally well written, and the experiments are scientifically sound. The conclusions reflect the soundness of experimental data. This approach seems to be quite innovative and promising to improve the statistical accuracy of BLI data quantification.</p>
<p>This methodology can be used as a universal quantification tool for BLI data for in vivo assessment of adoptively transferred cells due to the versatility of the technology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No weaknesses were identified by this Reviewer.</p>
