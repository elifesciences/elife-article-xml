<title>Abstract</title><p>Mical1 regulates F-actin dynamics through the reversible oxidation of actin, a process controlled by its interactions with various proteins. Upon binding to Rab8 family members, Mical1 links endosomes to the cytoskeleton, promoting F-actin disassembly. In the absence of Rab, Mical1 exists in an auto-inhibited state, but its biochemical characterization remains incomplete. Our study reveals that the N-terminal MO-CH-LIM domains of Mical1 form an intramolecular complex with its C-terminal bMERB domain. Mutational analysis, guided by the AlphaFold2 model, identifies critical residues at the binding interface. Additionally, we demonstrate that full-length Mical1 binds to Rab8 in a 1:2 stoichiometry, thereby releasing auto-inhibition. Through structure-based mutational studies, we uncover allostery between the N and C-terminal Rab binding sites. Notably, Rab binding at the high-affinity C-terminal site precedes binding at the N-terminal site, suggesting a sequential binding mode. These findings elucidate how Rab8 binding releases the MO-CH-LIM domains from the Mical1 bMERB domain, facilitating interactions with other proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, thereby modulating actin dynamics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Actin dynamics is a highly controlled process, and the precise assembly and disassembly of actin is necessary for many cellular processes, including motility, adhesion, morphogenesis, and cytokinesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Actin-binding proteins (ABPs) are known to control filament polymerization (F-actin), its organization (bundling), and actin disassembly (G-actin). Apart from ABPs, actin post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, oxidation, acetylation, arginylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, and others, regulate actin dynamics, fine-tune actin organization, and its interaction with ABPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The Molecule Interacting with CasL (Mical) protein family members include Mical1, Mical2, and Mical3, which are monooxygenases that oxidize actin and regulate cytoskeleton organization in the presence of the coenzyme NADPH and of O <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Mical1 specifically oxidizes Met44 and Met47 of the DNaseI-binding loop (D-loop) in actin monomers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. These residues are involved in bridging actin subunits, thereby regulating F-actin stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Methionine oxidation leads to F-actin depolymerization, a process that can be selectively reversed by methionine sulfoxide reductases. For example, MsrB reduces Met44 and Met47 of oxidized monomeric actin (G-actin), leading to the repolymerization of actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Mical proteins play a crucial role in actin assembly regulation during muscle organization, axon guidance, drosophila bristle development, cell shape, cell viability, cardiovascular integrity, vesicular trafficking, and regulation of nuclear actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Mical1 has been implicated in several different cancers, including pancreatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, breast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, gastric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, colorectal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and melanoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> as well as in neurological and mental health disorders such as neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, spinal cord injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, and epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Mical family members contain an N-terminal monooxygenase (MO) domain which plays a crucial role in actin-depolymerization, a calponin homology (CH) domain, a LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3) domain which provides a protein-protein interaction interface, and a C-terminal bMERB domain that interacts with Rab proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Apart from these domains, Mical family members have a proline-rich region that interacts with SH3 domain-containing proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Mical1 plays a crucial role in synapse development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Mical1 and Mical3 are required for cytokinesis and vesicular trafficking. They regulate these processes by regulating F-actin dynamics by disassembling the actin filaments. Mical-like (MICAL-L) family members lack the MO domain and play critical roles in vesicular trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Humans have two Mical-like proteins (Mical-L1 and Mical-L2/JRAB) whereas Drosophila has a single Mical and a single Mical-like protein. Several studies have reported that in the absence of stimuli, the Micals and Mical-like family members exist in an auto-inhibited state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. However, biochemical, and structural characterization of the auto-inhibited state is missing.</p>
<p>Rab GTPases are players that have a crucial role in vesicular trafficking and more than 60 Rabs have been reported for humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Similar to other small GTPases, they act as molecular switches, switching between GTP-bound active state and GDP-bound inactive state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The switching process is spatiotemporally regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) which facilitate the nucleotide exchange from GDP to GTP and their GTPase activity is enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In the active GTP bound state, Rabs interacts with specific effector molecules to execute distinct downstream functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. MICAL family members are one such Rab8 family effector. It has been shown that the binding of Rab molecules activates these family members by releasing auto-inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that in the case of some family members, such as Mical1/3 and EHBP1L1, Rab binds to the bMERB domain in a 1:2 stoichiometry, whereas other bMERB family members have only a C-terminal high affinity binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, it is still to be shown whether full-length Mical1 binds to two Rab molecules and if there is any allosteric interaction between the two binding sites.</p>
<p>In this study, we comprehensively characterized the auto-inhibited and active states of human Mical1 using biochemical and structural methods. Via isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we confirmed that the N-terminal MO-CH-LIM domains interact with the C-terminal bMERB domain, requiring the full-length bMERB domain for this interaction. Crosslinking-mass spectrometry (XL-MS) experiments supported the auto-inhibited state of Mical1. Utilizing AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we constructed a model revealing the auto-inhibited state and identified crucial interacting residues. Additionally, we confirmed the 1:2 stoichiometry of Rab8a binding to full-length Mical1. Next, we investigated whether allostery exists in the N- and C-terminal Rab binding sites. To answer this, we have used the bMERB domain, since it shows similar Rab affinity as full-length Mical1. Biochemical experiments show that Rab8 first binds to the high-affinity C-terminal site, facilitating subsequent second Rab8 binding to the low-affinity N-terminal site. These findings underscore the essential role of Rab binding in Mical1 activation.</p>

<title>Mical1 exists in an auto-inhibited state</title>
<p>Human Mical1 comprises four domains: an N-terminal monooxygenase (MO), a central calponin (CH), a LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3) domain, and a C-terminal bivalent Mical/EHBP Rab-binding (bMERB) domain. Domain boundaries are taken from isoform 1 (UniProt ID: Q8TDZ2) (Supplementary Fig. 1). To characterize the auto-inhibited and active states, we purified full-length Mical1 and various deletion constructs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Supplementary Table. 2). All constructs except the bMERB domain are tagged with a C-terminal histidine tag. Further, to determine the oligomeric states of the proteins, their native masses were determined by size exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering analysis (SEC-MALS). Results showed that all the purified constructs predominantly exist as monomers. The average molar masses were as follows: full-length Mical1, 112.2 kDa (theoretical mass: 118.94 kDa); MO-CH-LIM (residues 1-781), 86.2 kDa (theoretical mass: 86.48 kDa); MO-CH (residues 1-615), 69.4 kDa (theoretical mass: 68.23 kDa); MO (residues 1-488), 55.78 kDa (theoretical mass: 55.14 kDa); bMERB (residues 918-1067), 18.13 kDa (theoretical mass: 17.83 kDa) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b-f</xref>).</p>

<p>Several studies have indicated that, in the absence of Rab, the bMERB domain forms an intramolecular interaction with the other domains (CH/LIM/MO-CH-LIM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Full-length Mical is catalytically inactive, with its enzyme activity somehow inhibited by the C-terminal domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Fremont <italic>et al</italic>., proposed a Mical1 auto-inhibition model based on F-actin depolymerization assays and cell biology data, suggesting that the N-terminal monooxygenase and CH and LIM domains (MO-CH-LIM) interact with the bMERB domain to form an inactive complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The binding of Rab releases auto-inhibition, resulting in F-actin depolymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, the biochemistry of the auto-inhibited state is not well understood. Therefore, we aimed to confirm and quantify the intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of Mical1 by investigating the interaction between the separately purified C-terminal bMERB domain and the N-terminal MO/MO-CH/MO-CH-LIM domains via ITC. We observed binding between the MO-CH-LIM domain construct and the bMERB domain, driven by enthalpy with a K<sub>D</sub> value of 2.7 ± 0.16 µM and a 1:1 stoichiometry. However, no binding was observed between the isolated bMERB domain and the MO-CH/MO domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g-i</xref>). Our previous work also showed that the Mical1 CH-LIM construct and isolated CH and LIM domains do not interact with the bMERB domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, our data indicate that all three domains (MO-CH-LIM) are necessary for stable bMERB interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g-i</xref>). Like Mical1, other F-actin interacting proteins, such as Myosin V, Talin2, and Vinculin, also exist in an auto-inhibited state, with their activation being spatially and temporally regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Full-length bMERB domain is essential for MO-CH-LIM interaction</title>
<p>Mical1 and Mical3, among other bMERB family members, feature a high-affinity C-terminal Rab-binding site (Ct-RBS2; helices 2-3) and a lower-affinity N-terminal site (Nt-RBS1; helices 1-2). In contrast, EHBP1L1’s bMERB domain has two Rab-binding sites of similar affinities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. EHBP1, another family member, has a single Rab-binding site and forms an auto-inhibited complex where helices 1-2 of the bMERB domain constitute the CH binding site, with Rab binding at the C-terminal site (helices 2-3) releasing auto-inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. To pinpoint the exact binding site on Mical1, we generated two deletion constructs of its bMERB domain, deleting either the N-terminal or C-terminal helix, and tested their interaction with MO-CH-LIM. Our ITC data confirm that the full-length bMERB domain is necessary for a stable interaction, as the deletion constructs did not form a stable complex.

<p>To independently verify the interaction between the MO-CH-LIM and bMERB domains, we performed crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) analyses. Two experiments were conducted: first, using full-length Mical1; second, mixing the MO-CH-LIM construct and the bMERB domain in a 1:2 ratio to achieve a saturated MO-CH-LIM complex. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-f</xref>). A total of 59 peptides were identified from Mical1 full-length experiments, and 76 peptides were identified from the MO-CH-LIM:bMERB complex. Crosslink mapping revealed numerous reproducible inter-domain and intra-domain connections between the two experiments. In the Mical1 full-length experiment, 6 peptides linked MO and bMERB domains, compared to 24 peptides in the MO-CH-LIM:bMERB complex experiment, confirming the interaction between the full-length bMERB domain and MO. This aligns with our ITC data, indicating the involvement of all three bMERB helices. However, no cross-links were found between CH and bMERB or LIM and bMERB domains. Our ITC results clearly demonstrate that the MO-CH-LIM construct interacts with the bMERB domain but not with MO or MO-CH. The absence of cross-links may be due to the limited number of lysine residues in the CH and LIM domains (2 in CH, 1 in LIM), potentially indicating they are not part of the binding interface. Nevertheless, XL-MS experiments suggest that the bMERB domain interacts with the MO domain, implying the formation of an intramolecular complex.</p>

<p>The AlphaFold2 model predicts that the MO (residues 1-488), CH (residues 508-613), Helix<sup>CHL</sup> (residues 624-654), LIM (residues 692-751) domains, and linker (residues 800-855) interact with the C-terminal bMERB (residues 886-1067) domain, forming an auto-inhibited complex. Helices 1-2 of the bMERB domain interact with the MO, CH, and LIM domains, while helix 3 specifically interacts with Helix<sup>CHL</sup>, resulting in three distinct binding interfaces on the bMERB domain, predominantly through hydrophobic interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-c</xref>). The first binding interface involves the first half of helix 1 and the second half of helix 2 of the bMERB domain, where the MO domain interacts (1190 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> buried surface). The MO domain consists of two core domains: a large domain (MO<sup>Large_domain</sup>, residues 1–226 and 374– 484) and a smaller cap domain (MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup>, residues 235–366). Both domains are connected by β-strands β9 (residues 228–234) and β15 (residues 367–373). The active site is a cleft formed by both the MO<sup>Large_domain</sup> and the MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup>, containing a FAD molecule. Both the MO<sup>Large_domain</sup> and the MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup> interact with the bMERB domain. The MO<sup>Large_domain</sup> interacts with helix 1, whereas the MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup> interacts with both helices 1 and 2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref>). The binding site is opposite to the active site (FAD binding cleft). The second binding interface involves the center of the bMERB domain, where all three helices interact with the MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup>, LIM domain, and Helix<sup>CHL</sup>. The third binding interface centers on helices 1-2 of the bMERB domain, facilitating interactions between the CH (507 Å²) and LIM (652 Å²) domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). While helix 3 of the bMERB domain does not directly interact with the MO, CH, and LIM domains, our ITC data indicate its necessity for complex formation. This necessity is likely due to stabilizing interactions between helices 2 and 3 and the Helix<sup>CHL</sup>, suggesting that this interaction stabilizes the second binding interface where the MO and LIM domains interact with helices 1 and 2 of the bMERB domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
<p>Apart from the active site cleft, a smaller cleft is formed between the MO<sup>Large_domain</sup> and MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup>, occupied by helix 1 of the bMERB domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). This cleft includes loops connecting β9-β10, β17-α15, and β15 of the MO<sup>Large_domain</sup>, and β11 and the loop connecting α10-11 of the MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup>. Helix 1 residue K918 forms hydrogen bonds with D153 and E257 of the MO domain, while E921 interacts with S259 of the MO domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, inset1). The side chain of F925 of the bMERB domain inserts itself into a hydrophobic patch formed by P401, L402, and V285 residues of the MO domain. Similarly, I264 of the MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup> inserts into the hydrophobic patch involving helix 1 (I931) and helix 2 (V995 and L998), while Y265 of the MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup> interacts hydrophobically with F925 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, inset1). Additionally, K235 in the β9-β10 loop forms a hydrogen bond with E939 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, inset4)</p>
<p>The CH and LIM domain binding sites on the bMERB domain span the C-terminal half of helix 1 and the N-terminal half of helix 2, characterized by a hydrophobic array. L598<sup>CH</sup> interacts hydrophobically with L956, V971, and L974 of the bMERB domain, whereas I601<sup>CH</sup> similarly engages with L975 and V978. Further, the CH:bMERB interaction is reinforced by hydrogen bonds between residues D596<sup>CH</sup>-R957 and E512<sup>CH</sup>-K988 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, inset2). V632 and F634 of Helix<sup>CHL</sup> interact hydrophobically with V985, I993, L1047, and F1050 of the bMERB domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, inset5). The LIM domain also engages extensively with the bMERB domain through hydrophobic interactions: Y705<sup>LIM</sup> with V950 and L954, L707<sup>LIM</sup> in the groove formed by L974, L977, and V978, and W732<sup>LIM</sup> with L935 and M992. Additionally, hydrogen bonds are observed between R719<sup>LIM</sup>-E988 and T730<sup>LIM</sup>-E939 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, inset3-4).</p>
<p>Next, we compared the auto-inhibited Mical1 model with previously published crystal structures of Mical1 individual domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. The predicted MO domain closely resembles the isolated mouse Mical1 MO domain in both oxidized (PDB: 2BRY) and reduced states (PDB: 2C4C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, with RMSD values of 0.299 Å for 396 Cα residues and 0.581 Å for 422 Cα residues, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3a-b). Although the AlphaFold model lacks FAD, its active site residues are similar to the oxidized state of the mouse Mical1 MO domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Even in the auto-inhibited state, the active site is accessible for catalysis. Previous studies have shown that in the reduced state of the MO domain, the FAD isoalloxazine ring flips during the catalytic cycle, leading to conformational changes in active site residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. FAD’s isoalloxazine ring flips during the catalytic cycle in the reduced MO domain, causing changes in active site residues such as F399, W400, and P401 upon NADPH binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). F399, in particular, undergoes significant changes upon NADPH binding. In the auto-inhibited AlphaFold2 model, bMERB domain binding sterically hinders this rotation, stabilizing the oxidized MO domain and preventing the FAD transition to the reduced state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-e</xref>). In the auto-inhibited state, the side chains of I264 and Y265 in the MO<sup>Cap_domain</sup> are inserted into a hydrophobic patch formed by helices 1 and 2 of the bMERB domain. In the isolated oxidized/reduced mouse MO domain structure, Y265 and I264 lacked electron density, indicating that bMERB binding likely stabilizes the loop conformation of the MO domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d-e</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, structural analysis of isolated human CH (PDB: 2DK9) and bMERB domain (PDB: 5LE0) revealed differences from the AlphaFold2 predictions, with RMSD values of 1.089 Å for 92 Cα residues in the CH domain and 0.967 Å for 94 Cα residues in the bMERB domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Notably, the maximum structural difference was observed for the isolated human LIM domain (PDB: 2CO8), with an rmsd of 2.135 Å for 65 Cα residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. 3c-f). We hypothesize that the bMERB domain first interacts with the CH domain, establishing the binding interface for the LIM domain. As the LIM domain binds, it brings all three domains together, stabilizing the MO binding interface and forming a compact structure. Finally, the MO domain interacts with both the bMERB and LIM domains, facilitating the formation of a tightly packed auto-inhibited complex.</p>

<title>Generation of bMERB interface mutants</title>
<p>To corroborate the Mical1 auto-inhibited AlphaFold2 model, we conducted biochemical experiments. Sequence alignment of bMERB domains reveals that surface residues interacting with MO-CH-LIM are highly conserved across mammalian homologs (Supplementary Fig. 4). To assess the significance of individual interface residues, we introduced mutations into each helix of the bMERB domain based on the AlphaFold2 Mical1 auto-inhibited model and analyzed their interaction with MO-CH-LIM using ITC experiments. (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). All bMERB mutants with alanine substitutions at conserved residues, except K918A_E921A, show a significant decrease in binding affinity. The K918A and E921A double mutations in helix 1 reduce affinity for MO-CH-LIM by only 2-fold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). K918 forms hydrogen bonds with D153 and E257 of the MO domain, while E921 bonds with S259. In contrast, mutation of F925 abrogates the MO-CH-LIM interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), as its side chain inserts into the hydrophobic pocket formed by A262, Y265, and V285 of the MO domain. The E939A mutant shows more than a 5-fold reduction in binding affinity with MO-CH-LIM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). The side chain of E939 forms hydrogen bonds with K235 of the MO domain and T730 in the LIM domain.</p>

<p>Double alanine mutations in helix 2 (L974A_L975A and L977A_V978A) lead to a 6-fold reduction in binding affinity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f, g</xref>). Residues L956, V971, L974, L975, L977, and V978 of the bMERB domain form a hydrophobic patch that accommodates the CH and LIM domains. The side chain of L598 in the CH domain fits into the hydrophobic pocket formed by L956, V971, and L974, while I601 interacts with V971 and L975. Additionally, L707 of the LIM domain forms a hydrophobic interaction with L974, L977, and V978 of the bMERB domain. The M992A_I993A double alanine mutant in helix 2 causes a more than 25-fold reduction in binding affinity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>). M992 interacts with LIM domain residue W732, and I993 interacts with F634 of Helix<sup>CHL</sup> (residues 624-654).</p>
<p>Furthermore, mutating residues L1047 and F1050 of helix 3 to alanine eliminates detectable binding with MO-CH-LIM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Notably, L1047 and F1050 interact with Helix<sup>CHL</sup> (residues 624-654), not with MO, CH, or LIM domains. The side chain of F634 of Helix<sup>CHL</sup> inserts into a hydrophobic patch formed by I993 (helix 1), L1047, and F1050 (helix 2) of the bMERB domain, while V632 of Helix<sup>CHL</sup> interacts with V985 of bMERB. The L1047 and F1050 mutations destabilize this hydrophobic patch.</p>

<title>Allostery between the two Rab binding site</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that the Mical1 bMERB domain binds Rab8 in a 1:2 stoichiometry, with helices 1-2 forming the low-affinity N-terminal binding site (Nt-RBS1) and helices 2-3 forming the high-affinity C-terminal binding site (Ct-RBS2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Deleting either the N- or C-terminal helix resulted in binding Rab molecules at a 1:1 stoichiometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We investigated whether two Rab molecules bind to the bMERB domain of full-length Mical1 and as expected full-length Mical1 binds Rab8 with a 1:2 stoichiometry, similar to the isolated bMERB domain, but with slightly lower affinity (K<sub>D1</sub>: 40 vs. 10 nM and K<sub>D2</sub>: 0.73 vs. 1.12 µM) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-b</xref>). Next, we examined whether the binding of a Rab molecule at either the N- or C-terminal site affects the binding of a second Rab molecule at the other site, or if the two sites operate independently. Since full-length Mical1 exhibits a similar range of Rab8 binding affinities as the isolated bMERB domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b, h</xref>), we generated and purified isolated bMERB domain mutants based on the bMERB:Rab10 complex (PDB: 5LPN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> structure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). We assessed their interaction with Rab8 by varying the bMERB:Rab ratio (1:1.1 and 1:2.2) using analytical size exclusion chromatography. These experiments aimed to identify constructs that either show no or defective complex formation or fail to display an increase in complex formation upon increasing the Rab concentration. Furthermore, the stoichiometry of the complex was determined using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with selective constructs.</p>

<p>First, we generated mutants targeting Nt-RBS1. Mutants K918A_E921A, F925A, W970A, and L974A_L975A showed no binding defects (Supplementary Fig. 5a-d, h). However, E939A and L956S exhibited only a slight increase in complex formation at higher bMERB ratios (1:1.1 to 1:2.2), indicating a lower affinity for the second N-terminal Rab binding (Supplementary Fig. 5e, f). Mutants L977A_V978A, V978A_V985A, V978A, V985A, M992A_I993A, and L1047A_F1050A showed no significant change in complex formation with increased Rab concentration, suggesting either 1:1 binding or defective binding at both sites (Supplementary Fig. 5i-n).</p>
<p>We next generated mutants targeting Ct-RBS2. Mutants L1011S and V1038A showed no apparent defects (Supplementary Fig. 6a-d). However, mutants V1041A, R1044A, and I1048A formed smaller complexes on aSEC and showed no significant change in complex formation with varying Rab concentrations, suggesting binding defects (Supplementary Fig. 6e-g). Notably, the double mutant V1041A_I1048A showed minimal complex formation, indicating that these mutations affect binding at both Rab sites (Supplementary Fig. 6h).</p>
<p>Distinct heat exchange patterns for Rab binding at the N-terminal and C-terminal sites of Mical1 were previously observed, with C-terminal binding being enthalpy-driven and N-terminal binding entropy-driven<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. To precisely determine the impact of specific mutations on Rab binding, we conducted ITC experiments with mutants: bMERB<sub>V978A_V985A</sub>, bMERB<sub>V1041A_I1048A</sub>, bMERB<sub>M992A_I993A</sub>, and bMERB<sub>L1047A_F1050A</sub>. The ITC data unequivocally demonstrate that bMERB<sub>V978A_V985A</sub> binds to Rab8 with a 1:1 stoichiometry, an enthalpy-driven reaction, and affinity similar to Ct-RBS2. In contrast, bMERB<sub>V1041A_I1048A</sub> exhibited low heat exchange and cannot be reliably fitted, indicating that C-terminal binding is necessary for Rab binding at the N-terminal site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h-l</xref>). Residues V978/V985 and V1041/I1048 are functionally equivalent, interacting with specific Rab10 residues (I44, W63, F46 for V978/V1041; L9, F46A, I48 for V985/I1048) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, Insets 1-2). V978 and V985 are crucial for N-terminal Rab binding, as single mutants V978A and V985A show similar binding as of the double mutant V978A_V985A. Conversely, the double mutant V1041A_I1048A exhibits a pronounced effect on Rab10 binding compared to individual mutants V1041A and I1048A, indicating that perturbations in the N-terminal binding site still allow Rab8 to bind to the C-terminal site, whereas perturbations at Ct-RBS2 also affect binding at Nt-RBS1. This suggests a sequential binding mechanism for Rabs. To further support our observation, we performed SEC experiments with V978A_V985A and V1041A_I1048A bMERB mutants with other Rab8 family members (Rab10, Rab13, and Rab15). Similar observations were made; however, compared to Rab8, Rab10 showed a lesser increase in complex formation upon increasing the bMERB:Rab ratio, suggesting a slightly lower affinity for the N-terminal Rab binding (Supplementary Fig. 7).</p>
<p>The other Nt-RBS1 mutant, bMERB<sub>M992A_I993A</sub>, exhibited a similar high affinity for C-terminal Rab8 binding, while a more than 30-fold decrease in N-terminal Rab binding was observed. The residue M992 forms hydrophobic interactions with Y6 of Rab10 (Nt-RBS1) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5o</xref>, Inset3). An intriguing observation arose with the mutant bMERB<sub>L1047A_F1050A</sub>, which demonstrated reduced binding affinity for both Rab binding sites. This mutant showed over a 20-fold decrease in C-terminal Rab8 binding and a 10-fold reduction in N-terminal Rab binding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5p</xref>). Residues L1047 and F1050 contribute to hydrophobic interactions with L8 of Rab10 (Nt-RBS1) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, Inset3). However, L1047 and F1050 do not participate in binding with Rab10 at Ct-RBS2; the decrease in binding affinity might be due to a change in local hydrophobicity, as these residues lie on the opposite side of the crucial I1048. Previously, we reported that the N-terminus of the Rab8 family member provides specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. L8<sup>Rab<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> is implicated in the RabSF1 interaction with L1047 and F1050, thereby further stabilizing the interaction. These findings suggest that the conformation of helix 3 of the bMERB domain plays a crucial role in Rab binding at both the N-terminal and C-terminal Rab binding sites within the full-length bMERB domain background. This contrasts with earlier findings showing that Rab8 bound to N- and C-terminal helix-deleted constructs in a 1:1 ratio, suggesting site independence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We propose that the absence of helix 3 may cause helices 1-2 to adopt a different conformation, accommodating the Rab molecule. Overall, our data suggest allosteric communication between the N-terminal and C-terminal Rab binding sites, with the first Rab molecule binding at Ct-RBS2, followed by the second Rab molecule binding at Nt-RBS1.</p>

However, the second half of helix 2 of the mutant bMERB domain adopts a different conformation. The N-terminal Rab binding site is formed by a kink in the second half of helix 2 and the movement of the first half of helix 1 towards Rab. In the bMERB<sub>V978A_V985A</sub>:Rab10 structure, the second helix’s conformation is similar to the unbound bMERB domain conformation (PDB: 5LEO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b-c</xref>).

<p>Recently, Macgarry <italic>et al</italic>., proposed an alternate mode of Mical1 activation by Rho GTPases and showed that upon extracellular ligand stimulation, Cdc42 interacts with its effector PAK1 and active Cdc42:PAK1 then binds to the MO domain of Mical1, PAK1, a serine/threonine kinase, phosphorylates S817 and S960 of the Mical1 bMERB domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The authors proposed that this phosphorylation enhances Rab10 binding, which activates Mical1 and increases F-actin disassembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. We analyzed AlphaFold2 model and found that S817 lies in the linker region, while S960 is part of the bMERB domain. Despite the low pLDDT score for this linker region, the position of S817 is highly reproducible across models, and the side chain is pointing towards a negatively charged patch. Phosphorylation might induce charge repulsion, potentially ’loosening’ the auto-inhibited complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a-b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 9). However, further biochemical and structural validation is needed.</p>

<p>Previously, we showed that the bMERB domain interacts with Rab8, Rab10, Rab13, and Rab15, but lacked quantitative binding data. We have now quantified these interactions. Similar to Rab8, ITC data reveal that Rab10 and Rab15 bind to the bMERB domain in a 1:2 stoichiometry, with one high-affinity site (Ct-RBS2: 11 nM for Rab10, 2.5 nM for Rab15; enthalpy-driven) and one low-affinity site (Nt-RBS1: 3.73 µM for Rab10, 2.91 µM for Rab15; entropy-driven). We purified the bMERB<sub>S960D</sub> mutant and assessed its interaction with Rab8, Rab10, and Rab15 using aSEC/ITC. The phosphomimetic mutation at S960 did not affect Rab binding, consistent with our structural observations that S960, located in helix 1 of the Nt-RBS1 site, does not interact with Rab10 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c-o</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on our findings, we propose that phosphorylation of both S817 and S960 may facilitate the release of auto-inhibition in Mical1, exposing the bMERB domain for Rab binding without affecting Rab affinity. Further biochemical studies are needed to fully elucidate the activation mechanism of Mical1 by the RhoGTPase-PAK1 pathway.</p>

<title>Impact of Rab binding site mutations in the bMERB domain on MO-CH-LIM interaction</title>
<p>In the absence of Rab, the Nt-RBS1 of bMERB accommodates the CH and LIM domain, so we investigated the effect of several RBS mutants of the bMERB domain on MO-CH-LIM interaction (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). The L956S mutant displayed more than a 9-fold reduction in binding affinity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>). L956 forms a hydrophobic interaction with L598 of the CH domain; however, it is also part of a continuous array of hydrophobic residues. Therefore, we propose that this mutation may lead to the destabilization of the hydrophobic patch. In contrast, the phosphomimetic mutant S960D did not affect MO-CH-LIM binding, as this residue is not part of the predicted binding interface (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>). Another putatively non-interacting residue, the W970A mutant, exhibited a 4-fold decrease in binding affinity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8e</xref>). Although W970<sup>bMERB</sup> is not directly involved in the interaction, it may contribute to stabilizing the hydrophobic patch of the bMERB domain, which is crucial for MO-CH-LIM interaction.</p>

<p>The double alanine mutations V978A_V985A completely abolished the MO-CH-LIM interaction (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8f</xref>). Interestingly, single mutations V978A and V985A caused a 2-fold and 10-fold reduction in binding affinity, respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8g-h</xref>). V978 interacts with A602 of the CH domain and L707 of the LIM domain, while V985 interacts with V632 of the Helix<sup>CHL</sup>. This indicates that the hydrophobic nature of these residues is crucial for stabilizing CH and LIM interactions with the bMERB domain. In contrast, double alanine mutations of non-interface residues, V1041A_I1048A, showed slightly better affinity than the wild type (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8i</xref>).</p>

<title>Structural basis of Mical1 activation</title>
<p>To unravel the structural basis for the release of the MO, CH, and LIM domains from the bMERB domain upon Rab binding, we superimposed the Mical1 auto-inhibited AlphaFold2 model with the bMERB:Rab10 complex (PDB: 5LPN) structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Superimposition reveals that in the auto-inhibited Mical1 model, the Nt-RBS1 site is blocked by the CH and LIM domains, along with Helix<sup>CHL</sup>. Upon Rab binding, the bMERB domain helices undergo significant conformational changes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a-c</xref>). Helix 3 adopts a new conformation that interferes with the CH domain and Helix<sup>CHL</sup>. Meanwhile, binding of the second Rab molecule shifts helices 1-2 towards the Rab, further disrupting the interaction with the CH domain.</p>

<p>The AlphaFold2 auto-inhibited model suggests that while the active site is accessible, helix 1 of the bMERB domain restricts the catalytic loop (amino acids 395-405) movement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). Conformational changes in W400 stabilize FAD binding via π-π stacking and may facilitate hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Several studies suggest that during oxidation, methionine residues approach W400, making them accessible to hydrogen peroxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The AlphaFold2 model indicates that enzyme activity is likely inhibited by the bMERB domain, which restricts the movement of the catalytic loop (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). In the Mical1 auto-inhibited model, F399’s movement is restricted, and the MO domain conformation resembles that of the isolated MO domain in the oxidized state (PDB: 2BRY) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we propose a model for Mical1 activation (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). Comparing the Mical1 auto-inhibited state with the bMERB complex reveals that Nt-RBS1 is blocked by the CH, Helix<sup>CHL</sup>, and LIM domains. However, helix 3 of the bMERB domain is accessible, allowing the first Rab8 molecule to bind at the C-terminal high-affinity Rab binding site, defining the helix 3 conformation. This binding displaces the CH domain and Helix<sup>CHL</sup>, loosening the structure and exposing Nt-RBS1. A second Rab molecule then binds at the low-affinity RBS, preventing the reassembly of the bMERB:CH domain. The binding induces significant conformational changes in helices 1 and 2, disrupting their interaction with the MO domain. Key residues E939, F925, and N999 in helices 1 and 2 shift side chain orientations, leading to MO domain dissociation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9d</xref>), supported by ITC data. These movements also further dissociate the LIM domain. Consequently, the binding of the second Rab molecule relieves auto-inhibition, allowing access to the MO, CH, and LIM domains. The active MO domain then induces F-actin depolymerization.</p>

<caption><title>The activation mechanism of Mical1 by Rab8 family members.</title>
<p>In the absence of active Rab8, Mical1 exists in an auto-inhibited state, where the MO, CH, Helix<sup>CHL</sup>, and LIM domains interact with its bMERB domain. Rab8 is recruited to the membrane by its GEF molecule (e.g., Rabin 8 or GRAB). The first molecule of active Rab8 binds to the high-affinity C-terminal binding site, leading to a change in the conformation of helix 3, which displaces the CH domain and Helix<sup>CHL</sup>. The first binding of the Rab molecule also changes the conformation of helix 2 and helix 3 at the low-affinity N-terminal Rab binding site, further interfering with CH binding, and this conformation leads to a change in the LIM and MO binding interface on the bMERB domain, resulting in the displacement of the LIM and MO domains. The second Rab8 molecule binds to stabilize the active state of the enzyme, allowing the MO domain to be available for F-actin interaction, leading to the depolymerization of F-actin.</p></caption>

<p>Mical1 regulates actin dynamics by selectively oxidizing Met44 and Met47 of F-actin in an NADPH-dependent manner, causing depolymerization and severing of F-actin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. We have previously shown that Mical1’s CH, LIM, or CH-LIM domain fails to interact with F-actin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The Mical1 CH domain is structurally similar to CH type-2 domains, which cannot directly bind to F-actin, unlike CH type-1 domains. We tested full-length Mical1, MO-CH-LIM, MO-CH, and MO constructs for F-actin interaction using actin co-sedimentation assays. The results showed that MO-CH-LIM, MO-CH, and MO constructs interact with F-actin, indicating the MO domain is essential and sufficient for this interaction. Full-length Mical1 showed less interaction, suggesting that Rab binding is needed to overcome auto-inhibition for F-actin binding (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9e</xref>).</p>
<p>Previously, we suggested that the binding of two Rab molecules to Mical1 could increase the local concentration of specific Rab molecules, creating Rab microdomains and controlling Mical1 activity. Based on our data, we now propose that the initial binding of the first Rab molecule to a high-affinity site recruits Mical1 to specific membranes and alleviates its auto-inhibited state. This facilitates the subsequent binding of the second Rab molecule at the low-affinity Nt-RBS1 site, further stabilizing Mical1’s active state by preventing the rebinding of the MO, CH, and LIM domains. This process regulates the duration of enzyme activity and thus F-actin dynamics (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). For Mical-like proteins, a concerted Rab recruitment cascade has been reported. For instance, Mical-L1 connects Rab35 and Rab8. Another study demonstrated that Mical-L1 is recruited to recycling endosomes by Rab35, which subsequently recruits other Rab proteins such as Rab8, Rab13, and Rab36<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Similarly, in Mical1-L2-dependent GLUT4 translocation, trafficking relies on the concerted action of Rab8 and Rab13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. The authors suggested that bMERB domain dimerization allows for concerted recruitment; however, in the case of Mical1, a single bMERB domain can recruit Rab proteins in a concerted manner.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study has provided biochemical and structural insights into both the auto-inhibited and active states of Mical1. Our data offer a detailed overview of the MO-CH-LIM:bMERB interaction, with mutagenesis experiments highlighting the crucial residues involved. Additionally, we have elucidated the activation mechanism of Mical1, presenting evidence of allosteric regulation between the two Rab binding sites and identifying the key residues required for Rab recruitment.</p>

Program MeroX version 2.0.1.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> was used for cross-link identification. MS data in MGF format and protein sequences in FASTA format were loaded on the program and the cross-linked residues were searched. In the settings, the precursor precision and the fragment ion precision were set to 10.0 and 20.0 ppm, respectively. MS1 data were re-calibrated by 5 ppm according to the average mass deviation of the raw MS data. The FDR was set to 50, i.e. no filtering according to FDR with MeroX was done. RISEUP mode was used, and the maximum missing ions was set to 1. Crosslinks data were exported to XiViewer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Crystallization and structure determination</title>
<p>Initial crystallization condition screens for the protein complexes described in the paper were performed using the JSG CORE I-IV, Pact, and Protein Complex suites (Qiagen). The sitting-drop vapor diffusion method was employed, with a reservoir volume of 70 μL and a drop volume of 0.1 μL for the protein (300 µM complexes, 1:1 Rab:effector) and 0.1 μL for the reservoir solution at 20°C. The best conditions were then optimized using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method, with varying drop sizes, to obtain well-diffracting crystals. The complex of bMERB<sub>V978A_V985A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> (300 µM of 1:1 complex) was crystallized in 0.17 M Sodium acetate, 0.085 M Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 25.5% (w/v) PEG 4000 and 15% (v/v) glycerol. The complex bMERB<sub>V978A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> (300 µM of 1:1 complex) was crystallized in 0.1 M Imidazole pH 8.0, 5% (w/v) PEG 3000 and 30% (v/v) PEG 200. Crystals were fished directly from the crystallization drop and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data of bMERB<sub>V978A_V985A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> was collected at 100 K on beamline X10SA at the Swiss Light Source (Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland). For the bMERB<sub>V978A_V985A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> complex crystal, a native data set was collected at a wavelength of 0.999968 Å. Whereas diffraction data of bMERB<sub>V978A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> was collected at 100 K on beamline ID23-2 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). For the bMERB<sub>V978A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> complex crystal, a native data set was collected at a wavelength of 0.873130 Å. Data were integrated and scaled with XDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The crystal of the bMERB<sub>V978A_V985A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> complex diffracted to a resolution of 1.8 Å (space group P2<sub>1</sub> with a = 53.673 Å, b = 48.807 Å, c = 79.199 Å), and a single copy of the complex is present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The initial model for the bMERB<sub>V978A_V985A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> complex was obtained by molecular replacement using PHASER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> with the crystal structure of the Mical1<sub>bMERB</sub>:Rab 10 (PDB: 5LPN) as a search model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The partial model was completed by manual building in Coot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. For the bMERB<sub>V978A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> complex, the crystal diffracted to a resolution of 2.05 Å (space group P2<sub>1</sub> with a = 53.517 Å, b = 49.434 Å, c = 79.095 Å), and one copy of the complex constitutes the asymmetric unit of the crystal. The partial model was obtained by molecular replacement using PHASER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and the bMERB<sub>V978A_V985A</sub>:Rab10<sub>1-175</sub> was used as a search model. The initial model was completed by manual building in Coot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. The final models were refined to convergence with phenix.refine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study addresses the regulation of the MICAL-family of actin regulators by Rab GTPases, which play a key role in directing membrane trafficking within cells. The <bold>compelling</bold> evidence explains how Rab8 family members bind at two sites to allosterically regulate MICAL1, and relieve an auto-inhibited state unable to bind actin. This study lays the basis for further progress in understanding membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton dynamics in eukaryotic cells.</p>

<p>The manuscript describes comprehensive structure-function studies combining structural studies, Alphafold2-based modelling, and extensive structural validation by mutagenesis and biochemical experiments. Consequently, a sophisticated activation mechanism of Mical1 as a representative of the MICAL family is elucidated at the molecular level. Since MICAL proteins are important regulators of membrane trafficking and cytoskeleton dynamics, the study is of high relevance for many groups. Structural data are of high quality, the modelling data appear to be sound, and the subsequent biochemical analyses are carried out in great detail, yielding a complete story. I have little to criticize on this beautiful work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rai and coworkers have studied the regulation of the MICAL-family of actin regulators by Rab 8 family GTPases. Their work uses a combination of structural biology, biochemistry, and modelling approaches to identify the regions and specific residues interacting with Rabs and understand the consequences of MICAL1 regulation. The study extends previous work on individual domains by incorporating analysis of the full-length MICAL1 protein and provides compelling evidence for allosteric regulation by Rab binding to two low and high-affinity regulatory sites.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Excellent biochemical and structural analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional data to test the model for Rab regulation of MICAL1 in the actin-pelleting assay would enhance the study.</p>
