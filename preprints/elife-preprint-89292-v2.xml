<title>Abstract</title>
<p>A small, nucleotide-binding domain, the ATP-cone, is found at the N-terminus of most ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalytic subunits. By binding ATP or dATP it regulates the enzyme activity of all classes of RNR. Functional and structural work on aerobic RNRs has revealed a plethora of ways in which dATP inhibits activity by inducing oligomerization and preventing a productive radical transfer from one subunit to the active site in the other. Anaerobic RNRs, on the other hand, store a stable glycyl radical next to the active site and the basis for their dATP-dependent inhibition is completely unknown. We present biochemical, biophysical and structural information on the effects of ATP and dATP binding to the anaerobic RNR from <italic>Prevotella copri</italic>. The enzyme exists in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium biased towards dimers when two ATP molecules are bound to the ATP-cone and tetramers when two dATP molecules are bound. In the presence of ATP, <italic>P. copri</italic> NrdD is active and has a fully ordered glycyl radical domain (GRD) in one monomer of the dimer. Binding of dATP to the ATP-cone results in loss of activity and increased dynamics of the GRD, such that it can not be detected in the cryo-EM structures. The glycyl radical is formed even in the dATP-bound form, but the substrate does not bind. The structures implicate a complex network of interactions in activity regulation that involve the GRD more than 30 Å away from the dATP molecules, the allosteric substrate specificity site and a conserved but previously unseen flap over the active site. Taken together, the results suggest dATP inhibition in anaerobic RNRs acts by increasing the flexibility of the flap and GRD, thereby preventing both substrate binding and radical mobilisation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are a family of enzymes with sophisticated radical chemistries and allosteric regulation. RNRs produce all four deoxyribonucleotides and are the only enzymes providing de novo building blocks for DNA replication and repair in all free-living organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mathews, 2016</xref>). Virtually all RNRs possess an allosteric site regulating substrate specificity (the s-site), a crucial aspect of RNR that ultimately provides a balanced supply of dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mathews, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2018</xref>). A second allosteric site (the a-site) is located in an N-terminal domain called the ATP-cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aravind <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>), found in the majority of RNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jonna <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Whereas the s-site binds all deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and usually ATP, the a-site in the ATP-cone can only bind ATP and dATP. Binding of ATP activates RNR, and binding of dATP inhibits it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hofer <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Martínez-Carranza <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The RNR family consists of three evolutionarily related classes (I to III) with a common radical-based reaction mechanism but differing in the mode of radical generation and in quaternary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Högbom <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lundin <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Class I, strictly aerobic RNRs are heterotetramers consisting of two α subunits (NrdA) with binding sites for substrates and allosteric nucleotides and two β subunits (NrdB), that harbour a radical initiator in the form of a stable radical or an oxidized metal cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Högbom et al, 2020</xref>). Class II RNRs are either dimers or monomers with an α subunit (NrdJ) that, in addition to binding sites for substrate and allosteric nucleotides, also harbours the radical initiator cofactor adenosylcobalamin. Class III RNRs, which only function anaerobically, are dimers of an α subunit (NrdD) with a stable radical close to the active site, and binding sites for allosteric nucleotides. The radical is introduced via encounter with a specific radical-SAM enzyme called NrdG, and once activated NrdD can perform multiple turnovers in the absence of NrdG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Backman <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Torrents <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The dATP-dependent inhibition has been biochemically characterised in representatives of all three RNR classes, but only structurally studied in class I. A common denominator of all inhibited class I RNRs is oligomerization, leading to disturbed radical transfer between the α and β subunits. Hitherto four different inhibitory oligomerization mechanisms have been identified: heterooctameric α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> complexes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic> and <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ando <italic>et al,</italic> 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Martínez-Carranza <italic>et al,</italic> 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wei <italic>et al,</italic> 2014</xref>), an α<sub>4</sub> complex in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansson <italic>et al,</italic> 2016</xref>), α<sub>6</sub> complexes in the eukaryotes <italic>Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ando <italic>et al,</italic> 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brignole <italic>et al,</italic> 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Crona <italic>et al,</italic> 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fairman <italic>et al,</italic> 2011</xref>), and a β<sub>4</sub> complex in the bacterium <italic>Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rozman Grinberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2018a</xref>). All these class I oligomers involve protein-protein interactions mediated by the ATP-cone domain.</p>
<p>The ATP-cone is in essence restricted to RNRs and the RNR-specific repressor NrdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rozman Grinberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Among RNRs it is found in about 80% of class III enzymes and about 50% of class I enzymes, but less than 10% of class II enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jonna <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). The presence and function of the ATP-cone domain distinguish anaerobic RNRs from the other members of the large glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) family that are otherwise structurally related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Backman <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>). The allosteric regulation mechanisms of class III RNRs (NrdDs) from <italic>E. coli</italic>, bacteriophage T4 and <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> were determined several decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andersson <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eliasson <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Torrents <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). T4NrdD was the first class III RNR structure solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Logan <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>), and later, structures of <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> NrdD (TmNrdD) have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aurelius <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>). However, these two NrdDs lack an ATP-cone and the structural basis for allosteric activity regulation in the class III RNRs is still an outstanding question. Here, we present structural, biochemical and biophysical studies on the ATP-cone-containing NrdD from the human pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nii &amp; al., 2023</xref>) <italic>Prevotella copri</italic> (PcNrdD), showing that the binding of dATP causes increased flexibilityof the C-terminal glycyl radical-bearing domain, as well as a flap-like loop that binds across the top of the active site in the active form. This increase in dynamics is coupled to enzymatic inactivation by inhibition of substrate binding and radical transfer. The final outcome of dATP inhibition is thus blocked radical transfer in both class I and class III RNRs, but it is achieved by completely different mechanisms, i.e. oligomerization prevents radical transfer between subunits in class I RNRs but long-range modulation of the flexibility of key structural elements prevents substrate binding in class III RNRs.</p>

<title>Allosteric activity regulation by ATP and dATP</title>
<p>The amino acid sequence of PcNrdD suggests that it belongs to the formate-requiring class III RNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Burnim <italic>et al</italic>, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wei <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), and initial optimization of the assay composition showed that this was the case (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - figure supplement 1</xref>). ATP-cone mediated activation of PcNrdD enzyme activity by ATP or inhibition by dATP was tested with two different substrates. With GTP as substrate the s-site was filled with dTTP as effector, and in absence of any a-site effector the basal level of GTP reduction was 21±2 nmol/min/mg. An increasing concentration of ATP stimulated activity to a kcat of 1.3 s-1 (478±26 nmol/min/mg), with a K<sub>L</sub> of 0.67±0.12 mM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). On the other hand, an increasing concentration of dATP resulted in an abrupt inhibition of enzyme activity with a K<sub>i</sub> of 74±24 µM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Hence, the K<sub>i</sub> value for dATP inhibition via the ATP-cone is approximately 10-fold lower compared to the K<sub>L</sub> value for ATP activation via the ATP-cone.</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><title>Activity assays of Prevotella copri NrdD in the presence of ATP or dATP.</title><p>A 2.5-fold excess of holoNrdG over apoNrdD was used to study the allosteric regulation effect of ATP and dATP on the a-site. GTP reduction was monitored with 1 mM dTTP as effector in the s-site and titrated with ATP (a) or dATP (b) in the a-site. CTP reduction assays were titrated with ATP (c) or dATP (d), in this case acting both as s-site effectors and a-site regulators. Experiments were performed in triplicate for (a), (c), and (d) and with four replicates for (b). Insets in panels (b) and (d) show the results plotted in log scale. Curve fits for calculation of KL and Ki used equations (1) and (2), respectively, given in Materials and Methods, and in (d) equation (3). Curve fits for (c) and (d) used a start activity of 50 nmol/min/mg, and in (c) only results for 0-3 mM ATP were used. The R values for curve fits in panels (a) - (d) were 0.99, 0.95, 0.83, and 0.96, respectively.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The activation/inhibition experiments were also carried out with CTP as substrate. Specificity effectors for CTP reduction are ATP or dATP, so in these experiments both the s- and a-sites were conceivably filled with ATP or dATP, respectively. It is obvious from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref> that increasing concentrations of ATP initially stimulate activity and that high levels of ATP cause inhibition, plausibly by ATP also acting as substrate. We therefore used only results up to 3 mM ATP to calculate an approximate kcat of 1.1 s-1 (385±116 nmol/min/mg) with an apparent K<sub>L</sub> of 0.67±0.52 mM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Addition of dATP initially results in a stimulation of enzyme activity, conceivably when the s-site is filled with dATP, after which competing inhibition appears when dATP also binds to the ATP-cone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). All in all, these results suggest that the ATP-cone in PcNrdD responds similarly to inhibition by dATP as has been observed before for several class I RNRs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Binding of nucleotides to the ATP-cone</title>
<p>To confirm binding of ATP or dATP to the ATP-cone we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Substrate GTP and s-site effector dTTP were used to fill up the other nucleotide binding sites in PcNrdD. Binding of dATP occurred with a K<sub>D</sub> of 6 µM, whereas binding of ATP was 4-fold weaker with a K<sub>D</sub> of 26 µM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-c</xref>). The number of bound dATP molecules observed with ITC was almost 2-fold higher for dATP compared to ATP, but both values were below 1. Nucleotide binding measured with MST confirmed our results for ATP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) that had a KD of 25 µM, and dATP that with this method had a KD of 23 µM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). However, in cryo-EM experiments, where higher nucleotide concentrations can be used, we show that the ATP-cone can bind two ATP or two dATP molecules (see below), as also expected based on its sequence. The KL and Ki values reported above for ATP-activation and dATP-inhibition of GTP reduction conceivably reflect the requirement for two bound nucleotide molecules to achieve these effects, whereas the K<sub>D</sub> measurements via ITC and MST are restricted by the component concentrations that can be used and plausibly only reflect the first nucleotide bound.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the K<sub>D</sub> values for ATP and dATP do not differ by orders of magnitude, as has been found for several class I RNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ando <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Birgander <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Ormö &amp; Sjöberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rozman Grinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rozman Grinberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Torrents <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Collectively these two binding methods instead suggested that ATP and dATP may interact at two distinct sites in the ATP-cone for the functional readout of dATP inhibition, as has earlier been observed in the transcriptional repressor NrdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rozman Grinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). To test this hypothesis, apo-PcNrdD was incubated with ATP only, dATP only or a combination of ATP and dATP, then desalted, boiled, centrifuged and the nucleotide content of the supernatant analysed by HPLC. <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1</xref> shows that only dATP was bound when PcNrdD was incubated with a combination of ATP and dATP. This was also the case when incubations were performed in the presence of s-site effector and substrate, and also when the desalting was performed in the presence of s-site allosteric effector and substrate. In incubations with only ATP, s-site effector and substrate were needed during the entire work-up procedure for ATP to be retained by the protein. In conclusion, the binding experiments suggest that the PcNrdD ATP-cone can bind either ATP or dATP but not both simultaneously. Importantly, the results point to allosteric communication between the s-site, the active site and the a-site in the ATP-cone, as dTTP and GTP are required for any ATP to be retained. Both of these observations are consistent with the structural analyses shown below.</p>

<title>Modulation of the oligomeric state by ATP and dATP in the presence of allosteric effectors</title>
<p>Binding of dATP to the ATP-cone in all class I RNRs studied to date results in formation of higher oligomers unable to perform catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Martínez-Carranza <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). We therefore next asked whether a similar mechanism would be valid for dATP-mediated inhibition of a class III RNR. To elucidate the oligomeric states of PcNrdD we used gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kaufman <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>), a method similar to electrospray mass spectrometry. It requires low protein and nucleotide concentrations as well as volatile buffers.</p>
<p>When loaded with ATP, PcNrdD was in a dimer-tetramer equilibrium shifted towards dimers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, left; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 - figure supplement 1</xref>). Addition of the CTP substrate or the s-site effector dTTP resulted in a similar equilibrium. In contrast, the dimer-tetramer equilibrium of dATP-loaded PcNrdD was shifted towards tetramers, and this equilibrium was likewise not affected by addition of the CTP substrate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, right; <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 - figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, dATP-inhibition of enzyme activity seems to work differently in PcNrdD than the clearcut and drastic change in oligomeric structure observed for class I RNRs, since both ATP-loaded and dATP-loaded forms of PcNrdD were in dimer-tetramer equilibria.</p>

<title>Glycyl radical formation in presence of ATP or dATP</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether dATP inhibition was mediated by prevention of glycyl radical formation. Apo-PcNrdD was incubated with NrdG and <italic>S-</italic>adenosylmethionine in presence of ATP or dATP. Whereas reduction of substrate requires the presence of formate, the formation of a glycyl radical does not. We therefore incubated with or without formate as well as with or without substrate. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows that the glycyl radical was readily formed in the presence of dATP both with and without the CTP substrate, and the result was similar in the absence of formate (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 - figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, under all conditions the glycyl radical content was higher in the presence of dATP compared to with ATP, and it was also more stable than in absence of any effector nucleotides. In addition, the shape of the doublet EPR signal was similar under all conditions studied. Collectively, these results show that the glycyl radical is readily formed in the presence of a dATP concentration that inhibits RNR activity.</p>

<p>PcNrdD is a compact dimer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Each monomer consists of 739 residues, of which residues 1-91 constitute the ATP-cone, 92-110 a linker region, 111-122 a flap that folds over the substrate in the active site, 123-671 are the core domain with its 10-stranded α/β barrel fold typical of the RNR/glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) family, and 676-739 are the C-terminal glycyl radical domain (GRD) that contains a structural Zn site followed by the buried loop containing the radical glycine residue at position Gly711 and a C-terminal tail that extends across the surface of the protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b,c</xref>). The closest structural neighbours as identified by the DALI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Holm, 2022</xref>) are the NrdDs from bacteriophage T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Logan <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) (1H7A, 2.5 Å root mean square deviation [rmsd] in Cα positions for 535 residues, 27% sequence identity) and <italic>T. maritima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aurelius <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wei <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) (4U3E, 3.0 Å rmsd for 508 residues, 16% sequence identity; <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 - figure supplement 1</xref>). The linker, flap and GRD are well-ordered in one of the monomers (dark blue in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) and substrate CTP is bound (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 - figure supplement 2a,b</xref>), while in the other monomer this region is less well-ordered and the active site is empty (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 - figure supplement 2c,d</xref>). We will refer to these as the “active” and “inactive” monomers respectively.</p>
<p>At the concentration of ATP used (1 mM), ATP is not observed to bind to the s-sites near the dimer interface. The ATP-cones containing the a-site are flexible, but the reconstruction allowed the modelling of two ATP molecules per ATP-cone and many of the most important side chains. The ATP molecules are bound similarly to the twin dATP molecules seen in the ATP-cones of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA (PaNrdA) and <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB (LbNrdB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansson <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rozman Grinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>), and to dATP bound to PcNrdD itself (see below). However, the ATP-cones in PcNrdD exhibit a hitherto unobserved relative orientation in which the four triphosphate groups are projected towards each other. (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b,d</xref>). The large negative charge is compensated for by the proximity of as many as 12 Arg and Lys side chains from both monomers. The ATP-cones interact by contacts involving the “roof” of the domain (residues 1-18). Arg11 of each ATP-cone reaches over to interact with the α-phosphate group of one of the ATP molecules in the other ATP-cone, and a salt bridge is formed between Asp9 at the end of the lid and Arg91 at the end of the last helix of the other ATP-cone. Strikingly, the dimer of ATP-cones is slightly offset from the dimer axis of the core protein, such that the ATP-cone of the inactive monomer approaches the core domain of the active monomer, while the ATP-cone of the active monomer is more distant from the core domain of the inactive one (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,b</xref>). However, the closest atom of any ATP molecule is over 30 Å from the substrate CTP in the active site.</p>
<p>The glycyl radical site is found at Gly711, at the tip of a loop projected from the C-terminal region of the enzyme into the barrel, where it approaches the radical initiator cysteine Cys416 at the tip of a loop stretching through the barrel from the other side (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The second cysteine necessary for the radical mechanism of PcNrdD is Cys171 on the first β-strand of the barrel (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). Consistent with the fact that PcNrdD belongs to the group of anaerobic RNRs that use formate as overall reductant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Burnim <italic>et al</italic>, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mulliez <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wei <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), there is no third cysteine residue on the sixth β-strand, and its place is taken by Asn435. As usual for GREs, Gly711 is completely buried within the barrel, with no solvent-accessible surface area. The base, phosphate and most of the ribose of substrate CTP are well-defined but the density is weaker around the 5’ C-atom (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="545753v2_fig7.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>After the glycyl radical loop emerges from the α/β barrel, it traverses the top of the barrel, forming a short helix from residues 723-730 and ending in an extended tail. This conformation of the C-terminus is very similar to the one seen for TmNrdD in PDB entry 4U3E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wei <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>). This tail makes few specific interactions with other residues in the core.</p>
<p>When compared to previously determined NrdD structures, the first common structural element is a long α-helix in the core domain stretching from Thr123 to Leu141. Between this and the ATP-cone are the linker (92-110), followed by the flap over the substrate in the active site (111-122). Two residues from the flap make H-bonds to CTP: Asn114 to the γ-phosphate group and Asn116 to the amino group of the cytosine base. We call this region the “NxN flap”, as the NxN motif (114-116) is one of the most highly conserved sequence motifs in the NrdD family (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>). This is the first time such interactions have been observed in an NrdD, as the flap corresponds to a disordered segment of 17 residues in the structures of TmNrdD and T4NrdD. However, an AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jumper <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>) model of TmNrdD (entry Q9WYL) suggests that this linker potentially has the same conformation in TmNrdD and possibly all other NrdDs, whether or not they have an ATP-cone. As seen previously in TmNrdD, the triphosphate moiety is recognised through the conserved HxHD motif (157-160), H-bonds to the main chain atoms of a loop (577-581) following the third-last strand of the α/β barrel and the dipole of the following helix (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>).</p>
<p>Significantly, the NxN flap forms the nexus of a network of interactions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) between the substrate, the linker to the ATP-cone, the C-terminal GRD, and “loop 2” (residues 304-311) that is responsible for communicating the substrate specificity signal from the s-site at the dimer interface to the active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aurelius <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Larsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Logan <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). Important interactions linking the NxN flap to the C-terminus include H-bonds from Tyr712, which immediately follows the radical Gly711, to Glu581, which bridges to both the substrate and Ala115 in the flap, as well as from Arg719 in the GRD to the main chain carbonyl groups of Asn114 and Met117 in the flap. Tyr712 is highly conserved in the NrdD family (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). This nexus is crucial for allosteric activity regulation, as will be discussed later.</p>
<p>As the NxN flap appears to close off the top of the active site, we used the web server Caver Web v1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Stourac <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>) to analyse substrate access to the active site in the ATP-bound form, and identified a tunnel ∼12 Å long leading from the surface of the protein to the active site that is 5.6 Å in diameter at its narrowest point (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 - figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in principle a fresh substrate could diffuse into the active site on each catalytic cycle.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM structure of the ATP-dTTP-GTP dimer</title>
<p>In order to probe the generality of the conformations observed in the ATP-CTP complex, we also solved the structure of PcNrdD in complex with ATP in the a-site, specificity effector dTTP in the s-site, and substrate GTP in the active site (c-site). Again, 2D classes show a predominantly dimeric form with no more than ∼10% tetramers. From a set of 437 886 particles selected from 2D classes with the best apparent density for the ATP-cone region, we obtained a volume at 2.40 Å resolution for the dimer with C1 symmetry that was further improved using DeepEMhancer (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table 1 - table supplement 2</xref>). dTTP is clearly visible in the s-site (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 - figure supplement 1a</xref>) as is GTP in the active site (<xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 - figure supplement 2</xref>). A Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion can be modelled in the s-site, coordinated by Glu290 and all three phosphate groups of dTTP. A β-hairpin loop between residues 185-192 that is disordered in the ATP-CTP structure in the absence of an s-site nucleotide is here ordered, due to an H-bond to the 2’-OH group of dTTP. Readout of the s-site nucleotide’s identity is achieved through an H-bond to Asn298 (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 - figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Like the ATP-CTP complex, the ATP-dTTP-GTP complex can also be partitioned into an active and an inactive monomer. The ATP-cone region is very flexible, but the last helix of the ATP-cone in the active monomer can be traced back to residue 85 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a,b</xref>). The helix is not kinked at residue 91 as in the ATP-CTP dimer but forms an uninterrupted helix between residues 85-104. The volume for the ATP-cone region lies entirely on one side of the PcNrdD dimer axis, as is also apparent in some of the 2D classes (<xref rid="fig8s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 - figure supplement 3</xref>). The ATP-cone cannot be modelled in detail, but if the volume is contoured at very low level, there is almost enough density for one ATP-cone. Taken together, this suggests that there is one partially disordered ATP-cone and one highly flexible in the ATP-dTTP-GTP complex. In the active monomer, the NxN flap and entire C-terminus are ordered while in the inactive monomer, the entire assembly of linker and NxN flap up to residue 120 and the entire GRD are so flexible that they cannot be seen in the cryo-EM volumes. We expect that the GRD behaves largely as a rigid body whose displacements relative to the core domain become larger in the dATP-bound form.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, binding of dTTP to the s-sites at the dimer interface induces two distinct conformations of loop 2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>). In the active monomer, loop 2 is projected towards the aforementioned network of interactions between NxN flap, GRD and substrate, packing against the flap, though no polar interactions are apparent. However, loop 2 also makes extensive interactions with its equivalent in the inactive monomer, which forces the latter into a conformation where it would sterically clash with an ordered NxN flap (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>). Furthermore, Phe412, which stacks on the substrate base in the active monomer, and Arg305, which is projected from the substrate-distal side of loop 2, sterically prevent the substrate binding in the inactive monomer. These may be important contributing factors to the disorder of the NxN flap and GRD. Finally, Gln309, which interacts with the substrate in the active monomer (<xref rid="fig8s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 - figure supplement 2</xref>), is oriented away from the substrate through its interactions with the “active” loop 2.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM structure of the ATP-dGTP dimer</title>
<p>As a third insight into the ATP-bound forms of PcNrdD, we solved the structure of PcNrdD in complex with specificity effector dGTP in the s-site and ATP at a concentration where it would both act as allosteric effector at the a-site and as the cognate substrate for dGTP (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Table 1 - table supplement 3</xref>).

<title>Cryo-EM structure of the dATP-bound dimer</title>
<p>In micrographs of PcNrdD samples in the presence of 0.5 mM dATP, we observed an approximately 1:1 mixture of dimeric and tetrameric particles, consistent with results from GEMMA. To resolve whether dATP inhibition was linked to oligomerisation, we resolved the structures of each of these oligomers separately. We made a reconstruction of the dATP-bound PcNrdD dimer from 1 009 021 particles to 2.7 Å resolution that was further improved by DeepEMhancer postprocessing. The core domain is very similar to that of the ATP-CTP complex, with an rmsd in Cα positions of 1.2 Å for 1089 Cα atoms considering each dimer as a whole (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Table 1 - table supplement 4</xref>). dATP is clearly visible in the specificity site (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 - figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, in contrast to the ATP complexes, the entire GRD is disordered in both monomers of the dATP-bound dimer (<xref rid="fig8s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 - figure supplement 5</xref>). No structure is visible after residue 676 at the end of the last strand of the barrel. This suggests that inhibition by binding of dATP to the ATP-cone is coupled to disordering of the C-terminal domain. The NxN flap that covers the top of the substrate in the ATP/CTP-bound form is also disordered, as are the ATP-cones themselves.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM structure of the dATP-bound tetramer</title>
<p>From the same micrographs that revealed the dATP-bound dimers we also resolved dATP-bound tetramers. We obtained a map from cryoSPARC at 2.8 Å, which was again improved with DeepEMhancer (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref>). Two dATP molecules are bound to each ATP-cone and one at each of the specificity sites, giving a total of 12 visible dATPs per tetramer. The tetramer reveals an arrangement of two dimers (chains A/B and C/D respectively) in which the ATP-cones are all well-ordered and one ATP-cone from each pair mediates interactions between the dimers (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9b</xref>). The ATP-cones have an almost domain-swapped arrangement within each dimer relative to the core domains. This oligomeric arrangement has not previously been observed within the RNR family.</p>

<p>dATP binds to the specificity site as in the dimeric dATP-bound form (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8 - figure supplement 1c</xref>). The two dATP molecules bound to each ATP-cone do so very similarly to the dATP-loaded ATP-cones of the RNR class I active site subunit from PaNrdA (PDB ID 5IM3) and the class I radical generating subunit from LbNrdB (5OLK) to which the PcNrdD ATP-cones have 29% and 33% sequence identity respectively (<xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 - figure supplement 1</xref>). The DALI server reveals an rmsd in Cα positions of 1.9 Å and 1.7 Å respectively. The next most similar ATP-cone is that of the RNR transcriptional regulator NrdR from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> in its dodecameric form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rozman Grinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>) binding two ATP molecules, with 82 aligned residues, rmsd 2.4 Å and sequence identity 17%. Structural similarity to other ATP-cones is listed in <xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 - figure supplement 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The two dATP molecules bind with their negatively charged triphosphate moieties oriented towards each other (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9c</xref>). No Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion is observed between the triphosphate tails, but this may be an artefact of the cryo-EM method, as the PaNrdA and LbNrdB crystal structures suggest that this ion is necessary for charge neutralisation. As in the ATP-bound form, further charge compensation is achieved by extensive coordination by, or proximity of, basic side chains, e.g. Lys7, Arg8, Arg87 and Arg91. As previously observed in PaNrdA and LbNrdB, the adenosine base of the “inner” dATP (dATP1) fits into a pocket under the β-hairpin roof of the ATP-cone and the base of the “outer” nucleotide (dATP2) is sandwiched between an aromatic residue (Tyr83) and the side of the first α-helix in the domain. No direct contacts are seen between the dATP molecules bound to the ATP-cone and residues in the core domain.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig9s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 - figure supplement 2</xref> shows the differences in binding modes of dATP in the dATP-bound tetramer and ATP in the ATP-CTP dimer. The high mobility of the ATP-cone in the latter precludes a detailed analysis. However, it is clear that the triphosphate tails have very different orientations. In the ATP complex the tail of ATP2 is oriented away from the C-terminal helix towards the base of ATP1, such that the β-phosphate moiety may even H-bond to the base of ATP1. The side chain of Arg87 fills the space vacated by the γ-phosphate of ATP2. Instead of H-bonding to the γ-phosphate of ATP2, Arg91 swings away and interacts with the equivalent moiety of ATP2 in the ATP-cone of the other chain. The structures suggest that the additional 2’-OH group in ATP may cause conformational changes in the ribose ring that propagate to the phosphate tail, but further analysis requires improved resolution.</p>
<p>As in PaNrdA and LbNrdB, the ATP-cones in the dATP-bound tetramer self-interact through a pair of α-helices at the C-terminal end of the ATP-cone. Remarkably, the pair of ATP-cones is highly asymmetrically positioned with respect to the 2-fold axis of its core dimer, being displaced as a rigid body towards the other dimer (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9b</xref>). Both pairs of ATP-cones are displaced in the same way, giving the complex overall C2 symmetry around an axis bisecting the pair of dimers. Consequently, the 2-fold axes of the ATP-cones and the core dimer are not aligned (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9b</xref>). The asymmetric arrangement is associated with two distinct conformations of the linker 93-103 between the fourth helix of the ATP-cone (<xref rid="fig9s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 - figure supplement 3a,b</xref>) and the core domain. In chains A and C, a small kink leads from helix 4 into a short helical segment that packs antiparallel to helix 122-142 in the core domain. In contrast, in chains B and D, the short helix is parallel to helix 122-142 and is joined to helix 4 at a 45° angle. The rest of the polypeptide between residues 103-121, including the NxN flap, is disordered in both linkers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, all contacts between the two dimers of the tetramer are mediated by interactions between one of the ATP-cones in one dimer (B or D) and one of the core domains of the other dimer (C or A respectively). <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9d</xref> shows the interactions of the roof of the ATP-cone with two outer helices from the C-terminal half of the barrel domain (residues 458-485 and 550-569, preceding the sixth and seventh strands). The interactions are mostly hydrophobic but are reinforced by several H-bonds, e.g. between Gln3D-Gln458A, Ser53D–Gln458A, Arg11D-Asp468A, the main chain amide of Ile12D and Tyr557A. The amount of buried surface area is small: 717 Å<sup>2</sup>, or around 1% of the total surface area of each dimer. For comparison, the monomer-monomer interactions within each dimer bury 11.7% of the total area. The residues on the core domain of PcNrdD involved in interactions with the ATP-cone of the other dimer do not show high sequence conservation, even when the alignments are restricted to the most similar sequences.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM structures of PcNrdD-dATP complexes produced in the presence of CTP</title>
<p>To investigate whether substrate had any allosteric effect on the conformations of the ATP-cone, flap and GRD, we determined separate cryo-EM structures of tetrameric and dimeric PcNrdD, from the same grid, in the presence of 0.5 mM dATP and 0.5 mM CTP, achieving a resolution of 2.6 Å from 1 105 348 particles before post-processing for the tetramer and 2.6 Å from 1 132 695 particles for the dimer (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Table 1 - table supplement 5</xref>). Both forms were almost identical to those seen in the presence of dATP alone, and no CTP could be seen bound to the active site (<xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 - figure supplement 3</xref>). This strongly suggests that substrate binding is dependent on ordering of the flap region by binding of ATP to the ATP-cone.</p>

<title>Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS)</title>
<p>To validate our structural and biochemical hypotheses, we further examined the degree of order of the different structural elements of PcNrdD in solution using HDX-MS. This method measures the degree of protection of peptides from H/D exchange in a deuterated solution, which reports on how exposed they are. Three different samples were analysed: apo-PcNrdD and the complexes with dATP-CTP and ATP-CTP.</p>
<p>The apo form shows high deuterium uptake over the entire ATP-cone, linker and NxN flap, from residues 1-117 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10a</xref>). Analysis of differences in uptake in the N-terminal region between the apo protein and the ATP or dATP complexes clearly confirms binding of both nucleotides to the ATP-cone (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10b</xref>). Peptides spanning residues 2-84 exhibit clear protection from HDX in both nucleotide-bound states. Furthermore, bimodal deuterium uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">James et al. 2022</xref>) was observed for N-terminal peptides spanning residues 2-23 and 83-99. For peptides very close to the N-terminus (2-23), the apo form only exhibits one high uptake (dynamic) conformational state while for the two ligand bound states there was a clear bimodal behaviour (EX1) with one high uptake and one protected state of an approximately equal size (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10c</xref> and Figure 10 - figure supplement 1). Possible interpretations are that the bimodality is due to a mixture of occupied and empty ATP-cones, or to the mixture of dimers and tetramers.</p>
<fig id="fig10" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">

<caption><p>Summary of the HDX-MS experiments. a) Heat map showing the deuterium uptake of the apo state for time points 30, 300 and 3000 s. Warm colours represent fast uptake and cold colours a low uptake. Both the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions have a high uptake already at 30s. For the N-terminal bimodal uptake, only the fast exchanging population (rightmost) is depicted. The influence of bimodal uptake and more detail can be seen in Figure 10 - figure supplements 1 and 2. b) Differential chiclet plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang et al. 2021</xref>) collapses the timepoints into a single maximum deuterium uptake difference for states apo-(ATP+CTP), apo-(dATP+CTP) and (dATP+CTP)-(ATP+CTP). Colours range from deep blue for a high degree of relative protection to deep red for high deprotection.

For peptides 2-23 and 83-99, when there are two lines with the same colour, the top traces are for the fast-exchanging population and the bottom for a less dynamic/more protected population. Note that for peptide 83-99 the apo state has two populations at all timepoints, while the ATP and dATP converge at 3000s to one population (with the dATP state as most protected). For peptides 295-312 and 693-713 the apo curve has been removed for visual clarity.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, peptides spanning amino acids 81-99 in the linker region have a bimodal uptake that is most pronounced in the apo state. For the nucleotide-bound forms there are also two populations where the dATP-CTP state converges into a single, more protected population at the longest time point, 3000s (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10c</xref>). This suggests a mixture of states with flexible and locked linkers, consistent with the highly dynamic nature of residues 85-100 observed in the cryo-EM structures, where in the dATP bound tetramer the linker is ordered to residue ∼100, while in the dimer the ATP-cone and linker are highly dynamic and the first ordered structure is observed from residue 120.</p>
<p>The NxN flap at residues 101-117 has a high H/D exchange rate with both ligands and does not differ much between ATP and dATP, but the region 118-126 has a higher exchange rate in the dATP form, most likely because substrate is not bound to the active site.</p>
<p>Clear differences between the ATP and dATP complexes are seen in the region 178-204, which contains the β-hairpin of the s-site (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10c</xref>, panel 178-204) that is highly protected with dATP. This is consistent with the structures that show no ATP bound at the s-site but full occupancy of dATP. Peptides between 330-348, which are in contact with the β-hairpin, are also protected in the dATP complex. The region 295-312, i.e. loop 2, is deprotected in the dATP form relative to ATP. This is also in agreement with the cryo-EM structures, in which loop 2 is partially disordered in the dATP complex but ordered in the ATP complex in the monomer with bound CTP.</p>
<p>The HDX-MS results show a high degree of deuterium uptake in the GRD in all forms, indicating a high degree of mobility. This is consistent with the cryo-EM structures, in which the GRD overall has B-factors higher than the core domain (though the glycyl-radical containing loop has similar B-factors to the core, being buried). From the HDX-MS data it is clear that the GRD is highly dynamic, and while a trend of increased dynamics for some C-terminal peptides in the GRD can be seen for the dATP-CTP state, a detailed analysis is confounded by the limited time resolution and the complexity of the sample, which consists of a mixture of conformations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ribonucleotide reductase is an essential enzyme for all free-living organisms. Its complex regulation at the levels of transcription, overall activity and substrate specificity makes it quite unique in Nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mathews, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2018</xref>). A fundamental understanding of this regulation could e.g. pave the way for better antibiotics. The ATP-cone is a small, genetically mobile domain frequently found at the N-terminus of RNR catalytic subunits of all major classes, as well as in the bacterial RNR-specific transcription factor NrdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rozman Grinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Its role in allosteric regulation of class I aerobic RNRs has been extensively studied. In the presence of dATP, the ATP-cone mediates the formation of a surprising variety of different oligomeric complexes that nevertheless have in common that they block the formation of an (observed or inferred) active complex between the catalytic and radical generating subunits that permits proton-coupled electron transfer on each catalytic cycle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Martínez-Carranza <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite their catalytic subunits being evolutionarily related to those of class I, anaerobic class III RNRs have a fundamentally different activation mechanism that is likely common to all glycyl radical enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Backman <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lundahl <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Once generated on the catalytic subunit by encounter of the reductase with its radical SAM family activase, the glycyl radical can catalyse hundreds of cycles of turnover before being exhausted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Torrents <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Allosteric inhibition could thus in principle proceed by two mechanisms: by blocking the initial encounter of the reductase and activase, or by preventing subsequent transfer of the radical to the substrate. The first of these hypotheses is intuitively more similar to the steric blocking mechanisms encountered in class I RNRs; the latter is more challenging to understand, as the glycine and cysteine are buried in close proximity in the active site.</p>
<p>In this work we present the first biochemical, biophysical and structural characterisation of an anaerobic, class III RNR containing an ATP-cone, providing the first picture of the structural basis for allosteric activity regulation in this large family. We show that the ATP-cone can bind two molecules of ATP or dATP, but not both simultaneously. HDX-MS confirms that binding of either nucleotide reduces the exposure of the ATP-cone to deuterium exchange, as well as confirming dATP binding to the s-site. As expected, the presence of an ATP-cone confers inhibition of enzyme activity at high dATP concentrations. GEMMA experiments show that PcNrdD exists in a mixture of dimeric and tetrameric states under most experimental conditions studied, with the equilibrium shifted towards dimers in the presence of ATP. Addition of inhibiting concentrations of dATP shifts the equilibrium towards tetramers. The equilibria are not affected by substrate or specificity effector. EPR spectroscopy clearly shows that the glycyl radical is formed even in the presence of dATP. Together, these results show that dATP inhibition in class III RNRs does not occur by blocking the initial encounter of reductase and activase. Instead, our nucleotide binding results show that dATP inhibition prevents binding of substrates.</p>
<p>The seven cryo-EM structures of PcNrdD in a variety of nucleotide complexes presented here suggest a mechanism in which binding of ATP or dATP modulates activity by affecting the dynamics of a tightly knit network of structural elements including the critical glycyl radical domain in the C-terminal region of the enzyme. A summary of the conformational states is shown in <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>. In the presence of ATP and substrate CTP, the GRD is fully ordered in one monomer and Gly711 is found at its expected position proximal to Cys416, to which it will deliver its radical to initiate each catalytic cycle and accept it back at the end of the cycle. The CTP substrate is bound in this monomer and a conserved but previously unobserved flap containing two Asn residues (NxN flap) forms over the top of the substrate, making H-bonding interactions with it. Loop 2, which mediates between the substrate specificity site and the active site, is fully ordered. In contrast, in the other monomer, no substrate is bound, loop 2 is disordered and the flap and C-terminus are more dynamic. At the same time, the ATP-cones themselves are relatively flexible. This is not unexpected for this type of ATP-cone, which binds two nucleotides and was first observed in the class I RNR PaNrdA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johansson <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). SAXS studies showed that the ATP-cone in PaNrdA is flexible in the presence of ATP, while in its dATP-bound form it forms a symmetric interaction with an ATP-cone on another dimer, causing the enzyme to tetramerise. A similar behaviour was seen even when this type of ATP-cone was evolutionarily “transplanted” to the N-terminus of the radical-generating subunit, as seen in LbNrdB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rozman Grinberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2018a</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>By careful isolation of a subset of particles, we were able to characterise an unusual dimer of ATP-cones in the ATP-CTP complex, where four ATP molecules bind with all their triphosphate tails pointing towards each other. Such an orientation is unprecedented for RNRs, but such tail-to-tail orientations, compensated by extensive positive charges, are found in e.g. adenylate kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berry, 1994</xref>). The relevance of this arrangement remains to be elucidated. Interestingly, when dTTP was added to the s-site in the ATP-dTTP-CTP complex, the ATP-cones became even more dynamic and could only be observed in one monomer of the dimer as diffuse density. This behaviour was reproduced with dGTP in the s-site. Both complexes with s-site effector are functionally more relevant forms than the ATP-CTP complex, as in the cell, a form with empty s-site is unlikely to exist. The partitioning of monomers into active and inactive is amplified by the presence of s-site effector (dTTP or dGTP) in both complexes with ATP. Only one of the active sites is occupied by substrate, with ordered NxN flap and C-terminal GRD. This is correlated with two distinct conformations of loop 2 in the two monomers. In the inactive monomer, the NxN flap and GRD are disordered, as loop 2 blocks their active conformation and concomitantly substrate binding. These results point to only one of the PcNrdD monomers being active at a given time and also to a significant cross-talk between the a-site, s-site and active site. This is corroborated by the finding that an s-site effector is necessary for retention of ATP by the ATP-cone when PcNrdD is first incubated with these nucleotides then purified without them.</p>
<p>In the presence of inhibitory concentrations of dATP we were able to isolate structures of both dimers and tetramers from the same cryo-EM sample, in agreement with the GEMMA results that show a shift towards the tetrameric form. In both forms, the C-terminal GRD is highly mobile in all monomers such that it cannot be seen in the cryo-EM reconstructions. An exposed glycyl radical is incompatible with its stability, so it is possible that the dynamics of the GRD are exaggerated somewhat by the vitrification process. Consistent with this, the HDX-MS results show a small but noticeable deprotection of peptides from the GRD in the presence of dATP-CTP compared to ATP-CTP.</p>
<p>In the tetramers, pairs of ATP-cones asymmetrically disposed relative to the 2-fold axes of their respective PcNrdD dimers associate through the “roof” of the “inner” dATP binding site to the core domain of the other dimer. While this allowed us to build complete models for the ATP-cones and analyse dATP binding, the role of tetramerisation in the inhibition mechanism is unclear. The tetrameric structures appear to be facilitated by a dATP-induced “stiffening” of the pair of ATP-cones, similar to what was seen in PaNrdA and LbNrdB, and their interaction with a second dimer of PcNrdD, but the interaction area is small (1% of the total surface area) and the residues involved are not highly conserved in NrdDs, even from the most similar sequences. Therefore, further studies of NrdDs containing ATP-cones are required in order to determine whether oligomerization is a general phenomenon in the family. Furthermore, the GRD is mobile in all complexes with dATP in the a-site, whether dimeric or tetrameric. Since both the ATP-cone and the GRD are disordered in the dATP-bound dimers, the exact molecular mechanism by which dATP induces disorder of the GRD remains somewhat elusive.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results show a clear correlation between ATP or dATP binding to the ATP-cone and activity or inhibition respectively. This involves a previously uncharacterised but highly conserved structural element, the NxN flap, that folds over the substrate and furthermore acts as a structural bridge between the ATP-cone, the active site and the C-terminal GRD. An increase in dynamics of these elements prevents substrate binding and thus transfer of the radical from the GRD to the substrate. Interestingly, a similar flap is formed over the top of the active site in the <italic>E. coli</italic> active complex, but it is formed by part of the C-terminal region of the separate radical generating subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kang, 2020</xref>). Thus, a locking of the substrate in the active site appears to be a conserved feature of active class I and class III RNRs. However, in class I RNR there is no tunnel allowing substrate access to the active site in the locked state. This is consistent with the fact that the class I subunits dissociate on each catalytic cycle, while in class III the glycyl radical can catalyse many substrate reductions before having to be regenerated. It remains enigmatic exactly how the tiny chemical difference between dATP and ATP (the 2’-OH group) results in such major conformational changes, as in the ATP-CTP complex, where the ATP-cones are visible, the a-site in the ATP-cone is separated from the NxN flap by at least 30 Å and in the most biologically relevant complexes with additional s-site effector, the ATP-cone is very disordered. Nevertheless, the present results give first insights into allosteric activity regulation in anaerobic RNRs and add yet another aspect to the surprisingly wide range of allosteric conformational changes that can be mediated by the binding of the two highly similar nucleotides ATP and dATP to a small, evolutionarily mobile protein domain.</p>

<p>Both binding of nucleotides to the ATP-cone in PcNrdD and binding of substrates CTP and GTP to PcNrdD were assessed using MST. PcNrdD was labelled using Monolith Protein Labeling Kit RED-NHS 2nd generation according to the manufacturer’s protocol. MST was performed using the Monolith NT.115 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH) at room temperature. Binding of GTP and CTP was assayed in MST buffer containing 40 mM Hepes pH 7, 50 mM KCl, 50 and 100 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM dTTP (only for GTP binding) and either 5 mM ATP or 1 mM dATP. The 16 reaction tubes were prepared by the addition of 2 μl MST buffer (concentrated 5 times), 5 μl GTP or CTP of the desired concentration and 1 μl RED dye-labelled NrdD in a total volume of 10 μl. Final NrdD concentration in the binding reaction was 11 nM while the binding partner concentrations were between 70 mM and 2 μM for CTP and 50 mM and 1.5 μM for GTP. Binding of ATP and dATP to the ATP-cone was assayed in MST buffer containing 25 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM TCEP, 0.1% Tween-20, 1 mM dTTP and 5 mM GTP. A 16-step dilution series of the binding partners was prepared by adding 5 μl buffer to 15 tubes. ATP or dATP was added to the first tube to the final concentration of 4 mM and 5 μl was transferred to the second tube and mixed by pipetting (1:1 dilution series). To each tube of the dilution series 5 μl of PcNrdD was added to reach a final concentration of 11 nM. The samples were transferred to Monolith™ NT.115 Series Premium Capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies GmbH), which were scanned using the MST instrument (100% excitation power, medium MST power). Obtained MST data was analysed and fitted using the MO. Affinity Analysis v2.3 software (NanoTemper Technologies) with default parameters. K<sub>D</sub> and standard deviation for GTP and CTP binding to PcNrdD in the presence of ATP and for ATP and dATP binding to the ATP-cone were calculated using fits from at least three individual titrations. K<sub>D</sub> values for CTP or GTP binding to PcNrdD in the presence of dATP were extremely high and could not be reliably determined since the titration curves did not reach a plateau and therefore are only estimates.</p>

Samples of 100 μL were injected on the column equilibrated with buffer A (10% methanol, 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 10 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide) and eluted at 1 mL/min with a gradient of 40%-100% buffer B (30% methanol, 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 10 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide). Compound identification and product quantification were performed by comparison with injected standards. Three different sets of experiments were performed, each set consisting of incubation with only ATP, only dATP, and a combination of ATP and dATP. In the first set of experiments 75 µM apo-NrdD was incubated with 1 mM ATP or 1 mM dATP, and when 1 mM each of ATP and dATP was used, dATP was added 15 min after addition of ATP. After 30 min incubation the mixtures were desalted in a buffer without nucleotides. In the second set of experiments 75 µM apo-NrdD in presence of 1 mM dTTP and 5 mM GTP was incubated with 3 mM ATP or 1 mM dATP, and when both nucleotides were combined dATP was added 15 min after addition of ATP.

From this volume, a set of templates was created and used for template-based picking with a diameter of 100 Å. Due to the large number of micrographs, they were split into two sets. The largest set (16 219 micrographs) was analysed first. About 8.6 million particles were extracted with a 350-pixel box size and classified into 60 2D classes. Eight representative classes containing different orientations (∼3.3 million particles) were used to generate four ab-initio models without symmetry (C1) and particles were subjected to three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous refinement using four classes. The most populated model containing ∼1 million particles was subjected to homogeneous and non-uniform refinement, which gave a map with an overall FSC resolution of 2.94 Å.

A 4-point calibration (pH 2,4,7,10) was made prior to all measurements. The HDX-MS analysis was made using automated sample preparation on a LEAP H/D-X PAL™ platform interfaced to an LC-MS system, comprising an Ultimate 3000 micro-LC coupled to an Orbitrap Q Exactive Plus MS.</p>
<p>HDX was performed on 2 mg/ml PcNrdD with and without ligands (5 mM ATP + 5 mM CTP or 1 mM dATP + 5 mM CTP) in 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 7.5. The HDX-MS was performed in one continuous run, the apo state being run before both complexed states. For each labelling time point, 3 μl HDX samples were diluted with 27 μl labelling buffer (containing the ligands) of the same composition prepared in D<sub>2</sub>O, pH<sub>(read)</sub> 7.4. The HDX labelling was carried out at t = 0, 30, 300, and 3000 s at 20 °C. Each time point was run in 4-6 replicates. The labelling reaction was quenched by dilution of 30 μl labelled sample with 30 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 0.4 M TCEP, 4 M urea, pH 2.5 at 1 °C. 50 μl of the quenched sample was directly injected and subjected to online pepsin digestion at 4 °C on an in-house immobilized pepsin column (2.1 x 30 mm). The online digestion and trapping was performed for 4 min using a flow of 50 µL/min 0.1% formic acid (FA), pH 2.5. The peptides generated by pepsin digestion were subjected to on-line SPE on a PepMap300 C18 trap column (1 mm x 15 mm) and washed with 0.1% FA for 60 s. Thereafter, the trap column was switched in-line with a reversed-phase analytical column (Hypersil GOLD, particle size 1.9 µm, 1 x 50 mm). The mobile phases were (A) 0.1% FA and 95% acetonitrile / 0.1% FA (B) and separation was performed at 1 °C using a gradient of 5-50% B over 8 minutes and then from 50 to 90% B for 5 min. Following the separation, the trap and column were equilibrated at 5% organic content until the next injection. The needle port and sample loop were cleaned three times after each injection with mobile phase 5% MeOH / 0.1% FA, followed by 90% MeOH / 0.1% FA and a final wash of 5% MeOH / 0.1% FA. After each sample and blank injection, the pepsin column was washed by injecting 90 μl of pepsin wash solution 1% FA / 4 M urea / 5% MeOH. In order to minimize carry-over, a full blank was run between each sample injection. Separated peptides were analysed on a Q Exactive Plus MS, equipped with a HESI source operated at a capillary temperature of 250 °C with sheath gas 12, Aux gas 2 and sweep gas 1 (au). For HDX analysis, MS full scan spectra were acquired at 70K resolution, AGC 3e6, max IT 200 ms and scan range 300-2000. For identification of generated peptides, separate non-deuterated samples were analysed using data dependent MS/MS with HCD fragmentation. A summary of the HDX experimental detail is reported in Figure 10 - figure supplement 1. The mass spectrometry raw files have been deposited at the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Perez-Riverol et al. 2022</xref>) with the dataset identifier PXD047943.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>PEAKS Studio X Bioinformatics Solutions Inc. (BSI, Waterloo, Canada) was used for peptide identification after pepsin digestion of non-deuterated samples. The search was done on a FASTA file with only the NrdD sequence. The search criteria were a mass error tolerance of 15 ppm and a fragment mass error tolerance of 0.05 Da, allowing for fully unspecific cleavage by pepsin. Peptides identified by PEAKS with a peptide score value of log P &gt; 25 and no modifications were used to generate a peptide list containing peptide sequence, charge state and retention time for the HDX analysis. HDX data analysis and visualisation was performed using HDExaminer, version 3.3 (Sierra Analytics Inc., Modesto, US). The analysis was made on the best charge state for each peptide, allowed only for EX2 (except for bimodal parts of the protein for which EX1 calculation of uptake was allowed) and the two first residues of a peptide were assumed unable to hold deuteration. Due to the comparative nature of the measurements, the deuterium incorporation levels for the peptic peptides were derived from the observed relative mass difference between the deuterated and non-deuterated peptides without back-exchange correction using a fully deuterated sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Engen &amp; Wales, 2015</xref>). As a full deuteration experiment was not made, full deuteration was set to 75% of maximum theoretical uptake. The presented deuteration data is the average of all high and medium confidence results. The allowed retention time window was ± 0.5 minute. The spectra for all time points were manually inspected; low scoring peptides, obvious outliers and any peptides where retention time correction could not be made consistent were removed. As bottom-up labelling HDX-MS is limited in structural resolution by the degree of overlap of the peptides generated by pepsin digestion, the peptide map overlap is shown for the respective state in Figure 10 - figure supplement 1.</p>

<p>The goal of this study is to understand the allosteric mechanism of overall activity regulation in an anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) that contains an ATP-cone domain. Through cryo-EM structural analysis of various nucleotide-bound states of the RNR, the mechanism of dATP inhibition is found to involve order-disorder transitions in the active site. These effects appear to prevent binding of substrate and a radical transfer needed to initiate the reaction.</p>
<p>Strengths of the manuscript include the comprehensive nature of the work - including both numerous structures of different forms of the RNR and detailed characterization of enzyme activity to establish the parameters of dATP inhibition. The manuscript has been improved in a revision by performing additional experiments to help corroborate certain aspects of the study. But these new experiments do not address all of the open questions about the structural basis for mechanism. Additionally, some questions about the strength of biochemical data and fit of binding or kinetic curves to data that were raised by other referees still remain. Some experimental observations are not consistent with the proposed model. For example, why does dATP enhance Gly radical formation when the proposed mechanism of dATP inhibition involves disorder in the Gly radical domain?</p>
<p>The work is impactful because it reports initial observations about a potentially new mode of allosteric inhibition in this enzyme class. It also sets the stage for future work to understand the molecular basis for this phenomenon in more detail.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Bimai et al describes a structural and functional characterization of an anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme from the human microbe, P. copri. More specifically, the authors aimed to characterize the mechanism by how (d)ATP modulates nucleotide reduction in this anaerobic RNR, using a combination of enzyme kinetics, binding thermodynamics, and cryo-EM structural determination, complemented by hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX). One of the principal findings of this paper is the ordering of a NxN 'flap' in the presence of ATP that promotes RNR catalysis and the disordering (or increased protein dynamics) of both this flap and the glycyl radical domain (GRD) when the inhibitory effector, dATP, binds. The latter is correlated with a loss of substrate binding, which is the likely mechanism for dATP inhibition. It is important to note that the GRD is remote (&gt;30 Ang) from the binding site of the dATP molecule, suggesting long-range communication of the structural (dis)ordering. The authors also present evidence for a shift in oligomerization in the presence of dATP. The work does provide evidence for new insights/views into the subtle differences of nucleotide modulation (allostery) of RNR, in a class III system, through long-range interactions.</p>
<p>The strengths of the work are the impressive, in-depth structural analysis of the various regulated forms of PcRNR by (d)ATP using cryo-EM. The authors present seven different models in total, with striking differences in oligomerization and (dis)ordering of select structural features, including the GRD that is integral to catalysis. The authors present several, complementary biochemical experiments (ITC, MST, EPR, kinetics) aimed at resolving the binding and regulatory mechanism of the enzyme by various nucleotides. The authors present a good breadth of the literature in which the focus of allosteric regulation of RNRs has been on the aerobic orthologues.</p>
<p>The addition of hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) complements the results originating from cryo-EM data. Most notably, is the observation of the enhanced exchange (albeit quite subtle) of the GRD domain in the presence of dATP that matches the loss of structural information in this region in the cryo-EM data. The most pronounced and compelling HDX results are seen in the form of dATP-induced protection of peptides immediately adjacent to the b-hairpin at the s-site, where dATP is expected to bind based on cryo-EM. It is clear that the presence of dATP increases the rigidity of this region.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: The discussion of the change in peptide mobility in the N-terminal region is complicated by the presence of bimodal mass spectral features and this may prevent detailed interpretation of the data, especially for select peptide region that shows opposite trends upon nucleotide association. Further, the HDX data in the NxN flap is unchanged upon nucleotide binding (ATP, dATP, or CTP), despite changes observed in the cryo-EM data.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the Reviewing Editor and two additional reviewers for the insightful input they gave us on the first version of our manuscript on allosteric activity regulation of the anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase from Prevotella copri. We have revised the manuscript in the light of the reviewers' comments. In particular, we have added additional experiments using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to probe the accessibility and mobility of different parts of the protein structure in the apo-state and in the presence of dATP/CTP and ATP/CTP. The results strongly confirm the binding of nucleotides to the activity and specificity sites, as seen biochemically and structurally. In the question of mobility of the glycyl radical domain the HDX-MS experiments suggest an increased mobility in the presence of dATP, though the results are not as clear-cut as for the nucleotide binding. The HDX-MS analyses are complicated by the fact that they reflect all species in solution, which are evidently multiple for all states of PcNrdD. Finally, we have rephrased key parts of the results and discussion, and modified the title, to avoid any implication that we believe the glycyl radical domain becomes extensively disordered, rather that it becomes more mobile to the extent that it cannot be seen in the cryo-EM structures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study advances our understanding of the allosteric regulation of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) by nucleotides, providing valuable new structural insight into class III RNRs containing ATP cones. The cryo-EM structural characterization of the system is solid, but other aspects of the manuscript, which are incomplete, could be improved by including additional functional characterization and more evidence for the proposed mechanism of inhibition by dATP. The work will be of interest to biochemists and structural biologists working on ribonucleotide reductases and other allosterically regulated enzymes.</p>

Additionally, some of the presentations of biochemical data could be improved to comply with standard best practices.</p>
<p>The work is impactful because it reports initial observations about a potentially new mode of allosteric inhibition in this enzyme class. It also sets the stage for future work to understand the molecular basis for this phenomenon in more detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the editor and reviewers for their positive evaluation of the potential impact of our work. We completely agree that hypotheses based on structural data require orthogonal experimental verification. However, the number and consistency of the cryo-EM structures speak in favour of the data being representative of conditions in solution. We feel that in particular cryo-EM data should be relatively free of artefacts, e.g. biased or incorrect relative domain orientations, compared to crystallography, where crystal packing effects can affect these parameters. As we write in response to Reviewer #2, it has been difficult to propose a direct structural mechanism for transmission of the allosteric signal from the a-site in the ATP-cone to the active site and GRD given that the ATP-cones and linker are disordered in the dATP-bound dimers and only partly ordered in the dATP-bound tetramers. Further verification experiments will be performed in future but are outside the scope of the present article.</p>
<p>We will improve the presentation of the biochemical data in a revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>General comments:</p>
<p>(1) It would be ideal to perform an additional experiment of some type to confirm the orderdisorder phenomena observed in the cryo-EM structures to rule out the possibility that it is an artifact of the structure determination approach. Circular dichroism might be a possibility?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Circular dichroism reports only on the approximate relative proportions of helix, sheet and loop structure in a protein, thus we believe that it would not be a sensitive enough tool to distinguish between ordered and disordered states. We are considering what alternative methods might be appropriate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Does the disordering phenomenon of one subunit in the ATP-bound structures have any significance - could it be related to half-of-sites activity? Does this RNR exhibit half-of-sites activity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Half-of-sites activity has not been biochemically proven in any ribonucleotide reductase in spite of the fact that it was first suggested in 1987 (PMID: 3298261). However, strong structural indication was recently published in the form of the holo-complex of the class Ia ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli, which is highly asymmetrical and in which productive contacts forming an intact proton-coupled electron transfer pathway are only formed between one of two pairs of monomers (PMID: 32217749). We have not been able to prove half-of-sites activity for PcNrdD due to low overall radical content, but the structural results are indeed consistent with such an activity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Does the disordering of the GRD with dATP bound have any long-term impact on the stability of the Gly radical? I realize that the authors tested the ability to form the Gly radical in the presence of dATP in Fig. 4 of the manuscript. But it looks like they only analyzed the samples after 20 min of incubation. Were longer time points analyzed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Radical content was measured after 5 min and 20 min incubation; 5 min incubations (not included in the manuscript) consistently gave higher radical content compared to 20 min incubation. Longer time points were not analysed, as we assumed that the radical content would be even lower after 20 min.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Did the authors establish whether the effect of dATP inhibition on substrate binding is reversible? If dATP is removed, can substrates rebind?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting question. We measured KDs for dATP in the micromolar range and are hence confident that dATP binding is reversible. Our measurements do not, however, directly prove that inhibition of the enzyme is reversible. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the protein as purified was precipitated and analysed by the UV-visible spectrum. The aspurified PcNrdD contained 30% nucleotide contamination. The as-purified sample was then analysed by HPLC and we identified a major peak, corresponding to dATP/dADP. Therefore, purification conditions had to be optimised to remove the nucleotides. This is evidence that PcNrdD that has “seen” dATP can subsequently bind substrates in the presence of ATP. We will describe the purification more clearly in a revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In some figures (Fig. 6e, for example), the cryo-EM density map for the nucleotide component of the model is not continuous over the entire molecule. Can the authors comment on the significance of this phenomenon? Were the ligands validated in any way to ensure that the assignments were made correctly?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed we sometimes saw discontinuous density for the nucleotides, both in the active site and in the specificity site. However, the break was almost always near the C5’ carbon atom, which is common to all nucleotides. While we cannot readily explain this phenomenon, the nucleotides refined well with full occupancy, giving B-factors similar to those of the surrounding protein atoms. The identity of the nucleotide could always be inferred from a) the size of the base (purine or pyrimidine); b) the known nucleotide combinations added to the protein before grid preparation; c) prior knowledge on the combinations of effector and substrate that have been found valid for all RNRs since the first studies of allosteric specificity regulation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript describes the functional and structural characterization of an anaerobic
(Class III) ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) with an ATP cone domain from Prevotella copri (PcNrdD). Most significantly, the cryo-EM structural characterization revealed the presence of a flap domain that connects the ATP cone domain and the active site and provides structural insights about how nucleotides and deoxynucleotides bind to this enzyme. The authors also demonstrated the catalytic functions and the oligomeric states. However, many of the biochemical characterizations are incomplete, and it is difficult to make mechanistic conclusions from the reported structures. The reported nucleotide-binding constants may not be accurate because of the design of the assays, which complicates the interpretation of the effects of ATP and dATP on PcNrdD oligomeric states. Importantly, statistical information was missing in most of the biochemical data. Also, while the authors concluded that the dATP binding makes the GRD flexible based on the absence of cryo-EM density for GRD in the dATP-bound PcNrdD, no other supports were provided. There was also a concern about the relevance of the proposed GRD flexibility and the stability of Gly radical. Overall, the manuscript provides structural insights about Class III RNR with ATP cone domain and how it binds ATP and dATP allosteric effectors. However, ambiguity remains about the molecular mechanism by which the dATP binding to the ATP cone domain inhibits the Class III RNR activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript reports the first near-atomic resolution of the structures of Class III RNR with ATP domain in complex with ATP and dATP. These structures revealed the NxN flap domain proposed to form an interaction network between the substrate, the linker to the ATP cone domain, the GRD, and loop 2 important for substrate specificity. The structures also provided insights into how ATP and dATP bind to the ATP cone domain of Class III RNR. Also, the structures suggested that the ATP cone domain is directly involved in the tetramer formation by forming an interaction with the core domain in the presence of dATP. These observations serve as an important basis for future study on the mechanism of Allosteric regulation of Class III RNR.</p>
<p>(2) The authors used a wide range of methodologies including activity assays, nucleotide binding assays, oligomeric state determination, and cryo-EM structural characterization, which were impressive and necessary to understand the complex allosteric regulation of RNR.</p>
<p>(3) The activity assays demonstrated the catalytic function of PcNrdD and its ability to be activated by ATP and low-concentration dATP and inhibited by high-concentration dATP.</p>
<p>(4) ITC and MST were used to show the ability of PcNrdD to bind NTP and dATP.</p>
<p>(5) GEMMA was used successfully to determine the oligomeric state of PcNrdD, which suggested that PcNrdD exists in dimeric and tetrameric forms, whose ratio is affected by ATP and/or dATP.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Activity assays.</p>
<p>The activity assays were performed under conditions that may not represent the nucleotide reduction activity. The authors initiated the Gly radical formation and nucleotide reduction simultaneously. The authors also showed that the amount of Gly radical formation was different in the presence of ATP vs dATP. Therefore, it is possible that the observed Vmax is affected by the amount of Gly radical. In fact, some of the data fit poorly into the kinetic model. Also, the number of biological and technical replicates was not described, and no statistical information was provided for the curve fitting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The highest turnover activity of PcNrdD measured in presence of ATP was 1.3 s-1 (470 nmol/min/mg), a kcat comparable to recently reported values for anaerobic and aerobic RNRs from Neisseria bacilliformis, Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis, Facklamia ignava, Thermus virus P74-23, and Aquifex aeolicus (PMID: 25157154, PMID: 29388911, PMID: 30166338, PMID: 34314684, PMID: 34941255). The general trend illustrated in Figure 1 is that ATP has an activating effect on enzyme activity, whereas high concentrations of dATP have an inactivating effect on activity, which cannot be explained by suboptimal assay conditions since our EPR results consistently show that more radical is formed in incubations with dATP compared to incubations with ATP. Curve fitting methods used are listed in Materials and Methods (as specified in the Figure 1 legend), and standard errors for all specified curve fitting results (from triplicate experiments) are shown in Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Binding assays.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the binding assays is complicated by the fact that dATP binds both a- and s-sites and ATP binds a- and active sites. dATP may also bind the active site as the product. It is unknown if ATP binds s-site in PcNrdD. Despite this complexity, the binding assays were performed under the condition that all the binding sites were available.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not clear which event these assays are reporting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Both ITC and MST experiments involving ATP and dATP binding to the a-site were performed in the presence of at least 1 mM GTP substrate (5 mM in MST) to fill the active site, and 1 mM dTTP effector to fill the s-site (specified in the legend to Figure 2). These conditions enable binding of ATP or dATP only to the a-site in the ATP-cone.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Oligomeric states.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to the ambiguity in the kinetic parameters and the binding constants determined above, the effects of ATP and dATP on the oligomeric states are difficult to interpret. The concentrations of ATP used in these experiments (50 and 100 uM) were significantly lower than KL determined by the activity assays (780 uM), while it is close to the Kd values determined by ITC or MST (~25 uM). Since it is unclear what binding events ITC and MST are reporting, the data in Figure 3 does not provide support for the claimed effects of ATP binding. For the effects of dATP, the authors did not observe a significant difference in oligomeric states between 50 or 100 uM dATP alone vs 50 uM dATP and 100 uM CTP. The former condition has dATP ~ 2x higher than the Kd and KL (Figure 1b) and therefore could be considered as &quot;inhibited&quot;. On the other hand, NrdD should be fully active under the latter condition. Therefore, these observations show no correlation between the oligomeric state and the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The results in Figure 3 show that at in presence of 100 µM ATP plus 100 µM CTP the oligomeric equilibrium is 64% dimers plus 36% tetramers, and in presence of 50-100 µM dATP the oligomeric equilibrium is 32% dimers and 68% tetramers. We agree that there is no clear and strong correlation between oligomeric state and inhibition. We will also try to make it clearer in a revised version. Meanwhile, in order to add some clarity to our observations, SEC experiments at higher nucleotide concentrations will be done to strengthen our observations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Effects of dATP binding on GRD structure</p>
<p>One of the key conclusions of this manuscript is that dATP binding induces the dissociation of GRD from the active site. However, the structures did not provide an explanation for how the dATP binding affects the conformation of GRD or whether the dissociation of GRD is a direct consequence of dATP binding or it is due to the absence of nucleotide substrate. Also, Gly radical is unlikely to be stable when it is not protected from the bulk solvent. Therefore, it is unlikely that the GRD dissociates from the active site unless the inhibition by dATP is irreversible. Further evidence is needed to support the proposed mechanism of inhibition by dATP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We admit that it has been difficult to propose a direct structural mechanism for transmission of the allosteric signal from the a-site in the ATP-cone to the active site and GRD given that the ATP-cones and linker are disordered in the dATP-bound dimers and that the linker can only be partly modelled in the dATP-bound tetramers. Most likely dATP binding causes a change in the dynamics of the linker region and NxN flap that directly affects substrate binding and simultaneously causes disorder of the GRD, given that all are part of a
connected system (described as “nexus” in the manuscript). The structures determined in the presence of dATP and CTP show that CTP cannot bind in the absence of an ordered NxN flap.</p>
<p>In any case a major conclusion of the work is that dATP does not inhibit the anaerobic RNR by prevention of glycyl radical formation but by prevention of its subsequent transfer. We agree that further evidence is required to support the proposed mechanism, but given the extent of the data already presented in the manuscript, we feel that such studies should be the subject of a future publication.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Functional support for the observed structures.</p>
<p>Evidence for connecting structural observations and mechanistic conclusions is largely missing. For example, the authors proposed that the interactions between the ATP cone domain and the core domain are responsible for tetramer formation. However, no biochemical evidence was provided to support this proposal. Similarly, the functional significance of the interaction through the NxN flap domain was not proved by mutagenesis experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did actually make mutants to verify the observed interactions, but several of them did not behave well in our hands, e.g. with regard to protein stability. Since we have no evidence that oligomerisation is coupled to inhibition, and since we did not observe any conservation between protein sequences in the interaction area, we chose not to pursue this point further. The main merit of the tetramer structures is that they allowed a high-resolution view of dATP binding to the ATP-cone and a comparison to previously-observed ATP-cones. Nevertheless, mutation experiments, also including the NxN flap, could be the subject of future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Bimai et al describes a structural and functional characterization of an anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme from the human microbe, P. copri. More specifically, the authors aimed to characterize the mechanism by how (d)ATP modulates nucleotide reduction in this anaerobic RNR, using a combination of enzyme kinetics, binding thermodynamics, and cryo-EM structural determination. One of the principal findings of this paper is the ordering of a NxN 'flap' in the presence of ATP that promotes RNR catalysis and the disordering of both this flap and the glycyl radical domain (GRD) when the inhibitory effector, dATP, binds. The latter is correlated with a loss of substrate binding, which is the likely mechanism for dATP inhibition. It is important to note that the GRD is remote (&gt;30 Ang) from the binding site of the dATP molecule, suggesting long-range communication of the structural (dis)ordering. The authors also present evidence for a shift in oligomerization in the presence of dATP. The work does provide evidence for new insights/views into the subtle differences of nucleotide modulation (allostery) of RNR through long-range interactions.</p>
<p>The strengths of the work are the impressive, in-depth structural analysis of the various regulated forms of PcRNR by (d)ATP using cryo-EM. The authors present seven different models in total, with striking differences in oligomerization and (dis)ordering of select structural features, including the GRD that is integral to catalysis. The authors present several, complementary biochemical experiments (ITC, MST, EPR, kinetics) aimed at resolving the binding and regulatory mechanism of the enzyme by various nucleotides. The authors present a good breadth of the literature in which the focus of allosteric regulation of RNRs has been on the aerobic orthologues.</p>
<p>Given the resolution of some of the structures in the remote regions that appear to be of importance, the rigor of the work could have been improved by complementing this experimental studies with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal the dynamics of the GRD and loops/flaps at the active site.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have discussed with expert colleagues the possibility of carrying out MD simulations on the different states in order to study the differential effects of ATP and dATP binding on the dynamics of the GRD. However, they felt that the chance of obtaining meaningful results was low, particularly since some structural elements are missing from the models for both forms, in particular the linker between the ATP-cone and the core.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The biochemical data supporting the loss of substrate binding with dATP association is compelling, but the binding studies of the (d)ATP regulatory molecules are not; the authors noted less-than-unity binding stoichiometries for the effectors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Most of the methods used measure only binding strength, not the number of binding sites (N), whereas ITC also measures number of sites. N is dependent on the integrity of the protein, i.e. the number of protein molecules in a preparation that are involved in binding, and quite often gives lower values than the theoretical number of binding sites.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, the work would benefit from additional support for oligomerization changes using an additional biochemical/biophysical approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>SEC (chromatography), GEMMA (mass spectrometry) and cryo-EM were used to study oligomerization. Since each method has restrictions on nucleotide concentrations as well as protein concentrations that can be used, the results are not directly comparable, but all three methods indicate nucleotide dependent oligomerization changes. The SEC results will be included in a revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, the authors have mostly achieved their overall aims of the manuscript. With focused modifications, including additional control experiments, the manuscript should be a welcomed addition to the RNR field</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Since the 2-fold axis of the dimer is vertical, the GRD of the left-hand monomer is hidden from view at the back of the molecule in Figure 6. For this monomer there was a small amount of density that allowed modelling of part of the glycyl radical loop (though not the tip containing the radical Gly itself) and the NxN flap, albeit with significantly higher mobility. We have illustrated this through an additional supplement for Figure 6 (figure supplement 2) in which the B-factors of the residues are shown both as a ribbon with radius proportional to the B-factor and through colouring. We hope that the four views in Figure 6 (figure supplement 2) together illustrate the relative mobility of different parts of the dimer.</p>

<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added a fifth supplement to Figure 8 in which we show the cryo-EM reconstruction for the dATP-bound dimer in two orientations, with the ATP-CTP-bound structure superimposed, which clearly shows that the entire GRD, the ATPcones, linker and NxN flap are all disordered in both monomers.</p>

<p>(4) Design of the activity assays</p>
<p>It is not clear if the activity assays report the rate of glycyl radical formation or nucleotide reduction. The authors mixed NrdD and NrdG and initiated the reaction by adding formate (essential for nucleotide reduction) and dithionite (Gly radical formation). The Gly radical formation is slow (in min time scale). The authors reported that ATP/dATP affected the rate of Gly radical formation and in the presence of ATP, Gly radical formation was incomplete even after 20 min. Therefore, it is possible that within the timescale of the activity assays (5 min), the reactions could be partially limited by the Gly radical formation, which may be the reason for the poor curve fitting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Activity assays were performed with 5 min pre-incubation without dithionite and formate (no glycyl radical formation) and 10 min incubation after addition of dithionite and formate (glycyl radical formation plus substrate reduction). During earlier tests, NrdD and NrdG were first preincubated in the presence of dithionite (glycyl radical formation) and after addition of formate the substrate reduction was monitored during 20 min. These experiments resulted in lower enzyme activity, whereas higher activity was achieved only upon formate addition to the preincubation reaction. We suppose that the presence of dithionite, which is a strong reducing agent, affected NrdD stability and the reaction was stabilised by the presence of formate at an earlier stage of the reaction. For the EPR conditions used in the paper, 5 min incubation gave higher radical content compared to 20 min, and the reported activity assay gave highest activity after 10 min incubation; kcat of 1.3 s-1.</p>

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>There is a significant ambiguity remaining about the binding event that the ITC and MST results are reporting.

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>MST and ITC were performed in presence of substrate (1 mM GTP) and s-site effector (1 mM dTTP in ITC experiments, and 5 mM dTTP in MST experiments), thus dATP is blocked from binding to the s-site and ATP from binding to the active site.</p>

<p>MST, ITC and enzyme assays were all performed in the presence of substrate, and enzyme assays also contained NrdG, which was not present in the MST and ITC analyses. While KD is a thermodynamic constant representing the affinity of ligand to its binding site - in our case an effector nucleotide to the ATP-cone, KL is a kinetic constant (the allosteric effector concentration that gives half maximal activity) representing the relationship between the effector concentration and the reaction speed and is affected by the enzyme turnover number (kcat). The relationship between KD, KL and Ki is further complicated by conformational and possibly oligomeric state changes of NrdD upon binding of allosteric effectors, which occurs on a slower time scale than the rapid exchange of nucleotides in allosteric sites.</p>

<p>(10) GRD structure with dATP</p>
<p>The disorder of GRD in the presence of dATP does not agree with the formation of Gly radical under the same conditions. Gly radical is unlikely stable if it is extensively exposed to solvent. Most likely, the observed cryo-EM structures represent the conformation irrelevant to Gly radical formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the glycyl radical is unlikely to be stable if exposed to solvent. We believe that the GRD is not completely disordered but most likely made more mobile through rigid body movements of the domain to an extent that makes it invisible in the cryo-EM maps. It is most likely still in the vicinity of the active site, shielding the glycyl radical. Our new HDX-MS results show a small but tangible increase in mobility of the GRD in the presence of dATP compared to ATP. Of course the differences in dynamics remain to be confirmed. It is worth noting that the group of Catherine Drennan at MIT published a conference abstract more than a year ago that suggested a similar pattern of ordered/dynamic GRDs, based on crystal structures, though the details have not yet been published (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R3407">https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R3407</ext-link>).</p>
<p>We also agree that the cryo-EM structures do not show the GRD conformation relevant to Gly radical formation, as this has been shown spectroscopically for the GRE pyruvate formate lyase to require large conformational changes in the GRD and also the presence of the activase. However, revealing this conformation would be a completely different project. We postulate that inactivation proceeds by prevention of radical transfer to the substrate, not by prevention of its formation.</p>
<p>We have altered the wording in several places in the revised manuscript, including the title, to avoid using the term “disorder”, as this may imply (partial) unfolding, and we certainly do not wish to imply that.</p>

<p>(12) Conclusion about the disordered GRD.</p>
<p>-The authors should describe the reason why the dATP binding affected the structure of GRD. The authors did not discuss why dATP binding affected the folding or mobility of GRD. Since this is the key conclusion of this manuscript and the authors are making this conclusion based on the absence of the ordered GRD structure (hence the negative results), the authors should carefully describe why the dATP binding does not allow the binding/folding of GRD in the position observed in the ATP-bound structure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in our response to point 4 in this reviewer’s Public Review, it is difficult to propose a direct structural mechanism for transmission of the allosteric signal from the a-site in the ATP-cone to the active site and GRD given that the ATP-cones and linker are disordered in the dATP-bound dimers and that the linker cannot be completely modelled even in the dATP-bound tetramers. Our first hypotheses were that the ATP-cone might work by a steric occlusion mechanism, but the reality appears more complex. Most likely dATP binding causes a change in the dynamics of the linker region and NxN flap that directly affects substrate binding and simultaneously causes higher mobility of the GRD, given that all are part of a connected system. The structures determined in the presence of dATP and CTP show that CTP cannot bind in the absence of an ordered NxN flap. We hope that future structural studies of NrdDs from other organisms may shed further light on this mechanism.</p>

<p>Similar to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM is a highly selective method that requires the selection of particles that can be analyzed with sufficient resolution.

However, the authors did not perform such functional characterizations and made conclusions purely based on the structural observations.</p>

<p>Overall, the work presents an impressive and in-depth structural view of the conformational changes stemming from the interactions of (d)ATP allosteric effector molecules that are interrelated to RNR function. The manuscript is written clearly and provides a solid overview of RNR chemistry. The cryo-EM data show striking differences between ATP and dATP bound forms, though in select regions, the resolution is not good enough for strong interpretations of the finer details.</p>
<p>(1) In cryo-EM structures, dATP appears to shift the oligomerization equilibrium from nearly all dimeric forms (absence of dATP) to a mixture of both dimeric and tetrameric species (presence of dATP). The examination of the oligomeric composition in solution using the GEMMA - a mass spectral technique - showed somewhat similar trends, though given the magnitude of the differences, it was less compelling. Have the authors considered a complementary solution technique, such as analytical SEC or dynamic light scattering that could provide further support for the change in oligomerization as observed in the cryo-EM?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>SEC analysis with 2 µM apoPcNrdD and higher nucleotide concentrations (1 mM) was performed, confirming the presence of both dimer and tetramer in solution at different ratios depending on the addition of ATP or dATP. The SEC analysis, included as Figure 3 - figure supplement 1, confirms the existence of an equilibrium in solution.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The protein as isolated from the final SEC shows a predominant peak corresponding to aggregate protein. It would be helpful if the authors ran an analytical SEC on the protein sample that is more refined to see how much soluble dimer/tetramer vs. aggregate protein there is. This could impact the kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of effector interactions. Further, the second major peak is labeled as 'monomer'. Is the protein isolated as a monomer and then forms dimer upon effector binding? It is unclear. The authors should consider presenting the SEC standards for the given column and buffer condition so that a reasonable estimate of the oligomerization status of the isolated protein can be assigned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Can the reviewer possibly have believed that Figure 1 - supplementary figure 2a shows PcNrdD rather than PcNrdG? The figure supplement corresponds to the as-isolated SEC analysis of the activase (PcNrdG), which shows the presence of two main peaks of aggregates and monomer. The monomeric peak was reinjected and showed no presence of further aggregation states. Currently it is not known which oligomeric state the activase harbours upon binding to PcNrdD and glycyl radical formation. None of the other SEC figures in the MS has any predominant peak corresponding to aggregated protein.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) More details are needed for the ITC section. The ITC methods are not clear. What is the exact composition of the ligand solution being titrated into the protein solution? It is unclear how the less-than-unity binding stoichiometry was determined and what it means. Is the n value for the monomer, dimer, or tetramer forms? It is concerning that n &lt; 1 is observed for dATP binding in the ITC whereas there are 3 dATP bound/subunit in the cryo-EM. For completeness, titration of a buffer into protein solution (no ligand) should be conducted and presented to demonstrate that the heats produced in Figure 2 correspond to the ligand only (and not a buffer mismatch).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>ITC experiments were performed in the presence of 1 mM GTP (c-site) and 1 mM dTTP (ssite). Unlike other parameters in ITC analyses, the N value is usually the least accurate of all fitted parameters and strongly depends on the concentration of the active protein in the sample. N values described in the current study are in the same range as values reported for ATP-cones in other RNRs and NrdR (Rozman Grinberg &amp; al 2018a, 2018b, 2022 McKethan and Spiro 2013). The results most likely reflect two high-affinity binding sites for dATP and one high affinity binding site for ATP. Different nucleotide concentrations were used in the cryoEM and ITC experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is intriguing that the binding of dATP doesn't quell the glycyl radical. In fact, it appears that, as the authors suggest, the amount of glycyl radical might be increased in these samples. However, the cryo-EM data indicates that the GRD is disordered. It is unclear how these would be correlated, as one would not expect a disordered structural element to maintain such a potent oxidant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As already written above, we do not wish to imply that the GRD is completely or even highly disordered, just that its dynamics increase in the presence of dATP. Otherwise we completely agree that a very exposed Gly radical is incompatible with its stability. It could be that the amount of disorder is exaggerated somewhat by the vitrification process in cryo-EM. We have tried to reword some of the text to emphasise higher mobility rather than disorder.</p>
<p>It has been difficult to propose a direct structural mechanism for transmission of the allosteric signal from the a-site in the ATP-cone to the active site and GRD given that the ATP-cones and linker are disordered in the dATP-bound dimers and that the linker can not be completely modelled even in the dATP-bound tetramers. We initially thought that a steric occlusion mechanism might be at play, but the reality appears more complex. Most likely dATP binding causes a change in the dynamics of the linker region and NxN flap that directly affects substrate binding and simultaneously causes higher mobility of the GRD, given that all are part of a connected system. The structures determined in the presence of dATP and CTP show that CTP cannot bind in the absence of an ordered NxN flap. We hope that future structural studies of NrdDs from other organisms may shed further light on this mechanism.</p>

<p>(1) There are some conflicting reports as to whether P. copri is considered a human 'pathogen'. According to Yeoh, et al Scientific Reports 2022, P. copri is one of the predominant microbes in the human gut and is linked to a positive impact on metabolism. Perhaps the addition of a citation that provides support for it as a pathogen would clarify the statement on p. 3.</p>

<p>We have added a recent reference (Nii T, Maeda Y, Motooka D, et al. (2023) Genomic repertoires linked with pathogenic potency of arthritogenic Prevotella copri isolated from the gut of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Ann Rheum Dis 82: 621-629. doi:
10.1136/annrheumdis-2022-222881).</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 3, the number of dimers/tetramers for dATP (100 uM) does not add up to 100.</p>
<p>What is the other 2%?</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing this out - it has been corrected.</p>

<p>(3) The data in Figures 5C and D do show slight changes that could be fit and interpreted as a 'weak' interaction. Thus, the statement on p 9 &quot;where dATP-loaded PcNrdD could bind neither GTP nor CTP&quot; should be changed to indicate that the interactions are weak (or that the nucleotides weakly associate).</p>

<p>The text and the figure have been changed according to the reviewer’s suggestion.</p>
