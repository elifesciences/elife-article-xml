<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bathymodioline mussels dominate deep-sea methane seep and hydrothermal vent habitats and obtain nutrients and energy primarily through chemosynthetic endosymbiotic bacteria in the bacteriocytes of their gill. However, the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate mussel host-symbiont interactions remain unclear. Here, we constructed a comprehensive cell atlas of the gill in the mussel <italic>Gigantidas platifrons</italic> from the South China Sea methane seeps (1100m depth) using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation. We identified 13 types of cells, including three previously unknown ones, and uncovered unknown tissue heterogeneity. Every cell type has a designated function in supporting the gill’s structure and function, creating an optimal environment for chemosynthesis, and effectively acquiring nutrients from the endosymbiotic bacteria. Analysis of snRNA-seq of <italic>in situ</italic> transplanted mussels clearly showed the shifts in cell state in response to environmental oscillations. Our findings provide insight into principles of host-symbiont interaction and the bivalves’ environmental adaption mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mutualistic interactions between multicellular animals and their microbiota play a fundamental role in animals’ adaptation, ecology, and evolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. By associating with symbionts, host animals benefit from the metabolic capabilities of their symbionts and gain fitness advantages that allow them to thrive in habitats they could not live in on their own<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Prime examples of such symbioses are bathymodioline mussels and gammaproteobacteria endosymbionts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The bathymodioline mussels occur worldwide at deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems, such as cold-seeps, hydrothermal vents, and whale falls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The host mussel acquired sulfur-oxidising (SOX) and/or methane-oxidising (MOX) symbiont through horizontal transmission at their early life stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Their symbionts, which are hosted in a specialised gill epithelial cell, namely, the bacteriocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, utilise the chemical energy from the reduced chemical compounds such as CH and H<sub>2</sub>S released from cold seeps or hydrothermal vents to fix carbon and turn into carbon source for the host mussel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The ecological success of the bathymodioline symbioses is apparent: the bathymodiolin mussels are often among the most dominant species in the deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, it is critical to know how the bathymodioline mussels interact with the symbionts and maintain the stability and efficiency of the symbiosis.</p>
<p>The gill structure of bathymodiolin mussels has undergone remarkable adaptations at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels to support their deep-sea chemosynthetic lifestyle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Compared to shallow water mussels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, the gill filaments of bathymodiolin mussels have enlarged surfaces allowing them to hold more symbionts per filament (Supplementary Fig. S1). This adaption requires not only novel cellular and molecular mechanisms to maintain and support the enlarged gill filament structure, but also a strong ciliary ventilation system to pump vent/seep fluid to fuel the symbiotic bacteria. Previous studies based on whole-genome sequencing and bulk RNA-seq projects have shown that genes in the categories of nutrient transporters, lysosomal proteins, and immune receptors are either expanded in the host mussel’s genome or up-regulated in the gill<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, suggesting that these genes involved in host-symbiont interaction. Though providing deep molecular insights, these studies mainly used homogenised tissues that average genes’ expression levels amongst different cell types and eliminate cell and gene spatial distribution information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In addition, the broad expression and function of potentially ‘symbiosis-related’ proteins also greatly limited data interpretation. Therefore, a systemic atlas of gill cell types and the descriptions of cell-type-specific gene expressional profiles are warranted to a better understanding of the host-symbiont interaction and environmental adaptation mechanisms of the bathymodioline symbiosis.</p>
<p>In recent years, single cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing (sc/sn RNA-seq) technologies have become one of the preferred methods for investigating the composition of complex tissue at the transcriptional level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. snRNA-seq has several advantages, such as compatibility with frozen samples, elimination of dissociation-induced transcriptional stress responses, and reduced dissociation bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. These advantages are significant for deep-sea and other ecological studies because cell and molecular biology facilities are not available in the field. To examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the environmental adaptations and host-symbiont interactions in bathymodioline mussels, we conducted a single nucleus RNA-sequencing-based transcriptomic study. We analysed the gill symbiosis in the dominate deep-sea mussels inhabiting the F-site cold-seep <italic>Gigantidas platifrons</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, which hosts a single a MOX endosymbiont population that consist of only one 16S rRNA phylotype. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for environmental adaptation mechanisms study in non-traditional but ecologically important organisms with single-nucleus RNA-sequencing technologies.</p>

<p>We conducted a <italic>G. platifrons</italic> deep-sea <italic>in situ</italic> transplant experiment at the “F-Site” Cold-seep (∼1117 m depth) and retrieved three groups of samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), as follows: the ‘Fanmao’ (meaning prosperous) group, which comprised the mussels collected from methane-rich (∼40 μM) site of the cold-seep, where the animals thrived; the ‘starvation’ group, which comprised the mussels collected from the methane-rich site and then moved to a methane-limited (∼0.054 μM) starvation site for 14 days before retrieval; and the ‘reconstitution’ group, which comprised the methane-rich site mussels moved to the ‘Starvation’ site for 11 days and then moved back to the methane-rich site for another 3 days.</p>

<label>2.</label><title>Cell atlas of G. platifrons gill</title>
<p>To unravel the intricate cellular composition, we utilised a reciprocal PCA (RPCA) strategy to project cells in the three samples onto the same space based on conserved expressed genes among them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. This strategy maximises the number of cells per cluster regardless of the organism’s state and therefore maximises genes per cluster<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Through the implementation of Seurat, we revealed 14 cell clusters, each was associated with a set of marker genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1B-D</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Given the limited availability of canonical marker genes for <italic>G. platifrons</italic> and molluscs in general, we undertook a meticulous approach to characterize each cell cluster. This involved: 1) examining the cluster marker genes’ functions, 2) identifying the expression pattern of cluster marker gene using whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (WISH) and/or double-fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (FISH) analyses, and 3) conducting scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. We successfully identified and characterized 13 of the 14 cell clusters, which could be categorized into four major groups, including 1) the supportive cells, 2) the ciliary cells, 3) the proliferation cells, and 4) the bacteriocytes. One cell cluster remained ambiguous. To assess the robustness of each cell cluster, we employed a bootstrap sampling and clustering algorithm examining the similarity among clusters and obtained strong support for all clusters through a combined analysis of the three samples (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Furthermore, when examining each sample individually, we found that the majority of clusters demonstrated robust support, with the exception of the three ciliary cell clusters, which showed overlaps of assignment probabilities among them (Supplementary Fig. S2 B-D). These three cell types are derived from a same precursor, and exhibited relatively lower numbers of nuclei, resulting in a reduced availability of genes per cell type, which is particularly true for the food grove ciliary cell (Supplementary Table S1). By integrating the spatial and functional annotations of these cell clusters, we gained insight into their collective efforts in supporting the symbiotic relationship and maintaining the high-efficiency chemosynthetic system within the gill tissue.</p>

<title>Supportive cells</title>
<p>We have identified four supportive cell types, namely, inter lamina cells basal membrane cells (BMC)1, BMC2, and mucus cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2A, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The inter lamina cells, marked by high expression of fibrillar-forming collagens, were the cells located between the two layers of basal membranes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D and E</xref>). These cells were previously identified as amoeboid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and their function has not been explored. The inter lamina cells were densely distributed around the food groove and at the rim of the gill filament. While on the middle part of the gill filament, the inter lamina cells distributed in parallel rows. It might help to connect the two sheets of basal membranes and maintain the spatial integrity of the gill filament. In addition, we observed the enrichment of ribosomal proteins involved in protein synthesis (Supplementary Table S2), indicating a high metabolic rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> of inter lamina cells. This implies that the inter lamina cells may process the nutrients acquired from the symbiont.</p>
<p>We have also identified two types of BMC populations which have not been recognised before. The BMC1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F and G</xref>) expressed genes encoding extracellular matrix and adhesive proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Supplementary Table S2), such as SCO-spondin (Bpl_scaf_27638-4.18), Zonadhesin (Bpl_scaf_1371-2.4), Cartilage matrix proteins (Bpl_scaf_16371-0.14 and Bpl_scaf_3387-5.47), and Collagen alpha-1(XXI) chain protein (Bpl_scaf_51350-0.19). BMC2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H and I</xref>) was distinctive from BMC1 in the context of expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) and marker genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Genes encoding hemicentins (Bpl_scaf_38731-0.50 and Bpl_scaf_7293-0.14), which are known to stabilise the cells’ contact with the basal membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, were highly expressed in BMC2. Thus, these two cell types are likely to help building the basal lamina, and stabilising the epithelial-derived cells, such as bacteriocytes and intercalary cells, on the surface of the basal membrane.</p>
<p>Mucus cells are specialised secretory cells with intracellular mucus vacuoles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In shallow-water filter-feeding bivalves, mucus cells secret mucus, which cooperates with the ciliary ventilation system to capture, process, and transport food particles to their mouths, known as filter feeding mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Deep-sea mussels may not necessarily retain this function since they do not normally acquire food resources such as phytoplankton and planktonic bacteria but obtain most of nutrient through their chemosynthetic symbiont. Thus, it was hypothesised that mucus cells are involved in other biological functions such as immune responses to pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Herein, genes encoding proteins with microbe-binding functionalities were enriched in mucus cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Supplementary Table S2), such as C-type lectins (Bpl_scaf_58694-0.22 and Bpl_scaf_38133-0.8), C1q domain-containing protein (Bpl_scaf_55216-2.11), and Fibrinogen C domain-containing protein (Bpl_scaf_18519-2.15)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The expression of similar immune genes was upregulated in a shallow water mussel <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> when challenged by a pathogenic bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Our WISH and double-FISH analyses showed that mucus cells were embedded within the outer rim cilia and scattered on the gill lamella alongside the bacteriocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2J</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2K</xref>). These data collectively suggest that mucus cells may help mussel maintain the immune homeostasis of gill. Interestingly, WISH and double-FISH analyses showed that mucus cells were also distributed alongside the gill lamella’s food groove and the inner edge, where the density of bacteriocytes is low (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>). Because the food groove is the main entry of food practical to the labial palps and mouth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, this distribution pattern implies that mucus cells may be also involved in capturing planktonic bacteria and sending them to the mouth.</p>

<title>Ciliary and smooth muscle cells</title>
<p>A remarkable feature of bathymodioline mussel’s gill is its ciliary ventilation system, which constantly agitates the water and provides the symbiont with the necessary gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We identified four types of ciliary cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>): apical ridge ciliary cells (ARCCs), food groove ciliary cells (FGCCs), lateral ciliary cells (LCCs), and intercalary cells (ICs), as well as a newly identified type of smooth muscle cells. All ciliary cells were marked by canonical cilium genes, such as genes encoding flagellar proteins, ciliary motor kinesin proteins, ciliary dynein proteins, and ciliary microtubules and were clearly distinguishable by specifically expressed genes (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig. S3). ARCCs were characterized by expression of Tubulin alpha-1A chain Bpl_3489-0.37 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) and Bpl_scaf_20631-1.16, which encodes homeobox Dlx6a-like protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) which is a marker of the apical ectodermal ridge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. FGCCs, which could be ladled by expression of marker gene Bpl_scaf_5544-0.0 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>), expressed genes encoding primary cilia development regulator Tubby-related protein 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> (Bpl_scaf_24834-2.3) and primary ciliary cell structural protein TOG array regulator of axonemal microtubules protein 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (Bpl_scaf_55620-1.3), suggesting the FGCCs are the sensory ciliary cells that gather information from the surrounding environment. Both ARCCs and FGCCs were located around the ventral tip of the gill filament (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). LCCs were distributed as two parallel rows along the gill lamella’s outer rim and ciliary disks’ outer rim (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3G</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>) and had highly expressed genes involved in cilium structure, cilium movement and ATP synthases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> and Supplementary Table S3), indicating that LCCs may have a strong ability to beat their cilia. Interestingly, we identified a group of previously unreported smooth muscle cells (SMCs) co-localised with the LCCs as showed by WISH (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref> and Supplementary Fig. S4). SMCs strongly expressed several Low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL receptor) and LDLR-associated proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In addition, these cells also expressed the angiotensin-converting enzyme-like protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> (Bpl_scaf-29477-5.10) and the ‘molecular spring’ titin-like protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> (Bpl_scaf_56354-7.8) (Supplementary Table S3). The expression of these genes could be commonly found in human vascular smooth muscle cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Collectively, we suspect that SMCs are involved in lateral cilium movement and the gill slice contraction.</p>

<title>Proliferation cells</title>
<p>It has long been known that the bathymodioline mussel gill has three types of proliferation cells that are conserved throughout all filibranchia bivalves: the budding zone at the posterior end of the gill where new gill filaments are continuously formed, and the dorsal and ventral ends of each gill filaments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. These “cambial-zone”-like cell populations could continuously proliferate throughout the whole life span of the mussel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Our snRNA-seq data recognised three types of proliferation cells, which is consistent with previous findings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and Supplementary Table S4). The gill posterior end budding zone cells (PEBZCs) are located on the first few freshly proliferated filaments of the posterior tip of gill (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). The PBEZCs marker (Bpl_scaf_61993-0.4) gradually disappeared at around the 11th −12th row of the gill filament (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), suggesting the maturation of the gill filaments, which is similar to the developmental pattern reported in another deep-sea mussel <italic>Bathymodiolus azoricus</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. The dorsal end proliferation cells (DEPCs), which expressed the hallmarks genes of muscular tissue (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), as well as cell proliferation and differentiation regulators, were the proliferation cells in connective tissue at the dorsal end of the gill slice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, 4E</xref>). The ventral end proliferation cells (VEPCs) were two symmetrical triangle-shaped cell clusters of small symbiont-free cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). In VEPCs, genes encoding ribosomal proteins, chromatin proteins, RNA and DNA binding proteins, and cell proliferation markers were all up-regulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and Supplementary Table S4), indicating that VEPCs are meristem-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>It has been hypothesised that new proliferation cells will be colonised by symbionts, serving as the vital mechanism of bacteriocyte recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. We then determined which proliferation cell type gives rise to the mature cells, especially the bacteriocytes, which has little available information regarding their precursor and transmission mode in bathymodioline mussels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Slingshot trajectory analysis suggested that the PEBZCs might be the origin of all gill epithelial cells, including the other two proliferation cells (VEPC and DEPC) and bacteriocytes (Supplementary Fig. S6). The sole exception was BMC2, which may be derived from VEPC rather than PEBZC. This result is consistent with previous studies which suggested new gill filaments of the filibranch mussels are formed in the gill’s posterior budding zones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. The colonisation by the symbiont might play a crucial role in determining the fate of the bacteriocytes. Noticeably, in <italic>G. platifrons</italic>, only the pillar-shaped first row of gill filament, comprised of small meristem-like cells, was symbiont-free (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4D and D</xref>’), whereas all the other gill filaments were colonised by symbionts. This pattern of symbiosis establishment is different from that of <italic>B. azoricus</italic>, in which PEBZCs are symbiont free and are gradually colonised by symbionts released from the bacteriocytes on the adjacent mature gill filaments after maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. On mature gill filaments, the DEPCs and VEPCs are seemingly the sources of new cells that sustain the growth of the gill filament from both dorsal and ventral directions, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Interestingly, comparable active ventral and dorsal end proliferation zones have also been identified in the symbiotic mussel <italic>B. azoricus</italic>, whereas they are absent in the shallow-water mussel <italic>Mytilus edulis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. This contrast further suggests the potential involvement of DEPCs and VEPCs in the establishment of symbiosis.</p>

<p>The gene expression profile of bacteriocytes aligned well with the morphological analysis, which suggested that the bacteriocytes have structural, metabolic, and regulatory adaptions to cope with the symbiont (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref> and 5I). It has been hypothesised that the bacteriocytes extract nutrients from the symbiont through two pathways: lysing the symbiont through the lysosome (the ‘farming’ pathway) or directly utilising the nutrient produced by the symbiont (the ‘milking’ pathway)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Our TEM observations clearly detected intracellular vacuole and lysosome system of the bacteriocyte that harbour, transport, and digest the symbionts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. The snRNA data showed bacteriocytes expressed cellular membrane synthesis enzyme (phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase, Bpl_scaf_15282-3.10) and a series of lysosomal proteins such as lysosomal proteases (cathepsins; Bpl_scaf_61711-5.12, Bpl_scaf_46838-6.40 and Bpl_scaf_59648-4.5; lysosomal alpha-glucosidase-like), protease regulators 56 (TMPRSS15 proteins; Bpl_scaf_52188-1.15 and Bpl_scaf_15410-0.9), and lysosomal traffic regulator proteins (rabenosyn-5, Bpl_scaf_54816-0.3 and Bpl_scaf_52809-1.6, lysosomal-trafficking regulator-like isoform X1). Among the proteases, cathepsins were thought to be evolutionary conserved molecular tools that host utilized to control the residence of their symbiont microbes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. They were also highly expressed in symbiotic tissue of other deep-sea chemosynthetic animals, such as vesicomyid clams and vestimen-tiferan tubeworms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Bacteriocytes also expressed genes encoding cellular vesicle transports (kinesins, Bpl_scaf_14819-0.11, Bpl_scaf_54265-1.13, and Bpl_scaf_4784-1.40)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, potential amino acid transporter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> (Bpl_scaf_36159-5.5), and genes involved in intracellular vesicle transport, such as the FYVE and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> (Bpl_scaf_33726-5.7). In addition to form and mobilise early endosomes, the protein products of these genes could transport symbiont-secreted nutrient vesicles to the host (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref> and Supplementary Table S5), supporting the “milking” pathway.</p>
<p>The symbiont of <italic>G. platifrons</italic> belongs to type I methanotrophy, of which the core metabolic function is linked with the development of intracytoplasmic membranes leading to a high lipid/biomass content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Recent lipid biomarker analyses showed that the gill of <italic>G. platifrons</italic> contains a high amount of bacterial lipids, which are directly utilised by the host to synthesise most of its lipid contents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Downstream of the bacteriocyte’s metabolic cascade, genes encoding proteins that may be involved in fatty acid/lipid metabolism, such as perilipin2 (Bpl_scaf_27158-3.8), which is the critical protein to form intracellular lipid droplets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, and a variety of fatty acid metabolism enzymes (acetyl carboxylase 2, Bpl_scaf_55250-5.11<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>; fatty acid desaturase 1-like isoform X1, Bpl_scaf_35916-0.6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>; long-chain fatty acid-ligase ACSBG2-like isoform X1, Bpl_scaf_28862-1.5 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>), were up-regulated, suggesting that the fatty acid could be a major form of nutrients passing from the symbiont to the host mussel.</p>
<p>Additionally, bacteriocytes expressed several solute carriers, including sodium/ascorbate cotransporter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>, solute carrier family 23 members 1-like, Bpl_scaf_32311-1.19), sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger (sodium potassium calcium exchanger 3-like, Bpl_scaf_14503-1.28), sodium/chloride ion cotransporter (solute carrier family 12 member 3-like isoform X1, Bpl_scaf_44604-3.7), ferrous iron transporter (solute carrier family 40 member 1-like, Bpl_scaf_63447-0.12) and zinc transporter (zinc transporter ZIP14-like, Bpl_scaf_44428-5.3). The solute carriers are a large family of ATP-dependent transporters that shuttle a variety of small molecules across the cellular membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. In several model symbiotic systems, solute carriers play a vital role in host-symbiont interaction by either providing the symbiont with sub-strates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> or transporting symbiont-produced nutrients to the host <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. Previous studies demonstrated that solute carrier genes were expanded in deep-sea chemosynthetic animals’ genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> and highly expressed in symbiotic organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> including bathymodioline mussel’s gill<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In bathymodioline mussels, previous bulk RNA-seq studies detected up-regulated expression of a large variety of solute carriers in the gill, which is consistent with the present study, suggesting that solute carriers may play crucial roles in shuttling nutrients in and out of bacteriocytes and in maintaining the suitable intracellular micro-environment (such as the SLC23A1 and SLC39A14) for the symbiont<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Cell-type-specific response to environmental stresses</title>
<p>To examine cell-type-specific acclimatisation to environmental changes the expression profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were compared between the three states (Fanmao, starved and reconstituted animals) of samples collected in our <italic>in situ</italic> transplantation experiment (full lists of DEGs are shown in Supplementary Table S6-S18). Notably, for each state three mussels were processed but pooled for nuclei extraction before snRNA sequencing (see Method for detail). We tested our hypothesis here that at the starvation site, a relatively low concentration of methane shall upset symbiont metabolism and thus substantially affect symbiont-hosting bacteriocytes by assessing the transcriptional changes per cell type. We calculated the distances between the three sets of samples on the UMAP plot (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) estimating the centroid coordinates per sample per cell type, and calculating the Euclid distance between the centroid coordinates of each pair of states per cell type (Supplementary Table S19). The impact of starvation was variable across cell types, as reflected by the cross-state distances (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, green bar). Starvation resulted in the most significant transcriptional changes in bacteriocytes reflected by a large Fanmao-vs-starvation distance (2.3), followed by VEPC and inter lamina cells (2.1 and 1.4, respectively). On the other hand, starvation had little impact on the transcriptions of ciliary cells and most supportive cells such as the food grove ciliary cell, BMC2, and mucus cells (distances &lt;0.5). <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> also shows that after reconstitution (moving the mussels back to the methane-rich site Fanmao for 3 days), the expressional profile of bacteriocytes rapidly changed back, reflected by a large starvation-vs-reconstitution distance and much smaller Fanmao-vs-reconstitution distance (2.3 vs. 0.8; Suppl. Tab. S19). This result coincided with and was supported by our pseudo-time analysis for bacteriocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), showing that bacteriocytes in the reconstitution are in intermediate and transitional states between Fanmao and starvation.</p>

<p>For the bacteriocytes population, we conducted cell trajectory pseudo-timing and detailed DEG analysis to interpret the mechanism of host-symbiont interactions. It is important to acknowledge that our sampling strategy might have limitations, as more closely spaced time points could enhance the confidence of trajectory reconstruction. The branched heatmap showed both up- and down-regulated genes during starvation and reconstitution compared with the Fanmao state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D and</xref> supplementary Fig. S7). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis of the bacteriocytes’ DEGs provides an overall view of the pathways enriched in each environmental state (Supplementary Fig. S8 A-C). The genes encoding ribosomal proteins are highly expressed in the bacteriocytes under the methane-rich ‘Fanmao’ state (Supplementary Fig. S8A), suggesting an active protein synthesis and cellular metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Moreover, organic ion transporters (A BCB P-glycol, Bpl_scaf_18613-16.10; canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter 2, Bpl_scaf_52110-4.43; sodium- and chloride-dependent glycine transporter 1-like, Bpl_scaf_13642-5.8), which may be involved in transporting symbiont-produced nutrients, are also highly expressed (Supplementary Fig. S9).</p>
<p>In starved <italic>G. platifrons</italic>, negative regulators of cell proliferation, such as autocrine proliferation repressors and receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase beta, were up-regulated in bacterio-cytes, suggesting repression of cell growth. We also observed the enrichment of genes in the apoptosis pathway (Supplementary Fig. S8B), which is attributed to the upregulation of caspases (Bpl_scaf_25165-3.8 and Bpl_scaf_24225-0.12) and cathepsins (Bpl_scaf_64706-0.16, Bpl_scaf_61711-5.12) which can trigger caspases-dependent cell death, suggesting cellular stress condition. Correspondingly, a gene encoding baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein (Bpl_scaf_6172-0.3), which can bind caspase and inhibit apoptosis, was up-regulated in bacteriocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the baculoviral IAP proteins are important in animal’s response to cellular stress and promote cell survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup>. Similarly, the gene encoding MAP3K14 (Bpl_scaf_60908-4.14) and potential E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF213 (Bpl_scaf_25983-1.26, Bpl_scaf_1894-1.45, Supplementary Fig. S10), which were apoptosis suppressor or regulator, were up-regulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. These results suggest that starved bacteriocytes were carrying out cell-type-specific adjustments to cope with stresses. The E3 ubiquitin ligases could also work as intracellular immune sensors of bacterial lipopolysaccharides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. Thus, the encoded protein may be able to active downstream immunological toolkit to digest the symbiont population for nutrients.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, bacteriocytes obtain nutrients from endosymbionts. KEGG pathway analyses suggested that phagosome, lysosome-related pathways were upregulated in the starvation state, indicating that bacteriocytes were actively digesting the endosymbionts in the starved <italic>G. platifrons</italic>. Interestingly, protein synthesis activity was more activated in inter lamina cells and VEPCs as supported by the up-regulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins in both cell populations (Supplementary Tables S6 and S17). This was contrary to the situation in bacteriocytes and may be a consequence of the high activity of “farming” in bacteriocytes.</p>
<p>We anticipated that after moving the starved <italic>G. platifrons</italic> back to Fanmao site, bacteriocytes and their endosymbionts would “reconstitute” leading to the partly restored “farming” and “milking” pathways. This was confirmed by higher expression of fatty acid metabolic genes in the mussels in the reconstitution state than those in the starvation state, such as long-chain-fatty-acid-ligase ACSBG2-like (Bpl_scaf_28862-1.5), elongation of very long-chain fatty acids 7-like (Bpl_scaf_5959-1.9), and fatty acid desaturase 1-like (Bpl_scaf_35916-0.6). These findings were also consistent with the result of KEGG analyses. The mitochondrial trifunctional enzyme (Bpl_scaf_42376-0.5) was also highly expressed, suggesting a high level of energy-producing activity. The KEGG analyses showed that glutamatergic synthase was enriched in the reconstitution state in comparison with those in both the Fanmao and starvation states. In the insect aphid–Buchnera endosymbiosis model, the host-produced glutamate could be transported and directly utilised by the symbiont<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. Similar glutamate-based host–symbiont metabolic interaction mechanisms were also proposed in the deep-sea mussel <italic>Bathymodiolus thermophilus</italic> and <italic>B. azoricus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. As the pseudotime analyses showed above (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), reconstitution was the intermediate state between Fanmao and starvation. Metabolic and gene regulatory functions of bacteriocytes were still different from that in Fanmao. The KEGG analyses suggested regulatory (Rap1 signalling, retrograde endocannabinoid signalling, chemokine signalling, glucagon signalling, thyroid hormone synthesis, mRNA surveillance pathway, etc.) and metabolic pathways were enriched in the reconstitution state (fatty acid metabolism, salivary secretion, aldosterone synthesis and section, insulin secretion and pancreatic section) (Supplementary Fig. S8C). For example, we detected up-regulation of the genes encoding carbonic anhydrases (Bpl_scaf_33596-7.3 and Bpl_scaf_48274-0.3), electroneutral sodium bicarbonate exchanger 1 (Bpl_scaf_61230-5.11), and globin-like proteins (Bpl_scaf_50392-1.14 and Bpl_scaf_24370-0.5), which could provide the symbiont with carbon dioxide and oxygen necessary for the symbiont’s chemosynthetic metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>.</p>

<label>5.</label><title>Summary and outlook</title>
<p>Using the deep-sea mussel <italic>G. platifrons</italic> as a model organism, we demonstrated the power of integrating snRNA-seq and WISH data in unravelling the mechanism behind animal-microbe symbiosis. The robustness of this strategy showed stable and highly distinguishable expression patterns of each cell type regardless of the different environmental states. We successfully profiled the specific roles of different types of cells, including the previously unknown cell types, in maintaining the structure and function of the gill. The supportive cells that located in between (inter lamina cells) and on the basal membrane’s surface (BMC1 and BMC2) helped maintain the anatomical structure of the basal membrane. Ciliary and smooth muscle cells involved in gill slice contraction and cilium beat allowing the gathering of material and information from the surrounding environment. Proliferation cells (PBEZCs, DEPCs and VEPCs) gave rise to new cells, including bacteriocytes which obtained nutrients from endosymbionts using intracellular vacuoles and lysosomes.</p>
<p>The snRNA analyses also revealed that different cell types collaborated to support bacteriocytes’ functionality. The PBEZCs gave rise to new bacteriocytes that allowed symbiont colonisation. Bacteriocytes attached to the basal membrane and were stabilised by supportive cells. Mucus cells co-localise with bacteriocytes and help to maintain immune homeostasis. The beating ciliary cells controlled the water flow, providing bacteriocytes with necessary inorganic substances from the environment. This new information on cell-cell interaction certainly advanced our overall understanding of how endosymbiotic microbes and host cells communicate and collaborate, which cannot be easily achieved through other methods.</p>
<p>Moreover, the analysis of snRNA data from bacteriocytes has provided insight into the molecular mechanisms employed by the host to maintain and regulate the symbiosis. Notably, the bacteriocytes-enriched transcripts involved in harbouring, digesting symbionts, and transporting nutrients produced by the symbionts were identify and characterised. Our <italic>in situ</italic> transplant experiments by moving mussels between methane-rich and methane-limited sites also provided clues of cell-type specific responses to environmental change. Under a methane-limited environment, the staved mussels more actively consumed endosymbionts through the “farming” pathway. After being moved back to the methane-rich environment, mussels produced more glutamates which sustained the regrowth of symbionts. These preliminary findings showed that the deep-sea mussels were able to control their endosymbionts using a set of genes in response to environmental change. Due to the limitation of remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dives and sampling capacity, we had to have pooled samples of each state for nuclei extraction and sequencing. Thus, the cells per cluster could be considered as technical than biological replicates. Although this sampling process strategy has been broadly used in snRNA/scRNA sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, we recognise the possible violation of assumptions in <italic>p</italic>-value calculation for DEGs between the three states.</p>
<p>Overall, the single-cell spatial and functional atlas developed in the present work will decipher some common principles of symbiosis and environmental adaption mechanisms of animals. The workflow developed in the present study could provide insightful references for researchers focusing on the mechanistic study of the biological adaptation of biologically and ecologically important non-model animals.</p>

<title>Deep-sea <italic>in situ</italic> transplant experiment and sample collection</title>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> transplant experiment was conducted at the ‘F-site’ cold seep during the R/V ‘Kexue’ 2020 South China Sea cold seep cruise. The overall design of the <italic>in situ</italic> transplant experiment and environmental states are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. First, mussels in the methane-rich ‘Fanmao’ site (meaning ‘prosperous’ site, 22°06<sub>′</sub>55.425<sub>″</sub>N,119<sub>°</sub>17<sub>′</sub>08.287<sub>″</sub>E, depth 1117m) were scoped into three nylon bags with approximately 10 mussels in each bag. Then, two bags of mussels were transplanted to the low methane Starvation site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, 22<sub>°</sub>07<sub>′</sub>00<sub>″</sub>N, 119<sub>°</sub>17<sub>′</sub>07.02<sub>″</sub>E, depth 1147.42m). After 11 days of transplantation, one bag of mussels in the Starvation site was moved back to the ‘Fanmao’ site. On the 14th day of the transplant, three bags of mussels: one bag from the Fanmao site (designated as the ‘Fanmao’ sample), one bag from the starvation site (designated as the ‘Starvation’ sample) and one bag of mussels which were first transplanted to the Starvation site for 11 days and moved back to the Fanmao site for 3 days (designated as the ‘Reconstitution’ sample) were all retrieved by ROV Fanxian. The mussels were kept in a hydraulic pressure-sealed biobox during the ascending of the ROV. The biobox is made of heat-insulated material, which will prohibit heat exchange with warm surface water. The samples were immediately processed once onboard R/V Kexue. For snRNA-seq, the posterior end tip of the mussel’s gill was dissected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C until use. For WISH, ISH and FISH, the gills of the mussels were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, prepared with autoclaved 0.22 μM membrane filtered <italic>in situ</italic> seawater) at 4 °C overnight. Then, the gill was washed with ice-cold 1× PBS three times, dehydrated and stored in 100% methanol at −20 °C.</p>

<title>Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of <italic>G. platifrons</italic></title>
<p>The gill nucleus was extracted using the Nuclei PURE prep nuclei isolation kit (Sigma-Aldrich). For each sample, posterior end tips from 3 individual mussels were randomly selected and pooled together. The posterior tips were homogenised in 10 mL of ice-cold lysis solution (Nuclei PURE lysis buffer with 0.1% Triton X100 and 1 mM DTT) on ice. The cell nuclei were then separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cell nuclei pellets were washed by re-suspending in icecold DPBS–BSA solution (1× DPBS, 0.04% nuclease-free BSA, 0.01% RNase inhibitor; Takara). The nucleus was spun down by centrifugation at 500×g for 5 min at 4 °C. This step was repeated to remove the contaminants from the cell plasma. Finally, the nucleus was re-suspended in the DPBS–BSA solution. The concentration of the cell nucleus was counted by Cell Countess II. Single-nucleus RNA-seq libraries were then constructed with the BD Rhapsody™ single-cell analysis system using the BD Rhapsody WTA Amplification Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The library was subjected to 150bp paired-end sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 plat-form. The clean reads of three datasets were submitted to the National Centre for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive database (Bioproject: PRJNA779258).</p>

<title>Bioinformatics</title>
<p>The three raw datasets (Fanmao, Starvation, and Reconstitution) were processed individually following the BD single-cell genomics analysis setup user guide (Doc ID: 47383 Rev. 8.0) and BD single-cell genomics bioinformatics handbook (Doc ID: 54169 Rev. 7.0). This process involved the preparation of gene names, alignment of data to the genome, and generation of an expression matrix for each dataset. A <italic>G. platifrons</italic> genome reference v1.0 (available at the Dryad Digital Repository; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h9942">http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h9942</ext-link>) was utilized. The genome was indexed and constructed using STAR 2.5.2b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the sequencing data was mapped to the indexed genome using the BD Rhapsody single-nucleus pipeline v1.9, employing default parameters.</p>
<p>Each data matrix was converted to a SingleCellExperiment data format, and empty barcodes were removed using the emptyDrops function of DropletUtils v3.14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. Then, we converted and processed the data in Seurat v3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We removed cells that had &lt;100 or &gt; 2500 genes and &lt;100 or &gt; 6000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). We also removed genes that had &lt;10 UMIs in each data matrix. Then, we log-normalised the data and used DoubletFinder v2.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup> to remove potential doublet, assuming a 7.5% doublet formation rate. The numbers of retained nuclei were 9717, 21614 and 28928 for Fanmao, Starvation and Reconstitution data, respectively (Supplementary Table S20). We used the top 3000 highly variable genes for principal component analysis (PCA) and a reciprocal PCA approach to integrating the three datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. The first 40 principal components (PCs) were used for uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensional reduction and following clustering (Supplementary Fig. S11). We employed an empirical parameter - a resolution of 0.2 - in the FindClusters function, utilizing the original Louvain algorithm. To identify unique marker genes associated with each cluster, we utilized the FindAllMarkers function from the Seurat package. This analysis employed the Wil-coxon rank sum test, focusing on genes that demonstrated a minimum 0.3-fold difference between two groups of cells. The annotation of cell types relied on the reference of previously published marker genes. In instances where clusters exhibited marker genes that couldn’t be associated with known cell types, we pursued the validation process through whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH; elaborated below), discerning cell types based on gene expression patterns and morphological characteristics. When WISH displayed uniform expression of marker genes from different clusters within the same cell type, we consolidated those clusters into a single cell type. We assigned cells to 14 reliable cell types (Supplementary Fig. S11). Supplementary data S1 presents the counting matrix and Supplementary data S1 presents the average expression of each gene per cell type. To evaluate the stability of each cell type, we implemented a bootstrap sampling and clustering strategy comprising 100 iterations using cells combined from all three samples and individual samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>. The determination of marker genes per cell type followed the previously described methodology. The identified marker genes were subsequently utilized in KEGG enrichment analysis, employing ClusterProfiler v4.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cell trajectory analysis</title>
<p>We conducted slingshot trajectory analyses using Slingshot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup> v2.2.1 for a subset of clusters (intercalary cells, dorsal-end proliferation cells,ventral-end proliferation cells, mucus cells, basal membrane cells 1, basal membrane cells 2 and bacteriocytes) to explore the developmental trajectory of cells, assuming that all these cells were developed from the same precursor (’posterior-end budding zone’). We performed PCA for the subsampled data set and conducted dimensional reduction using phateR v1.0.7 for slingshot analyses. We used the Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding (PHATE) because it could better reveal developmental branches than other tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We also examined the effect of deep-sea transplant experiments on shaping gene expression patterns by comparing the expression levels amongst the three different states of a given cluster. We conducted Monocle analyses using Monocle2 and Monocle 3 in R environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup>. This comparison was done for the bacteriocytes. The biased number of cells per state could affect the results of the dimensional reduction and calculation of marker genes, and the sequenced nucleus per state was unbalanced; therefore, we first downsampled the cells per cluster per state to to a maximum of 1000 nuclei per cell type. Thereafter, we performed PCA and dimensional reduction using UMAP and PHATE, calculated marker genes and conducted sling-shot trajectory and KEGG enrichment analyses as mentioned above for each cell type.</p>

The samples were embedded by incubating in Paraplast Plus (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h at 65 °C and then cooled down to RT. Sections with 5 μM thickness were cut using a microtome (Leica).</p>
<p>For double FISH, sections were dewaxed by incubating in xylene twice, a 1:1 mixture of 100% ethanol and xylene, 100% ethanol twice, 95% ethanol, 85% ethanol and 75% ethanol for 15 min each at RT. The sections were washed with PBST three times for 10 min each and then permeabilised by 2 μg/mL proteinase K (NEB) in PBST for 15 min at RT. Post-digestion fixation was conducted by incubating the sections in 4% PFA in PBST for 30 min at RT. The sections were washed three times with PBST for 15 min each. Pre-hybridisation was conducted by incubating the sections in HM for 1 h at 55 °C. Then, the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation was performed by incubating the sections in ∼0.5 ng/μL fluorescein (Roche)-labelled probed prepared in fresh HM overnight at 55 °C. The sections were washed three times with 2×SSC for 15 min each at 55 °C, cooled down to room temperature and washed three times with PBST.</p>
<p>A second-round hybridisation was conducted on the DIG-labelled oligonucleotides to label the symbiont. The slices were hybridised for 1 h at 46 °C with 100 ng DIG-labelled <italic>G. platifrons</italic> symbiont-specific probe in FISH buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris-HCl, 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulphate [SDS] and 30% formamide). The slices were then washed with FISH washing buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris HCl, 0.01% SDS and 5 mM EDTA) three times at 5 min each at 48 °C. The slices were washed with PBST three times and then blocked with blocking buffer (2.5% sheep serum and 2% BSA in sheep serum) for 1 h at room temperature.</p>
<p>The slices were then incubated with 1:1000 diluted anti-fluorescein–peroxidase (POD) (Roche) overnight at 4 °C, then washed six times with PBST for 15 min each and three times with TNT buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 100 mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20) for 15 min each. Afterwards, the fluorescent signal of the <italic>G. platifrons</italic> gene expression pattern was developed by the TSA fluorescein kit (Akoya Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The slices were washed three times, and the remaining POD activity was quenched by incubation in 1% hydrogen peroxide solution for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the slices were washed three times with PBS, blocked with blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature, incubated with 1:2500 diluted anti-DIG–POD (Roche) for 2 h at RT and washed with PBST for six times and TNT for three times. The symbiont FISH signal was developed using the TSA Cy3 kit (Akoya Biosciences).

<title>Whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation</title>
<p>For WISH, the connective region at the end of the W-shaped gill filament was cut off, and each gill slice was carefully peeled off with fine-tip tweezers. We dissected gill tissues from 5 individual mussels and pooled all the gill slices together. The gill slices were then rehydrated in 75%, 50% and 25% methanol-PBST (1×PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) for 15 min each, followed by 3×5 min PBST washes. The gill slices were then perme-abilised with 2 μg/mL proteinase K in PBST for 30 min at 37 °C. Post-digestion fixation was conducted by fixing the gill slices with 4% PFA in PBST for 30 min at room temperature (RT). After 3×5 min PBST wash to remove the residual fixative, the gill slices were pre-hybridised with a hybridisation mix (HM; containing 50% formamide, 5×saline–sodium citrate (SSC), 0.1% Tween 20, 10 μg/mL heparin, 500 μg/mL yeast tRNA) for 1 h at 65 °C. For each hybridisation, 5-10 gill slices were added to 400 μL of fresh HM containing ∼0.5 ng/μL DIG-labelled probe. Hybridisation was conducted in a 55 °C shaking water bath overnight. Post-hybridisation washes were performed according to the following steps: the gill slices were first washed 3×15 min with hybridisation washing buffer (50% formamide, 5×SSC, 0.1% Tween 20), followed by 3×15 min 2×SSC with 0.1% Tween 20 and 3×15 min 0.2×SSC with 0.1% Tween 20. The washings were also conducted in a shaking water batch, and all the washing buffers were pre-heated to 55 °C. The samples were washed three times with PBST and then blocked in blocking buffer (2.5% sheep serum, 2% BSA in PBST) for 1 h at RT. Each sample was incubated with 1:10,000 diluted anti-DIG-AP antibody (Roche) at 4 °C overnight. The samples were incubated with the antibody, then washed for 6×15 min with PBST, followed by washing in 3×15 min alkaline Tris buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5; 100 mM NaCl; 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). The samples were incubated in nitro blue tetrazolium/5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate staining solution (Sangon). After the desired expression pattern was revealed, the staining reaction was stopped by 3×15 min PBST–EDTA wash (PBST, 1 mM ETDA). The gill slices were cleared by incubating in 100% glycerol overnight at 4 °C and then mounted on glass slides. The results of control hybridisations (with sense probes) were provided in Supplementary Fig. S13-S16.

<p>Wang, He et al have constructed comprehensive single nucleus atlas for the gills of the deep sea Bathymodioline mussels, which possess intracellular symbionts that provide a key source of carbon and allow them to live in these extreme environments. They provide annotations of the different cell states within the gills, shedding light on how multiple cell types cooperate to give rise to the emergent functions of the composite tissues and the gills as a whole. They pay special attention to characterizing the bacteriocyte cell populations and identifying sets of genes that may play a role in their interaction with the symbiotes.</p>
<p>Wang, He et al sample mussels from 3 different environments: animals from their native methane rich environment, animals transplanted to a methane-poor environment to induce starvation and animals that have been starved in the methane-poor environment and then moved back to the methane-rich environment. They demonstrated that starvation had the biggest impact on bacteriocyte transcriptomes. They hypothesize that the up-regulation of genes associated with lysosomal digestion leads to the digestion of the intracellular symbiont during starvation, while the non-starved and reacclimated groups more readily harvest the nutrients from symbiotes without destroying them. Further work exploring the differences in symbiote populations between ecological conditions will further elucidate the dynamic relationship between host and symbiote. This will help disentangle specific changes in transcriptomic state that are due to their changing interactions with the symbiotes from changes associated with other environmental factors.</p>
<p>This paper makes available a high quality dataset that is of interest to many disciplines of biology. The unique qualities of this non-model organism and collection of conditions sampled make it of special interest to those studying deep sea adaptation, the impact of environmental perturbation on Bathymodioline mussels populations, and intracellular symbiotes. The authors also use a diverse array of tools to explore and validate their data.</p>

<p>Wang, He et al. shed insight into the molecular mechanisms of deep-sea chemosymbiosis at the single-cell level. They do so by producing a comprehensive cell atlas of the gill of Gigantidas platifrons, a chemosymbiotic mussel that dominates the deep-sea ecosystem. They uncover novel cell types and find that the gene expression of bacteriocytes, the symbiont-hosting cells, supports two hypotheses of host-symbiont interactions: the &quot;farming&quot; pathway, where symbionts are directly digested, and the &quot;milking&quot; pathway, where nutrients released by the symbionts are used by the host. They perform an in situ transplantation experiment in the deep sea and reveal transitional changes in gene expression that support a model where starvation stress induces bacteriocytes to &quot;farm&quot; their symbionts, while recovery leads to the restoration of the &quot;farming&quot; and &quot;milking&quot; pathways.</p>
<p>A major strength of this study includes the successful application of advanced single nucleus techniques to a non-model, deep sea organism that remains challenging to sample. I also applaud the authors for performing an in situ transplantation experiment in a deep sea environment. From gene expression profiles, the authors deftly provide a rich functional description of G. platifrons cell types that is well-contextualized within the unique biology of chemosymbiosis. These findings offer significant insight into the molecular mechanisms of deep-sea host-symbiont ecology, and will serve as a valuable resource for future studies into the striking biology of G. platifrons.</p>
<p>The authors' conclusions are generally well-supported by their results. However, I recognize that the difficulty of obtaining deep-sea specimens may have impacted experimental design and no replicates were sampled.</p>
<p>It is notable that the Fanmao cells were much more sparsely sampled. It appears that fewer cells were sequenced, resulting in the Starvation and Reconstitution conditions having 2-3x more cells after doublet filtering. These discrepancies also are reflected in the proportion of cells that survived QC, suggesting a distinction in quality or approach. However, the authors provide clear and sufficient evidence via bootstrapping that batch effects between the three samples are negligible. While batch effect does not appear to have affected gene expression profiles, the proportion of cell types may remain sensitive to sampling techniques, and thus interpretation of Fig. S12 must be approached with caution.</p>

<p>Wang et al. explored the unique biology of the deep-sea mussel Gigantidas platifrons to understand fundamental principles of animal-symbiont relationships. They used single-nucleus RNA sequencing and validation and visualization of many of the important cellular and molecular players that allow these organisms to survive in the deep-sea. They demonstrate that a diversity of cell types that support the structure and function of the gill including bacteriocytes, specialized epithelial cells that host sulfur-oxidizing or methane-oxidizing symbionts as well as a suite of other cell types including supportive cells, ciliary, and smooth muscle cells. By performing experiments of transplanting mussels from one habitat which is rich in methane to methane-limited environments, the authors showed that starved mussels may consume endosymbionts versus in methane-rich environments upregulated genes involved in glutamate synthesis. These data add to the growing body of literature that organisms control their endosymbionts in response to environmental change.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the data are well supported. The authors adapted a technique that would have been technically impossible in their field environment by preserving the tissue and then performing nuclear isolation after the fact. The use of single-nucleus sequencing opens the possibility of new cellular and molecular biology that is not possible to study in the field. Additionally, the in-situ data (both WISH and FISH) are high-quality and easy to interpret. The use of cell-type-specific markers along with a symbiont-specific probe was effective. Finally, the SEM and TEM were used convincingly for specific purposes in the case of showing the cilia that may support water movement.</p>
<p>The one particular area for future exploration surrounds the concept of a proliferative progenitor population within the gills. The authors recover molecular markers for these putative populations and additional future work will uncover if these are indeed proliferative cells contribute to symbiont colonization.</p>
<p>Overall the significance of this work is identifying the relationship between symbionts and bacteriocytes and how these host bacteriocytes modulate their gene expression in response to environmental change. It will be interesting to see how similar or different these data are across animal phyla. For instance, the work of symbiosis in cnidarians may converge on similar principles of there may be independent ways in which organisms have been able to solve these problems.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study provides an important cell atlas of the gill of the mussel Gigantidas platifrons using a single nucleus RNA-seq dataset, a resource for the community of scientists studying deep sea physiology and metabolism and intracellular host-symbiont relationships. The work, which offers solid insights into cellular responses to starvation stress and molecular mechanisms behind deep-sea chemosymbiosis, is of relevance to scientists interested in host-symbiont relationships across ecosystems.</p>
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Wang et al have constructed a comprehensive single nucleus atlas for the gills of the deep sea Bathymodioline mussels, which possess intracellular symbionts that provide a key source of carbon and allow them to live in these extreme environments. They provide annotations of the different cell states within the gills, shedding light on how multiple cell types cooperate to give rise to the emergent functions of the composite tissues and the gills as a whole. They pay special attention to characterizing the bacteriocyte cell populations and identifying sets of genes that may play a role in their interaction with the symbiotes.</p>
<p>Wang et al sample mussels from 3 different environments: animals from their native methane-rich environment, animals transplanted to a methane-poor environment to induce starvation, and animals that have been starved in the methane-poor environment and then moved back to the methane-rich environment. They demonstrated that starvation had the biggest impact on bacteriocyte transcriptomes. They hypothesize that the upregulation of genes associated with lysosomal digestion leads to the digestion of the intracellular symbiont during starvation, while the non-starved and reacclimated groups more readily harvest the nutrients from symbiotes without destroying them.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper makes available a high-quality dataset that is of interest to many disciplines of biology. The unique qualities of this non-model organism and the collection of conditions sampled make it of special interest to those studying deep sea adaptation, the impact of environmental perturbation on Bathymodioline mussels populations, and intracellular symbiotes. The authors do an excellent job of making all their data and analysis available, making this not only an important dataset but a readily accessible and understandable one.</p>
<p>The authors also use a diverse array of tools to explore their data. For example, the quality of the data is augmented by the use of in situ hybridizations to validate cluster identity and KEGG analysis provides key insights into how the transcriptomes of bacteriocytes change.</p>
<p>The authors also do a great job of providing diagrams and schematics to help orient non-mussel experts, thereby widening the audience of the paper.</p>

<p>Thank the reviewer for the valuable feedback on our study. We are grateful that the reviewers found our work to be interesting and we appreciate their thorough evaluation of our research. Their constructive comments will be considered as we continue to develop and improve our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One of the main weaknesses of this paper is the lack of coherence between the images and the text, with some parts of the figures never being referenced in the body of the text. This makes it difficult for the reader to interpret how they fit in with the author's discussion and assess confidence in their analysis and interpretation of data. This is especially apparent in the cluster annotation section of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the feedback and suggestions provided by the reviewer, and we have revised our manuscript to make it more accessible to general audiences.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another concern is the linking of the transcriptomic shifts associated with starvation with changes in interactions with the symbiotes. Without examining and comparing the symbiote population between the different samples, it cannot be concluded that the transcriptomic shifts correlate with a shift to the 'milking' pathway and not other environmental factors. Without comparing the symbiote abundance between samples, it is difficult to disentangle changes in cell state that are due to their changing interactions with the symbiotes from other environmental factors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the valuable feedback and suggestions provided by the reviewer. Our keen interest lies in understanding symbiont responses, particularly at the single-cell level. However, it's worth noting that existing commercial single-cell RNA-seq technologies rely on oligo dT priming for reverse transcription and barcoding, thus omitting bacterial gene expression information from our dataset. We hope that advancements in technology will soon enable us to perform an integrated analysis encompassing both host and symbiont gene expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, conclusions in this area are further complicated by using only snRNA-seq to study intracellular processes. This is limiting since cytoplasmic mRNA is excluded and only nuclear reads are sequenced after the organisms have had several days to acclimate to their environment and major transcriptomic shifts have occurred.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments shared by the reviewer and agree that scRNA-seq provides more comprehensive transcriptional information by targeting the entire mRNA of the cell. However, we would like to highlight that snRNA-seq has some unique advantages over scRNA-seq. Notably, snRNA-seq allows for simple snap-freezing of collected samples, facilitating easier storage, particularly for samples obtained during field trips involving deep-sea animals and other ecologically significant non-model animal samples. Additionally, unlike scRNA-seq, snRNA-seq eliminates the need for tissue dissociation, which often involves prolonged enzymatic treatment of deep-sea animal tissue/cells under atmospheric pressure. This process can potentially lead to the loss of sensitive cells or alterations in gene expression. Moreover, snRNA-seq procedures disregard the size and shape of animal cells, rendering it a superior technology for constructing the cell atlas of animal tissues. Consequently, we assert that snRNA-seq offers flexibility and represents a suitable choice for the research objects of our current research.</p>

<p>Because cells from multiple individuals were combined before sequencing, the in situ transplantation experiment lacks clear biological replicates. This may potentially result in technical variation (ie. batch effects) confounding biological variation, directly impacting the interpretation of observed changes between the Fanmao, Reconstitution, and Starvation conditions. It is notable that Fanmao cells were much more sparsely sampled. It appears that fewer cells were sequenced, resulting in the Starvation and Reconstitution conditions having 2-3x more cells after doublet filtering. It is not clear whether this is due to a technical factor impacting sequencing or whether these numbers are the result of the unique biology of Fanmao cells. Furthermore, from Table S19 it appears that while 98% of Fanmao cells survived doublet filtering, only ~40% and ~70% survived for the Starvation and Reconstitution conditions respectively, suggesting some kind of distinction in quality or approach.</p>
<p>There is a pronounced divergence in the relative proportions of cells per cell type cluster in Fanmao compared to Reconstitution and Starvation (Fig. S11). This is potentially a very interesting finding, but it is difficult to know if these differences are the expected biological outcome of the experiment or the fact that Fanmao cells are much more sparsely sampled. The study also finds notable differences in gene expression between Fanmao and the other two conditions- a key finding is that bacteriocytes had the largest Fanmao-vs-starvation distance (Fig. 6B). But it is also notable that for every cell type, one or both comparisons against Fanmao produced greater distances than comparisons between Starvation and Reconstitution (Fig. 6B). Again, it is difficult to interpret whether Fanmao's distinctiveness from the other two conditions is underlain by fascinating biology or technical batch effects. Without biological replicates, it remains challenging to disentangle the two.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As highlighted by the reviewer, our experimental design involves pooling multiple biological samples within a single treatment state before sequencing. We acknowledge the concern regarding the absence of distinct biological replicates and the potential impact of batch effects on result interpretation. While we recognize the merit of conducting multiple sequencing runs for a single treatment to provide genuine biological replicates, we contend that batch effects may not exert a strong influence on the observed patterns.</p>
<p>In addition, we applied a bootstrap sampling algorithm to assess whether the gene expression patterns within a cluster are more similar than those between clusters. This algorithm involves selecting a portion of cells per cluster and examining whether this subset remains distinguishable from other clusters. Our assumption was that if different samples exhibited distinct expression patterns due to batch effect, the co-assignment probabilities of a cluster would be very low. This expectation was not met in our data, as illustrated in Fig. S2. The lack of significantly low co-assignment probabilities within clusters suggests that batch effects may not exert a strong influence on our results.</p>
<p>Indeed, we acknowledge a noticeable shift in the expression patterns of certain cell types, such as the bacteriocyte. However, this is not universally applicable across all cell types. For instance, the UMAP figure in Fig. 6A illustrates a substantial overlap among basal membrane cell 2 from Fanmao, Starvation, and Reconstitution treatments, and the centroid distances between the three treatments are subtle, as depicted in Fig. 6B. This consistent pattern is also observed in DEPC, smooth muscle cells, and the food groove ciliary cells.</p>
<p>The reviewer also noted variations in the number of cells per treatment. Specifically, Fanmao sequencing yielded fewer than 10 thousand cells, whereas the other two treatments produced 2-3 times more cells after quality control (QC). It is highly probable that the technician loaded different quantities of cells into the machine for single-nucleus sequencing—a not uncommon occurrence in this methodology. While loading more cells may increase the likelihood of doublets, it is crucial to emphasize that this should not significantly impact the expression patterns post-QC. It's worth noting that overloading samples has been employed as a strategic approach to capture rare cell types, as discussed in a previous study (reference: 10.1126/science.aay0267).</p>
<p>The reviewer highlighted the discrepancy in cell survival rates during the 'doublet filtering' process, with 98% of Fanmao cells surviving compared to approximately 40% and 70% for the Starvation and Reconstitution conditions, respectively. It's important to clarify that the reported percentages reflect the survival of cells through a multi-step QC process employing various filtering strategies.</p>
<p>Post-doublet removal, we filtered out cells with &lt;100 or &gt;2500 genes and &lt;100 or &gt;6000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Additionally, genes with &lt;10 UMIs in each data matrix were excluded. The observed differences in survival rates for Starvation and Reconstitution cells can be attributed to the total volume of data generated in Illumina sequencing. Specifically, we sequenced approximately 91 GB of data for Fanmao, ~196 GB for Starvation, and ~249 GB for Reconstitution. As a result, the qualified data obtained for Starvation and Reconstitution conditions was only about twice that of Fanmao due to the limited data volume.</p>
<p>The reviewer also observed a divergence in the relative proportions of cells per cell type cluster in Fanmao compared to Reconstitution and Starvation, as depicted in Fig. S1. This discrepancy may hold true biological significance, presenting a potentially intriguing finding. However, our discussion on this pattern was rather brief, as we acknowledge that the observed differences could be influenced by the sample preparation process for dissection and digestion. It is crucial to consider that cutting a slightly different area during dissection may result in variations in the proportion of cells obtained. While we recognize the potential impact of this factor, we do not think that the sparsity of sampling alone could significantly affect the relative proportions of cells per cell type.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we acknowledge the reviewer's suggestion that sequencing multiple individual samples per treatment condition would have been ideal, rather than pooling them together. However, the homogenous distribution observed in UMAP and the consistent results obtained from bootstrap sampling suggest that the impact of batch effects on our analyses is likely not substantial. Additionally, based on our understanding, the smaller number of cells in the Fanmao sample should not have any significant effect on the resulting different proportion of cells or the expression patterns per each cluster.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Wang et al. explored the unique biology of the deep-sea mussel Gigantidas platifrons to understand the fundamental principles of animal-symbiont relationships. They used single-nucleus RNA sequencing and validation and visualization of many of the important cellular and molecular players that allow these organisms to survive in the deep sea. They demonstrate that a diversity of cell types that support the structure and function of the gill including bacteriocytes, specialized epithelial cells that host sulfur-oxidizing or methane-oxidizing symbionts as well as a suite of other cell types including supportive cells, ciliary, and smooth muscle cells. By performing experiments of transplanting mussels from one habitat which is rich in methane to methane-limited environments, the authors showed that starved mussels may consume endosymbionts versus in methane-rich environments upregulated genes involved in glutamate synthesis. These data add to the growing body of literature that organisms control their endosymbionts in response to environmental change.</p>

<p>We appreciate the valuable feedback provided by the reviewer on our study. It is encouraging to know that our work was found to be interesting and that they conducted a thorough evaluation of our research. We will take their constructive comments into account as we strive to develop and enhance our study. Thank the reviewer for all the input.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The one particular area for clarification and improvement surrounds the concept of a proliferative progenitor population within the gill. The authors imply that three types of proliferative cells within gills have long been known, but their study may be the first to recover molecular markers for these putative populations. The markers the authors present for gill posterior end budding zone cells (PEBZCs) and dorsal end proliferation cells (DEPCs) are not intuitively associated with cell proliferation and some additional exploration of the data could be performed to strengthen the argument that these are indeed proliferative cells. The authors do utilize a trajectory analysis tool called Slingshot which they claim may suggest that PEBZCs could be the origin of all gill epithelial cells, however, one of the assumptions of this analysis is that differentiated cells are developed from the same precursor PEBZC population.</p>
<p>However, these conclusions do not detract from the overall significance of the work of identifying the relationship between symbionts and bacteriocytes and how these host bacteriocytes modulate their gene expression in response to environmental change. It will be interesting to see how similar or different these data are across animal phyla. For instance, the work of symbiosis in cnidarians may converge on similar principles or there may be independent ways in which organisms have been able to solve these problems.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the valuable comments and suggestions provided by the reviewer. All suggestions have been carefully considered, and the manuscript has been revised accordingly. We particularly value the reviewer's insights regarding the characterization of the G. platifrons gill proliferative cell populations. In a separate research endeavor, we have conducted experiments utilizing both cell division and cell proliferation markers on these proliferative cell populations. While these results are not incorporated into the current manuscript, we would be delighted to share our preliminary findings with the reviewer. Our preliminary results indicate that the proliferative cell populations exhibit positivity for cell proliferation markers and contain a significant number of mitotic cells..</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Further experiments are needed to link the changes in transcriptomes of Bathymodioline mussels in the different environmental conditions to changes in their interactions with symbiotes. For example, quantifying the abundance and comparing the morphology of symbiotes between the environmental conditions would lend much support for shifting between milking and farming strategies. Without analyzing the symbiotes and comparing them across populations, it is difficult to comment on the mechanisms of interactions between symbiotes and the hosts. Without this analysis, this data is better suited towards comments about the general effect of environmental perturbation and stress on gene expression in these mussels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. We are also very curious about the symbiont responses, especially at the single-cell level. However, all the current commercial single-cell RNA-seq technologies are based on oligo dT priming for reverse transcription and barcoding. Therefore, the bacterial gene expression information is omitted from our dataset. Hopefully, with the development of technology, we could conduct an integrated analysis of both host and symbiont gene expression soon.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, clarification is needed on which types of symbiotes are being looked at. Are they MOX or SOX populations? Are they homogenous? What are the concentrations of sulfur at the sampled sites?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for your valuable comments and suggestions. Gigantidas platifrons harbors a MOX endosymbiont population characterized by a single 16S rRNA phylotype. We apologize for any confusion resulting from our previous wording. To clarify, we have revised lines 57-59 of our introduction</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the text and images, consider using standardized gene names and leaving out the genome coordinates. This would greatly help with readability. Also, be careful to properly follow gene naming and formatting conventions (ie italicizing gene names and symbols).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comments. In model animals, gene nomenclature often stems from forward genetic approaches, such as the identification of loss-of-function mutants. These gene names, along with their protein products, typically correspond to unique genome coordinates. Conversely, in non-model invertebrates (e.g., Gigantidas platifrons of present study), gene prediction relies on a combination of bioinformatics methods, including de novo prediction, homolog-based prediction, and transcriptomics mapping. Subsequently, the genes are annotated by identifying their best homologs in well-characterized databases. Given that different genes may encode proteins with similar annotated functions, we chose to include both the gene ID (genome coordinates) and the gene name in our manuscript. This dual labeling approach ensures that our audience receives accurate and comprehensive information regarding gene identification and annotation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, extending KEGG analysis to the atlas annotation section could help strengthen the confidence of annotations. For example, when identifying bacteriocyte populations, the functional categories of individual marker genes (lysosomal proteases, lysosomal traffic regulators, etc) are used to justify the annotation. Presenting KEGG support that these functional categories are upregulated in this population relative to others would help further support how you characterize this cluster by showing it's not just a few specific genes that are enriched in this cell group, but rather an overall functionality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the valuable suggestion provided by the reviewer. Indeed, incorporating KEGG analysis into the atlas annotation section could further enhance the confidence in our annotations. However, in our study, we encountered some limitations that impeded us from conducting a comprehensive KEGG enrichment analysis.</p>
<p>Firstly, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that we identified for certain cell populations was relatively small, making it challenging to meet the threshold required for meaningful KEGG enrichment analysis. For instance, among the 97 marker genes identified for the Bacteriocyte cluster, only two genes, Bpl_scaf_59648-4.5 (lysosomal alpha-glucosidase-like) and Bpl_scaf_52809-1.6 (lysosomal-trafficking regulator-like isoform X1), were identified as lysosomal genes. To generate reliable KEGG enrichments, a larger number of genes is typically required.</p>
<p>Secondly, single-nucleus sequencing, as employed in our study, tends to yield a relatively smaller number of genes per cell compared to bulk RNA sequencing. This limited gene yield can make it challenging to achieve sufficient gene representation for rigorous KEGG enrichment analysis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many genes in the genome still lack comprehensive annotation, both in terms of KEGG and GO annotations. In our dataset, out of the 33,584 genes obtained through single-nuclei sequencing, 26,514 genes have NO KEGG annotation, and 25,087 genes have NO GO annotation. This lack of annotations further restricts the comprehensive application of KEGG analysis in our study.</p>

<p>Additionally, it does not seem like trajectory analysis is appropriate for these sampling conditions. Generally, to create trajectories confidently, more closely sampled time points are needed to sufficiently parse out the changes in expression. More justification is needed for the use of this type of analysis here and a discussion of the limitations should be mentioned, especially when discussing the hypotheses relating to PEBZCs, VEPCs, and DEPCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate your thoughtful commentary. It is important to acknowledge that in the context of a developmental study, incorporating more closely spaced time points indeed holds great value. In our ongoing project investigating mouse development, for instance, we have implemented time points at 24-hour intervals. However, in the case of deep-sea adult animals, we hypothesized a slower transcriptional shift in such extreme environment, which led us to opt for a time interval of 3-7 days. Examining the differential expression profiles among the three treatments, we observed that most cell types exhibited minimal changes in their expression profiles. For the cell types strongly impacted by in situ transplantation, their expression profiles per cell type still exhibited highly overlap in the UMAP analysis (Figure 6a), thus enabling meaningful comparisons. Nevertheless, we recognize that our sampling strategy may not be flawless. Additionally, the challenging nature of conducting in situ transplantation in 1000-meter depths limited the number of sampling occasions available to us. We sincerely appreciate your input and understanding.</p>

<p>Slingshot is an algorithm that uses the principal graph of the cells to infer trajectories. It models trajectories as curves on the principal graph, capturing the progression and transitions between different cellular states.</p>
<p>Both Slingshot and pseudotime aim to infer cellular trajectories. Slingshot focuses on capturing branching patterns which is fully compatible with the graph generated using dimensionality reduction such as UMAP and PHATE, while pseudotime analysis aims to order cells along a continuous trajectory. It does not rely on dimensionality reduction graphs. We used both in the MS for different purposes.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your comment. In Figure 5C, most of the typical gill filament region is visible (the ventral tip of the gill filament, and the mid part of the gill filament) except for the dorsal end. The gill filament of bathymodioline mussels exhibits a simple structure: a single layer of bacteriocytes grow on the basal membrane. Consequently, the gill slices have a fairly uniform thickness (with two layers of bacteriocytes and one layer of interlamina cells in between), minimizing any potential impact on fluorescent intensity. As of now, detailed quantification of intracellular symbionts may necessitate continuous TEM or ultra-resolution confocal sections to 3D reconstruct the bacteriocytes, which may exceed the scope of the current study. Therefore, fluorescent intensity remains the only method available to us for estimating bacterial density/distribution across the gill filament.</p>

<p>Line 577-578: How was the number of clusters determined? What is meant by &quot;manually combine the clusters?&quot; If cells were clustered by hand, more detail on the method is needed, as well as direct discussion and justification in the body of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It would be more appropriate to emphasize the determination of cell types rather than clusters. The clusters were identified using a clustering function, as mentioned in the manuscript. It's important to note that the clustering function (in our case, the FindClusters function of Seurat) provides a general overview based on diffuse gene expression. Technically speaking, there is no guarantee that one cluster corresponds to a single cell type. Therefore, it is crucial to manually inspect the clustering results to assign clusters to the appropriate cell types. In some cases, multiple clusters may be assigned to the same cell type, while in other cases, a single cluster may need to be further subdivided into two or more cell types or sub-cell types, depending on the specific circumstances.</p>
<p>For studies conducted on model species such as humans or mice, highly and specifically expressed genes within each cluster can be compared to known marker genes of cell types mentioned in previous publications, which generally suffices for annotation purposes. However, in the case of non-model species like Bathymodioline mussels, there is often limited information available about marker genes, making it challenging to confidently assign clusters to specific cell types. In such situations, in situ hybridisation proves to be incredibly valuable. In our study, WISH was employed to visualise the expression and morphology of marker genes within clusters. When WISH revealed the expression of marker genes from a cluster in a specific type of cell, we classified that cluster as a genuine cell type. Moreover, if WISH demonstrated uniform expression of marker genes from different clusters in the same cell, we assigned both clusters to the same cell type.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>As noted in the public review, my only major concerns are around the treatment of progenitor cell populations. I am sympathetic to the challenges of these experiments but suggest a few possible avenues to the authors.</p>
<p>First, there could be some demonstration that these cells in G. platifrons are indeed proliferative, using EdU incorporation labeling or a conserved epitope such as the phosphorylation of serine 10 in histone 3. It appears in Mytilus galloprovincialis that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and phospho-histone H3 have previously been used as good markers for proliferative cells (Maiorova and Odintsova 2016). The use of any of these markers along with the cell type markers the authors recover for PEBZCs for example would greatly strengthen the argument that these are proliferative cells.</p>
<p>If performing these experiments would not be currently possible, the authors could use some computation approaches to strengthen their arguments. Based on conserved cell cycle markers and the use of Cell-Cycle feature analysis in Seurat could the authors provide evidence that these progenitors occupy the G2/M phase at a greater percentage than other cells? Other than the physical position of the cells is there much that suggests that these are proliferative? While I am more convinced by markers in VEPCs the markers for PEBZCs and DEPCs are not particularly compelling.</p>
<p>While I do not think the major findings of the paper hinge on this, comments such as &quot;the PBEZCs gave rise to new bacteriocytes that allowed symbiont colonization&quot; should be taken with care. It is not clear that the PBEZCs are proliferative and there does not seem to be any direct evidence that PBEZCs (or DEPCs or VEPCS for that manner) are the progenitor cells through any sort of labeling or co-expression studies.</p>

<p>We appreciate the comments and suggestions from the reviewer. We have considered all the suggestions and have revised the manuscript accordingly. We especially appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions about the characterisations of the G. platifrons gill proliferative cell populations. In a separate research project, we have tested both cell division and cell proliferation markers on the proliferation cell populations. Though we are not able to include these results in the current manuscript, we are happy to share our preliminary results with the reviewer. Our results demonstrate the proliferative cell populations, particularly the VEPCs, are cell proliferation marker positive, and contains high amount of mitotic cells.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a body of literature that has examined cell proliferation and zones of proliferation in mussels (such as Piquet, B., Lallier, F.H., André, C. et al. Regionalized cell proliferation in the symbiont-bearing gill of the hydrothermal vent mussel Bathymodiolus azoricus. Symbiosis 2020) or other organisms (such as Bird, A. M., von Dassow, G., &amp; Maslakova, S. A. How the pilidium larva grows. EvoDevo. 2014) that could be discussed.</p>

<p>Minor comments also include:</p>
<p>Consider changing the orientation of diagrams in Figure 2C' in relationship to Figure 2C and 2D-K.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments and suggestions from the reviewer. The Figure 2 has been reorganized.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the diagram in Figure 3K, please clarify if the arrows drawn for the direction of inter lamina water flow is based on gene expression, SEM, or some previous study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer's valuable feedback and suggestions. The arrows in the figure indicate the direction of water flow that could be affected by specific types of cilium. Our prediction is based on both gene expression and SEM results. To further clarify this point, we have revised the figure legend of Fig. 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please include a label for the clusters in Figure 5E for consistency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised our Figure 5E to keep our figures consistent.</p>

<p>Please include a note in the Materials and Methods for Monocle analysis in Figure 6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We conducted Monocle analyses using Monocle2 and Monocle 3 in R environment. We have revised our material and methods with further information of Figure 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Supplement 2, the first column is labeled PEBC while the first row is labeled PEBZ versus all other rows and columns have corresponding names. I am guessing this is a typo and not different clusters?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the great effort of the reviewer in reviewing our manuscript. We have corrected the typo in the revised version.</p>
