<title>Abstract</title><p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects a significant proportion of men aged 40–70 and is caused by cavernous tissue dysfunction. Presently, the most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, this is less effective in patients with severe vascular disease such as diabetic ED. Therefore, there is a need for development of new treatment, which requires a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment and cell-cell communications under diabetic condition. Pericytes are vital in penile erection; however, their dysfunction due to diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to understand the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes in diabetic ED. We found a decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in diabetic fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. Moreover, the newly identified pericyte-specific marker, Limb Bud-Heart (Lbh), in mouse and human cavernous tissues, clearly distinguishing pericytes from smooth muscle cells. Cell–cell interaction analysis revealed that pericytes are involved in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types in the corpus cavernosum; however, these interactions were highly reduced under diabetic conditions. Lbh expression is low in diabetic pericytes, and overexpression of LBH prevents erectile function by regulating neurovascular regeneration. Furthermore, the LBH-interacting proteins (Crystallin Alpha B and Vimentin) were identified in mouse cavernous pericytes through LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that their interactions were critical for maintaining pericyte function. Thus, our study reveals novel targets and insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>1. We have clarified the specificity of Lbh as a pericyte marker in our dataset. Lbh exhibits specific expression patterns in both mouse and human penile tissues, but not in all the tissues we analyzed using Mouse Single Cell Atlas. Therefore, in some tissues, particularly in mouse penile tissue, Lbh may be a valuable marker for differentiating pericytes along with other established pericyte marker genes.
2. We have performed statistical analyses and added experimental data to support cell-cell communication and TF regulon analysis results.
3. We have emphasized the importance of the observed results related to the rescue of ED by Lbh overexpression and clarified the need for further mechanistic investigations in the discussion section.
4. We have acknowledged the limitation that our data may not definitively identify the specific cell types responsible for ED rescue and emphasized the need for further mechanistic studies.
5. We have added controls and performed Co-IP experiments to support the interaction between LBH and CRYAB/VIM1. The results provide evidence for the specific interaction of these proteins.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) is an age-dependent vascular disease, affecting 5–35% of men aged 40–70 in varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kubin et al., 2003</xref>). Although not fatal, 322 million men worldwide will be affected by the disease by 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ayta et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kessler et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, it occurs in up to 75% of diabetes cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sáenz de Tejada et al., 2002</xref>). This causes significant physical and psychological problems for patients and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bivalacqua et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, the cavernous tissue is more prone to this disease than other blood vessels; therefore, its malfunction is considered as a biomarker in the progression of cardiovascular and vascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miner, 2011</xref>). Current ED treatment involves the use of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, but patients with severe vascular disease, such as diabetic ED, are less responsive. This is mainly because severe vascular dysfunction caused by diabetes results in insufficient bioavailable nitric oxide (NO) for PDE5 inhibitors to induce penile erection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Angulo et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is necessary to identify novel therapeutic targets, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the cavernous microenvironment, including cell–cell interactions, regulatory signals, and molecular regulation. Although recent studies have proposed gene expression profiles of primary cultured cavernous cells exposed to hyperglycemic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Anita et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ghatak et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yin et al., 2021</xref>), the relevant cell-specific relationships and genetic mechanisms in cavernous tissues have not been elucidated yet.</p>
<p>Pericytes are vital in the pathogenesis of erectile function as their interactions with endothelial cells are essential for penile erection. Pericytes interact with various cell types (especially endothelial cells) and are involved in angiogenesis, vasoconstriction, and permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bergers and Song, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gerhardt and Betsholtz, 2003</xref>). Diabetes causes pericyte loss or dysfunction, thereby creating an imbalance between pericytes and endothelial cells, leading to vascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Liu et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Warmke et al., 2016</xref>). For example, diabetic retinopathy is characterized by pericyte loss, capillary basement membrane thickening, and increased permeability, leading to retinal hypoxia and inflammation. Pericytes are particularly sensitive to glucose oxidation, which further promotes pericyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Warmke et al., 2016</xref>). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in pericytes under hyperglycemic conditions, thereby stimulating the secretion of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) in peripheral nerve pericytes, leading to basement membrane thickening, neovascularization, and pericyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shimizu et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, our previous studies showed that restoring the content and function of cavernous pericytes significantly reduced the permeability of cavernous blood vessels and enhanced neurovascular regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yin et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yin et al., 2021</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the effect of diabetes on pericyte dysfunction in the ED remain unclear.</p>
<p>Smooth muscle cells are also a vital component of the cavernous tissues in penile erection. Diabetes mellitus leads to smooth muscle cell dysfunction, such as decreased cavernosal smooth muscle relaxation, resulting in an inability to obtain or maintain satisfactory erection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Reddy et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). Since the marker genes of pericytes and smooth muscle cells often overlap, and their expression patterns are tissue-specific, identifying suitable <italic>in vivo</italic> markers to accurately interpret transcriptional and phenotypic changes in these cell types is of utmost importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chasseigneaux et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Smyth et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have identified pericyte-specific markers in different tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baek et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sun et al., 2022</xref>), enabling characterization of various cell types and their cell–cell communication. In this study, a single-cell transcriptome analysis was performed to examine the cellular heterogeneity in erectile dysfunction caused by diabetes. The goal of this study was to identify markers specific to cavernous pericytes and understand their role in ED by exploring their interactions with other cell types.</p>

<title>Single cell transcriptional landscape of mouse cavernous tissue</title>
<p>To elucidate the cellular landscape of mouse cavernous tissue and transcriptional changes in diabetic ED at the cellular level, we conducted a single-cell transcriptome analysis, profiling 12,894 cells <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. The cells were grouped into 15 clusters based on their transcriptomic patterns, and cell types were annotated based on the expression of marker genes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1B, C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Clustering analysis identified fibroblasts (FB), chondrocytes (Chond), myofibroblasts (Myo-FB), lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC), valve-related LEC, vascular endothelial cells (VEC), smooth muscle cells (SMC), pericytes, Schwann cells, and macrophages. The Chond and FB subsets were further annotated with additional marker genes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1D, E, and</bold></xref> <bold>Supplementary Fig. 1).</bold></p>

<p>Furthermore, we analyzed cell type-specific transcriptional changes due to diabetes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1F</bold></xref> <bold>and Supplementary Fig. 2A-G)</bold>. We found that <italic>Nos3</italic> (highly expressed in the untreated diabetes group compared to the treatment group) decreased in diabetic valve-related LEC and VEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ismail et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, <italic>Igfbp2</italic> and <italic>Igfbp4</italic> (lowly expressed in the penis of diabetic rats) were also downregulated in diabetic SMC and chondrocytes, respectively, whereas <italic>Igfbp3</italic> was upregulated in diabetic FB and Myo-FB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelbaky et al., 1998</xref>). Collagen genes (vital in the corpus cavernosum structure) were significantly under expressed in diabetic FB, Chond, My-FB, and pericytes than in normal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>). Gene ontology analysis using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated that the genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis were downregulated in diabetic FB, Chonds, Myo-FBs, valve-related LEC, and pericytes compared to the cells under normal conditions <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1G</bold></xref> <bold>and Supplementary Fig. 3)</bold>. In contrast, diabetic mice showed an increase in ribosome- and translation-related terms <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1H</bold></xref> <bold>and Supplementary Fig. 4)</bold>. In Schwann cells, there were no significant DEGs between diabetic and normal cells.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Identifying specific markers for pericytes in mouse cavernosum tissues</title>
<p>We distinguished SMC from pericytes by examining the expression of previously known marker genes (<italic>Cnn1, Acta2, Myh11, Tagln,</italic> and <italic>Actg2</italic> for SMC, <italic>Rgs5</italic>, <italic>Pdgfrb, Cspg4, Kcnj8, Higd1b,</italic> and <italic>Cox4i2</italic> for pericytes) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref> <bold>and Supplementary Fig. 5A)</bold>. However, rather than being exclusively expressed in each cell type, known marker genes were co-expressed in each cell type. To ensure proper annotation of SMC and pericytes, we identified the gene sets enriched in each cluster through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We found that the gene sets matching pericyte and SMC functions were enriched in each cluster <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. Gene sets related to the regulation of blood vessels and leukocytes were enriched in pericytes, whereas gene sets related to actin or muscles were enriched in SMC, suggesting that these clusters were properly annotated. In addition, we screened six genes (<italic>Lbh, Ednra, Gpc3, Npy1r, Pln,</italic> and <italic>Atp1b2</italic>) that were highly expressed in the pericyte cluster from the single-cell analysis results <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref> <bold>and Supplementary Fig. 5B)</bold>. When we calculate AUC scores for the markers, <italic>Rgs5</italic> had the highest AUC, but <italic>Rgs5</italic> was also expressed in SMCs in our data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref> <bold>and Supplementary Fig. 5C</bold>). <italic>Pln, Ednra, Gpc3,</italic> and <italic>Npy1r</italic> also seemed to be candidate markers, but the literature search excluded these genes as they are also expressed in the SMCs of other tissues or different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guo et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Haghighi et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kowalczyk et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wittrisch et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Atp1b2</italic> was also excluded because its protein expression was detected in both mouse cavernous pericytes and aortic SMC using immunofluorescence (IF) staining (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 5D)</bold>. In the single-cell data, <italic>Lbh</italic> (Limb Bud-Heart) was more specific for pericytes than <italic>Rgs5</italic>, a well-known marker for distinguishing between SMC and pericytes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2A, C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. IF staining showed that LBH was optimally expressed in mouse cavernous pericyte, whereas it was rarely expressed in the smooth muscle cell (SMC) of the aorta, consistent with our single-cell data <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref><bold>, top panel and Supplementary Fig. 5E).</bold>.In the blood vessels of other organs such as the bladder, aorta, and kidney, CD31-expressing endothelial cells were surrounded by Lbh-expressing pericytes but did not merge <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2D</bold></xref><bold>, bottom panel)</bold>. LBH expression was easily distinguishable from α-SMA in mouse cavernosum, dorsal artery and dorsal vein tissues in penile tissue, and is more specific than traditional pericyte markers (PDGFRβ) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2E</bold></xref>). For instance, PDGFRβ is expressed in pericytes and other surrounding tissue cells (as indicated by arrows and dotted area).</p>

<p>Finally, we examined <italic>Lbh</italic> expression patterns in various mouse tissues using the mouse single-cell atlas (Tabula Muris), although endothelial and pericyte clusters were not subclustered in most tissues from Tabula Muris. To identify pericytes, we relied on the expression pattern of known marker genes (<italic>Pecam1</italic> for endothelial cells, <italic>Rgs5</italic>, <italic>Pdgfrb</italic>, and <italic>Cspg4</italic> for pericytes). <italic>Lbh</italic> was expressed in pericytes of the bladder, heart and aorta, kidney, and trachea but not as specifically in penile pericytes (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6A-D</bold>). However, it is worth noting that other known pericyte markers were also did not exhibit exclusive expression in pericytes across all the tissues we analyzed. Therefore, in certain tissues, particularly in mouse penile tissues, <italic>Lbh</italic> may be a valuable marker in conjunction with other established pericyte marker genes for distinguishing pericytes.</p>

<title>Interactions between pericyte and other cell types in diabetes versus normal</title>
<p>Pericytes regulate various physiological functions involving other cell types such as EC and SMC. We compared the cell–cell interactions between pericytes and other cell types based on ligand-receptor interactions in single-cell data from mouse cavernous tissues under normal and hyperglycemic conditions. In diabetes, angiogenesis-related interactions, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), were reduced between pericytes and other cell types compared to those under normal conditions <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3A-C</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. In addition, interactions related to neuronal survival, adhesion, migration, and proliferation decreased in diabetic mice, as opposed to an increase in BMP signaling-related interactions <bold>(Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 8)</bold>. In addition to cell–cell interactions, the overall gene sets associated with angiogenesis, adhesion, and cell migration in pericytes were downregulated under diabetic conditions <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3D</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. We performed gene regulatory network analysis to compare the activities of transcription factors (TFs) in pericytes under diabetic and normal conditions. In normal pericytes, TFs promoting angiogenesis (<italic>Klf5</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, <italic>Lmo2</italic>, <italic>Junb</italic>, and <italic>Elk1</italic>) were significantly more active than in diabetic pericytes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3E</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>. In contrast, TFs that inhibit angiogenesis (<italic>Ppard</italic> and <italic>Hoxd10</italic>) were more active in diabetes. Experimental data indicated that the expression level of <italic>Lmo2</italic>, <italic>Junb</italic>, <italic>Elk1</italic>, and <italic>Hoxd10</italic> was higher (<italic>Hoxd10</italic>) or lower (<italic>Lmo2</italic>, <italic>Junb</italic>, <italic>Elk1</italic>) in diabetic pericytes compared to normal pericytes (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 9</bold>). Furthermore, using the proteome profiler mouse angiogenesis array, we tested 53 angiogenesis factors in cavernous tissue, among which the expression of OPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dai et al., 2009</xref>), CD105 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Browne et al., 2018</xref>), TSP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kyriakides et al., 2001</xref>), IGFBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2020</xref>), and IGFBP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lin et al., 2003</xref>) decreased under diabetic conditions, while MMP-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abdul et al., 2023</xref>), Angiogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Neubauer-Geryk et al., 2012</xref>), and PF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cella et al., 1986</xref>) increased <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3F</bold></xref> <bold>and Supplementary Table 1)</bold>. MMP-3 expression in the neurovascular unit is enhanced under diabetic conditions, leading to vascular damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abdul et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, angiogenesis activity decreased in mouse cavernous pericytes (MCPs) under diabetic conditions.</p>

<title>LBH improves erectile function under diabetic conditions through enhanced neurovascular regeneration</title>
<p>LBH is vital in promoting angiogenesis in human glioma under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). We performed IF staining for LBH and another pericyte marker (CD140b) in mouse cavernous tissues to explore the effect of LBH on erectile dysfunction. We found that LBH and CD140b expression significantly decreased in the pericytes under diabetic conditions compared to those in age-matched controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4A, C</bold></xref>). In addition, we assessed the expression of LBH <italic>in vitro</italic> under diabetic conditions and found that its expression was significantly decreased compared to that under normal conditions in mouse cavernous pericytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4B, D</bold></xref>). All IF staining results were confirmed by western blotting (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4E, F</bold></xref>). In addition, we overexpressed LBH in diabetic mice by intracavernosal injection of lentiviruses containing an ORF mouse clone of <italic>Lbh</italic> and assessed erectile function two weeks later. During electrical stimulation, the ratios of maximal and total intracavernous pressure (ICP) to mean systolic blood pressure (MSBP) were significantly reduced in PBS- and lentivirus ORF control particle-treated diabetic mice compared to age-matched controls. However, LBH overexpression in diabetic mice significantly improved this erection parameter, reaching 84% of the control values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4G, H</bold></xref> <bold>and Supplementary Table 2</bold>). Moreover, IF staining for CD31 (an endothelial cell marker), NG2 (a pericyte marker), neurofilament-2000 (NF), and neuronal NOS (nNOS) revealed that LBH overexpression significantly improved the endothelial cell, pericyte, and neuronal cell contents in diabetic mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4I-N</bold></xref>). These effects were achieved by inducing the survival cells in the cavernosum tissues (such as decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation, migration, and tube formation) and major pelvic ganglion (MPG) neurite sprouting under diabetic conditions (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 10</bold>). Thus, LBH is vital in promoting neurovascular regeneration under diabetic conditions.</p>

<title>LBH-interacting protein identification in mouse cavernous pericytes</title>
<p>We conducted LC-MS/MS analysis following the immunoprecipitation of LBH from mouse cavernous pericytes to further elucidate the LBH-mediated systematic network in mouse cavernous pericytes.

In addition, the proteins involved in ‘angiogenesis’ and ‘response to estradiol’ that are associated with pericyte activity were also included in this PPI network. Since the expression of LBH was decreased in the pericytes under diabetic conditions, we identified the expression level of angiogenesis and nerve system-related genes in diabetic pericytes using single-cell data. GSEA showed that gene sets related to angiogenesis and the nervous system were enriched in normal pericytes compared to diabetic pericytes <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6G</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DM is a major cause of ED, and poor long-term glycemic control can lead to nerve and blood vessel damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Desai et al., 2023</xref>). Many studies have outlined angiogenic and neurotrophic factors, such as VEGF, Comp-Ang1, dickkopf2, leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT3) that been tested as therapeutic options for ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bennett et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Burchardt et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hu et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jin et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yin et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). However, poor efficacy, side effects such as inflammation, and complex drug-protein engineering have limited their success in clinical trials. A more detailed understanding of the intercellular signaling mechanisms and microenvironment in the penis under physiological and pathological conditions are necessary to provide more effective therapeutic targets. We therefore employed single-cell RNA sequencing to dissect the complex transcriptional changes in various cell types in ED using a diabetes-induced ED mouse model, as diabetic ED accounts for 75% of ED patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sáenz de Tejada et al., 2002</xref>). Our findings from <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were confirmed using human data and samples, enabling us to understand how the results from mouse models could be translated to humans and developed as novel treatment targets.</p>
<p>It is well known that ED is a complex neurovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Leung et al., 2004</xref>), but the mechanism by which diabetes causes ED is still unclear. Many studies have showed that type 1 diabetes induces ED through different physiological processes, such as affecting penile contraction and relaxation, immune inflammatory response, neuropathy, structural and functional disturbance of cavernous smooth muscle cells, and dysfunction of endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Liu et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Thorve et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). Although other major cell populations in penile tissue such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cell, and fibroblasts have been extensively studied, pericytes have mainly been investigated in the context of the central nervous system (CNS). For example, in the CNS, pericytes are involved in maintaining the integrity of the brain’s blood-brain barrier (BBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ferland-McCollough et al., 2017</xref>), regulating blood flow at capillary junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gonzales et al., 2020</xref>), and promoting neuroinflammatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brown et al., 2019</xref>), whose dysfunction is considered an important factor in the progression of vascular diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Winkler et al., 2014</xref>). But little is known about the role of pericytes in penile tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">De Leonardis et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Souza et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). In order to explore the role of pericytes in repairing the corpus cavernosum vascular and neural tissues damaged by DM, we focused on pericytes, which are multipotent perivascular cells that contribute to the generation and repair of various tissues in response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Birbrair et al., 2015</xref>). Although recent studies have shown that pericytes are involved in physiological mechanisms of erection, little is known about their detailed mechanisms. Many known pericyte markers are co-expressed in other cell types; thus, identifying the specific marker genes for pericytes <italic>in vivo</italic> is the first step characterizing pericyte cell type. From the pericyte cluster in the single-cell RNA sequencing results, we found that <italic>Lbh, Ednra, Gpc3, Npy1r, Plm,</italic> and <italic>Atp1b2</italic> are specific pericyte markers (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 7</bold>). LBH was identified as a pericyte-positive and SMC-negative marker that was also highly expressed in human cavernous pericytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>) and was validated through IF staining in many vascular tissues and cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2</bold></xref>). As it is widely known, peicytes are primarily located in capillaries, where they surround endothelial cells of blood vessels. However, recent discoveries have identified cells with pericyte-like characteristics in the walls of large blood vessels, challenging the traditional concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Avolio and Madeddu, 2016</xref>). In our recent studies, we observed minimal overlap in staining between LBH and α-SMA, suggesting that the cells expressing LBH were not smooth muscle cells but possibly pericyte-like cells in large vessels. In small vessels within the bladder, kidney, and even the aorta, we found LBH-expressing cells surrounding CD31-expressing vessels, consistent with the known characteristics of pericytes. Further research is needed to comprehend the differences in LBH expression and its characteristics in both large and small blood vessels.</p>
<p>Lbh, a highly conserved transcription cofactor, is known to participate in early limb and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Briegel and Joyner, 2001</xref>). Moreover, LBH can directly target the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rieger et al., 2010</xref>) and regulate neural crest cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Powder et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, Jiang et al. showed that LBH overexpression promotes angiogenesis via VEGF-mediated ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, LBH inhibits cell migration and angiogenesis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wu et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). These inconsistent results may be related to different histopathological environments. Thus, LBH has dual effects on the development of blood vessels and the nervous system, similar to other angioneurins such as VEGF and BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zacchigna et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we explored the role of Lbh in the penile tissues of diabetic mice. Interestingly, Lbh expression was significantly lower in cavernous pericytes in a diabetic mouse model. Therefore, we hypothesized that the restoration of Lbh expression in the penis of diabetic mice will improve erectile function. To test our hypothesis, we utilized the diabetes-induced ED mouse model, commonly employed in various studies focusing on microvascular complications associated with type 1 diabetes. We observed that the overexpression of LBH in diabetic mice led to the restoration of reduced erectile function by enhancing neurovascular regeneration. However, this study primarily demonstrated the observed phenomenon without delving into the detailed mechanisms. In addition, our findings suggest that LBH can affect the function of cavernous pericytes, although we cannot definitively conclude which specific-cavernous cell types are affected by the overexpressed LBH, whether it be cavernous endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or others. Subsequent research will be required to conduct more comprehensive mechanistic investigations, such as <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using cavernous endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts to address these knowledge gaps. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that LBH can restores diabetes-induced ED by facilitating neurovascular regeneration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that CRYAB promotes angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Dimberg et al., 2008</xref>) and interacts with LBH in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, where it enhances cell survival by inhibiting the autoproteolytic maturation of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, our LC-MS/MS analysis of LBH following immunoprecipitation of MCPs identified VIM as a novel interaction partner and CRYAB (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). In addition, we assessed the expression of CRYAB and VIM under diabetic conditions. Unexpectedly, the expression of VIM was increased, whereas that of CRYAB was downregulated in the penis of diabetic mice and MCPs under diabetic conditions. VIM is a type III intermediate filament protein expressed in mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dave and Bayless, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). It is involved in cell adhesion, migration, cellular integrity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the malignant transformation and metastatic spread of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chen et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dave and Bayless, 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). It is a multifunctional protein that interacts with several other proteins with many functions under various pathophysiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Danielsson et al., 2018</xref>). For example, VIM interacts with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, promotes axonal extension, and serves as a double-edged sword in the nervous system by regulating axonal regeneration, myelination, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>VIM</italic> knockout mice were less susceptible to bacterial infections and had a reduced inflammatory response than wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Moisan et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, <italic>VIM</italic> deficiency was shown to prevent obesity and insulin resistance in type 2 DM by reducing CD36 expression on plasma membranes and intracellular trafficking of glucose transporter type 4 in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the combination of LBH with CRYAB and VIM could improve neurovascular regeneration in diabetic ED by activating the angiogenic effects of CRYAB and potentially reducing the inflammatory effects of VIM. Collectively, the discovery of the LBH-CRYAB-VIM interaction opens the door to a more specific understanding of the role of pericytes in diabetic ED. However, the clinical implications of these results remain uncertain. Future research endeavors should focus on incorporating LBH-CRYAB-VIM into therapeutic strategies for diabetes and ED.</p>
<p>As far as our knowledge extends, this study marks the first demonstration of LBH’s efficacy in restoring erectile function in mice with diabetes-induced ED. This not only introduces a novel approach to addressing diabetic ED but also carries substantial clinical relevance in mitigating other complications associated with diabetes.</p>

<title>Ethics statement and animal study design</title>
<p>Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Orient Bio, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) were used in this study. Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Subcommittee of Inha university (approval number: 200910-719). Animals were monitored daily for health and behavior as previous studies described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ghatak et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yin, 2022</xref>). Briefly, mice were maintained at room temperature (RT) (23 ± 2°C), 40-60% relative humidity, 12 hours light/dark cycle, and specific pathogen-free conditions. Sixty adult male C57BL/6 mice were used for single cell sequencing analysis, mouse cavernous pericyte culture (<italic>in vitro</italic> study), and erectile function evaluation (<italic>in vivo</italic> study). All animals were anesthetized with intramuscular injections of ketamine (100 mg/kg, Yuhan Corp., Seoul, Korea) and xylazine (5 mg/kg, Bayer Korea, Seoul, Korea). Animals were euthanized by 100% CO<sub>2</sub> gas exchange in a closed container at a CO<sub>2</sub> exchange rate of 10-30% container volume/min. In this study, a total of 90 eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were used (10 for single cell RNA sequencing; 40 for mouse cavernous pericyte culture and related experiments; 20 for erectile function evaluated experiment; 20 for angiogenesis array and other fluorescence examinations.). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jin et al., 2009</xref>). Shortly, low doses of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg, i.p., Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was injected for 5 consecutive days. Eight weeks later, only mice with a tail vein blood glucose level higher than 300 mg/dL and significantly decreased body weights were considered to have DM. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels were determined using an Accu-Check blood glucose meter (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) before starting all <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Body weights of STZ-treated (diabetic) mice were significantly lower than those of age-matched non-diabetic controls. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose concentrations were significantly higher in diabetic mice than in non-diabetic controls. However, diabetic mice infected with lentiviruses ORF control particles or lentiviruses containing ORF mouse clone of <italic>Lbh</italic> had no body weights and blood glucose levels change. Mean systolic blood pressures (MSBP) were similar in three STZ-treated groups and the non-diabetic control group (<bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). No mice died during erectile function evaluation experiment, and all experiments were performed in a blinded manner.</p>
<p>To test the efficacy of LBH on erectile function, the mice were distributed into four groups as follows: control nondiabetic mice (n = 5) and mice with STZ-induced diabetes receiving one successive intracavernous injections of phosphate-buffered saline (n = 5, PBS, 20 µL), lentiviruses ORF control particles (n = 5, NC, 5×10<sup>4</sup> infection units in 20 µL; Origene Technology, Rockville, MD, USA) or lentiviruses containing ORF mouse clone of <italic>Lbh</italic>(n = 5, LBH O/E, 5×10<sup>4</sup> infection units in 20 µL; Origene Technology) into the midportion of the corpus cavernosum. A vascular clamp was used to pressurize the bottom of penises immediately before injection and was left in place for 30 minutes to restrict blood outflow.</p>

<p>After mice were euthanized, the penis tissues (n = 5 for each group) were harvested, minced and digested using Multi Tissue dissociation kit (Miltenyi, 130-110-201) with minor modifications as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Park et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the small size of mouse penile tissues, we pooled 5 corpus cavernosum tissues for each group. Briefly, tissues were homogenized using 21G and 26 1/2 G syringes. The tissues were digested with 50 µL of Enzyme D, 25 µL of Enzyme R and 6.75 µL of Enzyme A in 500 µL of DMEM and incubated for 10 minutes at 37 °C. The enzymes were deactivated by 10% FBS and solution was then passed through tip strainer (70 µm and then 40 µm). After centrifugation at 1,000 RPM for 5 minutes, cell pellet was incubated with 1 ml of RBC lysis buffer on ice for 3 minutes. After the cell number and viability were analyzed by using Countess AutoCounter (Invitrogen, C10227), the single cell suspension was loaded onto 10x Chromium Single Cell instrument (10x Genomics).

<title>Quality control, clustering, and cell type annotation</title>
<p>FASTQ files from sequencing were aligned to the mouse reference sequence (mm10) using CellRanger count pipeline (10x Genomics, Version 3.0.2). Filtered feature-barcode matrices outputs by CellRanger were used to create Seurat objects for single cell RNA sequencing data analysis (Seurat v3.1.5). Cells with the number of genes less than 200 were filtered out from Seurat objects. Quality controlled data were normalized using NormalizeData function with default parameters. Highly variable features were identified using the FindVariableFeatures function with default parameters. Data were scaled by setting the number of UMI as variables to regress out using ScaleData function. The scaled data were merged into one Seurat object, and then normalized, and highly variable genes were identified and scaled. Linear dimensional reduction performed using RunPCA function with 30 principal components. The RunHarmony function was used to correct the batch effect between the merged data. Cells were clustered based on similar feature expression patterns using FindClusters function (resolution = 1.5) and FindNeighbors (reduction = “harmony”, dims = 1:20). To visualize and explore data, non-linear dimensional reduction was performed using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). To merge clusters with similar gene expression patterns, FindMarkers function (test.use = ‘bimod’) parameters was used to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and cluster pairs with less than 10 DEGs (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01, log_fold change ≥ 1) were merged. DEGs of each cluster were found using FindAllMarkers function (max.cells.per.ident = 100, min.diff.pct = 0.3, only.pos = TRUE).</p>

AUC scores of <italic>Rgs5, Pln, Ednra, Npylr, Atp1b2</italic>, and <italic>Gpc3</italic> for ability of a binary classifier to distinguish between pericyte and the other cell types in mouse penile tissues were measured by using FindMarkers function (test.use = ‘roc’). An pseudobulk DEG analysis for Lbh vs SMC or the other cell-types was performed by using FindMarkers function (test.use = ‘DESeq2). For the DESeq2 test, we added a pseudo-count of 1 to all read counts. Gene ontology analysis was performed using DAVID with significant DEGs as inputs. Gene ontology analysis on molecules of the protein-protein interaction network included parent terms (GOTERM_BP_5), and the others were gene ontology mappings directly annotated by the source database (GOTERM_BP_DIRECT). Only terms with p-value &lt; 0.05 and FDR &lt; 0.25 were considered significant gene ontology.</p>

<title>Single cell gene regulatory network analysis</title>
<p>Transcription factor (TF) activity of normal or diabetic pericyte were identified using SCENIC R package (v1.1.2-01). To avoid narrow comparison of TF activity in pericytes between normal and diabetic conditions that could lead to faulty reasoning, we included SMCs in the comparison as well. Raw count matrices of SMC and Pericyte extracted from the Seurat object were used as input for SCENIC. 10 kb around the transcription start site (TSS) and 500 bp upstream of the TSS were selected for motif ranking. Genes in input matrix were filtered using geneFiltering function with default parameters. To split targets into positive and negative correlated targets, the correlation was calculated using runCorrelation function. Potential transcription factor targets were inferred using runGenie3 function. Building and scoring the gene regulatory network were performed using runSCENIC functions. Clustering and dimensionality reduction on the regulon activity were performed using tsneAUC function. Only angiogenesis-related TFs with differences in activity between normal and diabetic pericytes were visualized in the heatmap. To assess differential regulon activities of transcription factors between diabetic pericytes and normal pericytes, we used generalized linear model using the scaled activity scores for each cell from SCENIC as input. We ran the generalized linear model using glm function in R programming.</p>

<title>Cell-cell interaction analysis</title>
<p>Ligand-receptor communications between cell types were predicted using CellPhoneDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb">https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb</ext-link>) and CellChat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat">https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat</ext-link>). Normalized single cell data was used as input for analysis. We performed CellPhoneDB with the statistical method. Interactions that did not differ by more than 0.25-fold mean values between diabetes and normal were considered to have no significant difference. Even if there is a difference in the mean value between diabetes and normal, interactions with p-value of 1 in both diabetes and normal were considered insignificant. The outputs of CellPhoneDB were visualized using ktplot in R. CellChat was performed according to tutorial for comparison analysis of multiple datasets with different cell type compositions. CellphoneDB permutes the cluster labels of all cells 1000 times and calculates the mean(mean(molecule 1 in cluster X), mean(molecule 2 in cluster Y)) at each time for each interaction pair, for each pairwise comparison between two cell types. We only considered interactions in which the difference in means calculated by these permutations were greater than 0.25-fold between diabetes and normal. Also, we considered that there is no interaction when the P-value is 1 and that the interactions with P-value &lt; 0.05 were significant.</p>

The indicated bands (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref>, framed in red dot line) were excised from SDS-PAGE gels, and Nano LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using an Easy n-LC (Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA, USA) and an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a nano-electrospray source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Samples were separated on a C18 nanobore column (150 mm × 0.1 mm, 3 μm pore size; Agilent). Mobile phase A for LC separation was 0.1% formic acid plus 3% acetonitrile in deionized water and mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The chromatography gradient was designed to achieve a linear increase from 0% B to 32% B in 23 minutes, 32% B to 60% B in 3 minutes, 95% B in 3 minutes, and 0% B in 6 minutes. The flow rate was maintained at 1500 nl/min. Mass spectra were acquired using data-dependent acquisition with a full mass scan (350–1800 m/z) followed by 10 MS/MS scans. For MS1 full scans, the orbitrap resolution was 15,000 and the AGC was 2 × 10<sup>5</sup>. For MS/MS in the LTQ, the AGC was 1 × 10<sup>4</sup>. The Mascot algorithm (Matrix Science, USA) was used to identify peptide sequences present in a protein sequence database. Database search criteria were as follows: taxonomy, Homo sapiens, Mus musculus; fixed modification, carbamidomethylated at cysteine residues; variable modification, oxidized at methionine residues; maximum allowed missed cleavages, 2; MS tolerance, 10 ppm; MS/MS tolerance, 0.8 Da. Only peptides resulting from trypsin digests were considered. Peptides were filtered with a significance threshold of P &lt; 0.05.</p>

<title>Immunoblots and Immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Cells and tissues were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease (GenDEPOT, LLC, Katy, TX, USA) and phosphatase (GenDEPOT, LLC) inhibitors. Equal amounts of proteins (30 µg per lane) from whole-cell or tissue lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8% to 15% gels, and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. After blocking with 5% non-fat dried milk for 1 hour at RT, membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight with the following primary antibodies: anti-LBH (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-Vimentin (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-CRYAB (1:1000; Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation, 10% (50 μg) of lysate was used as positive control (Input), 500 μg of lysate was incubated with the indicated antibody (1–2 μg) for 3–4 hours at 4°C followed by overnight incubation with Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with RIPA buffer, and then were resolved by SDS–PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Densitometric analyses of Western blot bands were performed using Image J software (National Institutes of Health [NIH] 1.34, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Results are expressed as the means ± SEMs of at least four independent experiments. The unpaired t test was used to compare two groups, and One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for four-group comparisons. The analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism version 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>), and statistical significance was accepted for P values &lt;0.05.</p>

<p>The authors have made <bold>important</bold> contributions to our understanding of the pathogenesis of erectile dysfunction (ED) in diabetic patients. They have identified the gene Lbh, expressed in pericytes of the penis and decreased in diabetic animals. Overexpression of Lbh appears to counteract ED in these animals. The authors also confirm Lbh as a potential marker in cavernous tissues in both humans and mice. While <bold>solid</bold> evidence supports Lbh's functional role as a marker gene, further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which it exerts its effects. This work is of interest to those working in the fields of ED and angiogenesis.</p>

<p>In this study, the researchers aimed to investigate the cellular landscape and cell-cell interactions in cavernous tissues under diabetic conditions, specifically focusing on erectile dysfunction (ED). They employed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression patterns in various cell types within the cavernous tissues of diabetic individuals. The researchers identified decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in several cell types, including fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. They also discovered a newly identified marker, LBH, that distinguishes pericytes from smooth muscle cells in mouse and human cavernous tissues. Furthermore, the study revealed that pericytes play a role in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types within the corpus cavernosum. However, these interactions were found to be significantly reduced under diabetic conditions. The study also investigated the role of LBH and its interactions with other proteins (CRYAB and VIM) in maintaining pericyte function and highlighted their potential involvement in regulating neurovascular regeneration. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and the study provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes and identifies potential therapeutic targets for further investigation.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>For Figure 4, immunofluorecent staining of LBH following intracavernous injections with lentiviruses is required to justify overexpression and tissue specificity.</p>

<p>Bae et al. described the key roles of pericytes in cavernous tissues in diabetic erectile dysfunction using both mouse and human single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is caused by dysfunction of the cavernous tissue and affects a significant proportion of men aged 40-70. The most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, these are less effective in patients with diabetic ED. Therefore, there is an unmet need for a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment, cell-cell communications in patients with diabetic ED, and the development of new therapeutic treatments to improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>Pericytes are mesenchymal-derived mural cells that directly interact with capillary endothelial cells (ECs). They play a vital role in the pathogenesis of erectile function as their interactions with ECs are essential for penile erection. Loss of pericytes has been associated with diabetic retinopathy, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease and has been investigated in relation to the permeability of cavernous blood vessels and neurovascular regeneration in the authors' previous studies. This manuscript explores the mechanisms underlying the effect of diabetes on pericyte dysfunction in ED. Additionally, the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes were carefully examined using both mouse and human single-cell RNA sequencing in diabetic ED. The novelty of this work lies in the identification of a newly identified pericyte (PC)-specific marker, LBH, in mouse and human cavernous tissues, which distinguishes pericytes from smooth muscle cells. LBH not only serves as a cavernous pericyte marker, but its expression level is also reduced in diabetic conditions. The LBH-interacting proteins (Cryab and Vim) were further identified in mouse cavernous pericytes, indicating that these signaling interactions are critical for maintaining normal pericyte function. Overall, this study demonstrates the novel marker of pericytes and highlights the critical role of pericytes in diabetic ED.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>Bae and colleagues substantially improved the data quality and revised their manuscript &quot;Pericytes contribute to pulmonary vascular remodeling via HIF2a signaling&quot;. While these revisions clarify some of the concerns raised, others remain. In my view, the following question must be addressed.</p>
<p>In my prior question on #3, I completely disagree with the statement that &quot;identified cells with pericyte-like characteristics in the walls of large blood vessels&quot;. The staining that authors provided for LBH, was clearly stained for SMCs, not pericytes. Per Fig 2E, the authors are correct that LBH is colocalized with SMA+ cells( SMCs). However, the red signal from LBH clearly stains endothelial cells. In the rest of 2E and 2D, LBH is CD31- and their location suggests LBH stained for SMCs in the Aorta, Kidney vasculature, Dorsal vein, and Dorsal Artery.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, the researchers aimed to investigate the cellular landscape and cell-cell interactions in cavernous tissues under diabetic conditions, specifically focusing on erectile dysfunction (ED). They employed single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression patterns in various cell types within the cavernous tissues of diabetic individuals. The researchers identified decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in several cell types, including fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. They also discovered a newly identified marker, LBH, that distinguishes pericytes from smooth muscle cells in mouse and human cavernous tissues. Furthermore, the study revealed that pericytes play a role in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types within the corpus cavernosum. However, these interactions were found to be significantly reduced under diabetic conditions. The study also investigated the role of LBH and its interactions with other proteins (CRYAB and VIM) in maintaining pericyte function and highlighted their potential involvement in regulating neurovascular regeneration. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and the study provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes and identifies potential therapeutic targets for further investigation.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary: In this manuscript, the authors performed single cell RNA-sequencing of cells from the penises of healthy and diabetes mellitus model (STZ injection-based) mice, identified <italic>Lbh</italic> as a marker of penis pericytes, and report that penis-specific overexpression of <italic>Lbh</italic> is sufficient to rescue erectile function in diabetic animals. In public human single cell RNA-sea datasets, the authors report that <italic>LBH</italic> is similarly specific to pericytes and down regulated in diabetic patients. Additionally, the authors report discovery of CRYAB and VIM1 as protein interacting partners with LBH.</p>
<p>The authors contributions are of interest to the erectile dysfunction community and their <italic>Lbh</italic> overexpression experiments are especially interesting and well-conducted. However, claims in the manuscript regarding the specificity of <italic>Lbh</italic> as a pericyte marker, the mechanism by which <italic>Lbh</italic> overexpression rescues erectile function, cell-cell interactions impaired by diabetes, and protein-interaction partners require qualification or further evidence to justify.</p>
<p>Major claims and evidence:</p>
<p>1. Marker gene specificity and quantification: One of the authors' major contributions is the identification of <italic>Lbh</italic> as a marker of pericytes in their data. The authors present qualitative evidence for this marker gene relationship, but it is unclear from the data presented if <italic>Lbh</italic> is truly a specific marker gene for the pericyte lineage (either based on gene expression or IF presented in Fig. 2D, E). Prior results (see Tabula Muris Consortium, 2018) suggest that <italic>Lbh</italic> is widely expressed in non-pericyte cell types, so the claims presented in the manuscript may be overly broad. Even if <italic>Lbh</italic> is not a globally specific marker, the authors' subsequent intervention experiments argue that it is still an important gene worth studying.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We appreciate this comment. In our scRNAseq data for the mouse cavernosum tissues, previously known markers such as Rgs5, Pdgfrb, Cspg4, Kcnj8, Higd1b, and Cox4i2 were found to be expressed not exclusively in pericytes, while Lbh exhibited specific expression patterns in pericytes (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5). LBH expression was easily distinguishable from α-SMA, not only in mouse cavernosum but also in dorsal artery and dorsal vein tissues within penile tissues. This distinctive expression pattern of LBH was also observed in the human cavernous pericytes (Fig. 5). Then, we examined Lbh expression patterns in various mouse tissues using the mouse single-cell atlas (Tabula Muris), although endothelial and pericyte clusters were not subclustered in most tissues from Tabula Muris. To identify pericytes, we relied on the expression pattern of known marker genes (Pecam1 for endothelial cells, Rgs5, Pdgfrb, and Cspg4 for pericytes). Lbh was expressed in pericytes of the bladder, heart and aorta, kidney, and trachea but not as specifically in penile pericytes (Supplementary Fig. 6A-D). However, it is worth noting that other known pericyte markers were also did not exhibit exclusive expression in pericytes across all the tissues we analyzed. Therefore, in certain tissues, particularly in mouse penile tissues, Lbh may be a valuable marker in conjunction with other established pericyte marker genes for distinguishing pericytes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Cell-cell communication and regulon activity changes in the diabetic penis: The authors present cell-cell communication analysis and TF regulon analysis in Fig 3 and report differential activities in healthy and DM mice. These results are certainly interesting, however, no statistical analyses are performed to justify claimed changes in the disease state and no validations are performed. It is therefore challenging to interpret these results, and the relevant claims do not seem well supported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: In response to these helpful suggestions, we calculated statistical significance and performed experimental validation. CellphoneDB permutes the cluster labels of all cells 1000 times and calculates the mean(mean(molecule 1 in cluster X), mean(molecule 2 in cluster Y)) at each time for each interaction pair, for each pairwise comparison between two cell types. We only considered interactions in which the difference in means calculated by these permutations were greater than 0.25-fold between diabetes and normal. Also, we considered that the interactions with P-value &lt; 0.05 were significant.</p>
<p>To assess differential regulon activities of transcription factor (SCENIC) between diabetic and normal pericytes, we utilized a generalized linear model with scaled activity scores for each cell as input. These scaled regulon activity values for angiogenesis-related TFs exhibited differences between diabetic and normal pericytes. The results of the generalized linear model revealed that Klf5, Egr1, and Junb were TFs with significantly altered regulon activities in diabetic pericytes. Experimental data indicated that the expression level of Lmo2, Junb, Elk1, and Hoxd10 was higher (Hoxd10) or lower (Lmo2, Junb, Elk1) in diabetic pericytes compared to normal pericytes (Supplementary Fig. 9). We have added the scaled regulon activity values and statistical significance in Fig. 3E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Rescue of ED by Lbh overexpression: This is a striking and very interesting result that warrants attention. By simple overexpression of the pericyte marker gene Lbh, the authors report rescue of erectile function in diabetic animals. While mechanistic details are lacking, the phenomenon appears to have a large effect size and the experiments appear sophisticated and well conducted. If anything, the authors appear to underplay the magnitude of this result.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We appreciate this comment. Therefore, we have added relevant clarification in the revised manuscript discussion section to emphasize the importance of LBH overexpression on rescuing ED as follows: “To test our hypothesis, we utilized the diabetes-induced ED mouse model, commonly employed in various studies focusing on microvascular complications associated with type 1 diabetes. We observed that the overexpression of LBH in diabetic mice led to the restoration of reduced erectile function by enhancing neurovascular regeneration. However, this study primarily demonstrated the observed phenomenon without delving into the detailed mechanisms. Nonetheless, these results of LBH on erections provide us with new strategies for treating ED and should be of considerable concern.” (Please see revised ‘Discussion’)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Mechanistic claims for rescue of ED by Lbh overexpression: The authors claim that cell type-specific effects on MPCs are responsible for the rescue of erectile function induced by Lbh overexpression. This causal claim is unsupported by the data, which only show that Lbh overexpression influences MPC performance. In vivo, it's likely that Lbh is being over expressed by diverse cell types, any of which could be the causal driver of ED rescue. In fact, the authors report rescue of cell type abundance in endothelial cells and neuronal cells. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that MPC effects alone or in principal are responsible for ED rescue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with these claims. Therefore, we have added relevant clarifications in the discussion section of the revised manuscript. Our findings suggest that LBH can affect the function of cavernous pericytes, although we cannot definitively specify which particular cavernous cell types are affected by the overexpressed LBH, whether it be cavernous endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or others. Subsequent research will be required to conduct more comprehensive mechanistic investigations, such as in vitro studies using cavernous endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts to address these knowledge gaps. (Please see revised ‘Discussion’)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Protein interaction data: The authors claim that CRYAB and VIM1 are novel interacting partners of LBH. However, the evidence presented (2 blots in Fig. 6A,B) lack the relevant controls. It is possible that CRYAB and VIM1 are cross-reactive with the anti-LBH antibody or were not washed out completely. The abundance of bands on the Coomassie stain in Fig. 6A suggests that either event is plausible. Therefore, the evidence presented is insufficient to support the claim that CRYAB and VIM1 are protein interacting partners of LBH.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with these claims. Therefore, we have added the relevant controls(Input) and performed Co-IP (IP: CRYAB or VIM, WB: LBH) to demonstrate CRYAB and VIM1 are not simply cross-reactive antigens to their LBH antibody. Our results show that we can detect the expression of CRYAB and VIM after LBH IP, and we also detect the expression of LBH after CRYAB and VIM IP. In addition, it can be seen from our results that the binding of LBH to VIM is higher than that of CRYAB. Regardless, these results indicate that the binding of CRYAB or VIM to LBH is not a random phenomenon. (Please see revised ‘Result’ and ‘Figure 6B’)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Impact: These data will trigger interest in Lbh as a target gene within the erectile dysfunction community.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Bae et al. described the key roles of pericytes in cavernous tissues in diabetic erectile dysfunction using both mouse and human single-cell transcriptomic analysis. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is caused by dysfunction of the cavernous tissue and affects a significant proportion of men aged 40-70. The most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, these are less effective in patients with diabetic ED. Therefore, there is an unmet need for a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment, cell-cell communications in patients with diabetic ED, and the development of new therapeutic treatments to improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>Pericytes are mesenchymal-derived mural cells that directly interact with capillary endothelial cells (ECs). They play a vital role in the pathogenesis of erectile function as their interactions with ECs are essential for penile erection. Loss of pericytes has been associated with diabetic retinopathy, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease and has been investigated in relation to the permeability of cavernous blood vessels and neurovascular regeneration in the authors' previous studies. This manuscript explores the mechanisms underlying the effect of diabetes on pericyte dysfunction in ED. Additionally, the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes were carefully examined using both mouse and human single-cell RNA sequencing in diabetic ED. The novelty of this work lies in the identification of a newly identified pericyte (PC)-specific marker, LBH, in mouse and human cavernous tissues, which distinguishes pericytes from smooth muscle cells. LBH not only serves as a cavernous pericyte marker, but its expression level is also reduced in diabetic conditions. The LBH-interacting proteins (Cryab and Vim) were further identified in mouse cavernous pericytes, indicating that these signaling interactions are critical for maintaining normal pericyte function. Overall, this study demonstrates the novel marker of pericytes and highlights the critical role of pericytes in diabetic ED.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. The methods are poorly written. It lacks specific information on the sample size, experimental design, and data analysis methods employed. The absence of these crucial details makes it difficult to evaluate the robustness and reliability of the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion, now we revised the methods of our manuscript, and added detailed information or references. For sample size we have added detailed information in Figure legend (Please see revised ‘Method’ , Figure Legend, and Supplementary information.)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The cell number in the scRNA-seq analysis is small (~12000) and some minor cell types are probably underrepresented. It is not clear whether the authors pooled the cells from different mice as one sample, or replicates in different groups have been included. It will be helpful to label different samples in the UMAP. The authors should repeat the experiments with more replicates to increase the cell number and validate the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We understand the reviewer's concern, but due to the small size of mouse penile tissue, we had to pool 5 corpus cavernosum tissues for each group (using pooled samples) for scRNA-seq analysis. Moreover, owing to the unique nature of mouse penile tissue, which is highly resistant, it posed challenges for the dissolution and isolation of single cells using conventional single-cell separation methods. Consequently, we had to increase the concentration of the enzyme to finally obtain 12,894 cells. Rather than conducting a repetitive scRNAseq analysis on the same mouse model, we validated our findings in human cavernous single-cell transcriptome data. This analysis allowed us to confirm the presence of pericyte in human corpus cavernosum, specific expression of LBH in human cavernous pericytes, and the identification of relevant GO terms associated with pericyte functions (Figure 5). We have add these information in ‘Method’ (Please see revised ‘Method’).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Functional studies are lacking to justify how manipulating LBH expression or its interacting proteins might lead to effective therapeutic approaches for diabetic ED.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We have performed the functional study to evaluate LBH expression might lead to effective therapeutic approaches for diabetic ED as showed in Figure 4G. Assessment of intracavernous pressure (ICP) is the most representative test for evaluating erectile function. Therefore, we modulated LBH expression in the penis of diabetic mice and assessed the erectile function of the mice by intracavernous pressure. However, we have not performed ICP studies and relative in vitro studies (migration, survival experiment) to assess whether LBH-interacting proteins have the same effect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Although the abstract identifies novel targets for potential interventions, such as LBH and its interacting proteins, the clinical relevance of these findings remains uncertain. The authors should include a discussion regarding the translation of these discoveries into therapeutic strategies or their potential impact on patients with diabetes and ED.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion and have added a discussion as per the reviewer’s recommendation (Please see revised ‘Discussion’).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. While the study highlights the importance of pericytes in penile erection, it fails to mention the broader context of other cell types involved in the pathogenesis of ED. Neglecting to discuss potential contributions from endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or neural elements limits the comprehensive understanding of the cellular interactions underlying diabetic ED.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with the reviewer's suggestion and have added a discussion regarding the significance of other cell populations in penile tissues, such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells fibroblasts, and neural elements, along with the rationale for our focus on pericytes. (Please see revised ‘Discussion’).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>We congratulate the authors on an interesting study. We were especially excited to see their Lbh overexpression results. However, we felt other claims in the paper could benefit from additional investigation, analysis, and statistical rigor. We have provided a set of suggestions for improvement below.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>1. Pericyte marker gene proposal: See public review for commentary on the following suggested experiments. The authors should perform binary classification analysis using <italic>Lbh</italic> and report the performance of this gene as a marker (e.g. using the area under the receiver operating characteristic, accuracy, precision and recall). Further, they should consider performing this analysis for all other genes in their data to determine whether <italic>Lbh</italic> is the best marker gene.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We appreciate this comment. AUC scores of Rgs5, Pln, Ednra, Npylr, Atp1b2, and Gpc3 for ability of a binary classifier to distinguish between pericyte and the other cell types in mouse penile tissues were measured by using FindMarkers function. Rgs5 had the highest AUC, but Rgs5 was also expressed in SMCs in our data. Pln, Ednra, Gpc3, and Npy1r also seemed to be candidate markers, but the literature search excluded these genes as they are also expressed in the SMCs of other tissues or different cell types. The AUC score of Lbh was over 0.7, and expression in SMC was not identified in previous studies, and ultimately, we experimentally identified that Lbh is penis pericyte specific. We have added this to the manuscript.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Robust differential expression analysis should also be performed for this gene (if not all) and the statistics should be reported, given known issues with the statistical approach used by the authors for differential expression (see: Squair 2021, 10.1038/s41467-021-25960-2). The authors' should also report the number of cells involved in these comparisons, as the number of pericytes in the data (Fig 1B) appears quite small.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We appreciate this comment. We used “MAST” to identify differentially expressed genes. This test is often used to find DEGs in single-cell RNA data. However, because the pseudobulk method has advantages over the single cell DEG method (Squair 2021, 10.1038/s41467-021-25960-2), we additionally performed DEG analysis with DESeq2 to confirm whether Lbh can distinguish pericytes from other cell types in the penile. As a result, even when tested with DESeq2, Lbh expression was significantly higher in pericytes than in other cell types in penile (adjusted p-value = 2.694475e-07 in Pericyte vs SMC, adjusted P-value = 3.700118e-58 in Pericyte vs the other cell types). Mouse penile tissue is small in size, and the number of pericytes in mouse penile tissue is relatively smaller compared to fibroblasts and chondrocytes. In our mouse penile scRNAseq data, the number of pericytes is as follows: normal: 58, diabetes: 116. Despite the limited number of cells, we were able to establish statistical significance in our analyses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Immunostaining results in Fig. 2D, E should likewise be quantified. At present, it's unclear that LBH and aSMA are mutually exclusive as claimed. The authors should also investigate <italic>Lbh</italic> expression in public single cell genomics data, rather than performing candidate gene literature searches. For example, the Tabula Muris suggests Lbh is expressed widely outside pericytes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: For Figure 2D and E, the aim of these analyses was to assess the distribution of LBH and other cellular markers to see if they overlap and if they can be distinguished. We think that some of the overlapping staining in the tissue may be caused by multilayered cellular structures, so staining within cells would be more convincing. Therefore, we quantified the percentage of LBH- or α-SMA-expressed pericytes and relative expression in smooth muscle cells in cell staining (Supplementary Fig. 5E). We found that only 3% of smooth muscle cells expressed LBH, 67% of mouse cavernous pericytes (MCPs) expressed α-SMA, and more than 97% of MCPs expressed LBH. Therefore, these results may illustrate the specific expression of LBH in MCPs. These information was added as ‘Supplementary Fig. 5E’ (Please see revised ‘Supplementary information’). We also examined Lbh expression patterns in various mouse tissues using the public mouse single-cell atlas (Tabula Muris), and provided a detailed response in reviewer 2’s public review 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Even if <italic>Lbh</italic> is not the best marker, the authors' intervention experiment still motivates study of the gene, but these analyses would help contextualize the result for readers.</p>
<p>1. Statistical anslyses for cell-cell communication and TF regulon analysis: See public review for context on these comments. The authors should perform statistical tests to evaluate the significance of differences detected for each of these analysis. For example, generalized linear models can be used to assess the significance of TF regulon activity scores from SCENIC, and permutation tests can be used to measure the significance of cell-cell interaction score changes. Without these statistical tests, it's challenging for a reader to interpret whether the results reported are meaningful or within the realm of experimental noise.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We appreciate this comment. We calculated statistical significance TF regulon analyses as suggested by the reviewer and described a detailed statistical calculation method for cell-cell communication. We provided a detailed response in reviewer 2’s public review 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Mechanism of ED rescue by Lbh overexpression: To support this claim, the authors would need to perform an experiment where Lbh is over expressed specifically in MPCs (using e.g. a specific promoter on their LTV construct, or a transgenic line with a cell type-specific Cre-Lox system). Absent these data, the claim should be removed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with the reviewer's suggestion and we have reworked the claim that ‘LBH overexpression is affected by pericytes during ED recovery’ and have added relevant clarification in the Discussion section to clearly state that LBH overexpression may affect many cavernosum cells, such as cavernous endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes (Please see revised ‘Result’ and ‘Discussion’)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Protein interaction claims: This experiment would require that the authors perform a similar pull-down with LBH KO cells and or a reciprocal Co-IP (e.g. IP: CRYAB or VIM1, WB: LBH) to demonstrate CRYAB and VIM1 are not simply cross-reactive antigens to their LBH antibody. Further, these experiments appear to only have a single replicate for each condition. The authors should either remove associated claims, or perform a Co-IP experiment with the relevant controls with sufficient replication.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with the claims. Therefore, we have included the necessary controls (Input) and performed Co-IP (IP: CRYAB or VIM1, WB: LBH) to demonstrate that CRYAB and VIM1 are not simply cross-reactive antigens to their LBH antibody. Our results show that we can detect the expression of CRYAB and VIM after LBH IP, and we also detect the expression of LBH after CRYAB and VIM IP. In addition, it can be seen from our results that the binding of LBH to VIM is higher than that of CRYAB. Regardless, these results indicate that the binding of CRYAB or VIM to LBH is not a random phenomenon. Additionally, all IP experiments were replicated at least three times.

<p>Major concerns about this work</p>
<p>1. The single cell RNAseq data collected for mouse diabetic ED(Fig 1B), FB are the most abundant cell population compared to PC, EC, SMC and other clusters. The rationale for studying FB clusters (in Figure 1, D-F) instead of PC cluster is unclear. Which cluster DEG did the authors annotate for Fig 1G-H?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We understand the reviewer's suggestion and confusion. Although other major cell populations in penile tissue such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cell, and fibroblasts have been extensively studied, pericytes have mainly been investigated in the context of the central nervous system (CNS). For example, in the CNS, pericytes are involved in maintaining the integrity of the brain's blood-brain barrier (BBB) [PMID: 27916653], regulating blood flow at capillary junctions [PMID: 33051294], and promoting neuroinflammatory processes [PMID: 31316352], whose dysfunction is considered an important factor in the progression of vascular diseases such as Alzheimer's disease [PMID: 24946075]. But little is known about the role of pericytes in penile tissue [PMID: 35865945; PMID: 36009395; PMID: 26044953]. In order to explore the role of pericytes in repairing the corpus cavernosum vascular and neural tissues damaged by DM, we focused on pericytes, which are multipotent perivascular cells that contribute to the generation and repair of various tissues in response to injury. Although recent studies have shown that pericytes are involved in physiological mechanisms of erection, little is known about their detailed mechanisms. We have also added this rationale in discussion.</p>
<p>Single cell level study has not been conducted in mouse penile tissues. Therefore, before delving into pericytes, we aimed to identify overall transcriptome differences between normal and diabetic conditions in mouse penile tissues. We presented the analyses of FB, which make up the largest proportion among the cell types in the mouse penis, in Fig. 1D-F. The analysis of other cell types is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1-4. Fig. 1G-H are GO terms for Fibroblasts clusters. We added this information in the figure.</p>

<p>1. Fig 2 is the critical data to show Lbh is a cavernous PC specific marker. More PC violin plots to identify PC cluster such as Cspg4, Kcnj8, Higd1b, Cox4i2 and more SMC violin plots to identify SMC cluster such as Acta2, Myh11, Tagln, Actg2 should be used for inclusion and exclusion of PC( the same concern applied to human scRNAseq in Fig 5B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We appreciate this comment. We examined the expression of other marker genes of pericytes and SMCs. Although some marker genes were rarely expressed in the mouse penis data (Kcnj8, Higd1b), the expression of marker genes tended to be relatively high in each cluster. The expression of Cspg4 and Cox4i2 was higher in pericytes than in SMCs, while the expression of Acta2, Myh11,and Tagln was higher in SMCs than in pericytes. Actag2 was specifically expressed in SMCs. Through the gene set enrichment test as well as the expression of known cell type marker genes, we identified that the annotation of pericyte and SMC was appropriate (Fig. 2B and Fig. 5C). We added the violin plots of these marker genes in Supplementary Fig. 5.</p>

<p>In human penis data, ACTA2 and MYH11 were expressed in SMCs, pericytes, and myofibroblasts, as in the previous paper [PMID: 35879305]. Among pericyte markers, the number of cells expressing KCNJ8 and HIGD1B was small. The cluster we annotated as pericyte was double positive for pericyte markers CSPG4 and COX4I2. ACTG2, a marker for SMC, was expressed more highly in SMC than in pericytes and myofibroblasts. As in the mouse penis data, we identified that the annotation of each cell type was appropriate through the gene set enrichment test in the human penis data. We added the violin plots of CSPG4, COX4I2, and ACTG2 in Supplementary Fig. 11.</p>

<p>When exploring Lbh expression levels in &quot;Database of gene expression in adult mouse brain and lung vascular and perivascular cells&quot; from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html">https://betsholtzlab.org/VascularSingleCells/database.html</ext-link>, Lbh is not uniquely expressed in PC, suggesting its tissue-specific expression level. This difference should be discussed in the Discussion section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We appreciate this valuable comment. For the answer to this comment, we extensively analyzed Lbh expression patterns in various mouse tissues using the public mouse single-cell atlas (Tabula Muris) as also suggested by Reviewer 2. Please see our detailed response in reviewer 2’s public review 1.</p>

<p>1. In prior studies on PC morphology and location (PMID: 21839917), they reside in capillaries (diameter less than 10um) or distal vessels (diameter less than 25um) and have oval cell body and long processes. Due to the non-specificity of Pdgfrb, SMC are positive for Pdgfrb staining (this has been shown in many publications that SMC are Pdgfrb+; unfortunately, NG2 antibody also stains for both PC and SMC). Therefore, the LBH immunostaining (in Fig 2D and 2E of large-sized vessels) are very likely for SMC identity, not PC. PC should be in close contact with CD31+ ECs in healthy conditions. The LBH immunostaining of PC in both mouse and human tissues (Fig 4) must be replaced and better characterized.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with the reviewer's suggestion. As it is widely known, peicytes are primarily located in capillaries, where they surround endothelial cells of blood vessels. However, recent discoveries have identified cells with pericyte-like characteristics in the walls of large blood vessels, challenging the traditional concept  [PMID: 27268036]. In our study, we observed minimal overlap in staining between LBH and α-SMA, suggesting that the cells expressing LBH were not smooth muscle cells but possibly pericyte-like cells in large vessels. In small vessels within the bladder, kidney, and even the aorta, we found LBH-expressing cells surrounding CD31-expressing vessels, consistent with the known characteristics of pericytes. Further research is needed to comprehend the differences in LBH expression and its characteristics in both large and small blood vessels. We have added discussions and references for this issue (Please see revised ‘Discussion’ and ‘Reference’)</p>

<p>1. How do mouse cavernous pericytes isolate? How is purity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: As the reviewer points out, we isolated mouse spongiform pericytes following our and other previously published methods. We used pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), which removes non-pericytic cells [PMID: 30929324, 23493068]. Although there are no purity study results such as FACS, other staining results thoroughly support the notion that this method yields pericytes with a notably high level of purity. (Please see ‘Method’ section).</p>

<p>1. Can mouse scRNAseq cell-cell communication in Fig 3 be reproducible in human scRNAseq cell-cell communication? The results in human ED are more clinically significant than in mouse data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: In human scRNAseq data, the difference between angiogenesis-related interactions between normal and diabetes was not as significant as that in mouse data. Because the cell type composition of the human and mouse penis is not completely identical, there are limitations in comparing cell-cell interactions. However, in the human penis data, some interactions related to angiogenesis between pericytes and other cell types were decreased in diabetes compared to normal (boxed parts).</p>

<p>1. Fibroblasts also express Vim. Murine PC VIM/CRYAB( should be written as Vim/Cryab as mouse proteins) direct interaction with Lbh is unclear from Lbh IP as Fig 6A red boxes showed a wide range of sizes. Where is the band for Lbh? Do human PC LBH interact with VIM/CRYAB?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: We agree with the reviewer's comment. VIM is a type III intermediate filament protein expressed in many cell types. We have added the relevant controls (Input) and performed Co-IP (IP: CRYAB or VIM, WB: LBH) to demonstrate CRYAB and VIM are not simply cross-reactive antigens to their LBH antibody. In western blot study, the LBH band was expressed between 35 kDa-48 kDa. From Figure 6A, we detected CRYAB in band 1 and VIM in bands 2 and 3. This may be due to the formation of dimers or multimers by VIM. We did not use human PCs for IP studies because IP requires large amounts of protein, making IP studies using human pericyte challenging. Nevertheless, the interaction between LBH and CRYAB in humans has been reported through fluorescent resonance energy transfer assay and affinity chromatography technology assay [PMID:34000384, PMID:20587334].</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Fig 6H and I, why does CRYAB expression significantly reduce in vitro and in vivo under diabetic conditions, whereas VIM expression significantly increases?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: As the reviewer pointed out, and we have discussed on this issue in the manuscript, CRYAB is known to promote angiogenesis. Diabetes reduces CRYAB expression, so angiogenesis may be impaired. Furthermore, since VIM is a multifunctional protein, it interacts with several other proteins with multiple functions under various pathophysiological conditions. There are many relevant literatures showing that VIM expression is increased under diabetic conditions [PMID: 28348116 and PMID: 32557212]. And VIM deficiency protects against obesity and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we hypothesize that exogenous LBH may have the ability to bind to the increased VIM in diabetic conditions and inactivate the effects of VIM. Thereby achieving the protective effect. This needs to be proved in further studies.</p>

<p>1. The therapeutic strategies targeting (Lbh-Cryab-Vim) on mouse diabetic ED model is not investigated and need to be further validated and discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: As the reviewers pointed out, in this study, we did not evaluate the targeted therapeutic strategy for LBH-CRYAB-VIM in a mouse diabetic ED model. We only identified the binding potential of these three proteins. Evaluation of this treatment strategy requires further study. For example, we can employ shRNA lentivirus, either alone or in combination, to downregulate CRYABexpression [PMID: 31612679] in normal mice, utilize a lentiviral vector CMV-GFP-puro-vimentin to overexpress Vimentin [PMID: 36912679], and then treat it with LBH to evaluate whether the LBH effect still exists (in vivo erectile function study and in vitro angiogenesis assay). We include this information in the Discussion section as a limitation of this study (Please see revised ‘Discussion’).</p>

<p>1. The Discussion of current knowledge of pericytes in diabetic ED and other diseases and the significance of this study as well as clinical implications, should be expanded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: As the reviewers pointed out, we have expanded the current knowledge of pericytes in diabetic ED and other diseases (CNS disease) and clinical implications as follows: “Although other major cell populations in penile tissue such as smooth muscle cells, endothelial cell, and fibroblasts have been extensively studied, pericytes have mainly been investigated in the context of the central nervous system (CNS). For example, in the CNS, pericytes are involved in maintaining the integrity of the brain's blood-brain barrier (BBB), regulating blood flow at capillary junctions, and promoting neuroinflammatory processes, whose dysfunction is considered an important factor in the progression of vascular diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. But little is known about the role of pericytes in penile tissue.” (Please see revised ‘Discussion’).</p>

<p>1. How many clinical samples were used? How many times did each experiment repeat?</p>

<p>Answer: As the reviewers pointed out, the clinical samples’ information was added in ‘method’ section. A total four human samples were used in this study (‘human corpus cavernosum tissues were obtained from two patients with congenital penile curvature (59-year-old and 47-year-old) who had normal erectile function during reconstructive penile surgery and two patients with diabetic ED (69-year-old and 56-year-old) during penile prosthesis implantation.’). For in vivo study, we quantified four different fields from human samples.</p>

<p>Minor concerns</p>
<p>1. Fig 1A, why normal mouse's body size is the same as DM?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Answer: As the reviewer pointed out, in Figure 1A, while the size of normal mice and DM mice may not appear significantly different, there are indeed notable difference in body weight and size. The normal mice body weigh we used was about 30 grams, while DM mice body weigh was generally less than 24 grams. We found that we missed information on physiological and metabolic parameters from in vivo studies (ICP function study). Therefore, we have added it in Supplementary Table 2 (Please see revised ‘Supplementary information’)</p>
