<abstract>
<p>Hearing loss is the most common form of sensory deficit. It occurs predominantly due to hair cell (HC) loss. Mammalian HCs are terminally differentiated by birth, making HC loss incurable. Here, we show the pharmacogenetic downregulation of Cldn9, a tight junction protein, generates robust supernumerary inner HCs (IHCs) in mice. The putative ectopic IHCs have functional and synaptic features akin to typical IHCs and were surprisingly and remarkably preserved for at least fifteen months &gt;50% of the mouse’s life cycle. In vivo, Cldn9 knockdown using shRNA on postnatal days (P) P1-7 yielded analogous functional putative ectopic IHCs that were equally durably conserved. The findings suggest that Cldn9 levels coordinate embryonic and postnatal HC differentiation, making it a viable target for altering IHC development pre- and post-terminal differentiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian cochlear hair cells (HCs) comprise a single row of inner hair cells (IHCs) and three rows of outer hair cells (OHCs). HCs transduce sound-mediated mechanical force into neural electrical codes for ear-brain intercommunication. The IHCs are the predominant afferent transducers, while the OHCs amplify low-level sound. Mammalian HCs are terminally differentiated by birth, and they are susceptible to damage by ototoxic drugs, noise-overexposure, aging, and environmental insults, resulting in hearing loss, the most common sensory deficit(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Neitzel and Fligor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rybak and Ramkumar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wilson and Tucci, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Emerging understanding of the mechanisms of transcription factors that induce HC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Atkinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Anoveros et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zheng and Gao, 2000</xref>), and potential induction for regeneration are promising, but none have produced new HCs with sustained functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iyer et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zine et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the current treatment for hearing loss ensuing from HC loss is cochlear implants, despite the potential advantages of HC-replacement therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hinton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sullivan et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In the mammalian cochlea, each HC is separated from the next by intervening supporting cells (SCs), forming an invariant and alternating mosaic along the cochlea’s length. Cochlear SCs can divide and trans-differentiate into HCs, serving as a potential resource for HC differentiation, using transcription and developmental signaling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">White et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Atoh1</italic>, a basic helix-loop-helix factor, induces SCs trans-differentiation into HCs. Upregulation of <italic>Atoh1, GFI1,</italic> and <italic>POU4F3</italic> triggers HC differentiation, but the fledgling HCs invariably degenerate, suggesting pre-maturity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Iyer et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, inhibition of the Notch signaling or upregulation of the wnt1 pathway suffices to drive HC formation from SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tang et al., 2023</xref>), but the functional features of the newly developed HC are circumpect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mizutari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Waqas et al., 2016</xref>). While transcription factors are potent targets for developmental regulation, a cadre of these essential DNA-binding proteins and the precise timing of expression are required to complete the developmental cascade(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jahan et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the key is identifying HC-developing bands of transcription and signaling factors to treat hearing loss. Recent studies identified the transcription factors INSM1 and IKZF2 as the regulators of OHC fate, while the transcription factor TBX2 specifies and maintains HC and SC fate(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaiser et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2023</xref>), advancing understanding of HC-subtype developmental specification mechanisms.</p>
<p>Contact-mediated lateral inhibition is among the final developmental events, where once a cell fate is determined, it inhibits neighboring cells from becoming that cell type. The HC-SC interphase is laced with tight junction proteins (TJPs), which may mediate lateral inhibition mechanisms in nonmammalian vertebrates, though their function is unclear in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chrysostomou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goodyear and Richardson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Petrovic et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, TJPs were also found to regulate cell proliferation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bhat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Díaz-Coránguez et al., 2019</xref>). The TJP scaffold cingulin regulates lateral inhibition in HC-SC rearrangements in the avian basilar papilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Goodyear and Richardson, 1997</xref>), and claudin b (<italic>cldnb</italic>), an ortholog of the <italic>cldn4</italic> in humans, upregulation controls cellular patterning during HC regeneration in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Montalbano et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, damaged HC extrusion and the breaking of intercellular junctional adhesions may trigger differentiation and regenerative proliferation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Corwin et al., 2007</xref>). In mammals, E-cadherin’s junctional expression negatively alters HC regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burns et al., 2013</xref>), while <italic>Cldn9</italic> is a positive regulator of cell proliferation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zavala-Zendejas et al., 2011</xref>). Although the high expression of <italic>Cldn9</italic> in the organ of Corti (OC) is well-established(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kudo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref></bold>), it is unknown whether regulation of the TJP contributes to sensory cell differentiation.</p>

The genetically modified ES cells containing one copy of the tTA cassette were injected into the healthy albino B6 blastocysts, and the injected blastocysts were transplanted into the uterus of an albino B6 mouse to generate the chimeric mouse.

<p>To determine the roles in vivo of Cldn9, we generated doxycycline (dox)-tet-OFF-Cldn9 transgenic mice to regulate expression levels of Cldn9. The downregulation of Cldn9 resulted in functional supernumerary (ectopic) putative IHCs along the cochlear contour. Auditory neurons innervated ectopic mechanically transducing IHCs with synaptic features resembling normal IHCs. Analogous additional putative IHCs differentiation was observed when Cldn9 was knocked down using shRNA injection in postnatal (P) days (P1-7) mice, suggesting that regulation of Cldn9 levels coordinates embryonic and postnatal development differentiation of SC into IHCs. Notably, the putative ectopic (PE) IHCs at the apical and middle-frequency contour of the cochlea were preserved for over half the mouse’s life cycle (15 months), making Cldn9 a viable target for generating transformed IHCs.</p>

Results of RT-PCR from the three groups of animals, including wild-type littermates (<italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup>)</italic>, heterozygote <italic>(Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup>),</italic> and Homozygous (<italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup>)</italic> with (1mg/ml) and without dox treatment. <italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup></italic> and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>mice demonstrate ∼55 and a 40-fold increase in <italic>Cldn9</italic> mRNA expression in cochlear tissue (Supplement figure 1 (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref></bold>)). Treatment of <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice with dox (1 mg/ml) resulted in an ∼0.4-0.6-fold decline in mRNA levels compared to <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic>cochleae (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref></bold>), translating to a marked difference in <italic>Cldn9</italic> protein expression (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref></bold>). Immunoelectron microscopic analysis showed that Cldn9 levels reduced by ∼8-fold in the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> cochlea (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2</xref></bold>). The <italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup></italic>mice had a reduced survival rate (1.5±0.3 months (mos)) relative to the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> littermates (23±2 mos<italic>)</italic>. Thus, all experiments were restricted to <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup> and Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> littermates fed on dox-water (1 mg/ml). There were no recognizable differences in body weight between <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1</xref></bold>). All animals were in the CBA background. <italic>Cldn9</italic> downregulation in the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> cochlea showed a qualitative decrease in the Cldn6 and an increase in ILDR1 TJP levels but no comparative differences in others(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kitajiri et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kitajiri and Katsuno, 2016</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Downregulation of <italic>Cldn9</italic> induces the production of ectopic cochlear HCs</title>
<p>5-week-old mice <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> cochleae displayed a notable row of ectopic HCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref></bold>). The ectopic HCs were observed along the cochlear contour (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref></bold>), ranged in abundance from base to apex (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>), and had contact with innervating neurons, shown in cochlear sections. A distinctive single of &quot;U&quot;-shaped IHC bundles was apparent in scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). In addition to their shape, the ectopic HCs were positively labeled with anti-myosin VIIa antibody and phalloidin-labeled stereocilia bundles, which are features of typical HCs. Moreover, the ectopic HCs were negatively labeled with an anti-prestin antibody (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref></bold>), a marker for OHCs, suggesting the new HCs were likely derived from the IHC lineage. Additionally, the ectopic HCs show IHC bundle features (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>), expressed multiple CtBP2 labeling in contrast to typical OHCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></bold>), and reacted positively to otoferlin antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pangrsic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Roux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Strenzke et al., 2016</xref>) (data not shown). We denote the new HCs as &quot;putative ectopic&quot; (PE) IHCs. On average, HC counts from randomly selected 6-8-week-old cochlea from <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice showed a ∼1.5-fold increase in IHCs in the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). The PE IHCs may subserve function and be a viable alternative to the original IHC. IHC counts at different ages (P2-P21) and the cochlear frequency segments (4-32 kHz) demonstrate that the <italic>Cldn9</italic>-induced ectopic IHCs were most prominent at the cochlear apex but remained statistically significant at the base (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs 2E-F</xref></bold>). SEM was used for high-resolution analyses to evaluate IHC and their bundle morphology. The original and PE IHCs in <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice had normal morphology, including intact hair bundles IHCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref></bold>). However, the stereocilia bundle orientation was less orderly when compared to those in <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cochlea (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>).

<title>Functional features of <italic>Cldn9</italic>-induced putative ectopic IHCs resemble normal IHCs</title>
<p>Motor responses of both mouse genotypes’ (<italic>Cldn9<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>T</sup>) to auditory stimuli (Preyer’s test) were normal. To evaluate the status of inner hair-cell function, we analyzed auditory brainstem responses to various sound-pressure levels. <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>mice responses were generally indistinguishable from their <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>+</sup> littermate counterparts. They exhibited similar characteristic responses to broadband clicks and pure tones of 8, 16, and 32 kHz stimuli (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>), with ∼5-15 dB threshold elevation in the <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice. The pattern of hearing threshold remained virtually constant from 2-8 months of monitoring. Moreover, <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice yielded similar distortion products (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>), suggesting normal OHC function. The apparent normal morphology of the PE IHCs led to the hypothesis the IHCs may exhibit functional mechano-electrical transducer (MET) currents. Since active MET channels are partially open at rest, the rapid uptake of the channel permeable lipophilic dye FM1-43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gale et al., 2001</xref>) was assessed. Results were determined from FM1-43 dye loading of apically-located original and PE IHCs of 4-week-old <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>mice representing characteristic frequencies (CFs) of ∼4-6 kHz. Local perfusion of 10-μM FM1-43 resulted in intense dye labeling at the hair bundle level of original and PE IHCs. The dye-membrane partitioning and diffusion across the IHCs’ basal aspects occurred within seconds. Z-stacked-time-lapse images were taken below hair bundle level 2-sec post dye exposure and at the basolateral compartment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref></bold>). The time constants (τ) of dye loading at the bundle and supra-nuclear basal membrane levels for original IHCs were (data from 4 mice); 19.4±1.1 sec (n=27) and 29.0±3.8 sec (n=27), and for PE IHCs were; 23.1±4.5 sec (n=27) and 47.0±8.4 sec (n=27) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>). These results are consistent with functioning IHCs at rest. We conclude that PE IHC bundles are set at the optimum dynamic range to transduce MET current at rest like the original counterparts. IHC MET current magnitudes and kinetic profiles from the basilar and ectopic rows at the ∼3-4-kHz cochlear-place map in P21 mice were comparable, as summarized in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figures 4E-G</xref></bold>. The normalized current-displacement relationships were well-fitted with a two-state Boltzmann function, portraying marked similarities between the original and PE IHC MET currents (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref></bold>).

<title>The endocochlear potential and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations in <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>The cochlear duct is furnished with cellular syncytia, K<sup>+</sup> channels, and transporters/pumps that operate to orchestrate a unidirectional (basal to apical) flux of K<sup>+</sup> at the lateral wall to produce the endocochlear potential (EP, ∼+80 mV), an extracellular potential, subserving the proverbial powerhouse for HC functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Von Bekesy, 1952</xref>). A remnant of K<sup>+</sup> flux is a high K<sup>+</sup> endolymph (∼140 mM) restricted from leakage into the basolateral aspects of HCs by TJ between HCs and SCs. At four months of age, the magnitude of the EP and the K<sup>+</sup> concentration endolymph and perilymph of <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>mice were variable but insignificant from age-matched littermates.

<title>Discussions</title>
<p>Fate determination is typically completed by birth in cochlear HCs, the primary receptors for mechanosensory sound detection. Generating functional HCs in the mammalian cochlea, with a proper cellular organization that allows for cochlear sound frequency selectivity, has been a demanding yet unsolved challenge. Consequently, deafness resulting from HC loss, which constitutes a significant portion of SNHL, is incurable. Multiple aspects must be considered in inducing HC differentiation since HCs have distinct functional and structural features along the cochlear axis. For optimal sensing of different sound frequencies, cochlear apical-to-basal HCs have diverse structural configurations and ion channel configurations and densities that sculpt and preserve low-to-high frequency sound processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kimitsuki et al., 2001</xref>). Additionally, HCs are connected to SCs by TJ proteins, enhancing the sensitivity of cochlear OHC sound amplification and maintaining high K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the endolymph at the apical surface and low K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the perilymph milieu surrounding HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cohen-Salmon et al., 2002</xref>). This process establishes a unidirectional K<sup>+</sup> flux in the cochlear duct to generate the EP, which boosts the receptor potential of HC by ∼80 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hudspeth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Von Bekesy, 1952</xref>). Thus, besides overcoming the insurmountable terminal differentiation of HCs, newly differentiated HCs <italic>in vivo</italic> should be equipped with features that resemble the original primary HCs to integrate into the specialized cochlear environment.</p>
<p>Among the multiple approaches used with limited success in HC replacement are overexpressing transcription factors involved in prosensory cell differentiation and silencing inhibitory factors in the induction of HC fate. These methods include 1) Transfecting proneural genes, such as Atoh1, in embryonic, newborn, and damaged mature cochlear tissue. However, hair-cell-competent cells invariably lose their responsiveness post-birth and in adult animals. In the case of the damaged cochlea, it is challenging to distinguish between transdifferentiated and repaired HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gubbels et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Izumikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">White et al., 2006</xref>). 2) Simulating cell division using cell-cycle inhibitors, this strategy activates apoptotic genes, leading to cell death and deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lowenheim et al., 1999</xref>). 3) Inhibiting Notch signaling using a γ-secretase inhibitor to stimulate HC differentiation from potential inner ear resident stem cells after noise trauma(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jeon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mizutari et al., 2013</xref>). The scarcity of resident stem cells in the adult cochlea may limit this strategy. Thus, multiple therapeutic armamentariums are required to restore hearing in the translational setting.</p>
<p>Previous studies demonstrated that claudin-9 is essential for hearing function and the maintenance of auditory HCs, using an ethylnitrosourea-induced <italic>Cldn9</italic> mutant mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>), which resulted in OHC degeneration. The current results demonstrate that embryonic regulation of <italic>Cldn9</italic> levels, but not null deletion using the dox-tet-OFF-<italic>Cldn9</italic> transgenic strategy induces functional ectopic IHCs, but not OHCs, along the cochlear contour with increasing numbers from base to apex. These <italic>Cldn9</italic> downregulated-induced IHCs mature, acquiring robust MET currents and neural innervation with synaptic structures markedly similar to resident IHCs. Results also revealed that postnatal downregulation of <italic>Cldn9</italic> levels <italic>in vivo</italic>, using shRNA, suffice to coordinate SC differentiation into IHCs. Because the PE IHCs remain viable for a sizable duration of the mouse’s lifespan, the Cldn9 regulatory strategy to induce IHC differentiation subserves a feasible approach to replace lost HCs. The downregulation of Cldn9-mediated selective IHC-increase indicates Cldn9’s role during the latter phase of HC differentiation, perhaps post-OHC-fate determination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Garcia-Anoveros et al., 2022</xref>). The findings suggest Cldn9-mediated effects may be upstream of the transcriptional factor-mediated trans-differentiation of HCs since PE ectopic HCs had features of IHCs, in contrast to primordial HCs generated by <italic>Atoh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). It deepens our understanding of the importance of tapping into later stages of HC differentiation that likely will result in end-organ-specific HCs.</p>
<p>Moreover, a pragmatic strategy requires titrated levels of the TJP to render new HCs without compromising the sensory epithelial cellular syncytial, a decline in the EP, and, significantly, a gradual extracellular K<sup>+</sup> increase that mediates undue HC depolarization and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nakano et al., 2009</xref>). The critical period at which alteration of TJP level can induce PE and new IHCs remains unclear, although, in the current report, we have demonstrated that functional and viable mature PE IHCs can be generated by regulating Cldn9 levels.</p>
<p>Our findings that downregulation in the TJP, Cldn9, can regulate IHC differentiation are in conceptual agreement with reports demonstrating that lateral inhibition can affect HC specification(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lanford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stone and Rubel, 1999</xref>). Similar accounts are described where newly formed HCs express delta1-like (DII1) and jagged 2 (Jag2) ligands to mediate Notch1-receptor activation in adjacent antecedent cells, thereby inducing the expression of hairy and enhancer of split (Hes1/5), which suppresses pro-HC transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chrysostomou et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this scheme, interruption of Notch1 signaling during HC development leads to HC overproduction(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brooker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lanford et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zine et al., 2000</xref>). In lateral inhibition, the foremost developing cells adopting HC fate antagonize the neighboring cells from differentiating into HCs through direct cell-to-cell communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brown and Groves, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mizutari et al., 2013</xref>). A possible explanation for the current findings is that TJ proteins, mainly Cldn9, are signaling in Notch-mediated lateral induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daudet and Lewis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lewis, 1998</xref>). Canonical Notch signaling is activated when a Notch ligand, such as Delta-like1 (DI1) in an adjacent HC, binds to a receptor in the SC, resulting in the release of the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus to activate the transcription of Notch target genes. The findings also confirm that the Notch signaling pathway is responsible for homeostatic TJP expression <italic>in vitro</italic> and promotes barrier function <italic>in vivo</italic> in the RAG1-adoptive transfer model of colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mathern et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, occluding junction depletion disrupts Notch and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in intestinal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fairchild et al., 2016</xref>). In the scheme provided in <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>, Cldn9 subserves the signaling catalyst to activate NICD cascades that suppress neighboring SCs from trans-differentiation. A limitation of the model is that if <italic>Cldn9</italic>-induced effects were solely dependent on the Notch signaling, putative ectopic OHCs and IHCs would have ensued. Future studies and emerging findings on HC differentiation will likely address these shortcomings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaiser et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2023</xref>). In cochlear tissue, downregulation of Cldn9 led to concomitant reduced expression of Cldn6 and increased ILDR1. It is unclear whether the induction of PE IHCs resulted from reduced expression of <italic>Cldn9</italic> alone or combined TJP alterations. It is conceivable that targeting a different TJP may have similar effects on OHC differentiation, requiring impending studies.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>All procedures were performed under research guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee of the University of Nevada, Reno. Mice of either sex were studied. Doxycycline (dox)-tet-OFF-Cldn9 transgenic mice were generated. In the mouse line, dox concentration can regulate the level of Cldn9 gene expression. The construct consisted of a tetracycline-based genetic switch (tTA cassette) made of three main modules: 1) The tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (tTA); 2) The neomycin resistance gene flanked by LoxP sites; and 3) Six copies of the tet operator (tetO) fused to the minimal CMV promoter. The tTA cassette was inserted at the −110 -nucleotide position upstream of the translational start of <italic>Cldn9</italic> to generate the targeting vector. The targeting vector was electroporated into B6 mouse embryonic stem cells. Following the selection in G418, DNA samples from the neomycin-resistant ES cell clones were prepared for short-arm PCR/sequencing analysis and Southern blot analysis to confirm the insertion of the tTA cassette into ES cells. Genetically modified ES cells containing one copy of the tTA cassette were injected into healthy albino B6 blastocysts, and the injected blastocysts were transplanted into the uterus of an albino B6 mouse to generate the chimeric mouse. The chimeric mouse was then bred with albino B6 mice to produce the F1 heterozygous mouse, and the germline transmission was confirmed by tail DNA genotyping. Deletion of the selection marker in the tTA cassette by crossing the F1 mouse with the embryonic Cre line (B6.129S4-<italic>Meox2<sup>tm1(cre)Sor</sup></italic>/J). We backcrossed the B6/129S4 background unto the CBA/CaJ mouse background for 12 generations to prevent the masking of age-related hearing loss effects. 1.0 mg/ml of dox water were fed to <italic>Cldn9</italic> breeding pairs from breeding day one, and heterozygote <italic>(Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup>)</italic> and Homozygous (<italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup>)</italic> mice and wild-type littermates (<italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup>)</italic>, through the time until for the sample collections. The body weights of mice were recorded. Genotyping was performed by PCR using a set of primers that flank the knockin in the <italic>Cldn9</italic> gene: forward primer Cldn9 knockin-F (knockin-sequence): 5’–ATCCACGCTGTTTTGACCTC–3’, Cldn9 R3 (Reverse): 5’– TCTGGACCACACAGGACATC– 3’. PCR fragments were separated with 2% agarose gel for an 800 bp product in wild-type, 365 bp in homozygous mutants, and two in heterozygous littermate mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Auditory brainstem recordings (ABR) and Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) measurements</title>
<p><italic>Cldn9</italic> mice (<italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/T</sup></italic>, and <italic>Cldn9<sup>T/T</sup></italic>) littermates were tested at 2-8 months (mos) of age. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine by intraperitoneal (IP) injection (25 mg/kg). Body temperature was monitored using a rectal probe and maintained at 36.8±1.0°C using a homeothermic device (Harvard Apparatus). ABR and DPOAE measurements were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dou et al., 2004</xref>). For ABR assays, thresholds were obtained by presenting tone bursts at 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz and a clicking sound from 0 dB to 90 dB sound pressure levels (SPL) in 5 dB intervals. Tones were 2.5 ms, while click was 0.1 ms in duration, with a repetition rate of 21/s. Electrodes were placed subdermally behind the tested ear (reference), the vertex (active), and the back (ground). Evoked potentials were averaged over 512 repetitions and collected using a Tucker Davis Technology (TDT) RZ6 processor and BioSigRZ software. The threshold was defined as the lowest intensity of stimulation that yielded a repeatable waveform based on an identifiable ABR wave.</p>
<p>DPOAE measurements were performed using the same TDT system with two calibrated MF1 speakers connected to an ER10B+ microphone. Data were collected every 21 ms and averaged 512 times. DPOAEs were recorded using two pure tones with frequencies f1 and f2, using an f2/f1 ratio 1.2. Input/output (I/O) functions were obtained by increasing the primary tone L1 (and corresponding L2) in 5-dB steps from 20 to 80 dB SPL at 8, 16, and 32 kHz frequencies. During DPOAE testing, the probe assembly was placed in the mouse’s left ear canal after visual inspection to ensure no ear infection or inflammation of the tympanic membrane. DPOAE thresholds were defined as the lowest level of f1 required to produce a DPOAE ≥ −5 dB SPL(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Cochlear mapping and hair cells and synaptic counts</title>
<p>The cochlea was micro-dissected into three to five pieces following the method described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Montgomery and Cox, 2016</xref>). Cochlear pieces were measured, and a frequency map was computed based on a 3D reconstruction of the sensory epithelium for HCs and synapse count of associated structures to relevant frequency regions using a custom plug-in to ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Muniak et al., 2013</xref>). Confocal z-stacks of the 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz areas were collected using a Leica Stellaris8 (Leica) and Nikon A1R laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc.). Images were gathered in a 512 x 512 raster using a high-resolution oil immersion objective (60x). IHCs and OHCs at the frequency locations were quantified using myosin-VIIa-positive as an HC-marker within a 70-100-μm field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).

<p>The cochleae were intra-labyrinthine perfused through the oval and round windows with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The samples were decalcified in 10% EDTA up to 72-96 hrs, depending on the age, at 4°C. Microdissected pieces were immunostained with antibodies to the following: (1) mouse anti-C-terminal binding protein 2 (pre-synaptic-marker, BD Biosciences, 1:200, Cat # 612044), (2) rabbit anti-myosin-VIIa (HC-marker, Proteus Biosciences, Inc,1:600, Cat # 25-6790), (3) mouse anti-sox2 (supporting cell (SC)-marker, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, 1:200, Cat # sc-365823), and (4) rabbit anti-Homer 1 (post-synaptic marker, Synaptic Systems, 1:250, Cat # 160 003), (5) rabbit anti-immunoglobulin like domain containing receptor 1 (ILDR1) (Antibodies-online.com, 1:200, Cat # ABIN1386369), (6) mouse anti-Cldn9 (Santa Cruz, 1:200, Cat # sc-398836), (7) mouse anti-Cldn6 (Santa Cruz, 1:200, Cat # sc-393671), (8) rabbit anti-Sox2 (Abcam, 1:200, Cat # ab97959), (9) rabbit anti-Tuj1 and chicken anti-Tuj1 (Abcam,1:500, Cat # ab18207, ab41489), (10) goat anti-calretinin (Swant Inc., 1:500, code # CG1), (11) mouse anti-calretinin (Millipore Sigma, 1:200, Cat # MAB1568), (12) rabbit anti-Prestin (Santa Cruz, 1:200, Cat # sc-22692), and (13) rabbit anti-calbindin (Cell signaling technology, 1:200, Cat # 13176S) with appropriate secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa-405, −488, −568, and −647 fluorophores..

<title>RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR of Cochlear tissue</title>
<p>The cochleae were dissected from the mouse and homogenized on ice. Because of limited tissue, we combined 10-15 mice cochleae for the study. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was generated using the RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was combined with RT2 SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen), specific qRT-PCR primers, and qRT-PCR analysis was run using the ViiaTM 7 Real-Time PCR System (ABI). Primer efficiencies were determined by standard dilution curve analysis. Three separate samples were used from 10 animals for each group. The experiments from each sample were performed in triplicate, and average cycle threshold (Ct) values were normalized to GAPDH expression. ΔΔCt values were determined relative to <italic>Cldn9<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cochlear samples. Fold change was defined as 2(−ΔΔCt).

<title>Electron Microscopy</title>
<p>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of cochlear sensory epithelia were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schwander et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Senften et al., 2006</xref>). Five to eight-week-old <italic>Cldn9</italic> mice and littermates were sacrificed for TEM, and the cochleae were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer at 4°C overnight. After several washes with buffer alone, cochleae were fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide at RT for 1-hr. After that, the fixed cochleae were decalcified in 10% EDTA for 3–4 days. Fixed and decalcified cochleae were dehydrated using a graded ethanol series and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut with a diamond knife. Specimens were examined using an electron microscope.</p>
<p>For SEM, mice were perfused with 4% PFA in 1x PBS, inner ears were isolated, and the stapes footplate was removed. Ears were flushed and fixed overnight in 4% PFA and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 1x PBS. After washing in ddH<sub>2</sub>O 3X for 1 hour, the samples were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for approximately 1 hour. Samples were washed before decalcifying for 3-4 days in 0.25 M EDTA at 4°C with daily solution changes. The cochleae were microdissected, the tectorial membranes removed, and gradually dehydrated in 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% ethanol, 2:1 ethanol/hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS, Thermo Scientific #A15139.AE)), 1:2 ethanol/HMDS, and finally 100% HMDS. Samples were transferred to an open well plate in HMDS and allowed to air dry overnight in a fume hood. They were then mounted on aluminum stubs (Ted Pella #16111) using double-sided carbon tape (EMS #77817-12) and stored in a specimen mount holder (EMS #76510) sealed in a desiccator until sputter-coated with Au/Pd (Emitech Sputter Coater K550) and viewed.

<p><italic>Cldn9</italic> heterozygote mice and wild-type littermates were anesthetized using ketamine and xylazine (100/25 mg/kg, i.p.) and K<sup>+</sup> concentration, and the EP was measured using double-barreled microelectrodes. An incision was made along the midline of the neck, and soft tissues were bluntly dissected laterally to expose the trachea and the animal’s left bulla. A tracheostomy was made, and the musculature over the bulla was cut posteriorly to expose the bone. A small hole was made in the cochlear capsule directly over the scala media of the lower basal turn. The EP electrode was filled with 300 mM NaCl, the K<sup>+</sup>-selective barrel was silanized, and the tip was filled with a liquid ion exchanger (Fluka 60398, K<sup>+</sup> ionophore I-Cocktail B) that was backfilled with 150 mM KCl. A round-window approach made measurements in the basal turn of the cochlea through the basilar membrane of the first turn.

<title>shRNA CLDN9 knockdown</title>
<p>siRNAs were designed, using siRNA at WHITEHEAD software, and cloned under U6 promoter in pSilencer5.1-U6 vector to produce hairpin siRNAs (shRNAs; Vector Biolabs, NM_020293). shRNA was packaged into adeno-associated virus constructs: AAV/Anc80L65-GFP-U6-mCLDN9-shRNA(4) at 1.0X10<sup>12</sup> GC/mL titer. shRNA sequence for mouse CLDN9 is 5’-CACC GTGCTTCGGGACTGGATAAGACTCGAGTCTTATCCAGTCCCGAAGCAC TTTTT-3’. The most efficient shRNA 1.0 µl round window injection reduced cochlear RNA by a ∼20-fold expression level compared with scrambled shRNA injection. A round window injection was carried out in mice at P1 – P15. Mice were anesthetized by induced hypothermia and kept on a cold on a cold surface during the injection procedure. After disinfecting the skin with 70% ethanol and Povidone iodine, an incision was made in only the left ear (experiment) and right ear (scramble shRNA injection). Underlying fat and soft tissue were carefully dissected to expose the round window of the cochlea. The glass pipette was pulled with a P-2000 (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) and sharpened with a BV-10 Micropipette Beveler (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). The shRNA was injected using a nanoinjector (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). After all the shRNA was injected, the pipette was left in place for 30 seconds before removal. The muscles and fat tissue were covered, and the skin was closed with a polypropylene suture. Before returning the pups to the home cage, the mice were put on the worm bedding heated by a heating pad for recovery before returning to their mother. Total surgery time did not exceed 15 min.</p>

<title>Voltage-clamp recording of hair cell mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) current</title>
<p>Patch-clamp experiments were performed in the standard whole-cell mode using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments). Patch electrodes were pulled with a horizontal puller (Sutter Ins.

The bath solution consisted of (in mM) 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 glucose (pH was adjusted to 7.3 using NaOH). Currents were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Voltages were not corrected for a liquid junction potential. No leak current subtraction was performed. Cells were held at −80 mV. All electrophysiological experiments were performed at RT (21-22°C). We used stepwise and sinewave mechanical stimulation of IHC bundles through a piezo-driven fluid-jet stimulator to record IHC mechanoelectrical transducer (MET) currents. We represented the bundle displacement in the form of applied piezo-driven voltage. Bundle displacement was not calibrated for each cell because of variations in stimulating probe positions relative to the stimulated hair bundle.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The focus of this manuscript was to investigate the role of Cldn9 in the development of the mammalian cochlea. The main rationale of the study is the fact that cochlear hair cells do not regenerate, so when damaged they are lost forever, causing irreparable hearing loss. The authors have attempted to address this problem by inducing the ectopic production of additional hair cells and testing whether they acquire the morphological and functional characteristics of native hair cells. They show that downregulation of Cldn9 using a well-established genetic manipulation of transgenic mice led to the production of extra numerary inner hair cells, which were able to survive for several months. By performing a large battery of experiments, the authors were able to determine that the native and ectopic inner hair cells have comparable morphological and physiological characteristics. There are several conclusions highlighted by the authors in different parts of the manuscript, including the key role of Cldn9 in coordinating embryonic and postnatal development, the differentiation of supporting cells into inner hair cells, and the possible use of Cldn9 to induce inner hair cell differentiation following deafness induced by hair cell loss.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Several of the conclusions in this study are well supported by the experimental work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Some aspects of the data and its interpretation needs better explanation and requires further investigation.</p>
<p>1. The Results section is the most difficult part to read and understand. It contains a very limited, and in some places confusing and repetitive, description of the data. Statistical analysis is missing for some of the key data (e.g., ABRs), and in some places the text contradicts the data presented in the figures (e.g., Figure 8). I am sure a careful revision of the text would clarify some of these issues.</p>
<p>2. One puzzling finding that is not addressed in the manuscript is the lack of functional benefit from these additional inner hair cells. In fact, it appears to be detrimental based on the increased ABR thresholds. Maybe it would be useful to analyze the wave 1 characteristics.</p>
<p>3. It is not clear what direct evidence there is, apart from some immunostaining, indicating that the ectopic inner hair cells derive from the supporting cells. This part would benefit from a more careful consideration and maybe an attempt at a more direct experimental approach.</p>
<p>4. One point that should be made clear throughout the manuscript is that the ectopic inner hair cells are generated in a cochlea that is undergoing normal maturation. Thus, there is no guarantee that modulating the expression levels of Cldn9 in a deaf mouse lacking hair cells would produce the same result as that shown in this study. My guess is that it probably won't, but I am sure this could be tested (maybe in the future) using the excellent experimental approach applied in this study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The generation of functional extranumerary inner hair cells (IHCs) in postnatal mice, particularly with virus-mediated knockdown of Cldn9 mRNA expression in the neonatal cochlear duct, is an important observation. It is significant because not many studies exist that report molecular manipulations of the neonatal organ of Corti that result in the generation of new hair cells that remain functional and appear to be intact for an extended time, here more than one year. Overall, this is a carefully conducted study; the observations are clear, and the methods are solid. Two independent methods for reducing the expression of Cldn9 mRNA were used: a conditional transgenic model and AAV-mediated knockdown with shRNA. The lack of a functional explanation of how the reduced expression of Cldn9 specifically leads to the formation of extranumerary IHCs leaves open questions. For example, it is not clear whether there is indeed a fate change happening and whether Cldn9 reduction affects developmental processes. The discussion of how Cldn9 reduction potentially affects Notch signaling, without hard evidence, is handwaving.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is a very interesting observation and somewhat unexpected in its specificity for inner hair cells. Using two different approaches to manipulate Cldn9 expression provides a strong experimental foundation. The study is conducted quantitatively and with care.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The lack of mechanistic insight results in an open-ended story where at least the potential interaction of Cldn9 reduction with known and well-characterized signaling pathway components should have been investigated. This missed opportunity limits the scope of the study and should be addressed: How does Cldn9 downregulation affect the expression levels of other known genes linked to hair cell production and cell fate decisions? Quantitative RT-PCR is working well for the authors, and a comparison of the expression of Notch or other known pathway components could provide mechanistic insight.</p>
<p>It is unclear how P21 inner hair cells were identified for the patch clamp experiments shown in Fig 4E-H. This is a challenging endeavor without the possibility of using specific markers.</p>
<p>Please also address the numerous minor points outlined below; it will improve the paper's readability.</p>
<p>Please include page numbers and line numbers in a revised manuscript.</p>

<p>This important study by Chen et al help in advancing our knowledge about the regulation of inner hair cell (IHC) development and revealed the role of Cldn9 in IHC embryonic and postnatal induction by transdifferentiation from the supporting cells. The authors developed an inducible doxycycline (dox)-tet-OFF-Cldn9 transgenic mice to regulate expression levels of Cldn9 and show that downregulation of Cldn9 resulted in additional, although incomplete row of IHCs immediately adjacent to the original IHC row. These induced extra IHCs had similar well developed hair bundles, able to mechanotransduce and were innervated by auditory neurons resembling wild-type IHCs. In addition, the authors knock down Cldn9 postnatally using shRNA injections in P1-7 mice with similar induction of extranumerary IHC next to the original row of IHCs. The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by the data, but some data analysis needed to be clarified and some crucial controls should be provided to improve the confidence in the presented results. There is a great potential for practical use of these valuable findings and new knowledge on IHC developmental regulation to design Cldn9 gene therapy in the future.</p>
<p>
The described by Chen et al mechanisms of extra hair cell generation by suppression of the tight junction protein Cldn9 expression level are very interesting and previously unknown. In particular, the generation of extra IHCs postnatally using downregulation of Cldn9 by shRNA could potentially be very useful as a replacement of HCs lost after noise-induced trauma, ototoxic agents, or other environmental trauma. On the other hand, the replacement of lost hair cells due to various genetic mutations by inducing a supernumerary IHCs with the same abnormalities would not be reasonable.</p>
<p>
The authors show that postnatally generated ectopic IHCs are viable and mechanotransducive, but it would be nice to show the maturation steps of ectopic IHC during this postnatal period. For example, stereocilia bundles of the ectopic hair cells should mature later than the original IHCs. A few days after viral delivery of shRNA, you should be able to observe immature IHC bundles that unequivocally will define newly generated IHCs. Unfortunately, the authors show only examples of already mature ectopic IHCs at P21 and in 5-6 weeks old mice and at relatively low resolution. Also, during maturation, IHCs usually have transient axo-somatic synapses that are not present in mature IHCs. It would be great to see if, in 5-6 weeks old mouse, the ectopic IHCs still have axo-somatic synapses or not, and if the majority of the ectopic IHCs have innervation. Some of the data in this study would benefit from showing corresponding controls and some - from higher resolution imaging.</p>
<p>
In the mammalian cochlea, each HC is separated from the next by intervening supporting cells, forming an invariant and alternating mosaic along the cochlea's length. Cochlear supporting cells in some conditions can divide and trans-differentiate into HCs, serving as a potential resource for HC differentiation, using transcription and other developmental signaling factors.</p>
<p>
However, when ectopic hair cells are generated from supporting cell trans-differentiation, the intricate mosaic of the organ of Corti is altered, which could by itself lead to hearing issues. In case of downregulation of Cldn9, the extra row of IHCs seems to be positioned immediately adjacent to the original IHC row. It is not clear if the newly formed unusual junctions between the ectopic and original IHCs are sufficiently tight to prevent leakage of the endolymph to the basolateral surface of IHCs. Also, it is not clear if the other organ of Corti tight junctions could lose their tightness due to the downregulation of Cldn9, which could over time affect the endocochlear potential as shown by this study and hearing abilities.</p>
<p>
Importantly, CLDN9 immunofluorescence staining data that show cytoplasmic staining of supporting cells should be revisited and the organ of Corti schematics showing CLDN9 expression should be corrected, considering that CLDN9 localizes to the tight junctions of the reticular lamina as was shown by immunoEM in this study and described in previous publications (Kitajiri et al., 2004; Nakano et al., 2009, Ramzan et al., 2021).</p>
<p>
While the current version of the manuscript will be of interest to scientists working in the inner ear development and regeneration field, it could be more valuable to the hearing researchers outside this immediate field and perhaps developmental biologists and cell biologists after proper revision.</p>
