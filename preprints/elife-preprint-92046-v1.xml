<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite the recognized importance of the spinal cord in sensory processing, motor behaviors, and neural diseases, the underlying organization of neuronal clusters and their spatial location remain elusive. Recently, several studies have attempted to define the neuronal types and functional heterogeneity in the spinal cord using single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing in animal models or developing humans. However, molecular evidence of cellular heterogeneity in the adult human spinal cord is limited. Here, we classified spinal cord neurons into 21 subclusters and determined their distribution from nine human donors using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. Moreover, we compared the human findings with previously published single-nucleus data of the mouse adult spinal cord, which revealed an overall similarity in the neuronal composition of the spinal cord between the two species while simultaneously highlighting some degree of heterogeneity. Additionally, we examined the sex differences in the spinal neuronal subclusters. Several genes, such as SCN10A and HCN1, showed sex differences in motor neurons. Finally, we classified human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons using spatial transcriptomics and explored the putative interactions between DRG and spinal cord neuronal subclusters. In summary, these results illustrate the complexity and diversity of spinal neurons in humans and provide an important resource for future research to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying spinal cord physiology and diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spinal cord is composed of distinct cell populations, mainly neurons and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abraira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Peirs and Seal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Todd, 2017</xref>). The heterogeneity among the various neuronal clusters contributes to the differences in sensory perception, transduction and processing, as well as the modulation of motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abraira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Floriddia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Todd, 2010</xref>). Recently, single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has provided an unbiased comprehensive strategy to explore gene expression at high resolution and classify cellular clusters in an objective manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aldinger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tran et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, single-nucleus analysis has several advantages, such as easy performance in whole tissue and avoidance of experimental artifacts in intact cells that are induced during the tissue dissociation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grindberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Habib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lake et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Emerging studies have used single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-seq to classify neuronal types in the mouse spinal cord. Using split pool ligation-based transcriptome single-nucleus sequencing (SPLiT-seq), Rosenberg <italic>et al</italic>. identified 30 neuronal types in the developing spinal cord of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). Delile <italic>et al</italic>. performed high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq and revealed the spatial and temporal dynamics of gene expression in the cervical and thoracic spinal cords of developing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Delile et al., 2019</xref>). Using single-cell RNA-seq, Häring <italic>et al</italic>. identified 15 excitatory and 15 inhibitory subtypes of sensory neurons in the spinal dorsal horn of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Häring et al., 2018</xref>). Sathyamurthy <italic>et al</italic>. used massively parallel single-nucleus RNA-seq and identified 43 neuronal populations in the lumbar spinal cord of adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>). Russ <italic>et al</italic>. provided an integrated view of cell types in the mouse spinal cord and their spatial organization and gene expression signatures using single-cell RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Russ et al., 2021</xref>). Recent studies have also provided the single-cell transcriptomic profiles of the developing spinal cord in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Andersen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rayon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Although the molecular and cellular organization of the spinal cord neurons is relatively well understood in mice or developing humans, limited research has defined the heterogeneity among neurons and their spatial distribution in the adult human spinal cord at a single-cell resolution, which is important for understanding the molecular basis of spinal cord diseases and physiology because multiple findings from animal experiments cannot be directly replicated in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kushnarev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yekkirala et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we aimed to systematically map the molecular and cellular composition of the adult human spinal cord as well as their spatial location using 10x Genomics single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics and compare these data with previously published corresponding mouse datasets. This study further examined the sex differences in spinal neuronal clusters to explore the potential mechanism for the differential prevalence of pain between sexes. As a result, we classified human spinal cord neurons into 21 subtypes with distinct transcriptional patterns, molecular markers, and functional annotations. The resulting atlas demonstrates that the overall molecular and cellular organization of the human spinal cord are similar to those reported in mice, although some degree of heterogeneity among transcriptional patterns exists. In addition, we determined that several genes showed sex differences in motor neurons. This study also used RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) and/or immunofluorescence (IF) staining to help validate these conclusions and present evidence for the spatial distribution of several neuronal classes in the human spinal cord. Detailed information on specific gene expression and distribution may serve as an important resource of the cellular and molecular basis for the physiology and etiology of the spinal cord, such as disorders associated with spinal somatic sensation and/or motor behaviors.</p>

<title>Identification of spinal cell types by spatial transcriptomics</title>
<p>Using the 10x Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression platform, we generated spatial transcriptomes for spinal cells of lumbar enlargements from six adult human donors (three males and three females, 47-59 years old) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>). Barcoded spots with 55-μm size were printed on the capture areas (6.5 mm × 6.5 mm) in Visium slides. From these spots, we initially identified 17 cellular types (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic></bold>) with distinct distribution characteristics in the spinal slices (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic></bold>). Based on the representative marker genes (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref></italic></bold>), these 17 cell types were classified into five major clusters, including neurons, Schwann cells, a mixed population of neurons and astrocytes, a mixed population of meningeal and vascular cells, and a mixed population of glial cells (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></italic></bold>). Because of the lower resolution of the spatial transcriptomic approach than that of single-cell or single-nucleus transcriptomes, a large portion of neurons were not well separated from their surrounding astrocytes. From the spot location, we showed that neurons mainly existed in gray matter, oligodendrocytes and microglia were mainly present in white matter, while astrocytes were distributed over the entire spinal cord tissue (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></italic></bold>). The number of spots in these five clusters and genes detected per cluster are shown in <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></italic></bold> and <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></italic></bold>, respectively. We verified that each individual donor contributed spots to each cluster (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 1A</italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Identification of spinal cell types using single-nucleus RNA-seq</title>
<p>To obtain single-cell resolution, we further performed single-nucleus RNA-seq on 64,021 nuclei from the lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord from nine adult humans (six males and three females, 35-59 years old), including the same six donors used in spatial transcriptomics (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></italic></bold>). As a result, eight major cell types (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></italic></bold>) were identified with distinct molecular markers (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic>Supplemental figure 1B-C</italic></bold>): oligodendrocytes (58.8% of total nuclei), microglia (13.1% of total nuclei), neurons (11.9% of total nuclei), astrocytes (5.2% of total nuclei), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (4.6% of total nuclei), vascular cells (3% of total nuclei), meningeal cells (2.1% of total nuclei), and Schwann cells (1.2% of total nuclei). We verified that each individual donor contributed cells to each cluster and that no individual donor was responsible for any specific cluster (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 1D</italic></bold>). The number of genes detected per nucleus varied among the major cell types (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 1E</italic></bold>). On average, 5,245 genes were detected in a single spinal cord neuron, and 2,241 genes were detected in a single nonneuron cell. These cell types of single nucleus RNA-seq were mapped to the spots of spatial transcriptomics to determine their location. The results showed that neurons mainly existed in gray matter, while oligodendrocytes and microglia were mainly present in white matter <bold><italic>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>)</italic></bold>. Astrocytes were widely present in the spinal cord but were more highly expressed in the white matter than in the gray matter (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></italic></bold>). These findings were validated using IF staining (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Identification of neuronal subtypes in the spinal cord</title>
<p>To identify and characterize various neuronal subtypes within the spinal cord, 7,641 neuronal nuclei were reclassified into 21 subclusters (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>) based on their transcriptional characteristics (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 2A-B</italic></bold>).

To speculate the spatial distribution of each neuronal cluster, the spinal gray matter was separated into three portions, including the superficial dorsal horn (SD, lamina I-II), deep dorsal horn (DD, lamina III-VI), and ventral horn (V, VII-IX), according to previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Todd, 2010</xref>) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></italic></bold>). Excitatory (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></italic></bold>) and inhibitory (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref></italic></bold>) neurons were predominantly mapped to the dorsal horn, which was confirmed by IF staining of their markers. Motor neurons (<italic>CHAT</italic> positive) were predominantly located in the ventral horn, with scattered expression in the dorsal horn (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref></italic></bold>), which is consistent with the recent published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>). For specific clusters, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) indicated that, C3, C4, C6, C7, C8, C10, and C13-19 clusters were predominantly present in the SD; C1, C2, and C12 clusters were in the DD, C5, C9, and C11 clusters were present across the SD and the DD, while C0 and C20 clusters were mainly located in the ventral horn (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic>Supplemental figure 4</italic></bold>). We conducted IF staining to validate the expression and distribution of several marker genes in the human spinal cord. For example, C8 was mapped to the superficial dorsal horn, and its representative marker, <italic>PDYN (prodynorphin, ligands for the kappa-type of opioid receptor)</italic>, was distributed primarily in laminae I-II (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref></italic></bold>), consistent with the previously reported location of <italic>PDYN</italic>-expressing neurons in the rodent spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sapio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Serafin et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we sought to explore the representative marker genes and annotate each cluster. Based on the top three most differentially expressed genes (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 2A-B</italic></bold>) and the distribution of classical gene markers in the spinal cord (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 5</italic></bold>), we defined their putative types and provided the representative marker genes for each neuronal cluster. Finally, we named these clusters by their spatial location and their neurotransmitter status (E, excitatory; I, inhibitory; M, mixed; and C, cholinergic) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref></italic></bold>). We have validated the distribution of several markers using IF staining. For instance, <italic>CCK (cholecystokinin, involved in sensory processing under physiological and pain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peirs et al., 2021</xref>))</italic> (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 6A-D</italic></bold>) and <italic>SST (somatostatin, involved in transmitting itch and pain sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fatima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>))</italic> (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 6E-H</italic></bold>) were widely present in human dorsal glutamatergic neurons, consistent with the findings in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Todd, 2017</xref>). <italic>FOXP2 (Forkhead box P2, involved neuronal differentiation and movement disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rousso et al., 2012</xref>))</italic> was presented in both human glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 6I-L</italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Transcriptional profiles of classical markers in spinal cord neurons</title>
<p>To explore the molecular and cellular architecture in the spinal cord neurons and to further determine their conservation and divergence between humans and mice, we mapped the expression profiles of classical spinal cord markers in humans and mice, including well-known ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, and transcription factors (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-G</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic>Supplemental figure 8</italic></bold>). First, from the atlas, we can make a general comparison of gene expression across different subclusters within humans or mice. The results showed that most genes showed similar expression profiles across different clusters, although several were significantly differentially expressed. For example, the expression of <italic>SST</italic> was significantly higher in C13 than in other clusters of humans (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, F</xref></italic></bold>), and the expression of <italic>NPY (neuropeptide Y, which influences many physiological processes, such as cortical excitability and stress response)</italic> was higher in C11 than in other clusters of humans (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, F</xref></italic></bold>). In the mouse spinal cord, <italic>Nts (neurotensin that may function as a neurotransmitter or a neuromodulator)</italic> and <italic>Nos1 (nitric oxide synthase 1 that functions as a neurotransmitter)</italic> showed selectively higher expression levels in C13 and C8, respectively (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, G</xref></italic></bold>). Second, we also observed that the overall transcriptional patterns were similar between species. For example, <italic>TAC1 (tachykinin precursor 1, functions as a neurotransmitter)</italic> and <italic>NPY</italic> were mainly present in the clusters (e.g., C4 and C11, respectively) of superficial dorsal neurons of both human (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, F</xref></italic></bold>) and mouse spinal cord (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, G</xref></italic></bold>), which were confirmed by RNAscope ISH and/or IF staining (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H-K</xref></italic></bold>). Nevertheless, some degree of heterogeneity in the expression of specific genes also existed between humans and mice. For example, <italic>Calca (calcitonin-related polypeptide alpha, which is involved in migraine)</italic> was selectively expressed in C20 of mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, G</xref></italic></bold>), but <italic>CALCA</italic> almost did not exist in human spinal neurons (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, F</xref></italic></bold>). <italic>GRP (gastrin releasing peptide)</italic> was predominantly present in C7 of humans (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, F</xref></italic></bold>), but <italic>Grp</italic> showed little expression in all mouse spinal neuronal clusters (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E, G</xref></italic></bold>). Of note, several genes, such as <italic>PAM (peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase)</italic>, <italic>OPRM1 (opioid receptor mu 1)</italic>, <italic>EBF1</italic>, <italic>GABRG3 (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunit gamma3)</italic>, <italic>GRIK2 (glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 2)</italic>, <italic>SCN1A (sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1)</italic>, <italic>KCND2 (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 2)</italic>, and <italic>RORA (RAR related orphan receptor A),</italic> were highly and widely expressed in the spinal neurons of both humans and mice (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-G</xref>, Supplemental figure 8-9</italic></bold>), which may provide some guidance for future studies that focus translational efforts on conserved molecular targets across species. However, several genes, such as <italic>CALCA</italic>, <italic>GAL (galanin)</italic>, and <italic>NPR1 (natriuretic peptide receptor 1),</italic> showed little expression in the human spinal cord (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-G</xref>, Supplemental figure 9J-L</italic></bold>), which should be considered during clinical translation. The expression profiles of each cluster in humans and mice are shown in <bold><italic>Supplemental material 1</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>Supplemental material 2</italic></bold>, respectively.

<title>Sex differences in gene expression in spinal neuronal types</title>
<p>The prevalence of chronic pain was higher in females than in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greenspan et al., 2007</xref>), which may result from sex differences in gene expression in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Avona et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mogil, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sorge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yu et al., 2020</xref>).

<p>C20 (motor neurons) had the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></italic></bold>), suggesting potential molecular differences in mechanisms of motor function between men and women. We were particularly interested in potential sex differences in genes related to pain processing and thus focused on ion channels. A main finding in C20 was the higher expression of genes that encode potassium channels, whereas a lower expression of genes that encode sodium channels was found in males compared to females (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref></italic></bold>).

<p>To determine the heterogeneity within DRG neurons, we further classified them into 13 subclusters: peptidergic neurons (PEP1-6), nonpeptidergic neurons (NP1-2), and neurofilament neurons (NF1-5) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></italic></bold>, <bold><italic>Supplemental figure 10B</italic></bold>) based on well-known representative marker genes (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 10C</italic></bold>). The number and percentage of barcodes for each cluster is shown in <bold><italic>Supplementalal Figure 10D</italic></bold>.

Characterizing ligand‒receptor interactions between DRG and spinal cord neurons may be an important future direction for research on sensory transduction.</p>

<title>Functional assignment for neuronal clusters</title>
<p>To propose a relationship between the identified neuronal types and known modality-specific functions, we performed GO term analysis of their top genes. We found that the overall functional assignments for excitatory, inhibitory, and motor clusters were similar in the adult human spinal cord (<bold><italic>Supplemental figure 13A-D</italic></bold>), such as chemical or glutamatergic synaptic transmission, axon guidance, neuron projection development, glutamate receptor signaling pathway, regulation of NMDA receptor activity, and ion transmembrane transport, suggesting that these neuronal subpopulations cooperated in the regulation of spinal functions.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate the value of our spinal cord atlas as a rich resource for probing the cellular biology underlying complex diseases in the spinal cord.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Increasing evidence from animal studies has demonstrated the diversity and complexity of cellular composition in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Russ et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>). In the spinal cord, the heterogeneity among various neuronal components makes up complex circuits that process sensory information and regulate motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abraira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Häring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Todd, 2010</xref>). In the present study, we profiled the classification of cell types and their spatial information in the adult human spinal cord using 10x Genomics single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics. As a result, we created an atlas of 21 discrete neuronal subtypes in the human spinal cord. We also defined these neuronal clusters using representative marker genes and identified their spatial distribution. Furthermore, we generated an atlas of the transcriptional profiles of spinal classical genes in the neuronal subtypes. A recent study also provided a cellular taxonomy of the adult human spinal cord using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>). They classified the cells of adult spinal cord into oligodendrocytes, microglia, astrocytes, neurons, OPC, meningeal cells, endothelial and pericyte cells, lymphocytes, Schwann cells, and ependymal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with their findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>), we showed oligodendrocytes and microglia were mainly enriched in the white matter, while astrocytes were distributed over the entire spinal cord. They also re-clustered neurons into glutamatergic, GABAergic/glycinergic, and cholinergic groups (motor neurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>). Using spatial transcriptomics, they showed that dorsal excitatory and inhibitory neurons were mainly localized to the superficial dorsal horn, and the dorsal excitatory and inhibitory neurons were mainly distinguished by neuropeptide genes. For example, the dorsal excitatory neurons were enriched with <italic>TAC1</italic>, <italic>TAC3</italic>, and <italic>GRP</italic>, while the dorsal inhibitory neurons were mainly expressed <italic>PENK</italic>, <italic>PDYN</italic>, and <italic>NPY</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>), which were in agreement with our findings. Importantly, our data further identified several genes with sex differences in motor neurons. We also performed spatial transcriptomics in DRG and provided the ligand‒receptor interactions between DRG and spinal neuronal types. Therefore, our data not only confirms several findings of a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>), and but also will serve as an important supplement in illustrating the complex transcriptomics of adult human spinal cord.</p>
<p>To date, multiple cellular and molecular changes in the spinal cord, including those in the expression of ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, and transcription factors, are thought to contribute to pathological pain development after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yekkirala et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is a great challenge to transfer experimental results from animals directly to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kushnarev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tibbs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yekkirala et al., 2017</xref>). High variance in cell components and gene expression in individual cell types in the spinal cord among species may partly explain the failure of clinical translation. Although multiple genes associated with pain have been identified in previous studies in rodents, the expression profiles of these genes in neuronal clusters of the human spinal cord remain elusive. In this study, we have provided transcriptional patterns of classical genes associated with pain in different human neuronal clusters. We also compared the differences in the expression of these genes across species. Our results of human-mouse comparisons indicate substantial similarities in the cell components and expression profiles of important genes across species, which is consistent with one recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>). However, several neuronal clusters showed varied expression profiles in terms of specific genes. For example, <italic>Calca</italic> was selectively expressed in motor neurons of mice, but <italic>CALCA</italic> almost never existed in human spinal neurons. Moreover, we did not identify the mouse homologous cluster for human C18. Interestingly, motor neurons in mouse developing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>) and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alkaslasi et al., 2021</xref>) spinal cord, as well as in the human developing spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Andersen et al., 2023</xref>) can be divided into two distinct subtypes (alpha and gamma), which were not observed in the adult human spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>). These divergences may partially explain why drug targets in the mouse model cannot be replicated in humans occasionally. This work reveals the molecular repertoire of each neuronal population, providing a significant extension of our understanding of different cell types in the spinal cord and an important database that allows researchers to probe and analyze the expression profiles of risk genes for human diseases involving the spinal cord. Therefore, this data resource may serve as a powerful tool to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms in neuronal populations that mediate spinal cord diseases.</p>
<p>The spinal cord plays a pivotal role in normal sensory processing and pathological conditions, such as chronic pain, providing numerous potential targets for the development of novel analgesics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Todd, 2010</xref>). However, there is a different prevalence of pain between male and female rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berkley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Greenspan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mogil, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Unruh, 1996</xref>). Previous human genetic studies have attempted to explore the underlying genetic mechanisms and identified several potential targets with sex-dependent expression, such as <italic>OPRM1</italic>, <italic>HTR2A (encoding serotonin 2A receptor)</italic>, <italic>SLC6A4 (encoding sodium-dependent serotonin transporter)</italic>, <italic>P2RX7 (encoding the ATP-gated purinoreceptor P2X7)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mogil, 2020</xref>), and <italic>CALCA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>). However, knowledge about gene expression that exhibits sex differences in the human spinal cord is limited. In our study, we showed that the overall transcriptomic profiles were largely conserved between the male and female spinal cord. Interestingly, for specific neuronal types, we identified several genes associated with pain that were differentially expressed in motor neurons between sexes. For example, <italic>FGF13</italic>, <italic>EBF1</italic>, <italic>KCNB2</italic>, <italic>KCNQ3</italic>, <italic>LRFN5</italic>, <italic>KCNC2</italic>, <italic>HTR2C</italic>, and <italic>CHRM3</italic> are significantly more highly expressed in males than females, while <italic>HCN1</italic> and <italic>SCN10A</italic> are significantly more highly expressed in females than males. Of note, previous evidence showed that the expression of <italic>HCN1</italic> and <italic>SCN10A</italic> exhibit sex differences in several nerve tissues, which might contribute the different prevalence of neurological disorders. For example, Hughes <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the expression level of HCN1 protein is significant higher (&gt; 5-fold) in the medial prefrontal cortical of female rats than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>SCN10A</italic> in the DRG and spinal cord of rodents is suggested to be associated with the higher prevalence of chronic pain in females compared to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">O’Brien et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Paige et al., 2020</xref>). The gene expression differences we observed may suggest potential molecular differences in the mechanisms of fine motor behaviors between men and women.</p>
<p>According to the projection sites of axons, neurons in the spinal cord can be divided into two main types, including projection cells with their axons that project to the brain and interneurons with their axons that remain within the region of the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Todd, 2017</xref>). Both projection neurons and interneurons can be further divided into three functional classes: inhibitory neurons, excitatory neurons, and motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Häring et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Osseward et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Todd, 2017</xref>). Mouse single-nucleus RNA-seq data revealed that spinal cholinergic clusters (<italic>Chat</italic> and <italic>Slc5a7</italic> markers) belong to excitatory clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>). However, both our and previous adult human results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>), as well as the developing human data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Andersen et al., 2023</xref>) showed that cholinergic clusters were independent subpopulations in the human spinal cord. Furthermore, we identified mixed populations that expressed both excitatory and inhibitory markers, which was not consistent with the findings in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>). In accordance with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Todd, 2017</xref>), our results also showed that some classical marker genes of the spinal cord, including <italic>CCK</italic>, <italic>SST</italic>, <italic>NST</italic>, and <italic>TAC1,</italic> were predominantly present in excitatory neuronal clusters, while others, such as <italic>NPY, NOS1</italic>, and <italic>PNOC (prepronociceptin),</italic> were predominantly present in inhibitory neuronal clusters, which is in line with the recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yadav et al., 2023</xref>). A previous study reported that the genes encoding the opioid peptides <italic>Penk (proenkephalin)</italic> and <italic>Pdyn</italic> were expressed by both excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Todd, 2017</xref>), whereas our results showed that <italic>PENK</italic> and <italic>PDYN</italic> were predominantly present in human inhibitory neuronal clusters C15 and C8, respectively.</p>
<p>The component heterogeneity of somatosensory neurons in the DRG is essential to relay different peripheral inputs to the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gatto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Todd, 2010</xref>). The heterogeneity in the molecular transcriptomes, neuronal types, and functional properties of DRG neurons in rodents has been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wang et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Recently, emerging evidence has revealed the organization of human DRG somatosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jung et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yu et al., 2023</xref>). Using single nucleus RNA-seq, Nguyen <italic>et al</italic>. identified 15 subclusters in human somatosensory neurons from lumbar 4-5 DRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>). Using spatial transcriptomics, Tavares-Ferreira <italic>et al</italic>. defined 12 subpopulations in human DRG sensory neurons, including 5 C nociceptors, 1 C low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), 1 Aβ nociceptor, 2 Aδ, 2 Aβ, and 1 proprioceptor subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with these results, our study also used spatial transcriptomics to identify several of the same clusters. For example, PEP6, NF4, NF5, and NP2 in our study were matched with putative silent nociceptors, putative proprioceptors, A LTMRs, and C-LTMRs, respectively, in Tavares-Ferreira <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>). Jung <italic>et al</italic>. used single-nucleus RNA-seq to classify human DRG neurons into 11 subclusters, including Proprioceptor &amp; Aβ SA-LTMR, Aβ SA-LTMR Ntrk3, Aδ-LTMR Ntrk2, C-LTMR P2ry1, NP1 Gfra1 Gfra2, NP2 Gfra1, NP3 SST, PEP1 Adcyap1, PEP2 Ntrk1, PEP2 Fam19a1, and Cold Trpm8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jung et al., 2023</xref>). A recent preprint in bioRxiv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yu et al., 2023</xref>) used single-soma RNA-seq to identify 16 neuronal types in human DRGs, including hTRPM8, hC. LTMR, hNP1, hNP2, hPEP. SST, hPEP.TRPV1/A1.1, hPEP.TRPV1/A1.2, hPEP. PIEZO, hPEP. KIT, hPEP. CHRNA7, hPEP. NTRK3, hPEP.0, hAδ. LTMR, hAβ. LTMR, hPropr, and hATF3. Some degree of heterogeneity existed in the clusters identified between these studies. For example, Jung <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jung et al., 2023</xref>) defined SST-positive neurons as NPs, whereas in our study and Yu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yu et al., 2023</xref>), SST clusters belong to PEPs. The H10 cluster in the study of Ngyuen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>) and the pruritogen receptor cluster in the study of Tavares-Ferreira <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>) mapped to both NP1 and NP2 in the study of Jung <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jung et al., 2023</xref>). These inconsistent nomenclatures for DRG subtypes across studies influence the comparison and integration of transcriptomic profiles across species, thereby hindering successful clinical translation. Previous studies have identified several genes that are differentially expressed between human and mouse DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jung et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yu et al., 2023</xref>). For example, <italic>SCN4B</italic>, <italic>IL31RA</italic>, <italic>IL4R</italic>, <italic>IL10RA</italic>, <italic>IL13RA1</italic>, <italic>TRPV1</italic>, <italic>SCN8A</italic>, and <italic>CALCA</italic> were more widely expressed across human DRG neuron subtypes than in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jung et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tavares-Ferreira et al., 2022</xref>). We additionally found that <italic>PVALB</italic> and <italic>SST</italic> showed broader expression across human DRG neuronal clusters than in mice, suggesting that genes are more selectively expressed in mice than in human DRGs.</p>
<p>It is recognized that dorsal spinal neurons can receive different DRG primary afferents to process different sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Todd, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2017</xref>). It is also well known that primary afferent axons terminate in different laminae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Todd, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2017</xref>). For example, myelinated low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents arborize in an area extending from lamina IIi-V, whereas nociceptive and thermoreceptive Aδ and C afferents innervate lamina I and much of lamina II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Todd, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2017</xref>). However, we still know little about the interactions between the various neuronal components of the DRG and spinal cord. Wang <italic>et al</italic>. reported that DRG TRPV1<sup>+</sup> neuron-spinal ErbB4<sup>+</sup> neuron connections are involved in heat sensation and that NRG1-ErbB4 signaling is related to heat hypersensitivity induced by nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). However, which DRG neuronal types secrete NRG1 remains unclear. Previous studies have shown that NRG1 is mainly produced in myelinated neurons and less in TRPV1<sup>+</sup> nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Calvo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Velanac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Willem et al., 2006</xref>). In the present study, we explored the potential connections between neuronal clusters in the DRG and spinal cord using ligand‒receptor analysis. Interestingly, our results showed that <italic>NRG1</italic> from NF clusters (myelinated DRG neurons) is paired with <italic>ERBB4</italic> of spinal superficial dorsal horn clusters, which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Calvo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Velanac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Willem et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, our findings added evidence that <italic>NRG1</italic> was likely secreted by NF clusters, activated ERBB4<sup>+</sup> neurons in the superficial dorsal horn and induced heat hypersensitivity. Ligand‒receptor analysis also revealed that <italic>NGFR</italic> and <italic>CALCRL</italic> in spinal C16 received broad inputs from various DRG neuronal clusters, suggesting the importance of spinal C16 clusters in DRG-spinal interactions. Therefore, our findings may guide future studies focusing on projections from the DRG to the spinal cord.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations. First, we did not use animal models to explore the function of identified neuronal clusters as well as the functional outcomes of genes with sex differences. Second, the putative projections from DRG to spinal neuronal types were not verified. Last, the comparison results between species rely on different sequencing techniques or different sample treating methods, which should be treated with caution in interpreting these data. It is of significance to address these important questions in future studies.</p>
<p>In summary, this work presents an atlas of adult human spinal neuronal types and their gene expression signatures and will provide an important resource for future research to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying spinal cord physiology and diseases.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>This study aimed to classify human spinal cord neurons and determine their spacial distribution, as well as explore the putative projections between DRG-spinal neuronal clusters using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. For this purpose, Lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord and L3-5 DRGs were acutely isolated from nine adult brain-dead human donors (six males and three females) within 90 min of cross-clamping in the operating room. To perform spatial transcriptomics, the spinal cord and DRG tissues were sectioned onto Visium slides, stained, and imaged. Tissue permeabilization and Visum spatial libraries were constructed using a Visum spatial library construction kit (10x Genomics, PN-1000184) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were finally sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq6000. We also examined the sex differences in the spinal neuronal subclusters between six male and three female donors. Additionally, we compared the transcriptional profiling obtained in human samples with previously published single-nucleus transcriptomic data of the mouse spinal cord. Finally, several sequencing findings were validated using RNAscope ISH and IF staining. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University on May 19, 2021 (Approval No. KLL-2020-273) and was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100047511) on June 20, 2021.

<p>Lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord and L3-5 DRGs were acutely isolated from nine adult brain-dead human donors within 90 min of cross-clamping in the operating room. These donors had not been diagnosed with acute/chronic low back or lower limb pain and mainly died from cerebral hernia or intraventricular hemorrhage. Surgical procedures were performed by the same surgeon from the department of orthopedic surgery. Samples were immediately cleaned from the blood and connective tissue and frozen on dry ice. Spinal cord tissues were cut transversely, parts were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound for spatial transcriptomics, and the remaining tissues were stored at −80°C for single nucleus RNA-seq, RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH), or immunofluorescence (IF) staining. For DRGs, the whole ganglia were embedded in OCT for spatial transcriptomics, and other DRGs were stored at −80°C for RNAscope in situ hybridization or IF staining.</p>

<title>Isolation of nuclei for single nucleus RNA-seq</title>
<p>Nuclei were isolated using a Nucleus Isolation Kit (catalog no. 52009-10, SHBIO, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, frozen human spinal cord was thawed on ice, minced, and homogenized in cold lysis buffer containing 1% BSA. Then, the lysate was filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer after removing the supernatant, followed by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The pellet was then filtered through a 40-μm cell strainer, centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C, and resuspended twice in nuclease-free BSA. Nuclei were stained with trypan blue and counted using a dual-fluorescence cell counter.</p>

<title>cDNA synthesis for single nucleus RNA-seq</title>
<p>Nuclei were loaded onto a Chromium single-cell controller (10x Genomics) to generate single-nucleus gel beads in the emulsion (GEM) using a single-cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit V3.1 (10x Genomics, 1000075) and Chromium Single Cell B Chip Kit (10x Genomics, 1000074) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 8,040 nuclei were captured from each sample. The captured nucleus was lysed, and the released mRNA was barcoded through reverse transcription in individual GEMs. Reverse transcription was performed to generate cDNA using an S1000TM Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) with the following parameters: 53°C for 45 min, 85°C for 5 min, and 4°C until further use. The cDNA was then amplified, and the quality was assessed using an Agilent 4200 (CapitalBio Technology, Beijing).</p>

<title>Data preprocessing</title>
<p>10x Genomics raw data were processed by the Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software Suite (release 5.0.1) to demultiplex raw base call files into FASTQ files using Cell ranger (v 6.1.2) and then to perform alignment, filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting using cellranger count. The reads were aligned to the GRCh38 human reference genome using a prebuilt annotation package downloaded from the 10x Genomics website.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i2">
<title>Quality control</title>
<p>Quality control was performed to eliminate low-quality cells, empty droplets or cell doublets. Low-quality cells or empty droplets usually contain very few genes or exhibit extensive mitochondrial contamination, whereas cell doublets exhibit an aberrantly high gene count. We also detected contamination with low-complexity cells such as red blood cells, which are less complex RNA species. Briefly, cells were filtered out if the gene number was &lt; 200 or &gt; 10,000, UMI counts were &lt; 500, cell complexity was &lt; 0.8, or the mitochondrial gene ratio was &gt; 10%.</p>

<sec id="s4i3">
<title>Normalization and integration</title>
<p>The Seurat package (v 4.3.0) was used to normalize and scale the single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Data were first normalized by the “Normalize Data” function using the normalization method “Log Normalize.” In detail, the expression of gene A in cell B was determined by the UMI count of gene A divided by the total number of UMIs of cell B, followed by multiplying by 10,000 for normalization, and the log-transformed counts were then computed with base as 2. The top 3,000 highly variable genes (HVGs) were detected by the “Find Variable Features” function using the selection method “vst”. We then used the “Scale Data” function to remove the uninteresting sources of variation by regressing out cell‒cell variation within gene expression driven by batch, the number of detected UMI, mitochondrial gene expression, and ribosomal gene expression. Finally, the corrected expression matrix was generated for further analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4i4">
<title>Dimension reduction, cell clustering and annotation</title>
<p>We used the “Run PCA” function in the Seurat package to perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the single-cell expression matrix with genes restricted to HVGs. To integrate cells into a shared space from different batches for unsupervised clustering, the harmony algorithm (v 0.1.0) was used to integrate two batches using the “Run Harmony” function. We then used the “Find Clusters” function in the Seurat package to conduct the cell clustering analysis by embedding cells into a graph structure in harmony space. The clustering results were visualized using UMAP. Canonical markers were used to determine the cell-type identity. These include <italic>SNAP25</italic>, <italic>SYP</italic>, <italic>RBFOX3</italic> for neurons; <italic>MBP</italic>, <italic>MOBP</italic>, <italic>MOG</italic>, <italic>PLP1</italic> for oligodendrocytes; <italic>MPZ</italic>, <italic>PMP22</italic>, <italic>PRX</italic> for Schwann cells; <italic>DCN</italic>, <italic>COL3A1</italic> for meningeal cells; <italic>AQP4</italic>, <italic>ATP1A2</italic>, GJA1, <italic>SLC1A2</italic> for astrocytes; <italic>FLT1, PECAM1</italic>, <italic>TEK</italic> for vascular cells; <italic>PDGFRA</italic> for oligodendrocyte precursor cells; and <italic>PTPRC</italic> for microglia.</p>

<title>Differential expression analysis</title>
<p>Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the ‘Find Markers’ function based on the nonparametric Wilcox rank sum test for two annotated cell groups. The marker genes were identified using the ‘Find All Markers’ function in Seurat with settings on genes with at least 0.25 increasing logFC upregulation compared to the remaining cell clusters.</p>

<sec id="s4i6">
<title>Enrichment analysis</title>
<p>Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment was conducted using the R package with default settings. GO terms with an adjusted p value of less than 0.05, calculated by the hypergeometric test followed by the Benjamini‒Hochberg method, were defined as significantly enriched terms. The top 20 enriched terms were selected for visualization.</p>

<sec id="s4i7">
<title>Spatial transcriptomics data analysis</title>
<p>We further characterized neuronal clusters by examining their spatial distribution using spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. For ST data, Loupe Browser (v 6.0.0) was used to align the gene expression spots to the image of the tissue slides to ensure a high-quality alignment. Processing of raw reads and calculation of barcode/UMI counts of the ST data were performed using 10x Genomics Space Ranger (v 1.3.1) with GRCh38 as a reference. Ribosomal and mitochondrial genes were removed for further analysis. Filters were applied to keep spots with gene counts ≥ 30 and UMI counts ≥ 50. ST data were integrated with Seurat (v 4.3.0). Filtered gene-barcode matrices were normalized with the ‘SCTransform’ function, and the top 3,000 variable genes were identified. Next, we performed principal component analysis (PCA), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) using the first 30 principal components. A shared nearest neighbor graph was built by the ‘FindNeighbors’ function in Seurat, and cluster identifications were performed by application of the Louvain algorithm using the ‘FindClusters’ function in Seurat.</p>
<p>SpaCET (v 1.0.0) was used to conduct cell type deconvolution of ST data with the above neuronal subcluster datasets as a reference. To identify the spatial location of neuronal subtypes, the spinal gray matter was separated into three regions as described in previous studies, including the superficial dorsal horn (lamina Ⅰ-Ⅱ), deep dorsal horn (lamina Ⅲ-Ⅵ), and ventral horn (Ⅶ-Ⅸ). Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) for the selected 3 subregions was conducted with the R package GSVA (v 1.42.0) using the top 50 positive marker genes as input from neuronal subclusters. A heatmap showing GSVA signature scores per region was visualized with ComplexHeatmap (v 2.14.0).</p>

<title>Human and mouse neuronal comparison in the spinal cord</title>
<p>Cross-species analysis was performed by comparison of our human findings with mouse data (GSE103892) from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>). The orthologous genes within the mouse data matrix were converted to human homologs using the R babelgene package (v22.3). Then, label transfer analysis was performed using Seurat (v 4.3.0). Mouse datasets were withheld as the query, while human datasets were used as the reference. Briefly, label transfer analysis consists of two steps. First, The transfer anchors were identified using the ‘FindTransferAnchors’ function. Second, these anchors were then used to transfer cluster labels to the query dataset with the ‘TransferData’ function.</p>

<title>Cellular interaction analysis between DRG and spinal neuronal clusters</title>
<p>Interactions between DRG and spinal neuronal clusters were predicted by ligand receptor pair analysis using SingleCellSignalR (v1.6.0). This package provides its own database of ligand‒receptor pairs, and we filtered the ligand‒receptor database provided by SingleCellSignalR named LRdb. Data from DRG and spinal cord were first merged using the merge function, and then count data were processed by the LogNormalize function and used as input to predict cell-to-cell interactions. The cell_signaling function was used to predict and calculate the interaction score, and the parameters’tol’ were set to 1, ‘s.core’was set to 0, and ‘int.type’ was set to paracrine mode to predict the potential interaction. For each ligand and receptor, cell‒cell interactions were plotted for the top 20 highest ligand‒receptor scores. Each ligand‒receptor pair is scored based on gene expression in every cell type or cluster. Sankey plots were plotted with the R package ggalluvial (v0.12.3) and represent the number of putative cell-to-cell interactions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Zhang et al. provide valuable data for understanding molecular features of the human spinal cord. The authors made considerable efforts to acknowledge and objectively address the limitations of Visium while attempting to overcome them by utilizing single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) from the same tissue. By mapping snRNA-seq clusters to Visium data, they offer spatial information, complemented by RNA-ISH and immunofluorescence (IF) validation. They also discuss gender-related differences and the similarities between human and mouse data, aiming to establish a crucial foundation for experimental research. However, I have some comments below.</p>
<p>1. The observation of gender-related differences is interesting. The authors reported that SCN10A, associated with nociceptos, exhibited stronger expression in females. While they intend to validate this finding through IF, the quantitative difference is not clearly observed in the IF data (Figure 5f). It would be essential to provide validation through DAPI-based cell counts, demonstrating the difference in CHAT/SCNA10A co-expression.</p>
<p>2. It is meritorious that in novel features of the transcriptomic study, the authors considered gender-related differences and similarities between humans and mice. Nevertheless, despite the extensive bioinformatics-based analyses performed, the results mostly confirm what has been previously reported (Nguyen et al. 2021; Yadav et al. 2023; Jung et al. 2023).</p>
<p>3. The study did not perform snRNA-seq in the DRG. The limitations of Visium in cell type separation are acknowledged, and the authors are aware that Visium alone has limitations in describing cell expression patterns. The authors need to validate their findings via analyses of public DRG snRNA-seq data (Jung et al. 2023 Ncom; Nguyen et al. 2021eLife) before drawing broad conclusions.</p>
<p>4. Figure 7's comparison between human Visium spot data and Renthal et al.'s mouse snRNA-seq may have limitations as Visium spot data could not provide a transcriptional profile at the single cell resolution. The authors need to clarify this point.</p>
<p>5. Recent findings indicate that type 2 cytokines can directly stimulate sensory neurons. This includes the expression of IL-4RA, IL31RA, and IL13RA in DRG. These findings support the role of JAK kinase inhibitors in mediating chronic itch. Demonstrating the expression of these itch receptors in DRG would be valuable.</p>
<p>6. Given that juxtacrine and paracrine signals operate from 0 to 200 um, spatial information is vital to understanding intercellular communication. The presentation of spatial information using Visium is meaningful, and more comprehensive analyses of potential interaction based on distance should be provided, beyond the top 10 interactions (Figure 8).</p>
<p>7. The gender-related differences are interesting and, if possible, it would be interesting to explore whether age-related differences or degeneration-related factors exist. Using public data could allow the examination of age-related changes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper, the authors generated a comprehensive dataset of human spinal cord transcriptome using single-cell RNA sequencing and the Visium spatial transcriptomics platform. They employed Visium data to determine the spatial orientation of each cell type. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data, they identified differentially expressed genes by comparing human and mouse samples, as well as male and female samples.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study offers a thorough exploration of both cellular and spatial heterogeneity within the human spinal cord. The resulting atlas datasets and analysis findings represent valuable resources for the neuroscience community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The analysis of spatial transcriptomics data was conducted as it is single-cell RNAseq data. However, there are established tools for effectively integrating these two types of data. The incorporation of deconvolution methods could enhance the characterization of each spot's cell type composition.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Zhang et al sought to use spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to classify human spinal cord neurons. The authors reported 17 clusters on 10x Visium slides (6 donors) and 21 clusters by single-nucleus sequencing (9 donors). The authors tried to compare the results to those reported in mice and claimed similar patterns with some differing genes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript provides a valuable database for the molecular and cellular organization of adult human spinal cords in addition to published datasets (Andersen, et al. 2023; Yadav, et al. 2023).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The results are largely observatory and lack quantitative analysis. Moreover, the assertions regarding the sex differences in motor neurons and the potential interactions between DRG and spinal cord neuronal subclusters appear preliminary and necessitate more rigorous validation.</p>

<p>Thank you for this important question! We have added panel G in Figure 5, which provided the quantitative analysis of the percentage of CHAT neurons that expressing SCN10A in male and female spinal cord.</p>

<p>Thank you! In addition to confirming the findings from previous studies, our results also provided new information regarding the difference between human and mouse. For example, we found that PVALB and SST showed broader expression across human DRG neuronal clusters than in mice, suggesting that genes are more selectively expressed in mice than in human DRGs. Moreover, we identified several genes associated with pain that were differentially expressed in motor neurons between sexes.</p>

<p>Thank you for this critical question! It is right that snRNA-seq has a higher resolution in describing cell expression patterns compared to the spatial transcriptomics. We acknowledged the limitation that we only performed spatial transcriptomics in human DRG without snRNA-seq. Nevertheless, our results of spatial transcriptomics in human DRG were similar to previously public snRNA-seq data of human DRG, suggesting a feasibility of using spatial transcriptomics in human DRG.</p>

<p>1. Figure 7's comparison between human Visium spot data and Renthal et al.'s mouse snRNA-seq may have limitations as Visium spot data could not provide a transcriptional profile at the single cell resolution. The authors need to clarify this point.</p>

<p>Thank you! We have clarified this in the limitation section.</p>

<p>1. Recent findings indicate that type 2 cytokines can directly stimulate sensory neurons. This includes the expression of IL-4RA, IL31RA, and IL13RA in DRG. These findings support the role of JAK kinase inhibitors in mediating chronic itch. Demonstrating the expression of these itch receptors in DRG would be valuable.</p>

<p>We have provided the expression patterns of IL-4RA, IL31RA, and IL13RA in human and mouse DRG (Figure 7-figure supplement 4), and cited the relevant paper.</p>

<p>1. Given that juxtacrine and paracrine signals operate from 0 to 200 um, spatial information is vital to understanding intercellular communication. The presentation of spatial information using Visium is meaningful, and more comprehensive analyses of potential interaction based on distance should be provided, beyond the top 10 interactions (Figure 8).</p>

<p>Thank you for this good question! In this study, we focused on the putative projections from DRG to spinal neuronal types, which may be an important future direction for research on sensory transduction. It will be interesting to determine the intercellular communication in the spinal spot using the spatial transcriptomics data in future studies.</p>

<p>1. The gender-related differences are interesting and, if possible, it would be interesting to explore whether age-related differences or degeneration-related factors exist. Using public data could allow the examination of age-related changes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that it is of great importance to identify the age-related differences using spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq data of human spinal cord. However, it is currently difficult to obtain comprehensive results due to the limited human spinal cord datasets regarding different ages.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors generated a comprehensive dataset of human spinal cord transcriptome using single-cell RNA sequencing and the Visium spatial transcriptomics platform. They employed Visium data to determine the spatial orientation of each cell type. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data, they identified differentially expressed genes by comparing human and mouse samples, as well as male and female samples.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study offers a thorough exploration of both cellular and spatial heterogeneity within the human spinal cord. The resulting atlas datasets and analysis findings represent valuable resources for the neuroscience community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The analysis of spatial transcriptomics data was conducted as it is single-cell RNAseq data. However, there are established tools for effectively integrating these two types of data. The incorporation of deconvolution methods could enhance the characterization of each spot's cell type composition.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your positive comments and suggestions！Indeed, we have used deconvolution methods to incorporate the spinal snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang et al sought to use spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to classify human spinal cord neurons. The authors reported 17 clusters on 10x</p>
<p>Visium slides (6 donors) and 21 clusters by single-nucleus sequencing (9 donors). The authors tried to compare the results to those reported in mice and claimed similar patterns with some differing genes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript provides a valuable database for the molecular and cellular organization of adult human spinal cords in addition to published datasets (Andersen, et al. 2023; Yadav, et al. 2023).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The results are largely observatory and lack quantitative analysis. Moreover, the assertions regarding the sex differences in motor neurons and the potential interactions between DRG and spinal cord neuronal subclusters appear preliminary and necessitate more rigorous validation.</p>

<p>Thank you very much! We have provided the quantitative analysis of the differential expression of SCN10A in male and female spinal cord motor neurons. Our sequencing data revealed putative projections from DRG to spinal neuronal types, which may be an important future direction for research on sensory transduction. We did not use animal models to verify these interactions between DRG and spinal cord neuronal subclusters, which is a major limitation in our study. Nevertheless, our analysis results will provide an important resource for future research to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying spinal cord physiology and diseases.</p>
