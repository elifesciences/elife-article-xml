<title>Abstract</title><p>The digestive tract represents the most complex interface of an organism with its biotope. Food may be contaminated by pathogens and toxicants while an abundant and complex microbiota strives in the gut lumen. The organism must defend itself against potentially noxious biotic or abiotic stresses while preserving its microbiota, provided it plays a beneficial role. The presence of intestinal viruses adds another layer of complexity. Starting from a differential sensitivity of two lines from the same <italic>Drosophila</italic> wild-type strain to ingested <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, we report here that the presence of Nora virus in the gut epithelium promotes the sensitivity to this bacterial pathogen as well as to an ingested oxidizing xenobiotic. The genotype, age, nature of the ingested food and to a limited extent the microbiota are relevant parameters that influence the effects of Nora virus on host fitness. Mechanistically, we detect the initial presence of viral proteins essentially in progenitor cells. Upon stress such as infection, exposure to xenobiotics, aging or feeding on a rich-food diet, the virus is then detected in enterocytes, which correlates with a disruption of the intestinal barrier function in aged flies. Finally, we show that the virus proliferates only when ISCs are induced to divide and that blocking either enterocyte apoptosis or JAK/STAT-driven ISC division leads to a drastically reduced Nora virus titer.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is important to check that experimental strains are devoid of intestinal viruses when monitoring survival/life span of fly lines or when investigating the homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium as these viruses can constitute significant confounding factors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The digestive tract represents the most complex interface of the host with its environment as it involves a large surface, the presence of an important microbiota, the ingestion of food potentially contaminated by pathogens or toxicants, and the need for absorption of digested nutrients and solutes. Multiple concurrent infections or abiotic stresses are likely to be common, especially when the host feeds on decaying organic matter, as is the case for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Co-infection models with bacterial and viral pathogens in the gut are starting to be experimentally investigated and have revealed an enhanced susceptibility to combined infections that can, be caused either by affecting pathogen transmission or by an inability to withstand tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lian et al., 2022</xref>, and references therein).</p>
<p>Some twenty distinct viruses have been identified in wild Drosophila and around 30% of wild individuals are infected by at least one virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Webster et al., 2015</xref>). A few of them are studied in laboratory for the mechanisms of interaction with the host: <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Sigma Virus (DMelSV), <italic>Drosophila</italic> A virus (DAV), <italic>Drosophila</italic> C virus (DCV), Drosophila X virus (DXV), and Nora virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Schneider and Imler, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Webster et al., 2015</xref>). Nora is an enteric virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Habayeb et al., 2006</xref>). Unlike other insect picorna-like viruses, its genome encodes four open reading frames corresponding to: a suppressor of RNA interference, VP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">van Mierlo et al., 2012</xref>), replicative proteins coded by ORF2, the poorly characterized product of ORF3, and capsid proteins derived from ORF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ekstrom et al., 2011</xref>). This virus infects common laboratory stocks where it appears to cause a persistent infection. It is transmitted horizontally and vertically via a fecal-oral route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Habayeb et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Habayeb et al., 2006</xref>). The Nora virus likely proliferates in the digestive tract, as large quantities of the virus are continuously released in the feces of infected flies. The virus does not appear to have major effects on host fitness, even though some damages to the intestinal epithelium have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Habayeb et al., 2009a</xref>). However, the microbiota of flies infected by Nora may change in quantity and bacterial diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schissel et al., 2021</xref>). We then wondered whether a persistent Nora virus infection could influence a secondary pathogenic bacterial infection.</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal epithelium is simple, formed mostly by a monolayer of columnar polyploid enterocytes (EC) and also comprises enteroendocrine cells and intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and enterocytes progenitor called enteroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jiang and Edgar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lemaitre and Miguel-Aliaga, 2013</xref>). The microbiota is made up of few species, at most twenty, and is usually dominated by two-three prevalent species such as <italic>Acetobacter pomorum</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic>, or <italic>Enterococcus faecalis,</italic> but its composition changes with ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Broderick and Lemaitre, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Immune defenses in the midgut include a chemical armentamarium, notably reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the NADPH oxidase, and likely not Dual oxidase, and antimicrobial peptides such as Diptericin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ayyaz and Jasper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ferrandon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim and Lee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). Resilience, a complementary dimension of mucosal host defense also known as disease tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>), is the ability of the intestinal epithelium to maintain its homeostasis, for instance by a mechanism of cytoplasmic purge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) or the increased proliferation of ISCs that ultimately regenerate enterocytes damaged either directly by pathogens or indirectly by the host’s own immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ferrandon, 2013</xref>, and references therein). ISC proliferation is regulated by the production of the growth factor Unpaired 3 (Upd3) that activates the JAnus Kinase/Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway in ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Herrera and Bach, 2019</xref>). Several models of gut infection have been developed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonfini et al., 2016</xref>) and can be used to study coinfection with Nora virus. We have focused on <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> intestinal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cronin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Haller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Limmer et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nehme et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sina Rahme et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Socha et al., 2023</xref>) and had not noticed major damages of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> oral infections on the integrity of the intestinal epithelium in contrast to another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Apidianakis et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteria are able to cross the intestinal barrier and to silently colonize inner tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2024</xref>). They are initially found circulating in the hemolymph at low concentration. However, after a few days of continuous feeding on bacterial solution, the bacteria start proliferating in the hemolymph in a quorum-sensing-dependent manner and ultimately kill the host through bacteremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Haller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Limmer et al., 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that Nora virus is a co-factor that synergizes with ingested bacteria or toxicants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal infection models, thus leading to an earlier demise of infected flies. We also report major effects of Nora infection on the lifespan of the flies under different feeding conditions. Mechanistically, we find that Nora virus infects originally ISCs and proliferates intensely upon ISCs divisions, ultimately leading to the contamination of enterocytes and gut barrier function disruption. Blocking the compensatory ISC proliferation by either inhibiting apoptosis in enterocytes or interfering with JAK-STAT signaling in ISCs protects flies from Nora pathogenesis through a drastic decrease of its titer.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Nora virus-infected stocks are shorter-lived and more susceptible to some infections</title>
<p>We noted that two Oregon-R (Ore-R) wild-type stocks kept by different investigators in the laboratory, hereafter referred to as (SM) and (SC), displayed a remarkably distinct survival pattern in one out of two models of intestinal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Limmer et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nehme et al., 2007</xref>) in which flies respectively fed either on <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> PA14 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) or <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> Db11 (Fig. S1A). Namely, the Ore-R (SM) was more sensitive to PA14 and there was a slight trend toward higher susceptibility to Db11. We also noted that Ore-R (SM) displayed a shorter lifespan under non-infected conditions either on our standard food or on sucrose solution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Fig. S1B, and see below). We wondered whether the difference might be due to an infection and checked the stocks for the presence of common microbes known to affect <italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Haller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lestradet et al., 2014</xref>). The only notable difference we identified between the two stocks was the presence of the Nora enteric virus in the infection-sensitive Ore-R(SM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>We therefore examined the guts of flies from the two Ore-R stocks and did not detect any major morphological differences. However, when we measured basal ISC proliferation by counting phospho-histone H3-positive (PHH3) cells in the intestine, we found an enhanced rate of ISC proliferation in the Nora-positive Ore-R(SM) stock (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). When we challenged the Nora-negative Ore-R(SC) stock with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we found a small but nevertheless significant increase in ISC proliferation. However, this <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-induced increase was three-times larger in the Nora-positive Ore-R(SM) stock (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, these observations suggest that flies infected with Nora have a lower fitness and are more susceptible to infections than non-infected flies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>The Nora virus causes the enhanced susceptibility to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> intestinal infections</title>
<p>As expected, bleaching the eggs laid by the Nora-infected Ore-R(SM) stock appeared to eradicate the virus ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Habayeb et al., 2009b</xref>), <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and Fig. S2A). This treatment did not have a noticeable adverse impact as bleached stocks displayed a normal survival for at least ten days on sucrose (Fig. S1E-I). Furthermore, cured Ore-R(SM) flies fed with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> were less susceptible to this intestinal challenge than the uncured stock (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>We placed our cured flies in a vial that had hosted infected males for several days for fecal- oral transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Habayeb et al., 2009a</xref>) and found that they became again Nora-positive over several generations (Fig. S2A). The reinfected stock was more sensitive to the ingestion of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> than the cured stock (Fig. S2B). This correlated with an enhanced ISC proliferation in the Nora virus reinfected flies, whether challenged with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or not (Fig. S2C).</p>
<p>The drawback of the fecal transmission route is that other enteric pathogens may be transferred along with the Nora virus. To exclude this possibility, we used gradient centrifugation to purify and concentrate Nora virus from an infected fly extract. This preparation was homogenous with particles of the expected size when observed by cryo- electron microscopy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Using RT-PCR, we confirmed the identity of the virus and ruled out the presence of other known contaminating <italic>Drosophila</italic> viruses (DAV, DCV, DBV, DTV, DXV, CrPV, FHV, <italic>etc</italic>…; see Table 1 Primer Sequence). Cured flies were fed on this pure viral preparation for 24 hours. This was sufficient to stably reinfect the stock over several generations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). As with the fecal contamination route, we observed that the flies reinfected with the pure viral preparation were more sensitive to the ingestion of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and displayed an enhanced rate of ISC proliferation in the gut (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In terms of lifespan on standard food or on sucrose solution, the re-infected stocks displayed a largely decreased fitness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>), in contrast to the findings of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Habayeb et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nigg et al., 2024</xref>) who reported only a mild effect upon the injection of the Nora virus. Altogether, these results demonstrate that Nora virus is responsible for the enhanced sensitivity to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> intestinal infection.</p>

<p>We suspected that a polymorphism in the gene <italic>pastrel</italic> might be the cause of the different susceptibility to Nora virus between Ore-R(SM) and Ore-R(SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Magwire et al., 2012</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we determined by RT-PCR the presence of a <italic>pastrel</italic> sensitive or resistant alleles (<italic>pst<sup>S</sup></italic>, <italic>pst<sup>R</sup></italic>) in several stocks commonly used in the laboratory. Strikingly, the sensitive allele was found in homozygous condition only in the Ore-R (SM) stock, while it was heterozygous in our <italic>w</italic> (A5001) stock (Fig. S1D). Interestingly, the <italic>w</italic> (A5001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Thibault et al., 2004</xref>) and the DD1 <italic>cn bw</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jung et al., 2001</xref>) stocks were found to be also harboring the Nora virus, the latter one being <italic>pst<sup>R</sup>/ pst<sup>R</sup></italic> (Fig. S1C). The w(A5001) and DD1 <italic>cn bw</italic> cured stocks as well as the Canton-S stocks were all more susceptible to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ingestion after having been converted to a Nora-positive status by the prior ingestion of the purified virus preparation (Fig. S1E-G). Since even stocks harboring two copies of the resistant <italic>pastrel</italic> allele became more sensitive to ingested <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Fig. S1D, S1F, G), we can rule out that distinct <italic>pastrel</italic> alleles were also the cause of the enhanced sensitivity to bacterial intestinal infections. Unexpectedly, the ORE-R (SC) strain appeared to be resistant to the ingestion of Nora since it did not display an enhanced sensitivity to oral <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection (Fig.S1I). Thus, this line may harbor in addition to the homozygous <italic>pst<sup>R</sup></italic> allele an unidentified locus that restricts the Nora virus.</p>
<p>In the following, we will use the Ore-R(SM) cured stock as a Nora-negative control. We will further characterize the impact of Nora virus on infected flies using the cured Ore-R(SM) stock reinfected with the pure Nora preparation, which will be referred to as Nora-positive flies.</p>

<title>Nora virus is reducing host longevity largely independently of the microbiota</title>
<p>We confirmed that Nora re-infected flies succumbed much earlier than Nora-negative control flies when orally challenged with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a sucrose solution after five days of prior feeding on our standard food or a rich food corresponding to our standard food containing five times more yeast (Fig. S3A-B). Strikingly, we observed that an oral infection with PA14 increased the Nora burden (thrice on standard food and four-times on rich food). Actually, the Nora virus titer and the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> load was higher for flies fed on rich food (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, Fig. S3C). Of note, flies fed on rich food succumbed earlier to the challenge, independently of their Nora status (compare S3B to S3A).

<p>As aging flies exhibit a dysbiosis that correlates with an impaired homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>), we also compared the Nora burden in young (3-5 day-old) and old (30-35 day-old) flies and found an about four-fold increase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), which correlated with an enhanced rate of ISC proliferation (Fig. S3E), in keeping with a previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hanson and Lemaitre, 2023</xref>). While checking for an increase of the microbiota load in old flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Iatsenko et al., 2018</xref>), we noted that the microbiota titer was much higher in Nora-positive than in Nora-negative flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This observation also held when flies were kept feeding only on a sucrose solution (Fig. S3F). To determine whether the microbiota influenced the fitness of Nora-negative or -positive flies, we first monitored their survival when kept on sucrose solution. An antibiotic mix treatment substantially decreased the lifespan of Nora-negative flies, possibly reflecting a positive impact of the microbiota on this amino-acid depleted food solution. In contrast, antibiotics treatment had no effect on Nora-positive flies (Fig. S3G). Interestingly, the proliferation of ISCs was increased in antibiotics-treated Nora-positive flies (Fig. S3H), which inversely correlates with the life span of those flies. We next monitored the fitness of Nora-negative or -positive flies on our standard or on rich food. The antibiotic treatment had a limited effect on Nora-negative flies with a somewhat enhanced fitness (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>). In contrast, it significantly extended the lifespan of Nora-positive flies on either standard or rich food (note that the detrimental effect of the Nora virus is attenuated on rich food, at least for two-thirds of their lives). However, the antibiotics treatment failed to protect the flies to the level of Nora-negative flies. We conclude that under these different feeding conditions, the microbiota contributes at best only partially to the decreased fitness of Nora-positive flies.</p>

<title>Nora virus contamination impairs the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium</title>
<p>As an increased rate of ISC division may mirror a phenomenon of compensatory proliferation driven by damage to enterocytes, we assessed the permeability of the gut of Nora-positive flies, first using the SMURF assay on 30-day old flies. The percentage of SMURF-positive flies was much higher in Nora-positive flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). In keeping with this result, when we plated hemolymph collected from flies, we observed a strong microbial growth for that retrieved from SMURF-positive flies, but not from SMURF-negative flies, whether Nora-positive or Nora-negative (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These results were further confirmed after <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ingestion: already after three days, the passage of PA14 through the intestinal epithelium was much higher in Nora-positive than in Nora-negative flies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Indeed, there was a detectable induction of a local immune response in the midgut induced by PA14 only in Nora-positive flies at two days instead of around five days for Nora-negative flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Limmer et al., 2011a</xref>), as monitored by measuring <italic>Diptericin</italic> expression levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).

<title>Nora does not directly influence the survival of flies to septic injury</title>
<p>The experiments above show that the presence of the Nora virus in a stock increases its susceptibility to ingested <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Since <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ultimately causes a systemic infection, we also tested whether Nora-positive flies would be more sensitive to other types of systemic infections. As shown in Fig. S4A, we did not observe any difference in the survival curves between Nora-positive or -negative flies exposed to spores of the entomopathogenic fungus <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic>, an infection model in which no macroscopic wounds are inflicted. In contrast, Nora-positive flies succumbed significantly earlier than Nora-negative control flies when challenged with the Gram-positive <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> or the Gram-negative <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> bacterial pathogens in a septic injury model (Fig. S2B-C). However, we found in control experiments that Nora-positive flies pricked with a needle dipped into a sterile PBS solution succumbed at a rate that was similar to that observed in flies submitted to a septic injury, whereas control Nora-negative flies were more resistant to aseptic injury (Fig. S4D). Unexpectedly, <italic>Myd88</italic> flies displayed an enhanced apparent sensitivity to a clean injury, a phenomenon we have observed before and that depends on the endogenous microbiota of <italic>MyD88</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). To understand why Nora-infected flies were more susceptible to a near-sterile wound, we measured the proliferation rate of ISCs as it has been reported that injury triggers a ROS-response, in the hypodermis, hemocytes, and in the gut that leads to enterocyte apoptosis and an increased compensatory proliferation of ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chakrabarti and Visweswariah, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Takeishi et al., 2013</xref>). As reported, we observed a modest, statistically not significant, increase of ISC proliferation in Nora-negative flies after injury of the cuticle (Fig. S4E). Nora-positive flies displayed a higher basal rate of ISC proliferation that was however not altered by injury, suggesting that gut damage is unlikely to account for the enhanced sensitivity of Nora-positive flies to wounding of the cuticle. We finally compared the survival rates of flies pricked with a clean needle to that of unchallenged controls and did not find any significant difference (Fig. S4F). We conclude that the apparent sensitivity of Nora-positive flies to clean injuries is actually due to the shortened lifespan of Nora-positive flies. This effect only becomes apparent in systemic infections with mild pathogens that kill the flies slowly (Fig. S4B-C).</p>

<title>Nora virus is detected in intestinal stem cells in unchallenged flies and adopts an enterocyte localization upon challenge</title>
<p>Since the Nora virus is mostly detected in the gut by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Habayeb et al., 2009a</xref>) and plating assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ekstrom and Hultmark, 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) and since it affects the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium, we raised an antibody against the virus, which is essentially specific except for a cross reaction of the secondary antibodies with intestinal muscles (compare <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5B</xref> &amp; S5A to 5C), which precludes drawing any conclusion as regards a possible localization of the Nora virus also in intestinal muscles, as has been previously described for DCV oral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ferreira et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, a positive signal was detected in basally located small triangular cells of the intestinal epithelium of flies that had ingested the Nora virus five days earlier and not in non-infected controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5C, S5A, and</xref> 5D). The right panel of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> displays a dividing stem cell that yields a basally located ISC and a differentiating progenitor cell (enteroblast or enteroendocrine cell). Indeed, a similar non-basally located small cell is shown in Fig. S5B. We confirmed the localization of the Nora virus to progenitor cells of the intestinal epithelium by staining the Nora virus in <italic>esg-Gal4Gal80<sup>ts</sup> &gt;UAS-GFP</italic> flies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). The Nora-positive signal was always found in the GFP-expressing progenitor cells. Using transgenic fly lines that express Dicer2-fluorescent protein fusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Donelick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Girardi et al., 2015</xref>), we noted that even though the construct was expressed under the direct control of the polyubiquitin promoter, we failed to detect the fusion protein in ISCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5E</xref> &amp; S5C), even though GFP is known to be stable In progenitor cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). If Dicer-2 were to be unstable specifically in ISCs, this might account for the initial localization of the Nora virus to ISCs, a proposition that would require further experimental confirmation.</p>

<p>We have shown above that Nora-positive flies are more susceptible to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ingestion. We found that the Nora-positive flies were also more susceptible to the strongly oxidizing agent paraquat in survival experiment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). As for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> oral infection, the ingestion of paraquat led to similarly enhanced levels of the viral titer as monitored by RTqPCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) and by staining with the Nora antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5H</xref> and S5D). Immunohistochemistry further revealed that the virus starts also proliferating within enterocytes under pathogenic or chemical stress (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Interestingly, aged flies or young flies raised on rich food also exhibited a growth of the virus in enterocytes (Fig. S5 E-H), in keeping with the increased viral burden found in these 30-day-old flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). In addition, the detection of the Nora virus in enterocytes also correlated with an enhanced proliferation of ISCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C</xref> &amp; S3D).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Nora virus is initially restricted to progenitor cells in basal conditions but appears to start proliferating also inside enterocytes upon stress and/or increased proliferation of ISCs.

<title>ISC division promotes the proliferation of the Nora virus</title>
<p>The above conclusion implies that ISC proliferation is likely needed to promote the proliferation of the virus. To test this hypothesis, we used two complementary approaches that rely on the fact that enterocyte damage triggers the compensatory proliferation of ISCs.</p>
<p>First, we measured the degree of apoptosis in epithelial cells through ApopTag/TUNEL staining. We noted that Nora-positive bacteria do not display enhanced levels of apoptosis in this tissue under basal conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, Fig. S6A). However, the ingestion of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> led to enhanced levels of apoptosis, significantly more so in Nora-positive flies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, Fig. S6B). In contrast, paraquat induced much higher levels of positive signals, independently of the Nora status of the exposed flies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, Fig. S6C). This situation was roughly mirrored in the number of mitotic ISCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>), although the degree of proliferation induced by paraquat was similar to that induced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection, possibly mirroring an adverse effect of paraquat exposure to the division of ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chatterjee and Ip, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we attempted to block the induction of apoptosis in enterocytes by expressing there the baculovirus p35 protein that inhibits executioner caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hay et al., 1994</xref>). p35 did partially protect the flies from the noxious effects of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ingestion, with a relatively stronger effect on Nora-positive flies, which correlates with the higher number of apoptotic cells measured in those flies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). As expected, the expression of p35 in enterocytes blocked the compensatory proliferation of ISCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Strikingly, the Nora virus titer was abolished in both control or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-infected, originally Nora-positive, flies, as monitored by RTqPCR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>) and by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G-H</xref>) for which less than ten Nora-positive progenitor cells per midgut were detected at best.</p>
<p>The second approach was to interfere with the signals that drive ISC proliferation upon enterocyte damage. JAK-STAT pathway activation in ISCs promotes their division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cronin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). Silencing in ISCs the genes that encode either the JAK-STAT pathway receptor Dome or the STAT92E transcription factor also provided protection against ingested <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, in both Nora-positive and Nora-negative cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). Indeed, the <italic>upd3</italic> gene encoding one Dome ligand and the gene encoding the JAK-STAT-regulated inhibitor SOCS36E were induced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ingestion, again more strongly so in Nora-positive flies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). This result was further corroborated using a transgenic fly line that expresses an UPD3-GFP reporter protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). As expected, silencing <italic>Dome</italic> or <italic>STAT</italic> abolished the compensatory proliferation of ISCs. Again, as for the ectopic expression of p35 in enterocytes, blocking JAK-STAT pathway signaling in ISCs prevented any proliferation of the Nora virus in midguts, whether infected orally with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or not.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nora virus infection is prevalent both in wild <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> flies and laboratory stocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Habayeb et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Webster et al., 2015</xref>). It has originally been reported to have limited effects on its host fitness, likely due to its proliferation that is mostly restricted to the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Habayeb et al., 2009b</xref>). Here, in keeping with some more recent work, we report that the presence of Nora virus may be a confounding factor when performing intestinal infections or exposing flies to xenobiotics, and more generally when investigating fitness in extended processes such as aging. Our data support a model according to which Nora virus primarily infects intestinal epithelium progenitor cells and largely remains latent/quiescent. However, exposure to a variety of stresses that all lead to an increased proliferation of ISCs, apparently reactivates the virus and results in the contamination of enterocytes. Ultimately, the generalized proliferation of Nora within epithelial cells affects the barrier function of the midgut epithelium and leads to a decreased fitness that leads to a premature demise of the infected flies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Model of Nora virus propagation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine</title><p>Schematic representation of Nora virus propagation in the posterior midgut from intestinal stem cells to enterocytes. The Nora virus intially invades ISC in the midgut and remains rather quiescent. External factors such as age, infections or exposure to xenobiotics stress the host intestinal epithelium and induce ISC compensatory proliferation that ensures a degree of homeostasis by replacing damaged enterocytes. ISC cell division appears to stimulate the proliferation of the Nora virus that ultimately contaminates enterocytes. This is likely to further damage the epithelium and lead to a loss of the integrity of this intestinal barrier.</p></caption>

<p>Our data document a low basal level of infection in young flies, which correlates with a localization restricted to progenitor cells of the intestinal epithelium. Strikingly, a series of parameters such as age, food nutritional value, pathogenic infection of the gut, and a strong oxidizing agent all induce both an increased viral burden associated to the infection of enterocytes, and proliferation of ISCs. Nora virus appears either to have relatively moderate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Habayeb et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hanson and Lemaitre, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nigg et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schissel et al., 2021</xref>) or intermediate to strong (this study; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hanson and Lemaitre, 2023</xref>)) effects on host fitness. The finding that the higher nutrient quality of the food leads to reduced effects on host fitness may partially account for these differences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>), even though the Nora load was much higher on nutrient-rich food (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The genetic background may also contribute to these differences, even though we observed similar effects of Nora contamination on host fitness in a variety of strains fed on sucrose solution (Fig. S1 F-I). It could also be that the strains used in other laboratories may have modifier genes in their genetic background as one of Oregon strains appeared to be nonpermissive for Nora (Fig. S1J; see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hanson and Lemaitre, 2023</xref>)). Thus, the Nora load may differ in the different laboratories and could account for the differences in host fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hanson and Lemaitre, 2023</xref>). Interestingly, the microbiota had opposite effects on host fitness depending on the food source (positive on sucrose (Fig. S3G) <italic>vs.</italic> negative on standard or rich food (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>)). As reported earlier, we did observe a higher microbiota titer in Nora-infected flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, S3F), which however did not correlate with increased proliferation of ISCs at least on sucrose (Fig. S3H). Of note, strains kept in our laboratory do not contain <italic>Acetobacter</italic> but mostly <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> strains in their microbiota. Whether there is an increased diversity of the microbiota remains to be addressed. An earlier study reported that it was the case in wild-type flies of the <italic>Rel<sup>E23</sup></italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schissel et al., 2021</xref>), which however displays a very short life span with some 50% of uninfected flies dead by day 8, possibly due to the presence of the <italic>ebony</italic> marker in this strain.</p>
<p>Our results thus suggest that the virus is activated in dividing progenitor cells, especially when the intestinal epithelium is stressed either by infection or exposure to xenobiotics, and goes on proliferating in differentiated cells derived from these ISCs. The rate of ISC proliferation is always higher in Nora-positive flies, suggesting that Nora contamination of enterocytes may contribute in addition to stressors to their apoptosis and consequently lead to an enhanced compensatory proliferation of ISCs. The finding that blocking apoptosis enhances the fitness of Nora-positive flies to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection to the level of Nora- negative flies while equally decreasing the proliferation of ISCs supports this proposition. Hence, whenever ISC proliferation is triggered, the additional death of enterocytes caused by</p>
<p>Nora virus amplifies the phenomenon in a positive feedback loop. This model is further strengthened by the finding that the JAK-STAT ligand UPD3 is expressed at a higher basal level and induced more strongly by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection in Nora-positive flies than in Nora-negative flies. Thus, blocking either enterocyte apoptosis or the regulatory pathway that drives compensatory ISC proliferation yields a similar protection against the effects of Nora infection on fly fitness. More importantly, both experimental manipulations lead to a spectacular decrease of the viral titer, even under <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection conditions.</p>
<p>Our experiments point to an important role of initial proliferation of Nora virus in ISCs. With the exception of hematopoietic stem cells that can be infected by retroviruses and herpes viruses, mammalian germ cells, embryonic and adult stem cells have long been known to be rather resistant to viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, stem cells do not appear to rely primarily on interferon-based defenses, even though they do express a subset of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that contribute to the defense against viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, they are not responsive to interferon, which is mediated through JAK- STAT signaling, and instead rely to a large extent on RNA interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Maillard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maillard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Poirier et al., 2021</xref>). Whereas interferon signaling in mammals may have adverse effects on stem cell function because of antiproliferative actions of some ISGs, JAK-STAT signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ISCs promotes stem cell division and is also involved in the subsequent differentiation of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, picornaviruses and coxsackieviruses are known to productively infect activated or proliferating cells while the infection of quiescent cells leads only to persistence or latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Feuer and Whitton, 2008</xref>). Future studies will tell at which step of the cell cycle the Nora virus preferentially proliferates.</p>
<p>We have not addressed here whether the Nora virus is susceptible to host intestinal antiviral defenses. A major antiviral defense in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is the RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Galiana-Arnoux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">van Rij et al., 2006</xref>), which however appears less active in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mondotte et al., 2018</xref>), albeit oral DCV infection led to an increased viral titer in <italic>Ago2</italic> but not <italic>Dcr2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Segrist et al., 2021</xref>). It will be interesting to determine whether the absence of a Dcr2- fluorescent proteins fusions in progenitor cells that we report in this study rules out a role for the RNAi pathway in intestinal host defense against the Nora virus. Of note, it has been reported that Nora virus infection is not altered in flies defective for the RNAi antiviral pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Habayeb et al., 2009b</xref>), although the same study failed to see an effect of the JAK- STAT pathway, which conflicts with our own results (this study). The PVR/ERK pathway has been documented to play a role in enterocyte host defense against viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sansone et al., 2015</xref>). However, it needs to be primed by the microbiota through the PGRP- LC/IMD pathway and Pvf2 induction in enterocytes. Given the opposite effects of the microbiota on Nora-infected fly fitness depending on the food source, it appears unlikely that the PVR/ERK signaling pathway plays an essential role in host defense against the Nora virus. In addition, the likely absence of <italic>Acetobacter</italic> species in the microbiota of our fly strains on our food likely limits the induction of Pvf2 expression in enterocytes via the IMD pathway since <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> do not induce it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sansone et al., 2015</xref>). The STING/Relish pathway is another important systemic antiviral pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ai et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Goto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Segrist et al., 2024</xref>), which is also relevant to that of the intestinal epithelium. However, current data suggest it is mostly active in enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nigg et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Segrist et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, in the case of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> A virus (DAV), another prevalent intestinal virus, it is the EGFR pathway and not the JAK-STAT pathway acting in progenitor cells that is important for DAV proliferation. In addition, DAV is mostly found in enterocytes and only occasionally in progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nigg et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, while this axis of defense may not be essential once stem cells are proliferating, it might protect the enterocytes in the primary fecal contamination.</p>
<p>As emphasized by other investigators, intestinal viruses may be confounding factors of studies on aging and intestinal physiology, especially as regards the proliferation of ISCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hanson and Lemaitre, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nigg et al., 2024</xref>). Our results further add intestinal bacterial infections and exposure to toxicants to this list and more generally any study in which the process under investigation involves monitoring the survival of flies for periods of time over eight days. Finally, we have attempted to establish a Nora-free facility and bleached some 100 fly lines that tested Nora-negative on whole fly extracts. However, after a few months many of these lines tested positive for Nora. It is an open possibility that some fly strains cannot be cured (we had to go through several rounds of bleaching to cure from Nora contamination our Ore-R (SM) stock). Alternatively, a more sensitive test for Nora detection should be used, starting on dissected guts and for instance digital PCR (see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Nigg et al., 2022</xref>)).</p>

After ingestion, if there is an intestinal integrity loss, the dye will diffuse in the hemolymph, coloring the fly in blue.</p>

<p>Fly midguts (without crop, hindgut and Malpighian tubules) were dissected (20 per sample) and RNAs were extracted in TRI Reagent®-RT as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Reverse transcription was performed using iScriptTM (BIO-RAD). Quantitative PCR was performed using iQTM SYBR® Green (BIO-RAD) and a C1000TM Thermal Cycler (BIO-RAD) device. Expression values were calculated using a standard curve (with genomic DNA) and normalized to <italic>rp49</italic> expression level. Results presented the average ± SD of 3 independent experiments (with biological duplicates or triplicates).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis and reproducibility</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed on Graphpad Prism version 10 (Graphpad software Inc., San Diego, CA). The Mann–Whitney tests were used unless otherwise indicated. For survival experiments, the time it takes for 50% of the flies to succumb (LT50) was determined for each curve being compared. An unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test used on the LT50s from biological triplicates was used to assess the significance between two survival curves. When using parametric tests (analysis of variance (ANOVA) and <italic>t</italic>-test), a Gaussian distribution of data was checked using either D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus, Anderson-Darling, or Shapiro- Wilk normality tests. All experiments were performed at least three times. Significance values: *<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, ****<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study shows that the Nora virus, a natural Drosophila pathogen that also persistently infects many laboratory fly stocks, infects intestinal stem cells (ISCs), leading to a shorter life span and increased sensitivity to intestinal infection with the Pseudomonas bacterium. The authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> data to support their conclusions. The paper provides new insights into virus-host interactions in the Drosophila gut and serves as a warning for scientists who use the fruit fly as a model to study gut physiology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important article reveals that the Nora virus can colonize the intestinal cells of Drosophila melanogaster, where it persists with minimal immediate impact on its host. However, upon aging, infection, or exposure to toxicants, stem cell activation induces Nora virus proliferation, enabling it to colonize enterocytes. This colonization disrupts enterocyte function, leading to increased gut permeability and a significant reduction in lifespan. Results are convincing with an important impact on the Drosophila community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Building on previous studies by Habayeb et al. (2009) and Hanson et al. (2023), this study highlights cryptic Nora virus infection as a crucial factor in aging and gut homeostasis in Drosophila melanogaster.</p>
<p>(2) Consistent with the oral route of Nora virus transmission, the study demonstrates that the virus resides in intestinal stem cells, with its replication directly linked to stem cell proliferation. This process facilitates the colonization of enterocytes, ultimately disrupting intestinal function.</p>
<p>(3) The study establishes a clear connection between stem cell proliferation and virus replication, suggesting that various factors - such as microbiota, aging, diet, and injury - can influence Nora virus dynamics and associated pathology.</p>
<p>(4) The experimental design is robust, comparing infected flies with virus-cured controls to validate findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The study does not explore or discuss how oral ingestion of Nora virus leads to the colonization of stem cells, which are located basally in the gut. This mechanism should be discussed.</p>
<p>(2) The authors fail to detect Dicer-GFP fusion protein expression in stem cells, a finding that could explain why the virus persists in these cells. Further investigation is needed to determine whether RNAi functions are effective in stem cells compared to enterocytes. For clarification, the authors could cross esg-Gal4 UAS-GFP and Myo-Gal4 UAS-GFP with UAS GFP-RNAi and/or express a Dicer-GFP construct under a stem cell-specific driver.</p>
<p>(3) The presentation of experimental parameters (e.g., pathogen type, temperature, time points) should be improved in the results section and at the top of the figures to enhance clarity. Additionally, details regarding the mode of oral infection (continuous exposure vs. single feeding on a filter) should be specified. Given that fly stock flipping frequency influences microbiota load (as noted in Broderick et al.), this should be reported, especially for lifespan studies.</p>
<p>(4) To confirm that enterocyte colonization requires stem cell proliferation and differentiation, the authors should analyze Nora virus localization in JAK-STAT-deficient flies infected with bacteria or toxicants. This would help determine whether the virus can infect enterocytes in the absence of enterocyte differentiation, but stimulation of stem cells.</p>
<p>(5) The study does not discuss the spatial distribution of Nora virus infection along the gut. Specifically, it remains unclear whether viral colonization is higher in gut regions R2 and R3, which contain proliferative stem cells. Addressing this could provide valuable insights into the virus's infection dynamics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors report that Nora virus, a natural Drosophila pathogen that also persistently infects many laboratory fly stocks, infects intestinal stem cells (ISCs), leading to a shorter life span and increased sensitivity to intestinal infection with the Pseudomonas bacterium. Nora virus infection was associated with an increased proliferation of ISC and disrupted gut barrier function. Genetically, the authors show that increased ISC division in Nora virus and Pseudomonas coinfected flies is driven by signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway and apoptosis.</p>
<p>Accordingly, blocking apoptosis and JAK-STAT signaling reduces viral load, suggesting that in this context the JAK-STAT pathway is proviral in contrast to other previous observations in systemically infected flies. This work adds to the findings of another recent paper showing that another persistent fruit fly virus, Drosophila A virus, also increases ISC proliferation and decreases gut barrier function. Intestinal viruses should therefore be considered confounders in studies of fly intestinal physiology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the data are convincing and robust, starting with two wildtype fly stocks (Ore-R strain) that differ in their Nora virus infection status, followed by experiments in which cleared stocks are reinfected with a purified Nora virus stock preparation. The conclusions of the paper will be of interest to scientists working on insect physiology, virology, and immunology, but should also serve as a warning for scientists that use the fly as a model to study gut physiology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The title does not seem to be fully supported by the data. While the authors convincingly show the increased sensitivity to Pseudomonas infection, effects on another tested bacterium, Serratia marcescens, were not significantly different between Nora-virus-infected and non-infected flies. Thus effects of 'intestinal infection' seem to be too broad a claim. Also, whether the Nora virus increases sensitivity to oxidative stress is not so clear to me: the figure that supports this claim is the survival assay of Figure 5F. However, the difference in survival between control and paraquat-treated Nora (-) flies seems to be in the same order as between control and paraquat-treated Nora (+) flies. Rather, cause and effect seem to be the reverse: paraquat increases ISC proliferation, higher viral loads, and consequently shorter survival. I suggest rephrasing the title and conclusions accordingly.</p>
<p>Quantification of immunofluorescence microscopy is missing, rendering the images somewhat anecdotal. Quantification should be provided. It will then also be of interest to quantify the number of Nora(+) cells and the Nora virus levels per infected cell (e.g. Figure 5H). Also, the claim that the Nora virus initially infects ISC and later (upon stress) infects enterocytes requires quantification.</p>
<p>Genetic support for the role of the JAK-STAT pathway in driving ISC proliferation and supporting Nora virus replication is convincing. It would also be of interest to analyze other pathways implicated in ISC proliferation (e.g. JNK, EGFR), especially given the observations of Nigg et al, showing an involvement of STING/NF-kB and EGFR pathway in driving intestinal phenotypes of Drosophila A virus-infected flies (doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2024.05.009).</p>
<p>Figure 5E: An intriguing observation is that GFP:Dicer2 seems to be unstable in Nora virus-infected cells. Here, GFP control driven by the same driver line would be required to confidently conclude that this is due to an effect on Dicer-2 specifically.</p>
<p>Legends are mostly conclusive, and essential information about the experimental setup is missing in the captions of multiple figures, making the interpretation of the data difficult. See my private recommendations for suggestions to improve the data presentation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Franchet et al. sought to characterize the impact of Nora virus on host lifespan and sensitivity to a variety of infectious or stressful treatments. Through careful and rigorous analyses, they provide evidence that the Nora virus greatly impacts fly survival to infection, overall lifespan, and intestinal integrity. The authors have been thorough and rigorous, and the experimental evidence including proper isolation of the virus and Koch's Postulate reinoculation of the organism is excellent. The additional work is valuable and to the gold standard of the field, characterizing the pathology of the gut, including data showing gut leakage, the presence of the virus in the intestinal stem cells, and the importance of stem cell proliferation for virus replication and spread using elegant genetic tools to block stem cell proliferation or enterocyte death.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have been rigorous and careful. The initial finding is presented through the lens of two related strains differing in virus infection. From there, the authors characterized the virus and isolated a purified culture, which they used to reinoculate a cleared strain to demonstrate proper Koch's Postulate satisfaction. The authors have also probed various parameters in terms of dietary importance in relevant conditions for many experiments. The additional work to characterize the pathology of the gut is compelling, using genetic tools to block or allow intestinal stem cell proliferation and enterocyte death through JAK-STAT and JNK signalling alongside the tracing of virus presence using a Nora virus antibody. JAK-STAT and JNK are previously described as regulators of these processes, making these tools appropriate and convincing. It is also interesting to see good evidence that the virus itself is damaging, rather than simply permitting coinfection by gut microbes (which does happen).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The claim that Dcr2 is not abundant in ISCs because the protein is not stable is logically consistent and reasonable. Perhaps I missed this, but the authors could additionally knock down or use somatic CRISPR to delete Dcr2 in ISCs to test whether a lack of Dcr2 underlies sensitivity. In this experiment, the expectation would be that depleting Dcr2 in ISCs genetically would make little difference to susceptibility overall compared to controls. This is not an essential experiment request.</p>
