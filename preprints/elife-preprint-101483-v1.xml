<abstract>
<p>The biosynthesis of cAMP by mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases (mACs) is predominantly regulated by G-protein-coupled-receptors (GPCRs). Up to now the two hexahelical transmembrane domains of mACs were considered to fix the enzyme to membranes. Here we show that the transmembrane domains serve in addition as signal receptors and transmitters of lipid signals that control Gsα-stimulated mAC activities. We identify aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide as receptor ligands of mAC isoforms 1 to 7 and 9. The ligands enhance (mAC isoforms 2, 3, 7, and 9) or attenuate (isoforms 1, 4, 5, and 6) Gsα-stimulated mAC activities <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Substitution of the stimulatory membrane receptor of mAC3 by the inhibitory receptor of mAC5 results in a ligand inhibited mAC5-mAC3 chimera. Thus, we discovered a new class of membrane receptors in which two signaling modalities are at a crossing, direct tonic lipid and indirect phasic GPCR-Gsα signaling regulating the biosynthesis of cAMP.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The structure of the first second messenger, cyclic 3‘,5‘-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), was reported in 1958 by Sutherland and Rall. It was generated by incubation of a liver extract with the first messengers adrenaline or glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Since then, cAMP has been demonstrated to be an almost universal second messenger used to translate various extracellular stimuli into a uniform intracellular chemical signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The biosynthetic enzymes for cAMP from ATP, adenylyl cyclases (ACs), have been biochemically investigated in bacteria and eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Finally in 1989, the first mammalian AC was sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The protein displayed two similar catalytic domains (C1 and C2) and two dissimilar hexahelical membrane anchors (TM1 and TM2). The latter were proposed to possess a channel or transporter-like function, properties, which were never confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The domain architecture, TM1-C1-TM2-C2, clearly indicated a pseudoheterodimeric protein composed of two concatenated bacterial precursor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). To date, sequencing has identified nine mammalian membrane-delimited AC isoforms (mACs) with identical domain architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In all nine isoforms the catalytic domains are conserved and share extensive sequence and structural similarities which indicate a similar biosynthetic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). On the other hand, the associated two membrane domains differ substantially within each isoform and between all nine mAC isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Bioinformatic studies, however, revealed that the membrane domains, TM1 as well as TM2, are highly conserved in an isoform-specific manner for about 0.5 billion years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>Extensive studies on the regulation of the nine mAC isoforms revealed that the Gsα subunit of the trimeric G-proteins activate cAMP formation. Gsα is released intracellularly upon stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), i.e. the receptor function for mAC regulation was assigned to the diversity of GPCRs which presently are most prominent drug targets. In 1995 Tang and Gilman reported that Gsα regulation of mammalian mACs does not require the presence of the membrane anchors. A soluble C1-C2 dimer devoid of the membrane domains was fully activated by Gsα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This reinforced the view that the mAC membrane anchors which comprise up to 40 % of the protein were just that and otherwise functionally inert. The theoretical possibility of mACs to be regulated directly, bypassing the GPCRs, was dismissed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>We were intrigued by the exceptional evolutionary conservation of the mAC membrane anchors for 0.5 billion years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In addition, we identified a cyclase-transducing-element that connects the TM1 and TM2 domains to the attached C1 or C2 catalytic domains. These transducer elements are similarly conserved in a strictly isoform-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Furthermore, cryo-EM structures of mAC holoenzymes clearly revealed that the two membrane domains, TM1 and TM2, collapse into a tight dodecahelical complex resembling membrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Lastly, we created a chimeric model involving the hexahelical quorum-sensing receptor from <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> which has a known aliphatic lipid ligand and the mAC 2 isoform. We observed that the ligand directly affected, i.e., attenuated the Gsα activation of mAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). As a proof-of concept this demonstrated that the cytosolic catalytic AC dimer serves as a receiver for extracellular signals transmitted through the dyad-related membrane anchor. Accordingly, we proposed a general model of mAC regulation in which the extent of the indirect mAC activation via the GPCR/Gsα axis is under direct ligand control via the mAC membrane anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we report the results of a rigorous search for potential ligands of the mAC membrane domains. We identified aliphatic lipids as ligands for mAC isoforms 1 to 7 and 9. Isoform-dependently, the ligands either attenuate or enhance Gsα-activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> demonstrating a receptor function of the mAC proteins. The receptor properties are transferable as demonstrated by interchanging the membrane anchors between mAC3 and 5. Thus, the results define a new class of membrane receptors and establish a completely new level of regulation of cAMP biosynthesis in mammals in which tonic and phasic signaling processes intersect in a central signaling system, which is the target of frequently used drugs.</p>

<title>Oleic acid enhances Gsα-stimulated mAC3, but not mAC5 activity</title>
<p>We expected lipids as ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). We used bovine lung as a starting material because lipids are important for lung development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Lipids were extracted from a cleared lung homogenate, acidified to pH 1, with dichloromethane/methanol (2:1). The dried organic phase was chromatographed on silica gel (employing vacuum-liquid-chromatography; Si-VLC) and fractions A to Q were assayed (fractionation scheme in appendix 1). Fraction E enhanced mAC3 activity stimulated by 300 nM Gsα four-fold, whereas mAC5 activity was unaffected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>). The non-maximal concentration of 300 nM Gsα was used because it enabled us to observe stimulatory as well as inhibitory effects.</p>

<p>Fraction E was further separated by RP-HPLC into five subfractions (E1 – E5; appendix 1 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The mAC3 enhancing constituents appeared in fraction E2. It enhanced Gsα-stimulated mAC3 four-fold but had no effect on mAC5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of fraction E2 indicated the presence of aliphatic lipids (appendix 1 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Subsequent GC/MS analysis identified palmitic, stearic, oleic and myristic acid in E2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Concentration-response curves were established for these fatty acids with mAC3 and mAC5 stimulated by 300 nM Gsα (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). 20 µM oleic acid enhanced Gsα-stimulated mAC3 activity three-fold (EC<sub>50</sub> = 10.4 µM) and 20 µM palmitic acid two-fold (EC<sub>50</sub> = 6.4 µM), while stearic or myristic acid had no significant effect. None of these fatty acids affected mAC5 activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>The action of oleic acid on mAC3 was instantaneous and linear for &gt;25 min (appendix 2, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The Km of mAC3 for ATP (335 µM) was unaffected. Vmax was increased from 0.62 to nmol cAMP/mg/min (appendix 2, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Oleic acid did not affect the activity of a soluble, Gsα stimulated construct formerly used for generating a C1 and C2 catalytic dimer from mAC1 and 2, ruling out spurious detergent effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) (appendix 2, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The effect of oleic acid was further evaluated by Gsα concentration response curves of mAC3 and mAC5 in presence and absence of 20 µM oleic acid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, left and center). For mAC3 the calculated EC<sub>50</sub> of Gsα in presence and absence of oleic acid were 549 and 471 nM, respectively (not significant). Over the Gsα concentration range tested with mAC3 the enhancement of cAMP formation by 20 µM oleic was uniformly about 3.4-fold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> right). In the case of mAC5, Gsα stimulation was not enhanced by oleic acid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> center and right).</p>

<p>To explore the ligand space, we tested 18 aliphatic C<sub>12</sub> to C<sub>20</sub> lipids (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; structures in appendix 2 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). At 20 µM, elaidic, <italic>cis</italic>-vaccenic and linoleic acids were efficient enhancers of Gsα-stimulated mAC3 activity. Palmitic, palmitoleic, linolenic, eicosa-pentaenoic acids and oleamide were less efficacious; other compounds were inactive (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Notably, the saturated C<sub>18</sub> stearic acid was inactive here and throughout, albeit otherwise variations in chain length, and the number, location, and conformation of double bonds were tolerated to some extent, e.g., <italic>cis-</italic>vaccenic, linoleic and linolenic acids. The relaxed ligand specificity was anticipated as aliphatic fatty acids are highly bendable and bind to a flexible dodecahelical protein dimer embedded in a fluid lipid membrane. The ligand space of mAC3 somewhat resembled the fuzzy and overlapping ligand specificities of the free-fatty-acid receptors 1 and 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, the effect of oleic acid was probed <italic>in vivo</italic> using HEK293 cells permanently transfected with mAC3 (HEK-mAC3) or mAC5 (HEK-mAC5). Intracellular cAMP formation via Gsα was triggered via stimulation of the endogenous ß-receptor with 2.5 µM of the β-agonist isoproterenol, a submaximal concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Addition of oleic acid enhanced cAMP formation in HEK-mAC3 1.5-fold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Stearic acid was inactive. Under identical conditions, cAMP formation in HEK-mAC5 cells was unaffected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The EC<sub>50</sub> of oleic acid in HEK293-mAC3 cells was 0.5 µM, i.e., the potency appeared to be increased compared to respective membrane preparations whereas the efficiency was reduced, possibly reflecting the regulatory interplay within the cell. To exclude experimental artifacts, transfection efficiencies were tested by PCR. mAC3 and mAC5 transfections were similar (appendix 2; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Taken together, the results suggest that the enhancement of Gsα-stimulated mAC3 by oleic acid might be due to binding of oleic acid to or into an mAC3 membrane receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>

<p>Testing the panel of lipids at 20 µM with mAC isoforms 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8 we found that isoforms 1 and 4 were significantly attenuated by arachidonic acid, and somewhat less by palmitoleic acid. Other lipids had no effect (for bar plots and dose response curves see appendix 2 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10-12</xref>).

<p>Next, we examined whether arachidonic acid attenuates mAC1 and 4 in intact HEK 293 cells. Surprisingly, cAMP formation in HEK-mAC1 cells stimulated by 10 µM isoproterenol was attenuated by arachidonic acid with high potency (IC<sub>50</sub> = 250 pM), i.e., with higher potency compared to data with membranes prepared from the same cell line. In contrast, mAC4 activity examined under identical conditions was not attenuated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Currently, we are unable to rationalize these discrepancies. Possibly, mAC4 has another, more specific lipid ligand which is needed in <italic>in vivo</italic>. In general, the enhancing and attenuating effects bolster the hypothesis of specific receptor-ligand interactions and divergent intrinsic activities for different ligands.</p>
<p>At this point we were lacking ligands for mACs 5, 6, and 8 (appendix 2 Fig. 13-15). Possibly, the negative charge of the fatty acid headgroups might impair receptor interactions. A neutral lipid neurotransmitter closely related to arachidonic acid is arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Indeed, anandamide attenuated 300 nM Gsα-stimulation of mAC5 and 6 with IC<sub>50</sub> of 42 and 23 µM, respectively, i.e., comparable to the effect of arachidonic acid on mACs 1 and 4, and distinctly less potently than the ligands for mAC 2, 3, 7, and 9 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). mACs 5 and 6 may thus represent new targets for anandamide which is part of a widespread neuromodulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The concentrations of arachidonic acid and anandamide required may be achieved <italic>in vivo</italic> by local biosynthesis and degradation. An interfacial membrane-embedded phosphodiesterase cleaves the phosphodiester bond of the membrane lipid <italic>N-</italic>arachidonoyl-ethanolamine-glycerophosphate releasing anandamide into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The lipophilicity and lack of charge should enable it to diffuse readily. Whether the mACs and this biosynthetic phosphodiesterase colocalize or associate with its target mACs is unknown. Degradation of anandamide is by a membrane-bound amidase, generating arachidonic acid and ethanolamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether anandamide at higher concentrations might also affect mAC1 and 4. In fact, anandamide significantly attenuated Gsα-stimulated mAC1, but distinctly not mAC4 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> of anandamide for mAC1 was 29 µM.</p>
<p>We also tested whether anandamide attenuated cAMP formation <italic>in vivo</italic> using HEK-mAC5 cells primed by 2.5 µM isoproterenol (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). 100 µM Anandamide attenuated cAMP formation by only 23 % in HEK293-mAC5 cells, the effect was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). At this point, we were unable to identify a ligand for mAC8, presumably another lipid.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Receptor properties are exchangeable between mAC isoforms 3 and 5</title>
<p>To unequivocally validate specific mAC-ligand-receptor interactions and regulation we generated a chimera in which the enhancing membrane domains of mAC3, i.e., mAC3-TM1 and TM2, were substituted by those of mAC5 (design in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, right). The intention was to obtain a chimera, mAC5<sub>(membr)</sub>-AC3<sub>(cat),</sub> with a loss of receptor function, i.e., no enhancement by oleic acid, and a gain of another receptor function, i.e., attenuation of activity by anandamide. Successful expression and membrane insertion of the chimera in HEK293 cells was demonstrated by specific conjugation to Cy5.5 fluorophore, using the protein ligase connectase (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>, left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>)). cAMP synthesis of isolated membranes from these cells was stimulated up to 10-fold by addition of 300 nM Gsα, comparable to membranes with recombinant mAC3 or mAC5 proteins (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). mAC activity in the mAC5<sub>(membr)</sub>-AC3<sub>(cat)</sub> chimera was not enhanced by oleic acid, i.e., loss of receptor function, but was attenuated by anandamide, i.e., gain of receptor function (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C and D</xref>). The attenuation was comparable to results obtained with mAC5 membranes, i.e., IC<sub>50</sub> was 29 µM mAC5<sub>(membr)</sub>-AC3<sub>(cat)</sub> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>) compared to 42 µM for mAC5. This means that the attenuating receptor property of mAC5 was successfully grafted onto the mAC3-catalytic dimer. We take this to support the hypothesis that the mammalian mAC membrane domains operate as receptors using lipid ligands. The data virtually rule out unspecific lipid effects such as disturbance of membrane integrity by intercalation and surfactant or detergent effects. In addition, the data demonstrated that the signal most likely originates from the receptor entity and is transmitted through the subsequent linker regions to the catalytic dimer.</p>
<p>The findings were further substantiated <italic>in vivo</italic> using HEK293-mAC5<sub>(membr)</sub>-AC3<sub>(cat)</sub> cells. cAMP formation primed by 2.5 µM isoproterenol was attenuated by anandamide in HEK293-mAC5<sub>(membr)</sub>-AC3<sub>(cat)</sub> cells by 66%, (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>), by far exceeding the anandamide attenuation in HEK293-mAC5 cells of 23 %. In HEK293-mAC5<sub>(membr)</sub>-AC3<sub>(cat)</sub> cells oleic acid was ineffective, i.e., loss of function (data not shown). The results bolster the notion that mAC isoforms are receptors with lipids as ligands.</p>
<p>Lastly, we prepared membranes from mouse brain cortex in which predominantly mAC isoforms 2, 3 and 9 are expressed, isoforms with demonstrated enhancement of Gsα stimulation by oleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In cortical membranes 20 µM oleic acid enhanced Gsα stimulated cAMP formation 1.5-fold with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 5 μM, almost identical to the one determined for mAC2, 3, 7 and 9 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>). This suggests that mACs in brain cortical membranes are similarly affected by fatty acids.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the past, the biology of the two membrane anchors of mACs, highly conserved in an isoform-specific manner, remained unresolved. The theoretical possibility of a receptor function of these large hexahelical anchor domains, each comprising 150-170 amino acids, was considered unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Our data are a transformative step toward resolving this issue and introduce lipids as critical participants in regulating cAMP biosynthesis in mammals. The first salient discovery is the identification of the membrane domains of mACs as a new class of receptors for chemically defined ligands which set the level of stimulation by the GPCR/Gsα system. This conclusion is based on <italic>(i)</italic> the dodecahelical membrane domains of the nine mAC receptors have distinct, conserved isoform-specific sequences for the TM1 and TM2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>); <italic>(ii)</italic> the receptors have distinct ligand specificities; <italic>(iii)</italic> isoform dependently ligands either enhance or attenuate Gsα-stimulated mAC activities; <italic>(iv)</italic> receptor properties are transferable between isoforms by interchanging membrane domains; <italic>(v)</italic> isoproterenol-stimulated formation of cAMP <italic>in vivo</italic> is affected by addition of extracellular ligands. <italic>(vi)</italic> Gsα-stimulated cAMP formation in mouse cortical membranes is enhanced by oleic acid. Therefore, the results establish a new class of receptors, the membrane domains of mACs, with lipids as ligands. The data question the utility of the currently used mAC sub-classification, which groups mAC1, 3, 8, mAC2, 4, 7, mACs 5, 6, and mAC9 together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). At this point, mAC 1, 4, 5, and 6 which are ligand-attenuated, may be grouped together and a second group may consist of isoforms 2, 3, 7, and 9 which are ligand-enhanced. Our data do not contradict earlier findings concerning regulation of mACs via GPCRs, cellular localization of mAC isoforms or regional cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Instead, the data reveal a completely new level of regulation of cAMP biosynthesis in which two independent modalities of signaling, i.e., direct, tonic lipid signaling and indirect phasic signaling via the GPCR/Gsα circuits intersect at the crucial biosynthetic step mediated by the nine mAC isoforms.</p>
<p>The second important finding is the observation that the extent of enhancement of mAC3 activity by 20 µM oleic acid is uniform up to 1000 nM Gsα (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> right). We suppose that in mAC3 the equilibrium of two differing ground states favors a Gsα unresponsive state and the effector oleic acid concentration-dependently shifts this equilibrium to a Gsα responsive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In contrast, the equilibrium of ground states of mAC5 probably is opposite, i.e. the one accessible to Gsα stimulation predominates and stimulation by Gsα is maximal. In addition, oleic acid has little effect because the mAC5 receptor domain does not bind oleic acid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, right, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, center). A ligand for mAC5, e.g., anandamide or arachidonic acid, likely shifts the equilibrium of ground states to a Gsα unresponsive state and inhibits stimulation. The biological balance of ground states appears to be an intrinsic property which is isoform-specifically imprinted in mACs. Probably, it defines a major element of regulation and enables distinct inhibitory or stimulatory inputs by extracellular lipid ligands. The ground states probably are separated by a low transition energy and are stabilized by receptor occupancy. Hitherto available structures required Gsα and/or forskolin for stabilization and probably did not capture different ground states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Mechanistically, tonic levels of lipid ligands affect the ground states and thus set the bounds of cAMP formation elicited by phasic GPCR/Gsα-stimulation. As such lipid signaling through the mAC membrane receptors appears to represent a higher level of a systemic regulatory input based on constant monitoring the physiological and nutritional status of an organism.</p>
<p>Lipid signaling is much less characterized than solute signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Most of the highly functionalized ligands for GPCRs are storable in vesicles and the release, inactivation and removal are strictly controlled. On the other hand, the very nature of lipids, i.e., high flexibility of aliphatic chains, low water solubility, propensity for nonspecific protein binding, membrane permeability and potential effects on membrane fluidity complicate discrimination between extra- and intracellular lipid actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Yet, viewed from an evolutionary perspective, lipids possibly are ideal primordial signaling molecules because for the emergence of the first cell lipids were required to separate an intra- and extracellular space. Conceivably, lipids derived from membrane lipids were used for regulatory purposes early-on. In association with the evolution of bacterial mAC progenitors lipid ligands may have persisted in evolution and regulation by GPCR/Gsα in metazoans was acquired and expanded later.</p>
<p>The concentrations of free fatty acids in serum or interstitial fluid usually are rather low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). This raises the question of the origin of lipid ligands. One possibility is that the lipid ligands are acutely extracted from membrane lipids by membrane-integral hydrolases as known for anandamide and arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Additional potential lipid sources usable for ligand generation may be, among others, exosomes, serum lipids, chylomicrons, blood triglycerides and even lipids possibly originating from the microbiome. The discovery of lipids as ligands for the mAC receptors broadens the basis of regulation of cAMP biosynthesis with potentially wide-ranging consequences in health and disease.</p>

<p>Fraction E2 was analysed by GC-MS. Acids were acid trimethylsilylated using <italic>N,O</italic>-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + trimethylchlorosilane (BSTFA + TMCS, 99:1 v/v). The mixture was heated for 2 h at 90°C. After cooling and clearing the sample was transferred into a GC vial in 200 µL hexane.</p>
<p>An Agilent Technologies GC system (8890 gas chromatograph and 5977B mass spectrometer equipped with a DB-HP5MS UI column, 30 m x 0.25 mm, film thickness of 0.25 µm) was used. Injection volume was 1 µL. The temperature was kept at 100 C for 5 min, and then increased at 53°C/min to 240 C. The rate was decreased to 3 C/min to reach 305 C. Carrier gas was He<sub>2</sub> (99.9%; 1.2 mL/min). Ionization was with 70 eV and MS spectra were recorded for a mass range <italic>m/z</italic> 35-800 for 35 min. Compounds were identified by comparing the spectra with those in the NIST library. Individual compound content is given as a relative % of the total peak area.</p>

<p>Human mAC genes were from GenScript and fitted with a C-terminal FLAG-tag. The chimera mAC5(TM)_mAC3(cat) had an N-terminal connectase-tag, MPGAFDADPLVVEIAAAGA, followed by AC5(1–402)_AC3(250–631)_AC5(761–1009)_AC3(862–1144). The gene was synthesized by GenScript. HEK293 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Transfection with AC plasmids was with PolyJet (SignaGen, Frederick, MD, USA). Permanent cell lines were generated by selection for 7 days with 600 µg/mL G418 and maintained with 300 µg/mL For membrane preparation, cells were tyrpsinized, collected by centrifugation (3000xg, 5 min) and lysed and homogenized in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, one tablet of cOmplete, EDTA-free (per 50 mL) and 250 mM sucrose by 20 strokes in a potter homogenizer on ice. Debris was removed (5 min at 1000xg, 0°C), membranes were collected at 100,000xg, 60 min at 0°C, suspended and stored at -80°C in 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Membrane preparation from mouse brain cortex was according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Three cerebral cortices were dissected and homogenized in 4.5 ml cold 48 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 12 mM MgC1<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1 mM EGTA with a Polytron hand disperser (Kinematica AG, Switzerland). The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 12000xg at 4°C. The pellet was washed once with 5 mL 1 mM KHCO<sub>3</sub>.

<p>This manuscript describes a <bold>valuable</bold> study of a new lipid-mediated regulation mechanism of adenylyl cyclases. The biochemical evidence provided is <bold>convincing</bold>, but more evidence for regulation by lipids under natural cellular processes would be interesting. This manuscript will be of interest to all scientists working on lipid regulation and adenylyl cyclases.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that the Gαs-stimulated activity of human membrane adenylyl cyclases (mAC) can be enhanced or inhibited by certain unsaturated fatty acids (FA) in an isoform-specific fashion. Thus, with IC50s in the 10-20 micromolar range, oleic acid affects 3-fold stimulation of membrane-preparations of mAC isoform 3 (mAC3) but it does not act on mAC5. Enhanced Gαs-stimulated activities of isoforms 2, 7, and 9, while mAC1 was slightly attenuated, but isoforms 4, 5, 6, and 8 were unaffected. Certain other unsaturated octadecanoic FAs act similarly. FA effects were not observed in AC catalytic domain constructs in which TM domains are not present. Oleic acid also enhances the AC activity of isoproterenol-stimulated HEK293 cells stably transfected with mAC3, although with lower efficacy but much higher potency. Gαs-stimulated mAC1 and 4 cyclase activity were significantly attenuated in the 20-40 micromolar by arachidonic acid, with similar effects in transfected HEK cells, again with higher potency but lower efficacy. While activity mAC5 was not affected by unsaturated FAs, neutral anandamide attenuated Gαs-stimulation of mAC5 and 6 by about 50%. In HEK cells, inhibition by anandamide is low in potency and efficacy. To demonstrate isoform specificity, the authors were able to show that membrane preparations of a domain-swapped AC bearing the catalytic domains of mAC3 and the TM regions of mAC5 are unaffected by oleic acid but inhibited by anandamide. To verify in vivo activity, in mouse brain cortical membranes 20 μM oleic acid enhanced Gαs-stimulated cAMP formation 1.5-fold with an EC50 in the low micromolar range.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) A convincing demonstration that certain unsaturated FAs are capable of regulating membrane adenylyl cyclases in an isoform-specific manner, and the demonstration that these act at the AC transmembrane domains.</p>
<p>(2) Confirmation of activity in HEK293 cell models and towards endogenous AC activity in mouse cortical membranes.</p>
<p>(3) Opens up a new direction of research to investigate the physiological significance of FA regulation of mACs and investigate their mechanisms as tonic or regulated enhancers or inhibitors of catalytic activity.</p>
<p>(4) Suggests a novel scheme for the classification of mAC isoforms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Important methodological details regarding the treatment of mAC membrane preps with fatty acids are missing.</p>
<p>(2) It is not evident that fatty acid regulators can be considered as &quot;signaling molecules&quot; since it is not clear (at least to this reviewer) how concentrations of free fatty acids in plasma or endocytic membranes are hormonally or otherwise regulated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors extend their earlier findings with bacterial adenylyl cyclases to mammalian enzymes. They show that certain aliphatic lipids activate adenylyl cyclases in the absence of stimulatory G proteins and that lipids can modulate activation by G proteins. Adding lipids to cells expressing specific isoforms of adenylyl cyclases could regulate cAMP production, suggesting that adenylyl cyclases could serve as 'receptors'.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is the first report of lipids regulating mammalian adenylyl cyclases directly. The evidence is based on biochemical assays with purified proteins, or in cells expressing specific isoforms of adenylyl cyclases.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is not clear if the concentrations of lipids used in assays are physiologically relevant. Nor is there evidence to show that the specific lipids that activate or inhibit adenylyl cyclases are present at the concentrations required in cell membranes. Nor is there any evidence to indicate that this method of regulation is seen in cells under relevant stimuli.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Landau et al. have submitted a manuscript describing for the first time that mammalian adenylyl cyclases can serve as membrane receptors. They have also identified the respective endogenouse ligands which act via AC membrane linkers to modify and control Gs-stimulated AC activity either towards enhancement or inhibition of ACs which is family and ligand-specific. Overall, they have used classical assays such as adenylyl cyclase and cAMP accumulation assays combined with molecular cloning and mutagenesis to provide exceptionally strong biochemical evidence for the mechanism of the involved pathway regulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have gone the whole long classical way from having a hypothesis that ACs could be receptors to a series of MS studies aimed at ligand indentification, to functional studies of how these candidate substances affect the activity of various AC families in intact cells. They have used a large array of techniques with a paper having clear conceptual story and several strong lines of evidence.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) At the beginning of the results section, the authors say &quot;We have expected lipids as ligands&quot;. It is not quite clear why these could not have been other substances. It is because they were expected to bind in the lipophilic membrane anchors? Various lipophilic and hydrophilic ligands are known for GPCR which also have transmembrane domains. Maybe 1-2 additional sentences could be helpful here.</p>
<p>(2) In stably transfected HEK cells expressing mAC3 or mAC5, they have used only one dose of isoproterenol (2.5 uM) for submaximal AC activation. The reference 28 provided here (PMID: 33208818) did not specifically look at Iso and endogenous beta2 adrenergic receptors expressed in HEK cells. As far as I remember from the old pharmacological literature, this concentration is indeed submaximal in receptor binding assays but regarding AC activity and cAMP generation (which happen after signal amplification with a so-called receptor reserve), lower Iso amounts would be submaximal. When we measure cAMP, these are rather 10 to 100 nM but no more than 1 uM at which concentration response dependencies usually saturate. Have the authors tried lower Iso concentrations to prestimulate intracellular cAMP formation? I am asking this because, with lower Iso prestimulation, the subsequent stimulatory effects of AC ligands could be even greater.</p>
<p>(3) The authors refer to HEK cell models as &quot;in vivo&quot;. I agree that these are intact cells and an important model to start with. It would be very nice to see the effects of the new ligands in other physiologically relevant types of cells, and how they modulate cAMP production under even more physiological conditions. Probably, this is a topic for follow-up studies.</p>
<p>Appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions:</p>
<p>The authors have achieved their aims to a very high degree, their results do nicely support their conclusions. There is only one point (various classical GPCR concentrations, please see above) that would be beneficial to address.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, this is a groundbreaking study that will have profound implications in the field for the next years/decades. Since it is now clear that mammalian adenylyl cyclases are receptors for aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide, this will change our view on the whole signaling pathway and initiate many new studies looking at the biological function and pathophysiological implications of this mechanism. The manuscript is outstanding.</p>

<p>(1) At the beginning of the results section, the authors say &quot;We have expected lipids as ligands&quot;. It is not quite clear why these could not have been other substances. It is because they were expected to bind in the lipophilic membrane anchors? Various lipophilic and hydrophilic ligands are known for GPCR which also have transmembrane domains. Maybe 1-2 additional sentences could be helpful here.</p>

<p>Will be done as suggested.</p>

<p>(2) In stably transfected HEK cells expressing mAC3 or mAC5, they have used only one dose of isoproterenol (2.5 uM) for submaximal AC activation. The reference 28 provided here (PMID: 33208818) did not specifically look at Iso and endogenous beta2 adrenergic receptors expressed in HEK cells. As far as I remember from the old pharmacological literature, this concentration is indeed submaximal in receptor binding assays but regarding AC activity and cAMP generation (which happen after signal amplification with a so-called receptor reserve), lower Iso amounts would be submaximal. When we measure cAMP, these are rather 10 to 100 nM but no more than 1 uM at which concentration response dependencies usually saturate. Have the authors tried lower Iso concentrations to prestimulate intracellular cAMP formation? I am asking this because, with lower Iso prestimulation, the subsequent stimulatory effects of AC ligands could be even greater.</p>

<p>The best way to address this issue is to establish a concentration-response curve for Iso-stimulated cAMP formation using the permanently transfected cells. We note that in the past isoproterenol concentrations used in biochemical or electrophysiological experiments differed substantially.</p>

<p>(3) The authors refer to HEK cell models as &quot;in vivo&quot;. I agree that these are intact cells and an important model to start with. It would be very nice to see the effects of the new ligands in other physiologically relevant types of cells, and how they modulate cAMP production under even more physiological conditions. Probably, this is a topic for follow-up studies.</p>

<p>The last sentence is correct.</p>

<p>Appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions:</p>
<p>The authors have achieved their aims to a very high degree, their results do nicely support their conclusions. There is only one point (various classical GPCR concentrations, please see above) that would be beneficial to address.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, this is a groundbreaking study that will have profound implications in the field for the next years/decades. Since it is now clear that mammalian adenylyl cyclases are receptors for aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide, this will change our view on the whole signaling pathway and initiate many new studies looking at the biological function and pathophysiological implications of this mechanism. The manuscript is outstanding.</p>
