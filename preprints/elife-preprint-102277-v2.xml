<title>Abstract</title><p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a global public health threat with major economic implications. The non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) of SARS-CoV-2, in complex with nsp10, catalyses the final step of viral mRNA capping via its 2’-O-methylase activity, enabling the virus to evade host immunity and protect viral mRNA from degradation. However, host factors regulating nsp16 have not been thoroughly explored. Although various E3 ubiquitin ligases are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins, their specific roles in targeting nsp16 for degradation remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that nsp16 is ubiquitinated and degraded by host E3 ubiquitin ligases UBR5 and MARCHF7, acting through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). UBR5 and MARCHF7 induce nsp16 degradation via K48- and K27-linked ubiquitination, respectively, in independent processes that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, UBR5 and MARCHF7 exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity by degrading nsp16 variants from different SARS-CoV-2 strains. Our findings uncover novel mechanisms by which the UPS antagonises SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide promising targets for therapeutic intervention against COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as a global public health threat, causing over 700 million coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 7 million deaths (Carabelli et al., 2023; Markov et al., 2023). SARS-CoV-2 encodes four structural proteins, 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps) that assist in viral replication and transcription, and a series of accessory proteins (ORFs) associated with immune evasion (V’kovski et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). Some viruses such as Ebola virus (Valle et al., 2021), dengue virus (Jung et al., 2018), and reovirus (Furuichi et al., 1975) encode 2’-O methyltransferases (2’-O-MTases) homologous to those found in eukaryotes. This allows them to mimic the host 5’ cap structure on their RNA, hindering recognition by the innate immune system (Daffis et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Züst et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 nsp16, in complex with nsp10, functions as a 2’-O-MTase, methylating the first nucleotide of a capped viral RNA strand at the 2′-O position, converting the 5’ cap of RNA from ‘cap-0’ to ‘cap-1’ (Benoni et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Park et al., 2022</xref>). This modification shields SARS-CoV-2 from host antiviral responses such as MDA5 recognition and IFIT1 restriction (Bergant et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Russ et al., 2022</xref>). Importantly, nsp16 inhibits global host mRNA splicing, which reduces host protein and mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, nsp16 enhances SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by promoting TMPRSS2 expression (Han et al., 2023), highlighting its multifaceted role as a virulence factor. Moreover, nsp16-deficient strains exhibit reduced pathogenicity and induce a strong immune response, suggesting their potential as a live-attenuated vaccine candidate (Ye et al., 2022). Given nsp16’s critical functions, drugs targeting nsp16 or the nsp16-nsp10 complex have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Klima et al., 2022</xref>; Nguyen et al., 2022). Therefore, understanding host factors that interact with nsp16 is crucial for uncovering novel therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is an important pathway for the targeted degradation of intracellular proteins and is referred to as “the molecular kiss of death” (Dongdem &amp; Wezena, 2021; Park et al., 2020). Substrate ubiquitination requires a cascade of three ligases: E1, E2, and E3 (Zheng &amp; Shabek, 2017). Some E3 ubiquitin ligases function as monomers, while others form multi-subunit E3 complexes. Regardless of their form, all E3 ligases share the same functional specificity in recognizing substrates and determining the specificity of the UPS. In some complexes, an additional protein may be required as a substrate receptor to recognize the substrate (Iconomou &amp; Saunders, 2016; Yang et al., 2021). E3 ligases are indispensable for direct binding to substrates and determining the specificity of the UPS (Li et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022). Researchers have identified over 600 human genome-encoded E3 ligases that operate in diverse cellular environments, respond to a wide range of cellular signals, and regulate a vast array of protein substrates (Dongdem &amp; Wezena, 2021; Garcia-Barcena et al., 2020). Dysregulation of E3 ligase activity has been implicated in various human diseases, making them promising drug targets (Humphreys et al., 2021). E3 ligases are classified into three classes based on conserved domains and ubiquitin (Ub) transfer mechanisms: Really Interesting New Gene (RING) E3s, homologous to the E6AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) E3s, and RING-between-RING (RBR) E3s (Garcia-Barcena et al., 2020; Morreale &amp; Walden, 2016). RING E3 ligases directly transfer Ub from the E2-Ub complex to the substrate (Deshaies &amp; Joazeiro, 2009), whereas HECT-type E3s transfer Ub to their own catalytic cystine residue before attaching it to the substrate (Huibregtse et al., 1995). RBR E3s combine the characteristics of both RING and HECT types (Walden &amp; Rittinger, 2018). RBR and RING E3s share the RING-binding domains, but RBR family members can generate thioester intermediates with Ub, as is the case with HECT-type E3s (Garcia-Barcena et al., 2020).</p>
<p>To investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host factors, we focused on the interaction between nsp16 and the UPS. In this study, we present a novel regulatory mechanism targeting nsp16 via the host UPS. We demonstrate, for the first time, that nsp16 is ubiquitinated and degraded by the host proteasome. Interestingly, two E3 ligases from distinct families, the RING-type MARCHF7 and the HECT-type UBR5, independently recognise and target nsp16 for degradation in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Since nsp16 possesses 2’-O-MTase activity, its enzymatic function converts the viral RNA 5’ cap structure from cap-0 to cap-1. This dual targeting of nsp16 by MARCHF7 and UBR5 leads to its degradation, disrupting its function and ultimately demonstrating effective antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Our findings identify novel therapeutic targets for developing effective strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 and treat COVID-19.</p>

<title>Ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 by the UPS</title>
<p>Ubiquitination plays an important role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). To explore whether the non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are regulated by the UPS, we examined the effect of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 on the protein expression of all 16 non-structural proteins. MG132 treatment markedly increased the abundance of nsp8, nsp11, and nsp16 proteins in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), suggesting their potential degradation by the UPS. It has been reported that nsp8 undergoes UPS-mediated degradation via TRIM22-mediated ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fan et al., 2024</xref>). In this study, we focused on nsp16 for further investigation. To confirm the role of the UPS in nsp16 degradation, we employed additional proteasome inhibitors, Bortezomib and Carfilzomib. Unlike the lysosomal inhibitors Bafilomycin A1 and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and the autophagy-lysosomal inhibitor vinblastine, these proteasome inhibitors enhanced nsp16 stability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The impact of the USP on the half-life of nsp16 was investigated. To this end, nsp16-expressing cells were treated with a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, and the kinetics of nsp16 decay were examined. We observed that the half-life of nsp16 in MG132-treated samples was significantly longer than that in MG132-untreated samples (15 h versus 2 h) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).</p>

<p>A. The non-structural proteins nsp8, nsp11 and nsp16 could be restored by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. HEK293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with the plasmids of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) encoded by SARS-CoV-2. Thirty-six hours later, the cells were treated with MG132 (10 µM) or DMSO for 12 h before collection. The protein level was detected by Immunoblotting (IB). Quantification of nsp protein levels relative to the control protein is shown. Data are representative of three independent experiments and shown as average ±SD (n = 3). Significance was determined by a two-tailed t-test: *P &lt; 0.05; **P &lt; 0.01; ***P &lt; 0.001. B. Proteasomal inhibitors but no other inhibitors stabilized nsp16 protein. HEK293T cells transfected with the nsp16-Flag expression vector were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), MG132 (10 µM), Bortezomib (10 µM), Carfilzomib (10 µM), Bafilomycin A1 (5 µM), Vinblastine (2.5 µM), or NH<sub>4</sub>CL (2.5 µM) for 12 h prior to harvest. The cell lysates were analyzed by anti-Flag antibody. (C-D). The half-life of nsp16 was prolonged by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. C. HEK293T cells were transfected with the nsp16-Flag-expressing plasmids. 12 hours later, the cells were treated with DMSO or MG132 (10 µM) for 12 h, then 50 µg/mL cycloheximide (CHX) was added. Cells were harvested at the indicated times to detect the level of viral protein by anti-Flag antibody. D. Quantification of nsp16 protein levels relative to tubulin at different time points is shown. The half-life of the nsp16 protein was determined based on protein quantification using Image J, combined with the protein half-life formula for calculation. Results are shown as mean ± SD (n = 3 independent experiments). ***, P &lt; 0.001 by by a two-tailed t-test.</p><p>E. Samples were prepared for mass spectrometry, and nsp16 interacting proteins were obtained by immunoprecipitation (IP) (created using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biorender.com/h43f612">BioRender.com</ext-link>). The plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells for 48 h. Treat cells with or without MG132 (10 µM) for 12 h prior to harvest. The whole-cell lysates were incubated with protein G agarose beads conjugated with anti-Flag antibodies and used for IB with anti-Flag antibodies to detect the nsp16 protein. Samples enriched for proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>To identify proteins interacting with nsp16, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis, comparing nsp16-expressing cells treated with and without MG132 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology analyses of the MS data (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Biological process enrichment analysis showed that blocking nsp16 degradation resulted in an increase in the number of proteins that interact with it, including 43 proteins involved in virus-associated processes and 22 proteins involved in regulating mRNA stability. Five proteins were related to the regulation of the cellular antiviral defence. Additionally, interactions were associated with mRNA splicing and RNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with nsp16’s role as a 2’-O-MTase. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 uses nsp16 to disrupt host mRNA splicing to facilitate its infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Park et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Russ et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Züst et al., 2011</xref>). These findings corroborate the reliability of our MS data.</p>
<p>As expected, we found that several nsp16-binding proteins were related to ubiquitination and degradation pathways (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 — figure supplement 1B</xref>). Four deubiquitinases (DUBs), the E2 ligase UBE2D3, and 14 proteasomal enzymes were identified. Of these, six E3 ligases, UBR5, MARCHF7, HECTD1, TRIM32, MYCBP2, and TRIM21, were chosen for further investigation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>E3 ligases UBR5 and MARCHF7 independently mediate nsp16 degradation</title>
<p>To identify the E3 ligases responsible for nsp16 degradation, we designed small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting the six candidate E3 ligases and evaluated their effects on nsp16 abundance. Knockdown of UBR5 and MARCHF7 stabilised the protein levels of nsp16 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Furthermore, we generated stable cell lines with UBR5 or MARCHF7 knockdowns to further investigate their effects on nsp16 stability and confirm silencing efficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). To determine whether UBR5 and MARCHF7 cooperate in nsp16 degradation, we knocked down UBR5 or MARCHF7 using siRNA in MARCHF7- or UBR5-knockdown cells, respectively. Knockdown of UBR5 in MARCHF7-knockdown cells, and vice versa, further enhanced nsp16 stability. This indicates that UBR5 and MARCHF7 act independently to degrade nsp16 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We further validated the independent function of these E3 ligases by examining nsp16 degradation. MARCHF7 overexpression induced nsp16 degradation in both MARCHF7-knockdown and MARCHF7/UBR5-double-knockdown cells. Similarly, UBR5 overexpression degraded nsp16 even in the presence of MARCHF7 knockdown. Knockdown efficiencies were confirmed for all experiments (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 — figure supplement 1A</xref> and 1B). Notably, overexpression of wild-type MARCHF7 or UBR5, but not mutants lacking the functional RING domain (1-542 aa) or the HECT domain inactivated mutant, disrupts the stability of nsp16 in cells with MARCHF7 or UBR5 knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>). These findings demonstrate that UBR5 and MARCHF7 independently ubiquitinate nsp16 via their HECT or RING domains, targeting it for proteasomal degradation.</p>

<p>A. Knockdown of MARCHF7 or UBR5 resulted in nsp16 restoration. HEK293T cells were transfected with siRNA of E3 ligase candidates for 24 h, followed by co-incubation with the nsp16-Flag-expressing plasmids for 48 h, treated with MG132 (10 µM) for 16h before harvesting, lysed, and subjected to IB assay using anti-Flag antibody. RT-qPCR was conducted to determine the mRNA expression levels of E3 ligase candidates. The si-RNA targeting regions for the candidate E3 ubiquitin ligase proteins and the targeted regions for RT-qPCR are shown in Appendix-figure S1A. Data are representative of three independent experiments and shown as average ± SD (n = 3). Significance was determined by a two-tailed t-test: ***P &lt; 0.001.</p><p>B. RNA levels of UBR5 or MARCHF7 from HEK293T cells infected with lentivirus containing control or shRNA targeting UBR5 or MARCHF7 for 48 h and screened with antibiotics for 48 h. Knockdown cell lines were transfected with plasmids expressing nsp16-Flag, collected at the indicated times, and the protein levels of nsp16, MARCHF7, and UBR5 were detected by IB.C. MARCHF7 and UBR5 acted separately and did not depend on each other. HEK293T cells stably expressing UBR5 shRNA or MARCHF7 shRNA were transfected with siRNA of MARCHF7 or UBR5 for 24 h, respectively, followed by co-incubation with the nsp16-Flag-expressing plasmids for 48 h. The protein levels and the RNA levels of nsp16, UBR5 and MARCHF7 were measured by IB and RT-qPCR, respectively.</p><p>(D-E).

<title>UBR5 and MARCHF7 mediate distinct Ub linkages on nsp16</title>
<p>We first confirmed the ubiquitination of nsp16, both in the presence and absence of exogenous Ub (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). To further investigate the regulation by E3 ligases, we examined the impact of UBR5 or MARCH7 knockdown on nsp16 ubiquitination. Knockdown of either UBR5 or MARCHF7 decreased the ubiquitination level of nsp16 compared to that in the negative control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Ub contains seven lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K49, and K63) that form polyubiquitin chains with distinct functions, ultimately dictating the fate of the attached target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Grice &amp; Nathan, 2016</xref>). To determine the specific type of polyubiquitin chain modification of nsp16 mediated by UBR5 and MARCH7, we constructed a series of Ub mutants retaining only a single lysine residue. Except for K33, all single-lysine Ub mutants promoted nsp16 ubiquitylation to varying extents, suggesting a complex polyubiquitin chain structure on nsp16 potentially regulated by multiple E3 ligases or E2-E3 ligase pairs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Notably, analysis of specific lysine linkages revealed that MARCHF7 knockdown primarily reduced the K27-linked ubiquitination of nsp16, while UBR5 knockdown primarily reduced the K48-linked ubiquitination of nsp16 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). These findings indicate that MARCHF7 and UBR5 induce K27- and K48-linked ubiquitination on nsp16, respectively.</p>

<title>UBR5 and MARCHF7 directly interact and colocalise with nsp16 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)</title>

Co-IP experiments confirmed that both Myc-tagged MARCHF7 and endogenous UBR5 interact with nsp16 (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 — figure supplement 1A</xref> and 1B). To determine whether MARCHF7 or UBR5 directly interact with nsp16, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays were performed.

Image J software was used to quantify the relative fluorescence intensities (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 — figure supplement 1D</xref>). We next investigated whether UBR5 and MARCHF7 require each other for nps16 binding. We compared the binding ability of UBR5 to nsp16 in the presence or absence of MARCHF7 using Co-IP. MARCHF7 knockdown had no effect on the interaction between UBR5 and nsp16, and vice versa (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), indicating independent binding of UBR5 and MARCHF7 to nsp16.

<title>Functional domains of UBR5 and MARCHF7 are required for nsp16 interaction and ubiquitination</title>
<p>UBR5 is a four-domain E3 ligase containing two nuclear localisation signals. The four domains are UBA, UBR, PABC, and HECT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Muñoz-Escobar et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Notably, the HECT domain is essential for its E3 ligase activity, where UBR5 must be conjugated to Ub before transferring it to the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the UBR5 domain responsible for nsp16 ubiquitination, we utilised UBR5 mutants with inactivated individual domains. Only the HECT domain mutant failed to degrade nsp16 (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>), and was unable to induce nsp16 ubiquitination, further supporting its essential function (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the MARCHF7 region responsible for nsp16 degradation, we constructed a series of truncation mutants, as previously described (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 — figure supplement 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nathan et al., 2008</xref>). All mutants lost the ability to degrade nsp16 (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Furthermore, we explored the ability of these mutants to interact with nsp16 and their impact on nsp16 ubiquitination. Only the mutant with an intact N-terminal region (aa 1–542) retained strong binding to nsp16, while mutants with the active RING domain region (aa 543–616) did not. Consistently, only the wild-type MARCHF7 induced the formation of K27-linked Ub chains on nsp16 (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 — figure supplement 2F</xref>). These findings suggest that the N-terminal of MARCH7 mediates binding to nsp16, while the RING domain is required for its K27-linked ubiquitination activity.</p>

<p>Given the critical antiviral roles of UBR5 and MARCH7, we investigated the modification of nsp16 following viral infection. HEK293T cells stably expressing the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 (HEK293T-ACE2) were infected with the Wuhan strain for 48 h. Co-IP using an anti-nsp16 antibody revealed that nsp16 interacts with endogenous MARCHF7 and UBR5 and undergoes ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We further validated the antiviral effects of UBR5 and MARCH7 in a biosafety level 3 facility using the Wuhan strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and the Omicron strain at an MOI of 0.001. Compared to the control group, UBR5 or MARCH7 knockdown in Caco2 cells significantly increased intracellular and secreted viral mRNA levels (<italic>M</italic> and <italic>E</italic> genes) of both strains. Additionally, with the Wuhan strain, MARCH7 knockdown resulted in a 0.6-log increase in viral titre in the supernatants, while UBR5 knockdown caused an over 1-log increase. With the Omicron strain, knockdown of the two E3 ligases resulted in an even greater increase in viral titres (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C–E</xref> for the Wuhan strain and 5F–H for the Omicron strain). Immunoblotting (IB) confirmed these findings, demonstrating elevated intracellular and secreted N protein levels upon UBR5 or MARCH7 knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). The knockdown efficiency of MARCHF7 and UBR5 was also confirmed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Due to low transfection efficiency in Caco2 cells, we overexpressed UBR5-Myc or MARCH7-Myc in HEK293T-ACE2 cells. Overexpression of UBR5 or MARCH7 significantly decreased viral mRNA levels of the <italic>M</italic> and <italic>E</italic> genes in both the Wuhan and Omicron strains, as measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). IB analysis also showed decreased N protein levels in cells and supernatants, accompanied by a decrease in viral titres of more than 0.5-log. However, co-transfection with increasing amounts of nsp16 significantly abrogated the inhibitory effects of UBR5 and MARCH7 on SARS-CoV-2 replication (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A–H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>). To eliminate the potential influence of nsp16’s intrinsic function on experimental outcomes, we overexpressed UBR5 with an inactive HECT domain (UBR5-ΔHECT) or MARCHF7 with a RING domain deletion (MARCHF7-1-542), along with nsp16. These E3 ligase mutants failed to inhibit viral replication. Moreover, a gradual enhancement of nsp16 protein expression did not enhance viral replication. While there was a slight increase in the mRNA levels of <italic>M</italic>, protein levels of E and N remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 — figure supplement 2A–H</xref>).

<title>UBR5 and MARCHF7 mediate broad-spectrum degradation of nsp16 variants</title>
<p>Given the ongoing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, broad-spectrum antiviral activity remains critical. To investigate whether UBR5 and MARCH7 can mediate broad-spectrum degradation of various nsp16 variants, we aligned the amino acid sequences of nsp16 proteins obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (<xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 — figure supplement 3A</xref>). Among these, only three variants, XBB.1.9.1, XBB.1.5, and XBB.1.16, exhibited a higher number of mutation sites compared to other variants, which showed only one or two mutations, suggesting a more conserved sequence. Consequently, using mutagenesis techniques, we synthesised the nsp16 sequences for these three variants along with several single-site mutants from other variants. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 restored nsp16 protein levels for all variants (<xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>), confirming that degradation occurs through the UPS. Furthermore, knockdown of either UBR5 or MARCHF7 increased the stability of nsp16 proteins from these variants, albeit to varying degrees, indicating that these nsp16 proteins are sensitive to UBR5- or MARCHF7-mediated degradation (<xref rid="fig6s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 — figure supplement 3C</xref>).

In this study, we identify nsp16 as a short-lived protein with a half-life of only 2–3 h that is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the UPS. Using MS and bioinformatics screening, we identified two E3 ligases, UBR5 and MARCHF7, that directly interact with and target nsp16 for ubiquitination and degradation.</p>
<p>UBR5 is a member of the UBR box protein family and contains a HECT domain essential for its E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). It is known to regulate tumour growth, metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Xiang et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Qiao et al., 2020</xref>), and viral infections. For example, URB5 targets Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ORF4b protein for degradation, dampening the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, UBR5 acts as a cofactor for Zika virus replication by helping TER94/VCP degrade the capsid protein to expose the viral genome to the cytoplasm (Gestuveo et al.). MARCHF7 is a RING E3 Ub ligase that regulates T cell proliferation, neuronal development, inflammasomes, and tumour progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zheng, 2021</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cai et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). However, its role in viral infections has been largely unexplored, with only one study identifying it as a host protein interacting with the 2C of foot-and-mouth disease virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mahajan et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings reveal that UBR5 and MARCHF7 independently interact with nsp16 and facilitate its degradation, primarily within the cytoplasmic side of the ER. This reflects an evolutionary arms race between viruses, which develop mechanisms to resist host antiviral responses, and hosts, which deploy multiple strategies to counteract the virus. One such strategy is seen with multiple E3 ligases that target the same viral protein for degradation. Functional analyses demonstrate that UBR5 or MARCHF7 knockdown enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas their overexpression impaired replication. Furthermore, we found that when the enzymatic activity of these E3 ligases is inactivated, their antiviral effect is abolished, indicating that their antiviral effects are dependent on their E3 ligase activity. Additionally, we observed that in the absence of functional UBR5 or MARCH7, overexpression of nsp16 does not increase viral levels. This suggests that although nsp16 plays an important role, it cannot independently promote viral replication without the involvement of E3 ligases. This underscores the critical function of UBR5 and MARCHF7 as antiviral factors that suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication by promoting nsp16 degradation.</p>
<p>Notably, while nsp16 possesses 18 lysine residues, identifying specific ubiquitination sites proved challenging. Based on structural data of nsp16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Decroly et al., 2011</xref>), we constructed truncated nsp16 mutants to assess their degradation profiles. We found that nsp16 could still be degraded to varying degrees (Appendix-figure S2A-B), suggesting that multiple lysine residues serve as recognition sites for E3 ligases. Nonetheless, the results from these truncated mutants regarding the MG132 recovery provided us with valuable insights. For instance, the Δ2-17 mutant, which lacks this segment, showed more than a two-fold increase in nsp16 expression levels. Conversely, the Δ204-212 mutant exhibited significantly reduced recovery after MG132 treatment compared to the wild-type. These observations offer important clues for further investigation into the interaction regions between nsp16 and MARCHF7 or UBR5, as well as potential ubiquitination sites. MS analysis identified K76 of nsp16 as a ubiquitination site (Appendix-figure S2C). However, an nsp16 K76R mutant was still degraded by E3 ligases, although the degree of ubiquitination was reduced compared to that of the wild-type, indicating that K76 might be one of several potential ubiquitination sites (Appendix-figure S2D-E). Therefore, we hypothesise that nsp16 undergoes ubiquitination at multiple sites and may involve non-canonical ubiquitination pathways at non-lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McClellan et al., 2019</xref>). A comprehensive understanding of the ubiquitination landscape of nsp16 requires further investigation. In addition to UBR5 and MARCHF7, other E3 ligases could contribute to nsp16 regulation, which warrants further studies.</p>
<p>Currently, no specific activators or inhibitors exist for UBR5 or MARCH7. To validate their antiviral effects <italic>in vivo</italic>, we employed high-pressure tail vein injection, a method commonly used for gene delivery to the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kamimura et al., 2014</xref>). This method has also been shown to facilitate gene delivery to other tissues, including the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bonamassa et al., 2011</xref>). Gene expression was successfully detected in lung tissues. While this method induced mild immune activation, its effect is relatively minimal compared with that of other techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Suda et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, studies suggest that mice and non-human primates exhibit higher resistance to innate immune activation than humans, suggesting that our findings were only minimally influenced by immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Raper et al., 2003</xref>). However, this highlights that translating new drug targets into therapeutic treatments will require considerable time and effort. For example, human trials involving the injection of naked DNA (e.g., OTC cDNA) have shown variable outcomes. While no severe immune responses were observed in most participants, one case of fatal immune activation was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Raper et al., 2003</xref>), highlighting the variability of human immune responses and a key limitation in extrapolating findings from animal models to human trials. This variability might also explain why we did not observe a clear trend for MARCHF7 mRNA levels in peripheral blood samples from patients with varying disease severities. The limited number of patients in our study could further contribute to this observation.</p>
<p>In this study, we identified the host E3 ligases, UBR5 and MARCHF7, as critical regulators of SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 through ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. We demonstrated a negative correlation between the expression levels of these ligases and the degree of infection, underscoring their antiviral roles. Furthermore, both ligases significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our findings pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the UPS for the treatment of COVID-19.</p>

<caption><title>MARCHF7 or UBR5 have effects on mutant of nsp16 in different subtypes of SARS-CoV-2.</title>
<p>A. This diagram shows the mutation of nsp16 in different virus subtypes. The amino acids sequences of different SARS-CoV-2 strains were obtained from NCBI, and the amino acids sequences of nsp16 of different strains were compared by DNAMAN software. B. Nsp16 mutants can still be regulated by MG132. The mutated nsp16 plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells. After 36 hours of culture, cells were treated with 10 µm MG132 or DMSO, harvested 12 hours late6r, and cell lysates were examined by IB. C. MARCHF7 or UBR5 can degrade nsp16 mutants. After transfecting MARCHF7 or UBR5 siRNA and the mutated nsp16 plasmids, the cells were harvested 48 h later. The cell lysates were detected by IB.</p></caption>

<p>In this study, Tiang et al. explore the role of ubiquitination of non-structural protein 16 (nsp16) in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. nsp16, in conjunction with nsp10, performs the final step of viral mRNA capping through its 2'-O-methylase activity. This modification allows the virus to evade host immune responses and protects its mRNA from degradation. The authors demonstrate that nsp16 undergoes ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the host E3 ubiquitin ligases UBR5 and MARCHF7 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Specifically, UBR5 and MARCHF7 mediate nsp16 degradation through K48- and K27-linked ubiquitination, respectively. Notably, degradation of nsp16 by either UBR5 or MARCHF7 operates independently, with both mechanisms effectively inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, UBR5 and MARCHF7 exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral activity by targeting nsp16 variants from various SARS-CoV-2 strains. This research advances our understanding of how nsp16 ubiquitination impacts viral replication and highlights potential targets for developing broadly effective antiviral therapies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The proposed study is of significant interest to the virology community because it aims to elucidate the biological role of ubiquitination in coronavirus proteins and its impact on the viral life cycle. Understanding these mechanisms will address broadly applicable questions about coronavirus biology and enhance our overall knowledge of ubiquitination's diverse functions in cell biology. Employing in vivo studies is a strength.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;SARS-CoV-2 nsp16 is regulated by host E3 ubiquitin ligases, UBR5 and MARCHF7&quot; is an interesting work by Tian et al. describing the degradation/ stability of NSP16 of SARS CoV2 via K48 and K27-linked Ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. The authors have demonstrated that UBR5 and MARCHF7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase bring about the ubiquitination of NSP16. The concept, and experimental approach to prove the hypothesis looks ok. The in vivo data looks ok with the controls. Overall, the manuscript is good.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study identified important E3 ligases (MARCHF7 and UBR5) that can ubiquitinate NSP16, an important viral factor.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I had gone through the revised form of the manuscript thoroughly. The authors have addressed all of my concerns. To me, the experimental approach looks convincing that the host E3 ubiquitin ligases (UBR5 and MARCHF7) ubiquitinate NSP16 and mark it for proteasomal degradation via K48- and K27- linkage. The authors have represented the final figure (Fig.8) in a convincing manner, opening a new window to explore the mechanism of capping the vRNA bu NSP16.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1 the authors could reference and use NSP8 (PMID: 38275298) and Nucleocapsid (PMID: 37185839) in their experiments as positive controls.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! In Figure 1A, during our screening of SARS-CoV-2 nsp proteins regulated by MG132, we confirmed that nsp8 can also be restored by MG132. This finding indicates that nsp8 is degraded via the proteasome pathway and can therefore serve as a positive control for the experiment. It has been reported that nsp8 undergoes degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway following its ubiquitination mediated by TRIM22. We have added the description at line 115 in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The data indicating that NSP16 is ubiquitinated come from overexpression systems, and it is possible that NSP16 ubiquitination only occurs in expression contexts, not during coronavirus infection. If NSP16 ubiquitination can't be measured in the context of infection, it is unclear how we can make any conclusions. The authors need to demonstrate the ubiquitination of NSP16 in the context of viral infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer's suggestion and have incorporated the corresponding experimental results. As shown in Figure 5A, co-IP experiments using an endogenous nsp16 antibody were conducted following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain. These experiments confirmed that the nsp16 protein encoded by the virus undergoes ubiquitination in infected cells. This finding highlights the ubiquitination of nsp16 within a biological context, thereby supporting our conclusions in expression contexts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 4, adding controls will strengthen the authors' conclusion.</p>
<p>a) Is it possible to observe ubiquitination of NSP16 by transfecting in NSP16-FLAG tagged, immunoprecipitate NSP16, run a western blot, and probe for endogenous ubiquitin?</p>
<p>b) Can the authors please include an empty vector control as well as WT ubiquitin in these panels for comparison?</p>
<p>c) In addition, why are the Ubiquitination patterns different in the IP panels of D and E vs B?? Without an empty vector control, it is challenging to conclude what the background is.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions! We have made the following changes and additions in response to your comments:</p>
<p>a) We have conducted the experiments as per the reviewer's suggestion. Figure 3B shows the result. Co-IP experiments were performed, and endogenous ubiquitination of nsp16 was observed using the endogenous ubiquitin antibody.</p>
<p>b) We apologize for previously focusing solely on presenting multiple ubiquitin mutants on a single panel of nsp16 IP without considering the inclusion of an empty vector control and WT ubiquitin. The experiment has been redesigned and conducted, and the results are now presented in Figures 3E and 3F.</p>
<p>c) The differences in the ubiquitination patterns observed between the IP panels in Figures 3E and 3F compared to 3C may be due to varying plasmids, differences in antibody and depth of exposure. To address this, we have standardized the plasmids in the figure and included an empty vector control as a negative control to clarify the background signal.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Overexpression of the ubiquitin mutants may have an indirect effect on protein homeostasis. The authors can also utilize linkage-specific antibodies in their studies to elucidate the ubiquitin linkage associated with NSP16 ubiquitination. K63-linkage Specific Polyubiquitin (D7A11) Rabbit mAb, 5621S, and K48-linkage Specific Polyubiquitin (D9D5) Rabbit mAb, 8081S from Cell Signaling Technologies?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer's excellent suggestion! Using linkage-specific antibodies to elucidate the ubiquitin linkage associated with nsp16 ubiquitination would indeed provide more direct evidence. However, due to the long lead time for obtaining these antibodies, we plan to conduct further verification in future experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors discussed the subcellular localization of overexpressed NSP16- showing the localization of NSP16 in the context of viral infection would strengthen the study. If this is challenging, can the authors express NSP16 along with the co-factor NSP10 and examine its subcellular localization?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion! During viral infection, we observed the ubiquitination of the nsp16 protein through co-IP experiments, indicating that the presence of nsp10 does not influence the regulation of nsp16 ubiquitination by MARCHF7 or UBR5 (Figure 5A). Therefore, we believe that investigating the co-localization of nsp10 and nsp16 would not provide additional value to our results. Additionally, through a literature review, we found studies that have already examined the localization of nsp10 and nsp16 following viral infection. These studies revealed that nsp10 was located in the cytoplasm, while nsp16 can be detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (PMID: 33080218; PMID: 34452352). This observation is consistent with the localization of nsp16 that we observed in our overexpression experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) a) In Figure 3A, the authors should note that the interaction of NPS16 appears weak with UBR5. The authors should confirm that the interaction of NSP16 and the E3 ligases is relevant in the context of viral infection.</p>
<p>b) In Figure 3B, the scale bars should be labeled in at least one panel, as well as in the legend.</p>
<p>c) The authors discussed nuclear localization of MARCHF7, UBR5, and NSP16, therefore a control with a nuclear stain should be included in this figure to enhance the study.</p>
<p>d) Some panels look overexposed while others are blurry which decreases the robustness of the interaction as the authors stated in line 191. To strengthen the results of Figure 3, consider GST purification and in vitro, cell-free binding assays to confirm a direct interaction between nsp16 and the E3 ligases</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s thoughtful suggestions! We have made the following changes and adjustments based on your recommendations:</p>
<p>a) On the interaction between nsp16 and UBR5:</p>
<p>The interaction between nsp16 and UBR5 appears to be weak, possibly due to the large size of the UBR5 protein (300 kDa). As a result, there are challenges in presenting the experimental results, including difficulties in both expression and protein level detection. To further confirm the relevance of the interaction between nsp16 and the E3 ligases in the context of viral infection, we have performed experiments, and the results are presented in Figure 5A.</p>
<p>b) On scale bars:</p>
<p>The issue regarding the scale bars in Figure 4 has been addressed, and we have now included them in the figure legend for clarity (Line 885).</p>
<p>c) On nuclear localization control:</p>
<p>For the localization of MARCHF7, UBR5, and nsp16 in Figure 4C, given that both MARCHF7 and UBR5 are tagged with CFP, DAPI staining would result in spectral overlap. However, we conducted co-localization experiments for MARCHF7 or UBR5 with nsp16 in Figure 4—figure supplements 1E and 1F, where DAPI staining was included to illustrate the localization of these three proteins. Our experiments showed that while these proteins are present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, they are predominantly localized in the cytoplasm.</p>
<p>d) On validation of direct interaction:</p>
<p>We attempted GST purification and in vitro cell-free binding assays to verify the direct interaction between nsp16 and the E3 ligases. However, UBR5 and MARCHF7 are both large proteins, with UBR5 being particularly large, which significantly increased the difficulty of purification. Additionally, we faced challenges in purifying nsp16, as the purified nsp16 protein tended to aggregate. We will continue to optimize purification techniques and conditions in future experiments.</p>
<p>We appreciate your valuable comments, which have greatly contributed to improving our experiments and conclusions.</p>
<p>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) To confirm the knockdown of the E3 ligases by siRNA, the authors should use western blotting to show the presence/absence/decrease of the protein levels in addition to mRNA levels by RT-PCR. The authors have the lysates, and they have shown that the antibodies for MARCHF7 and UBR5 work therefore including this throughout the manuscript to help substantiate the authors' conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable suggestion! We have validated the knockdown efficiency at the protein level for the experiments involving siRNA knockdown. Corresponding Western blot images are now included in the relevant experiments to substantiate our conclusions, in addition to the RT-PCR data, including Figures 2, 4 and 5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In the overexpression studies of the E3 ligases with viral infection in Figure 5, the authors should include the catalytic mutants for the E3 ligases with the nsp16 gradient experiment. This would strengthen the conclusion of the studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion! We have conducted the relevant experiments based on your recommendation, and the corresponding data are presented in the Figure 6—figure supplements 2A-H. These results strengthen the conclusions of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Figure 5: For C and F, for a better comparison of the efficacy against the 2 strains, the authors should use the same scale. This could benefit from a kinetics experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion! We have made revisions in Figures 5E and 5H in responses to your recommendation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Is there a synergistic effect of double E3 knockdown on viral replication?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s question! In Figures 5—figure supplement 1A-B, we conducted experiments by individually and simultaneously knocking down MARCHF7 or UBR5, followed by infection with viral SARS-CoV-2 transmissible virus-like particles. The results revealed that simultaneous knockdown further enhances viral replication, demonstrating a synergistic effect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) In lines 98-100 the authors state &quot;This dual targeting by MARCHF7 and UBR5 impairs the 2'-O-MTase activity of nsp16, blocking the conversion of cap-0 to cap-1 at the 5 'end of viral RNA, ultimately exhibiting potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2&quot;. The authors did not examine the 2'-O-MTase activity of nsp16. The authors should rephrase this or provide the data if this experiment was done.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s valuable suggestion! Based on your comment, we have revised the ambiguous wording located in lines 100-104.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) In the discussion, the authors reported that elucidating a specific lysine residue (s) that is ubiquitinated was challenging and stated that they generated multiple mutants including truncated mutants, and wrote &quot;data not shown&quot;.

<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion! The referenced paper states, &quot;As can be seen in the Supplementary Fig. S2, the viral proteins are either cytoplasmic (NSP2, NSP3C, NSP4, NSP8, Spike, M, N, ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, and ORF10) or both nuclear and cytoplasmic (NSP1, NSP3N, NSP5, NSP6, NSP7, NSP9, NSP10, NSP12, NSP13, NSP14, NSP15, NSP16, E, and ORF9a),&quot; indicating that nsp16 is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Upon reviewing the literature, we found that the paper (PMID: 33080218) reports the distribution of nsp16 protein following viral infection.

<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s suggestion! Linear N-terminal ubiquitination, with its distinct linkage and substrate recognition mechanism, is typically mediated by a complex consisting of the E3 ubiquitin ligases HOIL-1 and HOIP, and differs from classical ubiquitination.

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the reviewer’s detailed suggestions. In this context, by “conservation,” we refer to the relative conservation of nsp16 proteins across different subtypes of the Omicron variant. We found that most of the mutation sites contained only 1 to 2 mutations. Additionally, we have constructed and validated multiple-mutant nsp16 proteins, which are still degraded by MARCHF7 or UBR5. Given the ongoing prevalence of the Omicron variant, we aim to explore the broad-spectrum degradation and antiviral effects of these two E3 ligases. While it would be ideal if these experiments could aid in identifying the ubiquitination sites, we have not yet identified any mutant forms that escape degradation. We also compared the nsp16 proteins of several other coronaviruses (such as human coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, MERS-CoV, NL63, OC43, and SARS-CoV-1), and found that these viruses' nsp16 proteins are not highly conserved. As a result, we have not further investigated whether MARCHF7 or UBR5 regulate the nsp16 proteins of these viruses.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In Figure 6, the authors found that increasing amounts of nsp16 restored the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of MARCHF7 or UBR5. The authors better discuss the possibility that nsp16 may stimulate viral replication regardless of these E3 ligases, or provide evidence to further clarify this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful suggestion! Given the strong functionality of nsp16 itself, your consideration is very comprehensive. In Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–H, we conducted transfection experiments with E3 activity-deficient proteins and reintroduced nsp16. The results showed that, in the absence of active MARCHF7 or UBR5 antiviral function, overexpression of nsp16 did not promote viral replication, although the RNA levels of the M protein slightly increased. Therefore, in our experiments, excess nsp16 did not significantly stimulate viral replication.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 7, the in vivo data supports the function of both E3 ligases to reduce viral infectivity. Is it possible that tail vein injection of naked plasmid DNA may stimulate the innate immune system, e.g., induce IFN as a DNA vaccine, which may contribute to the inhibitory effect? The authors are suggested to discuss or address it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Upon reviewing the relevant literature, we found that the hydrodynamic gene delivery (HGD) method using naked DNA is both highly efficient and associated with a low risk of triggering immune responses or oncogenesis. Studies have shown that HGD only weakly activates host immunity (reference: 37111597), which is less of a concern compared to other gene delivery methods. Although some studies have reported strong immune responses following the injection of naked DNA (e.g., Otc cDNA) in human trials, it is noteworthy that no such responses were observed in 17 other participants. This suggests that the immune reactions observed in some cases may be due to individual variability or limitations in animal models, which may not fully translate to human trials.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, we believe that the antiviral effects observed in our study are primarily attributable to the intrinsic properties and functions of the E3 ligases.  Furthermore, it has been reported that mice and non-human primates exhibit significantly greater resistance to innate immune activation compared to humans. This highlights the challenges in translating these findings into effective antiviral therapeutics and underscores the need for further research in this area. We have incorporated the requested discussion into the manuscript in lines 393-410.</p>

<p>(5) The authors suggested that both UBR5 and MARCHF7 had a function in triggering the degradation of NSP16, however, the expression of UBR5 but not MARCHF7 was shown to be associated with the severity of clinical symptoms. Further, why did the host evolve 2 kinds of E3 ligases to adjust only 1 viral target? Please discuss them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We acknowledge that the limited number of patients with varying degrees of illness in our study could potentially mask some of the observed phenomena. Additionally, individual variability may also play a significant role, which highlights the challenges in translating findings from animal models to human trials.</p>
<p>Regarding the presence of two E3 ligases targeting the same substrate, we view this as part of an evolutionary arms race between the host and the virus. Viruses evolve mechanisms to counteract the host’s antiviral responses, while the host, in turn, develops multiple pathways and strategies to combat viral infection. This dynamic may explain why multiple E3 ligases regulate the levels of the same factor, reflecting the host’s complex and redundant antiviral defense mechanisms. We have incorporated the requested discussion into the manuscript in lines 359-362.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1: The expression level of NSP6, 10, 11, and 12 is weak. Include a higher exposure blot (right next to these blots marking as higher exposure) to show the expression of these plasmids. Here, the NSP12 plasmid has no expression, so it is difficult to conclude the effect of MG132 from this blot. It will be appropriate to show the molecular weight of each gene fragment since some of the plasmids have multiple bands. Verify the densitometric analysis, the NSP4 (+/- MG132) blot, and the densitometric analysis do not correlate. Figure 1B: It is recommended to include appropriate control (media only) for NH4Cl. The DMSO control serves well for the drugs, not for Ammonium Chloride. In Figure 1C, how did the authors arrive at the 15-hour time point? The correlation does not appear as the authors claim. Where is the 15-hour sampling time point for MG132 or CHX chase? The experimental approach to screen the E2/E3 Ub ligase is appreciated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback! Regarding your questions, we have made the following revisions:</p>
<p>On the expression of nsp6, nsp10, nsp11, and nsp12 in Figure 1:</p>
<p>We have replaced the blots for nsp10, nsp11, and nsp12 with higher exposure blots. However, due to the strong expression of NSP14, we were unable to generate a higher exposure blot for nsp6. Based on the current exposure, it is clear that nsp6 is not regulated by the proteasome. Additionally, in the high-exposure blot for nsp12, we were able to observe its expression and found that this protein is weakly regulated by MG132. Following your suggestion, we have labeled the molecular weights of the proteins in the figure.</p>
<p>On the densitometric analysis of nsp4 protein:</p>
<p>We recalculated the densitometric analysis for nsp4 and found no issues. Although the band intensities do not show large changes, the relative fold changes appear more pronounced because we normalized the data using GAPDH as an internal control. We have added detailed description in the figure legend.</p>
<p>On the NH4Cl control:</p>
<p>In this experiment, ammonium chloride was dissolved in DMSO. We reviewed the solubility data and found that ammonium chloride has a solubility of 50 mg/ml in DMSO, which is sufficient to reach the concentrations used in our experiment. While the solubility is higher in water, we believe that DMSO is an appropriate solvent for this compound in our context.</p>
<p>On the 15-hour time point in Figure 1C:</p>
<p>Regarding the 15-hour time point mentioned in Figure 1C, we did not collect samples at that time. We performed semi-quantitative analysis of protein levels at different time points using ImageJ and estimated the half-life time point based on the half-life calculation formula. Thank you for your suggestion; we will clarify this in the figure legend.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your thoughtful review and constructive suggestions. We have made the necessary revisions and improvements to the figures based on your feedback.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 2: I do not find a reason to include DMSO control in the siRNAs for E2/E3 Ub. Please justify why it is necessary. It is requested to include WB for the siRNA-treated samples. It is strongly recommended to show the WB data for siRNA-treated samples because you are showing siRNA treatment of MARCHF7 in shUBR5 cells and vice versa. However, if antibodies for corresponding targets are not available, qPCR can be shown in graphical representation in supplementary data indicating the siRNA target region and qPCR target. Show a graphical representation of domains/ deleted regions of MARCHF7 and UBR5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback! We have addressed your concerns as follows:</p>
<p>On the inclusion of the DMSO control group:</p>
<p>The DMSO group was initially included as a control for the MG132-treated group. By comparing with the MG132 group, we aimed to observe whether nsp16 levels were restored by MG132 treatment. Additionally, in siRNA knockdown experiments, the DMSO group was included to compare nsp16 protein levels after knockdown with those in the NC group, as well as to assess differences in nsp16 restoration between MG132 treatment and factor knockdown. However, we acknowledge some issues in the control design. To address this, we have redesigned and conducted the experiments with improved controls (Figure 2A).</p>
<p>On validating knockdown efficiency:</p>
<p>We have included Western blot data for UBR5 and MARCHF7 knockdown efficiencies. For other factors where specific antibodies were unavailable, we followed your suggestion and provided graphical representations in the Appendix-figure S1, illustrating the siRNA target regions and qPCR target sites to confirm knockdown specificity and efficiency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 4 A: Write details on how this IP was done. What was the transfection time of this plasmid? Is the transfection time different from that of NSP16 in Figure 1A which shows a significant degradation of NSP16? Please discuss this in detail. It is recommended that this IP be done in +/- MG132. Since you have used siRNA and performed an IP, It is recommended to repeat the IP (with +/- MG132) using the MARCHF7 and UBR5 plasmids</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your detailed review and suggestions! We have addressed your concerns as follows:</p>
<p>On the specific protocol for the co-IP in Figure 3A:</p>
<p>The detailed protocol for the immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment is as follows: on day 1, cells were plated, and on day 2, we co-transfected nsp16 and Ub expression plasmids. After 32 hours of transfection, we treated the cells with MG132 for 16 hours, then harvested the cells for IP. We included MG132 treatment in all ubiquitination IP experiments because, without MG132, nsp16 would be degraded, preventing us from observing changes in ubiquitination levels. We apologize for not clearly labeling this in the figure, and we have made the necessary modifications.</p>
<p>On the use of MG132 and NSP16 degradation:</p>
<p>Following your suggestion, we have clarified the use of MG132 in the IP experiments, which differs from the degradation of nsp16 shown in Figure 1A. In Figure 1A, we show the degradation of nsp16 in the absence of MG132 treatment.</p>
<p>On the overexpression of UBR5 and MARCHF7:</p>
<p>The effect of overexpressing UBR5 or MARCHF7 on ubiquitination has been validated in Figure 4 supplement 2. In these experiments, we explored the effect of UBR5 activity domain inactivation on nsp16 ubiquitination, as well as the effect of MARCHF7 truncation on nsp16 ubiquitination modification. In these experiments, overexpression of the wild-type E3 ligases was also included, and the results yielded the same conclusions as those from the E3 knockdown experiments, thereby validating the robustness of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 4C: Appropriate controls are missing. The authors claim NSP16 is ubiquitinated and degraded by UBR5 and MARCHF7 via K27 and K48 chains. There is no NSP16 Only control. We cannot compare the NSP16 without an NSP16 transfection. I will suggest the authors repeat these individual controls in both the presence and absence of MG132.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your careful review and valuable suggestion! In response to your comment, we have redesigned the experiment and added a control group without nsp16 transfection. We have repeated the validation in the presence of MG132. Without MG132 treatment, nsp16 is degraded, leading to very low protein levels, making it difficult to observe the phenomenon. We have updated the figure accordingly and made the necessary adjustments based on your suggestion (Figure 3E-F).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In my opinion, the Figure 8 needs modification. It is requested to show the levels of strand-specific viral mRNA under UBR5 and MARCHF7 knock-down in +/- of MG312. This figure should also be supported by WB indicating the level of NSP16 (capping activity) and any of the viral proteins. This may validate that if the capping activity is lost, viral translation is affected and hence there is a reduction in virus titre. Alternatively, the figure can be modified by putting a sub-heading box over 7mGppA-RNA section and marking it as a future direction/ hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thorough and thoughtful review! Regarding the modification of Figure 8, we completely agree with your suggestion. Currently, examining the impact of viral RNA cap modification is technically challenging for us. Therefore, we have followed your advice and marked the investigation of how nsp16 degradation affects viral RNA cap structures as a future direction/hypothesis in the schematic of Figure 8. This revision helps provide direction for future experiments and enhances the clarity of the figure. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration and valuable suggestion!</p>

<p>(3) Just a curious question, what happens if we silence both UBR5 and MARCHF7 and check for virus titre? This is an additional work, but if the authors do not agree, it is ok.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion! Regarding your question about silencing both UBR5 and MARCHF7, we indeed attempted to generate knockout cell lines, but unfortunately, we were not successful at this stage. We plan to explore alternative methods to establish stable knockout cell lines in our future experiments. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure 5 supplement 1, we have performed experiments where both UBR5 and MARCHF7 were knocked down simultaneously, followed by infection with virus-like particles. The results indicate that dual knockdown further enhances viral replication. These findings may partially address your question. Thank you again for your insightful suggestion!</p>
