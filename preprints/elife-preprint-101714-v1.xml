<abstract>
<p>Skeletal stem cells have been isolated from various tissues, including periosteum and bone marrow, where they exhibit key functions in bone biology and hematopoiesis, respectively. The role of periosteal skeletal stem cells in bone regeneration and healing has been extensively studied, but their ability to contribute to the bone marrow stroma is still under debate. In the present study, we characterized a whole bone transplantation model that mimics the initial bone marrow necrosis and fatty infiltration seen after injury. Using this model and a lineage tracing approach, we observed the migration of periosteal skeletal stem cells into the bone marrow after transplantation. Once in the bone marrow, periosteal skeletal stem cells are phenotypically and functionally reprogrammed into bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells that express high levels of hematopoietic stem cell niche factors such as Cxcl12 and Kitl. In addition, using <italic>in-vitro</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic> approaches, we found that periosteal skeletal stem cells are more resistant to acute stress than bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. These results highlight the plasticity of periosteal skeletal stem cells and their potential role in bone marrow regeneration after bone marrow injury.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) are rare self-renewing multipotent stromal cells which are capable of multilineage differentiation into osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. BM-MSCs are mostly localized around the blood vessels and represent an important component of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) microenvironment, also referred to as the niche. BM-MSCs closely interact with HSCs and secrete factors, including the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (Cxcl12) and stem cell factor (SCF), that control their self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation capacities <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Several studies have used cell surface markers (CD51<sup>+</sup>, PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>) or reporter mice (<italic>Lepr</italic>-cre, Nestin (<italic>Nes</italic>)-GFP, <italic>Ng2</italic>-cre) to describe distinct BM-MSC populations with significant overlap <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent studies have suggested that the periosteum, a thin layer of fibrous material that covers the surface of long bones, is a source of SSCs for bone regeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. These P-SSCs have been described as sharing some characteristics with BM-MSCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, the relationship between these different stromal cell populations is poorly understood and the distinction between MSCs and SSCs remains controversial.</p>
<p>While the bone marrow is classically known as a major source of MSCs, the bone cortex represents a richer source of colony-forming units-fibroblasts (CFU-F) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that bone regeneration is mediated by both endochondral and intramembranous ossification and that the periosteum plays an important role in bone regeneration after injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. However, there is little information on the function of P-SSCs, aside from their crucial role in bone healing and remodeling, and whether they contribute to bone marrow regeneration.</p>
<p>In the present study, we developed and characterized a whole bone transplantation model to study bone marrow regeneration, in which an intact adult femur is transplanted subcutaneously into a recipient mouse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> Shortly after transplantation, bone marrow architecture in the transplanted femur, hereafter referred as the graft, is severely altered with an expansion of adipocytes that mimics the fatty infiltration classically observed in the bone marrow after chemotherapy or radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. This initial destruction of the bone marrow microenvironment is followed by a progressive regeneration of blood vessels and BM-MSCs network. The graft is progressively colonized by host-derived HSCs allowing the hematopoiesis to resume. Unexpectedly, we found that P-SSCs can migrate into the bone marrow and acquire BM-MSC niche functions, making them capable of supporting hematopoiesis through the <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of specific niche genes, such as <italic>Cxcl12</italic> and <italic>Kitl</italic>. In addition, we found that BM-MSCs and P-SSCs display different metabolic profiles, and that P-SSCs exhibit higher resistance to transplantation-induced stress. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the high plasticity of P-SSCs and highlights their potential contribution to bone marrow stroma regeneration after injury.</p>

<title>The whole bone transplant model recapitulates physiological regeneration of the bone marrow</title>
<p>To study the mechanisms involved in bone marrow regeneration, we utilized a model system based on the subcutaneous transplantation of an intact adult femur into non-conditioned age and sex matched recipient mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The bone transplantation is followed by a rapid and massive depletion of bone marrow cells in the engrafted femur with a cell viability reaching below 10% at 24 hours after transplantation (<bold>Figure S1A</bold>). Notably, bone marrow necrosis following bone transplantation is associated with the replacement of hematopoietic cells in the graft femur by marrow adipocytes, similar to the effects of chemotherapy or irradiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (<bold>Figure S1B</bold>). Following bone transplantation, we observed a progressive increase in bone marrow cellularity over time with no significant difference in cellularity between the graft and host femurs at five months following transplantation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Regeneration of the bone marrow compartment is associated with a reduction in adipogenic infiltration, as revealed by staining with the anti-perilipin antibody at 4 months post-transplantation (<bold>Figure S1B</bold>). Additionally, the absolute number of graft BM-MSCs, defined as CD45<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>CD51<sup>+</sup>CD140α<sup>+</sup> cells by flow cytometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, also increased over time, with no difference between the graft and host femurs at five months following transplantation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We also observed a progressive increase in the number of Lin<sup>-</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>-</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup> phenotypic HSCs in the graft femur over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the absolute HSC numbers in the graft did not reach HSC numbers as detected in the host femur after five months (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), no differences were observed in the numbers of hematopoietic progenitors or in the frequencies of hematopoietic cell populations between the host and graft femurs (<bold>Figure S1C and S1D</bold>). These data suggests that bone transplantation reproduces physiological bone marrow injury and the subsequent recovery process.</p>

<p>Hematopoiesis is a highly regulated and essential process by which all the differentiated blood cells are produced. To investigate whether functional hematopoietic progenitors fully recover in graft femurs, we performed a non-competitive bone marrow transplantation assay, in which we transplanted either graft or host bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated recipients at five months after bone transplantation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref><bold> and S2A</bold>). The survival of lethally irradiated recipients remained equal in both groups, with 100% of recipients surviving throughout the length of the experiment. Chimerism analysis revealed robust engraftment of recipient mice with hematopoietic cells derived from the engrafted femurs, indicating that HSCs and progenitors derived from graft femurs can sustain long-term hematopoiesis upon transplantation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We also observed no significant differences in donor cell contribution to myeloid or lymphoid lineages between the two groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Altogether, these data establish our bone transplantation model as a useful tool to study bone marrow and HSC niche regeneration.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Graft BM-MSCs are graft-derived and progressively express HSC niche factors during regeneration</title>
<p>Next, we aimed to determine the origin of the hematopoietic and stromal cell populations in the graft bone marrow. To achieve this, we took advantage of the Rosa<sup>mT/mG</sup> and ubiquitin C (UBC) promoter driven-GFP mouse models, in which all cells are labeled by red and green reporters respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We transplanted femurs isolated from UBC-GFP mice into Rosa<sup>mT/mG</sup> recipients and quantified endothelial cells, BM-MSCs, and hematopoietic cells in the graft (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Corroborating the results of Picoli et al., we observed that at five months post transplantation, over 98% of the graft BM-MSCs originated from the graft femur, while over 99% of the hematopoietic cells in the graft originated from the host mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Interestingly, endothelial cells were derived from both the host and the graft, suggesting the contribution of different progenitors. Furthermore, we did not detect any cells derived from the graft in the host femurs (data not shown). These results are consistent with data obtained from ossicle-based experiments, where MSC-seeded ossicles are colonized by recipient-derived hematopoietic cells10,29-32.</p>

<p>BM-MSCs are a major constituent of the hematopoietic niche, secreting maintenance factors that support HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. To test for HSC niche supportive activity of graft BM-MSCs, we utilized <italic>Nes</italic>-GFP reporter mice to isolate BM-MSCs after bone transplantation. Previous work from our group has shown that <italic>Nes</italic>-GFP marks mouse MSCs with HSC-niche function within the bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Since our previous analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) revealed that all of the graft BM-MSCs originate from the graft itself, we transplanted <italic>Nes</italic>-GFP femurs into <italic>Nes</italic>-GFP recipient mice and sorted CD45<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup><italic>Nes</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> BM-MSCs from donor and recipient mice for analysis at different time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Since we did not detect circulation of BM-MSCs between host and graft bone marrow in our bone transplantation experiments (data not shown), this strategy allowed us to compare host and graft BM-MSCs using equivalent markers. In addition to the previously described increase over time in the absolute number of BM-MSCs in the graft femur (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), we observed a progressive increase in the expression of the HSC-niche genes <italic>Cxcl12</italic> and <italic>Kitl</italic>, reaching a plateau at five months post-transplantation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Similarly, no differences were observed between host and graft femurs in the expression levels of additional niche factors, including <italic>osteopontin</italic> (<italic>Opn)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, <italic>angiopoietin-1</italic> (<italic>Angpt1)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, and <italic>vascular cell adhesion molecule-1</italic> (<italic>Vcam1)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> at five months (<bold>Figure S2B</bold>). In this experiment, host and graft BM-MSCs also had similar CFU-F activity at five months (<bold>Figure S2C</bold>). Altogether, these results show that by five months post-bone transplantation, the niche-supportive and <italic>in vitro</italic> clonogenic functions of graft BM-MSCs are restored and are similar to the activity of native host BM-MSCs.</p>

SSCs have been identified in the periosteum (P-SSCs), compact bone, and bone marrow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Similar to BM-MSCs, P-SSCs have been shown to have CFU-F activity and the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Due to the severe necrosis and depletion of the marrow cavity content that we observed following bone transplantation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref><bold> and S1A</bold>), we hypothesized that cells derived from the compact bone and/or the periosteum could potentially contribute to stromal marrow regeneration. We first analyzed the cellularity of graft bone marrow, compact bone, and periosteum at different early time points following transplantation. While the number of live cells within the bone marrow and compact bone were drastically reduced in the first 24 hours post transplantation, we unexpectedly observed a significant but transient increase in live periosteal cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref><bold> and S3A)</bold>.</p>

<p>Moreover, while most of the bone marrow cells were depleted shortly after transplantation (<bold>Figures S1A and S3A</bold>), cell viability was not affected in the periosteum within this time frame (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref><bold> and S3B</bold>). To quantify P-SSCs and BM-MSCs by flow cytometry, we used the combination of CD51 and CD200, as these markers have been well-validated in both tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Within the CD45<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>-</sup> CD31<sup>-</sup> fraction of live periosteal cells, we confirmed that CD51<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> P-SSCs had the highest CFU-F activity and were also capable of trilineage differentiation (<bold>Figures S3C-S3E</bold>). Flow cytometric analysis confirmed an expansion of P-SSCs starting at day 3 post transplantation and peaking at day 8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref><bold> and S3F</bold>). These results were confirmed by confocal microscopy analysis of <italic>Nes</italic>-GFP graft femurs transplanted into WT mice and stained for Periostin, a matricellular protein highly expressed by periosteal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We detected an expansion of <italic>Nes</italic>-GFP<sup>+</sup> skeletal progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> within the periosteum with a peak at day 8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), similar to the expansion kinetics that we detected by flow cytometry. Interestingly, by day 15, we could detect Periostin<sup>+</sup> cells outside of the periosteum layer and in the compact bone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the potential role of the periosteum in overall bone marrow regeneration, we compared the regenerative capacity of transplanted femurs with intact periosteum to that of femurs in which the periosteum was mechanically removed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). At five months after transplantation, total cellularity and BM-MSC number were significantly reduced in femurs lacking the periosteum, highlighting a potentially critical role for the periosteum and P-SSCs during bone marrow regeneration.</p>

<title>P-SSCs are more resistant to stress than BM-MSCs</title>
<p>Due to the ability of P-SSCs to survive bone transplantation, as opposed to BM-MSCs, we explored the intrinsic differences between BM-MSCs and P-SSCs. Using RNA sequencing, we analyzed the transcriptional differences between CD51<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> P-SSCs and BM-MSCs at steady-state. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that P-SSCs were positively enriched for gene sets associated with stemness and negatively enriched for gene sets associated with proliferation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These results are in line with qPCR analysis showing that P-SSCs express high levels of the cell cycle inhibitor genes <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1c,</italic> and low levels of the cell cycle progression gene <italic>Cdk4</italic> at steady state (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref>). Additionally, flow cytometric analysis revealed that, compared to BM-MSCs, P-SSCs are less metabolically active, as shown by decreased glucose uptake as assessed by 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2-NDBG) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that P-SSCs are more resistant to stress than BM-MSCs.</p>

<p>Low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high expression of antioxidant enzymes are mechanisms that help stem cells to avoid stress-induced cell death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Thus, we measured ROS levels by staining cells with the superoxide indicator dihydroethidium (DHE). At steady state, flow cytometric analysis revealed that P-SSCs had lower levels of cellular ROS than BM-MSCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Under physiological conditions, cells can maintain low ROS levels by expressing antioxidant enzymes. Indeed, qPCR analysis revealed higher expression of three major ROS-detoxifying enzymes genes: superoxide dismutase (<italic>Sod1</italic>), glutaminase (<italic>Gls</italic>) and glutathione peroxidase (<italic>Gpx1</italic>), in sorted CD51<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> P-SSCs than in CD51<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> BM-MSCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that P-SSCs are more stress-resistant than BM-MSCs, which may leave P-SSCs poised to proliferate in response to transplantation.</p>
<p>It is possible that the location of the periosteum on the outside of the bone allows P-SSCs to survive the stress of bone transplantation better than BM-MSCs. Therefore, to determine whether the anatomic location of BM-MSCs and P-SSCs is the primary determinant of their differential stress response, we performed an <italic>ex vivo</italic> culture experiment designed to subject BM-MSCs and P-SSCs to equivalent levels of stress while in the same environment. After short-term <italic>ex vivo</italic> expansion of total bone marrow and periosteal cells, we performed a lineage depletion of CD45<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic cells in both fractions. Purified P-SSCs and BM-MSCs were then maintained for 12 hours in serum-free culture media to stress the cells and mimic the nutrient deprivation that occurs immediately following bone transplantation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of activated caspase-3/7 revealed that after 12 hours in serum-free media, BM-MSCs exhibited a significantly higher level of apoptosis compared to P-SSCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref><bold> and S4A</bold>). These results suggest that P-SSCs are more intrinsically resilient than BM-MSCs, even when they are subjected to similar stress conditions in an equivalent environment.</p>

<title>P-SSCs as a source of functional BM-MSCs during regeneration</title>
<p>As we observed that bone transplantation was followed by a depletion of bone marrow cellularity with an early expansion of P-SSCs, and that transplantation of bones without periosteum negatively impacts graft regeneration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref>), we hypothesized that proliferating P-SSCs migrate into the bone marrow and contribute to stromal regeneration.

<p>Flow cytometric analysis of the graft at five months post-transplantation confirmed the presence of periosteum-derived GFP<sup>+</sup> MSCs within the bone marrow cavity (<bold>Figure S5A</bold>). Importantly, while P-SSCs do not express <italic>Cxcl12</italic> or <italic>Kitl</italic> at steady state, periosteum-derived GFP+ BM-MSCs expressed these niche cytokines at a similar level to control sorted <italic>Nes</italic>-GFP+ BM-MSCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We also quantified the expression of the niche factors <italic>Angpt1</italic> and <italic>Opn.</italic> Similarly, we found that <italic>Angpt1</italic> expression in the graft GFP<sup>+</sup> BM-MSCs reached the level of control BM-MSCs, while <italic>Opn</italic> expression was higher in GFP<sup>+</sup> BM-MSCs than in control <italic>Nes</italic>-GFP+ BM-MSCs at five months after transplantation (<bold>Figure S5B</bold>).

Therefore, the moderate increase in <italic>Opn</italic> expression level in graft BM-MSCs compared to steady state BM-MSCs could be due to a residual inflammatory effect of bone transplantation. These results show that P-SSCs can both migrate into the bone marrow cavity and upregulate HSC maintenance genes to support hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>To confirm these results, we took advantage of a previously described transgenic mouse model in which an inducible Cre is placed under the promoter of the <italic>Periostin</italic> gene (<italic>Postn<sup>MCM</sup></italic>), hereafter referred to as <italic>Postn</italic>-cre<sup>ER</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. <italic>Postn</italic> encodes the secreted matricellular protein Periostin, and is highly expressed by periosteal cells and upregulated during bone healing and formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.

We crossed the <italic>Postn</italic>-cre<sup>ER</sup> line with ROSA26-loxP-stop-loxP-tdTomato reporter (Tomato) mice to be able to lineage trace P-SSCs.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Bone marrow regeneration is a critical process that enables the recovery of hematopoiesis after injury such as irradiation or chemotherapy. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells represent a key component of the bone marrow microenvironment. These stromal cells play a crucial role in regulating the self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation properties of HSCs. The periosteum, a thin membrane that is highly vascularized and innervated, is located on the outside of the bone. This membrane contains numerous skeletal stromal cells, which play a pivotal role in maintaining the bone tissue and facilitating post-fracture healing. While the bone marrow microenvironment at steady state has been extensively studied, the mechanisms of bone marrow regeneration and stromal recovery remain poorly understood. Furthermore, data related to the functions of P-SSC beyond their established role in bone maintenance and fracture healing remain scarce. The objective of this study was to develop and characterize a model of whole bone transplantation in order to study bone marrow regeneration in mice. In this model, severe injury to hematopoietic and stromal cells within the bone marrow is induced, allowing for the investigation of the regeneration process of both cell populations. We found that the total graft bone marrow cellularity and BM-MSC cellularity demonstrate a gradual increase over time, ultimately reaching levels comparable to those observed prior to transplantation by five months post-transplantation. The five-month time point was subsequently employed for further analyses. Prior research has emphasized the significance of stromal integrity for the recovery of HSCs following irradiation or chemotherapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. The findings of our study indicate that, while initially impacted by the stress associated with transplantation, BM-MSCs ultimately demonstrate their capacity to regenerate and sustain hematopoiesis within the engrafted femur. Furthermore, our findings indicate that hematopoietic progenitors derived from the graft femur are capable of engraftment in secondary recipient mice, thereby facilitating multi-lineage reconstitution. This model system recapitulates a recovering bone marrow microenvironment. Furthermore, it allows for genetic <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of bone marrow regeneration. Consequently, bone transplantation can be employed as a valuable tool in future studies for investigating bone marrow regeneration.</p>
<p>The origin of endothelial progenitors in the bone marrow is not well defined. A recent study showed that during bone marrow regeneration after chemotherapy, sinusoidal and arteriolar vessels are derived from distinct progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, in the present study, we observed that endothelial cells within the graft originate from both the graft and host, which supports the hypothesis that different progenitors contribute to the bone marrow vascular network. Further studies are needed to clarify the respective contributions of graft- and host-derived progenitors and the different progenitors’ populations involved in the vascular network regeneration.</p>
<p>Our results also highlight the high resilience and plasticity of P-SSCs and reveal their potential contribution to the bone marrow stromal network and bone marrow regeneration. At steady state, P-SSC do not express HSC maintenance genes, such as <italic>Kitl</italic> and <italic>Cxcl12</italic>, and the potential capacity of P-SSC to support HSCs has not been previously addressed. Unexpectedly, our results show that in our model, P-SSCs can migrate to the bone marrow and adopt a phenotype similar to that of BM-MSCs. Therefore, it is possible that P-SSCs can be harvested and manipulated as a source of BM-MSCs. In accordance with our findings, a recent study employing Gli1 to trace P-SSC demonstrated the localized expression of <italic>Kitl</italic> and <italic>Cxcl12</italic> by P-SSCs at the fracture site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, this model was not designed to specifically address the role of P-SSC in bone marrow regeneration. Furthermore, niche-specific genes were only expressed by cells adjacent to the fracture callus. Although we did not find a baseline difference in <italic>Gli1</italic> expression between BM-MSCs and P-SSCs in our RNA sequencing analysis, this may be due to the differences in surface markers and reporters used to identify P-SSCs and BM-MSCs. In the same study, authors did not find expression of reporters in the periosteum using the <italic>Postn</italic>-cre<sup>ER</sup> mice. It is likely that this discrepancy is attributable to differences in generation of the Postn-Cre mice used. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that, compared to steady state, the <italic>Postn</italic> gene is upregulated following the activation of P-SSC, which is clearly evident in the context of whole bone transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> The results of our flow cytometry and imaging analyses demonstrate that P-SSC is specifically labelled at early time points following the transplantation of grafts from Postn-Cre<sup>ER</sup> mice. Therefore, we show a novel application for the use of the inducible <italic>Postn</italic>-cre<sup>ER</sup> mice to differentiate between BM-MSCs and P-SSCs <italic>in vivo.</italic> Accordingly, Duchamp et al. demonstrated that periostin contributes to the highly regenerative nature of P-SSCs compared to BM-MSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. While previous studies have used <italic>Prx1</italic> and <italic>Ctsk-</italic>Cre models, these models do not adequately allow the distinction between P-SSCs and BM-MSCs, likely due to their common embryonic origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Periostin is a well-studied protein that has been shown to interact with extracellular matrix proteins and plays a key role in tissue regeneration and cancer progression, promoting proliferation, invasion, and anti-apoptotic signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is possible that periostin contributes to P-SSC proliferation and migration into the bone marrow, which would be an interesting area for future investigation.</p>
<p>Additionally, our findings illustrate the differential stress response between BM-MSCs and P-SSCs. While BM-MSCs are renowned for their resilience to stress, our findings illustrate that P-SSCs exhibit an even greater resistance to stress, which is attributed, at least in part, to their distinctive metabolic profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Given that differences in apoptosis were observed between BM-MSCs and P-SSCs, even when they were cultured ex vivo under identical stress culture conditions, it can be concluded that the observed differences between P-SSCs and BM-MSCs are due to intrinsic cellular properties rather than their anatomical location. Nevertheless, additional studies are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for the observed relative stress resistance of P-SSCs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have used a whole bone transplantation model to study bone marrow regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> in response to acute injury using genetic tools. Our study has shown that P-SSCs can facilitate BM-MSC regeneration and our data suggest that P-SSCs are able to support hematopoietic cell recovery under stress conditions.</p>

<title>Bone transplantation procedure</title>
<p>Donor mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by cervical dislocation. Femurs were isolated and preserved in an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Recipient mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine intraperitoneal injection (10 µL/g). Donor femurs were subcutaneously implanted in the back of the recipient mice, and the skin was sutured with a non-absorbable polyamide 5/0 silk. Mice were allowed to recover under a heat lamp until awake and monitored daily for up to a week post-surgery.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Bone marrow transplantation</title>
<p>Non-competitive repopulation assays were performed using CD45.1 and CD45.2 mice. Recipient mice were lethally irradiated (12 Gy, two split doses) in a Cesium Mark 1 irradiator (JL Shepherd &amp; Associates). A total of 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> CD45.2<sup>+</sup> bone marrow nuclear cells from either the graft or host femurs were obtained at five months after transplantation and injected retro-orbitally into irradiated CD45.1<sup>+</sup> mice. Mice were bled retro-orbitally every 4 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, and peripheral blood was analyzed for engraftment and repopulation up to 16 weeks.</p>

<title>Preparation of single cell suspensions</title>
<p>To isolate P-SSCs, muscle tissue was carefully removed using scissors and intact bones were submerged for 30 minutes in ice-cold PBS with 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The periosteum was carefully removed with a surgical blade, and mechanical dissociation was performed using scissors. Enzymatic dissociation was performed by incubating the periosteum fragments for 45 minutes at 37°C in digestion buffer (Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, Gibco) containing 1 mg.ml<sup>−1</sup> collagenase type IV (Gibco) and 2 mg.ml<sup>−1</sup> dispase (Gibco)) on a rotator. Bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing and dissociating using a 1-ml syringe with PBS via a 21-gauge needle. For analysis of stromal and endothelial cell populations, intact bone marrow plugs were flushed into digestion buffer using 21- or 25-gauge needles and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with manual mixing every 10 mins. After bone marrow and periosteum isolation, the remaining compact bone was crushed, mechanically dissociated using scissors as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and digested in the digestion buffer, rotating for 45 minutes at 37°C. Enzymatic digestion was stopped by adding ice-cold PEB buffer (PBS with 0.5% BSA and 2mM EDTA).</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Flow cytometry and cell sorting</title>
<p>For FACS analysis and sorting, red blood cells were lysed (distilled H<sub>2</sub>O containing 155mM ammonium chloride, 10mM potassium bicarbonate and 0.5M EDTA) and washed in ice-cold PEB (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA) before staining with antibodies in PEB for 20 minutes on ice. Dead cells and debris were excluded by FSC (forward scatter), SSC (side scatter) and DAPI (4’,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Sigma). FACS analyses were carried out using BD LSRII flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) and cell sorting experiments were performed using a MoFlo Astrios (Beckman Coulter). Data were analyzed with FlowJo 10.4.0 (LCC) and FACS Diva 6.1 software (BD Biosciences). Antibodies used for FACS can be found in Supplementary table 1. For metabolic assays, cells were first stained with cell surface markers prior to labeling with metabolic dyes. For cellular ROS quantification, cells were incubated with dihydroethidium (5uM; Molecular Probes) for 20 minutes at 37°C in PBS. Glucose uptake quantification was performed by incubating the cells in DMEM without glucose (Gibco) containing Glutamax (1:100; Gibco) and 2-NBDG (17µmol mL<sup>-1</sup>; Cayman Chemical Company) for 30 minutes at 37°C.</p>

<title>CFU-F assays</title>
<p>For CFU-F and stromal cell culture, CD45<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>-</sup>CD31<sup>-</sup>CD51<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> stromal cells isolated from bone marrow and periosteum were sorted and plated at a clonal density (1,000 cell/well) in α-MEM (Gibco) containing 20% FBS (HyClone), 10% MesenCult Stimulatory supplement (StemCell Technologies) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin. Half of the medium was changed at day 7. Cells were cultured for 12-14 days, at the end of which the colonies were scored.</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation assays</title>
<p>Trilineage differentiation assays towards the osteogenic, adipogenic, and chondrogenic lineages were performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were treated with StemXVivo Osteogenic, Adipogenic, or Chondrogenic mouse differentiation media, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&amp;D Systems). All cultures were maintained with 5% CO2 in a water-jacketed incubator at 37°C. Osteogenic differentiation was revealed by Alizarin Red S staining. Adipocytes were identified by the typical production of lipid droplets and Bodipy (Invitrogen) staining. Chondrocytes were revealed by Alcian Blue staining.</p>

<title><italic>Ex vivo</italic> culture nutrient deprivation assay</title>
<p>Whole bone marrow from 1 femur and whole periosteum from 2 femurs were isolated and digested as previously described and plated in α-MEM (Gibco) containing 20% FBS (HyClone), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine and βFGF. The medium was changed every 3-4 days. Once a plate reached near confluence, CD45 lineage depletion was performed on both bone marrow and periosteum fractions. Cells were then counted and plated in 12- or 24-well plates at approximately 5000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Once the plates reached near confluence, media was switched to α-MEM without FBS, 1% L-glutamine and βFGF. 12 hours after the medium was switched to 0% FBS medium, the cells were trypsinized, spun down, and stained for cell surface markers. After 4-5 days, flow cytometric apoptosis quantification was performed using the CellEvent Caspase 3/7 kit (ThermoFisher) following the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence imaging of bone sections</title>
<p>To stain blood vessels, anti-CD31 and anti-CD144 antibodies were injected intravenously into mice (10 μg, 20 μL of 0.5 μg.μL<sup>−1</sup>) and mice were sacrificed for analysis at 10 min after injection. For frozen sections of long bones, femurs and tibias were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4 °C. For cryopreservation, the bones were incubated sequentially in 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose/PBS at 4 °C for 1h each and embedded and flash frozen in SCEM embedding medium (SECTION-LAB). Frozen sections were prepared at 20μm thickness with a cryostat (CM3050, Leica) using the Kawamoto’s tape transfer method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. For immunofluorescence staining, sections were rinsed with PBS, post-fixed with 4% cold PFA for 10 min, followed by blocking with 20% donkey serum (DS; Sigma) in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 3 h at room temperature (20–25 °C). For perilipin staining, sections were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in saturation buffer (PBS-donkey serum 10%). The rabbit polyclonal anti-perilipin antibody (clone: D1D8; Cat: 9349; Cell Signaling Technology) was used at 1:100 dilution in 2% Donkey serum 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS overnight at 4 °C. Periostin staining was performed using whole mount femur imaging. The bone marrow was exposed by shaving the bone using a cryostat (CM3050, Leica). Shaved femurs were fixed 30 minutes at 4°C in PBS/PFA 4%. Samples were then incubated in the saturation buffer (PBS-donkey serum 10%) during 1 hour at room temperature. Polyclonal goat anti-periostin antibody (Cat: AF2955; R&amp;D) and monoclonal rat anti-endomucin antibodies (clone: V.7C7; Cat: sc-65495; Santa Cruz) were used at a 1:100 dilution overnight at 4°C in PBS-donkey serum 2%. When necessary, primary antibody staining was followed by 3 washes with 2% DS 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS and a 30 min incubation with Alexa Fluor 568 or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) and 0.2% DAPI (4′, 6-diamino-2-phenylindole; Sigma).</p>

<title>RNA sequencing and analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA from 1000-3000 sorted steady BM-MSCs, steady state P-SSCs and graft BM-MSCs was extracted using the RNAeasy Plus Micro kit (Qiagen) and assessed for integrity and purity using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. When applicable, RNA from two mice was combined; however, each replicate contained RNA from distinct mice. RNA-seq data generated from Illumina Novaseq6000 were processed using the following pipeline. Briefly, clean reads were mapped to the mouse genome (GRCm38) using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR 2.6.1d). Gene expression levels were calculated and differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 and enriched using clusterProfiler. All RNA sequencing data are available under the SuperSeries dataset GSE222272 in GEO omnibus.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All data are presented as the mean±S.E.M. N represents the number of mice in each experiment, as detailed in the figure legends. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample sizes; sample sizes were determined by previous experience with similar models of hematopoiesis, as shown in previous experiments performed in our laboratory. Statistical significance was determined by an unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test to compare two groups or a one-way ANOVA with multiple group comparisons. Statistical analyses were performed, and data presented using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software), FACS Diva 6.1 software (BD Biosciences, FlowJo 10.4.0 (LLC), Slide Book Software 6.0 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) and QuantStudio 6 Real-Time PCR Software (Applied Biosystem, Thermo Fisher). *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001, ****P&lt;0.0001.</p>

<p>The study is <bold>valuable</bold> to the field, introducing a new model to test BM-periosteal stem cell function in vivo. The authors' findings suggested that periosteal stem cells are linked to hematopoietic regeneration. More comparisons with the conventional model and direct examination of periosteal stem cell factors in hematopoietic regeneration are missing. The observations are <bold>solid</bold>, however, the limitations in their experimental model made the overall impact <bold>incomplete</bold>; there is potential for improvements to be made in this area.</p>

<p>The manuscript under review investigates the role of periosteal stem cells (P-SSC) in bone marrow regeneration using a whole-bone subcutaneous transplantation model. While the model is somewhat artificial, the findings were interesting, suggesting the migration of periosteal stem cells into the bone marrow and their potential to become bone marrow stromal cells. This indicates a significant plasticity of P-SSC consistent with previous reports using fracture models (Cell Stem Cell 29:1547, Dev Cell 59:1192).</p>
<p>Major Concerns</p>
<p>(1) The authors assert that the periosteal layer was completely removed in their model, which is crucial for their conclusions. To substantiate this claim, it is recommended that the authors provide evidence of the successful removal of the entire periosteal stem cell (P-SSC) population. A colony-forming assay, with and without periosteal removal, could serve as a suitable method to demonstrate this.</p>
<p>(2) The observation that P-SSCs do not express Kitl or Cxcl12, while their bone marrow stromal cell (BM-MSC) derivatives do, is a key finding. To strengthen this conclusion, the authors are encouraged to repeat the experiment using Cxcl12 or Scf reporter alleles. Immunofluorescence staining that confirms the migration of periosteal cells and their transformation into Cxcl12- or Scf-reporter-positive cells would significantly enhance the paper's key conclusion.</p>
<p>(3) On page 8, line 20, the authors' statement regarding the detection of Periostin+ cells outside the periosteum layer could be misinterpreted due to the use of the periostin antibody. Given that periostin is an extracellular matrix protein, the staining may not accurately represent Periostin-expressing cells but rather the presence of periostin in the extracellular matrix. The authors should revise this section for greater precision.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have established a femur graft model that allows the study of hematopoietic regeneration following transplantation. They have extensively characterized this model, demonstrating the loss of hematopoietic cells from the donor femur following transplantation, with recovery of hematopoiesis from recipient cells. They also show evidence that BM MSCs present in the graft following transplantation are graft-derived. They have utilized this model to show that following transplantation, periosteal cells respond by first expanding, then giving rise to more periosteal SSCs, and then migrating into the marrow to give rise to BM MSCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These studies are notable in several ways:</p>
<p>(1) Establishment of a novel femur graft model for the study of hematopoiesis;</p>
<p>(2) Use of lineage tracing and surgery models to demonstrate that periosteal cells can give rise to BM MSCs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a few weaknesses. First, the authors do not definitively demonstrate the requirement of periosteal SSC movement into the BM cavity for hematopoietic recovery. Hematopoiesis recovers significantly before 5 months, even before significant P-SSC movement has been shown, and hematopoiesis recovers significantly even when periosteum has been stripped. Second, it is not clear how the periosteum is changing in the grafts. Which cells are expanding is unclear, and it is not clear if these cells have already adopted a more MSC-like phenotype prior to entering the marrow space. Indeed, given the presence of host-derived endothelial cells in the BM, these studies are reminiscent of prior studies from this group and others that re-endothelialization of the marrow may be much more important for determining hematopoietic regeneration, rather than the P-SSC migration. Third, the studies exploring the preferential depletion of BM MSCs vs P-SSCs are difficult to interpret. The single metabolic stress condition chosen was not well-justified, and the use of purified cell populations to study response to stress ex vivo may have introduced artifacts into the system.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Marchand, Akinnola, et al. describe the use of the novel model to study BM regeneration. Here, they harvest intact femurs and subcutaneously graft them into recipient mice. Similar to standard BM regeneration models, there is a rapid decrease in cellularity followed by a gradual recovery over 5 months within the grafts. At 5 months, these grafts have robust HSC activity, similar to HSCs isolated from the host femur. They find that periosteum skeletal stem cells (p-SSCs) are the primary source of BM-MSCs within the grafted femur and that these cells are more resistant to the acute stress of grafting the femur.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an interesting manuscript that describes a novel model to study BM regeneration. The model has tremendous promise.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors claim that grafting intact femurs subcutaneously is a model of BM regeneration and can be used as a replacement for gold standard BM regeneration assays such as sublethal chemo/irradiation. However, there isn't enough explanation as to how this model is equivalent or superior to the traditional models. For instance, the authors claim that this model allows for the study of &quot;BM regeneration in vivo in response to acute injury using genetic tools.&quot; This can and has been done numerous times with established, physiologically relevant BM regeneration models. The onus is on the authors to discuss or perform the necessary experiments to justify the use of this model. For example, standard BM regeneration models involve systemic damage that is akin to therapies that require BM regeneration. How is studying the current model that provides only an acute injury more relevant and useful than other models? As it stands, it seems as if the authors could have done all the experiments demonstrating the importance of these p-SSCs in the traditional myelosuppressive BM regeneration models to be more physiologically relevant. Along these lines, the use of a standard BM regeneration model (e.g., sublethal chemo/irradiation) as a critical control is missing and should be included. Even if the control doesn't demonstrate that p-SSCs can contribute to the BM-MSC during regeneration, it will still be important because it could be the justification for using the described model to specifically study p-SSCs' regulation of BM regeneration.</p>
<p>The authors perform some analysis that suggests that grafting a whole femur mimics BM regeneration, but there are many experiments missing from the manuscript that will be necessary to support the use of this model. To demonstrate that this new model mimics current BM regeneration models, the authors need to perform a careful examination of the early kinetics of hematopoietic recovery post-transplant. Complete blood counts should be performed on the grafts, focusing on white blood cells (particularly neutrophils), red blood cells, platelets, all critical indicators of BM regeneration. This analysis should be done at early time points that include weekly analysis for a minimum of 28 days following the graft. Additionally, understanding how and when the vasculature recovers is critical. This is particularly important because it is well-established that if there is a delay in vascular recovery, there is a delay in hematopoietic recovery. As mentioned above, a standard BM regeneration model should be used as a control.</p>
<p>The contribution of donor and host cells to the BM regeneration of the graft is interesting. Particularly, the chimerism of the vasculature. One can assume that for the graft to undergo BM regeneration, there needs to be the delivery of nutrients into the graft via the vasculature. The chimerism of the vascular network suggests that host endothelial cells anastomose with the graft. Host mice should have their vascular system labeled with a dye such as dextran to determine if anastomosis has occurred. If not, the authors need to explain how this graft survives up to 5 months. If anastomosis does occur, then it is very surprising that the hematopoietic system of the graft is not a chimera because this would essentially be a parabiosis model. This needs to be explained.</p>
<p>Most of the data presented for the resistance of p-SSCs to stress suggests DNA damage response. Do p-SSCs demonstrate a higher ability to resolve DNA damage? Do they accumulate less DNA damage? Staining for DNA damage foci or performing comet assays could be done to further define the mechanism of stress resistance properties of p-SSCs.</p>
<p>Given the importance of BM-MSCs in hematopoiesis and that the majority of the emerging BM-MSCs appear to be derived from p-SSCs, the authors should perform experiments to determine if p-SSC-derived BM-MSCs are critical regulators of BM regeneration. For example, the authors could test this by crossing the Postn-creER mice with iDTR mice to ablate these cells and see if recovery is inhibited or delayed. This should be done with the described periosteum-wrapped femur graft model as well as a control BM regeneration model. Demonstrating that the deletion of these cells affects BM regeneration in both models would further justify the physiological relevance and utility of the femur graft model.</p>
