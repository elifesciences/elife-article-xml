<title>Abstract</title>
<p>How the intra-Golgi secretory transport works remains a mystery. The cisternal progression and the stable compartment models have been proposed and are under debate. Classic cisternal progression model posits that both the intra-Golgi transport and Golgi exit of secretory cargos should occur at a constant velocity dictated by the cisternal progression; furthermore, COPI-mediated intra-Golgi retrograde transport is essential for maintaining the Golgi organization. Leveraging our recently developed Golgi imaging tools in nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks, we found that the intra-Golgi transport velocity of a secretory cargo decreases during their transition from the <italic>cis</italic> to the <italic>trans</italic>-side of the Golgi, and different cargos exhibit distinct velocities even within the same cisternae. We observed a vast variation in the Golgi residence times of different cargos. Remarkably, truncation of the luminal domain causes the Golgi residence time of Tac — a standard transmembrane secretory cargo without intra-Golgi recycling signals — to extend from 16 min to a notable 3.4 h. Additionally, when COPI-mediated intra-Golgi retrograde transport was inhibited by brefeldin A, we found that nocodazole-induced Golgi can remain stacked for over 30 - 60 minutes. Therefore, our findings challenge the classical cisternal progression model and suggest the stable compartment nature of the Golgi.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In this revised version, we have conducted several new experiments and incorporated the results as follows:
1)We used a large secretory cargo, collagenX RUSH reporter, which forms aggregates of ∼190 copies, to study intra-Golgi transport. We found that collagenX transport kinetics follow a similar trend as conventional secretory cargos (e.g., CD59 and TNFα). Consistent with our previous findings, our side averaging indicated that collagenX localizes to the cisternal rim during Golgi transit, in contrast to conventional cargos, which occupy the cisternal interior.
2)Using 293T cells, we measured intra-Golgi transport kinetics of SBP-GFP-CD59 and SBP-GFP-Tac-TC, representing cargos with fast and slow transport velocities. The results are consistent with our observations in HeLa cells.
3)We quantified the physical sizes of the Golgi ministack and TGN during BFA treatment using side average imaging. We observed a reduction in Golgi axial size and TGN collapse under BFA treatment.
4)We obtained en face average images of GFP-CD8a-TC, confirming its localization in the cisternal interior, similar to GFP-Tac-TC.
5)We quantified the percentage of cells undergoing post-Golgi endocytic retrieval of MGAT2-GFP.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Golgi complex in mammalian cells plays a crucial role in membrane trafficking and post-translational modification of proteins and lipids (cargos). Centrally positioned around the microtubule organization center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Klumperman, 2011</xref>), it comprises laterally connected Golgi stacks, each containing 4 – 7 tightly adjacent membrane sacs known as cisternae. Conventionally, a Golgi stack is recognized to have three regions: the <italic>cis</italic>, medial, and <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi. The <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) assembles outside the <italic>trans</italic>-side of a Golgi stack and is mainly composed of tubular and vesicular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">De Matteis and Luini, 2008</xref>). In the secretory pathway, newly synthesized cargos exit the ER at the ER exit site (ERES), pass the ER and Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), and reach the Golgi. Cargos subsequently transit from the <italic>cis</italic>-side through the medial and eventually reach the <italic>trans</italic>-side of the Golgi, where they exit the Golgi and target the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bergmann and Singer, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Castle et al., 1972</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite decades of research, the Golgi remains one of the most enigmatic organelles, particularly regarding the mechanism of intra-Golgi transport of secretory cargos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Emr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>). Two primary intra-Golgi transport models have been proposed and are currently the subject of debate. In the classic cisternal progression or maturation model, secretory cargos passively reside within Golgi cisternae, which progress or mature from the <italic>cis</italic> to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi cisternae to facilitate the forward or anterograde transport of cargos. Simultaneously, post-translational modification enzymes such as glycosyltransferases move in reverse or retrograde transport, altering cisternal properties to become the next cisternae of the Golgi stack. Under this perspective, the Golgi functions at a dynamic equilibrium of anterograde and retrograde intra-Golgi transport. The model predicts that all secretory cargos should have the same and constant intra-Golgi transport and Golgi exit velocity. It can provide a plausible explanation for the intra-Golgi transition of oversized secretory cargos, such as procollagen I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mironov et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, direct observations of cisternal maturation have been made in budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kurokawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Losev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Matsuura-Tokita et al., 2006</xref>), although similar observation has not been reported in mammalian cells. However, the budding yeast Golgi differs significantly from the mammalian one in the cisternal organization – it scatters throughout the cytoplasm as unstacked compartments. This substantial difference casts doubt on the general applicability of the budding yeast Golgi observation to higher eukaryotes.</p>
<p>In contrast, the stable compartment model posits that Golgi cisternae are stable entities. During intra-Golgi transport, carriers actively move secretory cargos from one cisterna or compartment to the next, from the <italic>cis</italic> to the <italic>trans</italic>-side, while post-translational modification enzymes remain stationary. At the <italic>trans</italic>-side of the Golgi, cargos are sorted into carriers bound for the plasma membrane. As a result, different cargos can exhibit distinct intra-Golgi transport and Golgi exit velocities under this model. To account for the intra-Golgi transport of oversized secretory cargos, such as procollagen I, a modified version of the stable compartment model, the rim progression model, has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lavieu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pfeffer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Volchuk et al., 2000</xref>). In this model, each Golgi cisterna seems to have a stable interior domain and a dynamic rim domain; the rim domain of Golgi cisternae undergoes constant en bloc fission and fusion, carrying small or large cargos to the next cisternae for intra-Golgi cargo transport. The rim partitioning of large secretory cargos is supported with previous EM studies of procollagen I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>), FM4 aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lavieu et al., 2013</xref>), and algal protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Engel et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated in fluorescence microscopy that during their intra-Golgi transition, small cargos, such as CD59, E-cadherin, and VSVG, localize to the cisternal interior, coinciding with Golgi glycosyltransferases, while large cargos, such as FM4 aggregates and collagenX, position themselves at the cisternal rim, where trafficking machinery components localize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tie et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Once secretory cargos transit the Golgi stack, they reach the <italic>trans</italic>-side of the Golgi and are packed into carriers destined for the plasma membrane. The classic cisternal progression model posits that secretory cargos linearly depart the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi. Contrary to this, cargo exit kinetics have been shown to adhere to a first-order exponential relationship rather than a linear one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). In an attempt to reconcile these observations, Patterson <italic>et al</italic>. introduced the rapid partitioning model, which stands distinct from the classic cisternal progression and stable compartment models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>). This model suggests that cargos rapidly diffuse throughout the Golgi stack, segregating into multiple post-translational processing and export domains, where cargos are packed into carriers bound for the plasma membrane. Nonetheless, synchronized traffic waves have been observed through various techniques, including electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>) and advanced light microscopy methods we developed, such as GLIM and side-averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tie et al., 2022</xref>). These findings suggest that the rapid partitioning model might not accurately represent the true nature of the intra-Golgi transport.</p>
<p>The ongoing debate among these models underscores the complexity of the Golgi and reflects the insufficiency of the existing experimental data, especially the intra-Golgi transport kinetics data. Two semi-quantitative approaches exist for studying the intra-Golgi transport kinetics of ER-synchronized secretory cargos. The first is the biochemical approach, where intra-Golgi transport kinetics can be indirectly deduced by subtracting ER-to-Golgi and Golgi-to-plasma membrane transport from the overall secretion (ER-to-plasma membrane transport) during the chase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ernst et al., 2018</xref>). However, this indirect approach provides only an averaged intra-Golgi transport kinetics, making it incapable of measuring the instantaneous intra-Golgi transport velocity at a sub-Golgi region. The second approach involves EM imaging of immuno-gold labeled secretory cargos at Golgi cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beznoussenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). The distribution of gold particles among individual Golgi cisternae during the chase directly indicates intra-Golgi transport kinetics. Nevertheless, this approach demands specialized techniques and equipment and considerable manual work in EM imaging and subsequent image examination, limiting its widespread use in other labs.</p>
<p>The limitations in current approaches call for novel methods, especially ones based on fluorescence microscopy, to resolve the intra-Golgi transport spatially and kinetically. However, optically resolving the intra-Golgi secretory transport in mammalian cells is challenging due to the thinness (200 – 400 nm) and random orientation of Golgi stacks. To overcome this, we leverage the uniform and rotationally symmetrical arrangement of nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks (hereafter referred to as Golgi ministacks). Extensive studies have provided strong evidence that ministacks obtained under prolonged nocodazole treatment (≥ 3 h), the condition employed in our studies, largely represent the native Golgi stack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cole et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fourriere et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rogalski et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schueder et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Van De Moortele et al., 1993</xref>). We developed a numerical Golgi localization tool called Golgi localization by imaging centers of mass (GLIM) that can precisely pinpoint a Golgi protein’s cisternal localization with nanometer accuracy in Golgi ministacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tie et al., 2016</xref>). Alongside this, we propose using the metric of Golgi residence time to quantify a Golgi protein’s retention in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we utilized past and newly acquired GLIM and Golgi residence time data to quantitatively analyze intra-Golgi transport and Golgi exit kinetics. Our data revealed that neither intra-Golgi transport nor Golgi exit exhibits a constant velocity. We discovered that when the luminal domain of Tac — a conventional transmembrane secretory cargo lacking intra-Golgi recycling signals — is truncated, its Golgi residence time increases from 16 min to a substantial 3.4 h. Through GLIM, we examined the cisternal organization of Golgi ministacks under brefeldin A (BFA) treatment, which halts retrograde intra-Golgi transport. Remarkably, under this condition, we found that nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks can remain stacked for 30 - 60 min. Therefore, our findings underscore the stable compartment nature of Golgi cisternae. They challenge the classical cisternal progression model and favor the stable compartment model.</p>

<title>The intra-Golgi transport is not a motion with constant velocity</title>
<p>The classic cisternal progression model postulates that the intra-Golgi transport velocity of a secretory cargo should remain constant. However, this prediction has not been directly tested due to the inherent challenge of measuring the intra-Golgi transport velocity. The advent of GLIM has allowed us to address this issue. In GLIM, briefly, HeLa cells expressing the RUSH secretory cargo (RUSH reporter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>) and GalT-mCherry, a <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi marker containing amino acids 1-81 of B4GALT1, were initially treated with nocodazole. Subsequently, cells were chased in biotin with nocodazole and cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) for various lengths of time (<italic>t</italic>) before immunofluorescence labeling for endogenous GM130, a <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker. Additionally, apart from SBP-GFP, a soluble secretory protein, and SBP-GFP-CD59 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tie et al., 2016</xref>), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, all RUSH reporters in this study are transmembrane proteins, including TNFα-SBP-GFP, TfR-SBP-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), SBP-GFP-CD8a-furin-WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tie et al., 2016</xref>), SBP-GFP-CD8a-furin-YA, SBP-GFP-CD8a-furin-AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tie et al., 2016</xref>), SBP-GFP-CD8a-furin-Y+AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tie et al., 2016</xref>), SBP-GFP-Tac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), SBP-GFP-Tac-TC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), and SBP-GFP-E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>). Except for TNFα-SBP-GFP, which uses Ii-streptavidin as the ER hook, all RUSH reporters employ signal sequence fused streptavidin-KDEL as their ER hook (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We calculated centers of mass as the positions of GM130, RUSH reporter, and GalT-mCherry within each analyzable Golgi ministack. The RUSH reporter’s Golgi localization quotient, or <italic>LQ</italic>, is calculated by dividing its distance from GM130 by GalT-mCherry’s distance from GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1 A-G</xref>). The <italic>LQ</italic> is a linear numerical metric to indicate a cargo’s axial localization within the Golgi, with a nanometer range of precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tie et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>To analyze the intra-Golgi transport kinetics of secretory cargos, we measured the <italic>LQ</italic>s of RUSH reporters after various durations of biotin administration (chase). Most kinetic data was previously reported in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tie et al., 2016</xref>) and re-analyzed here. Additionally, we generated new data and replicated specific measurements. GLIM involves laborious manual image analysis. To increase image analysis efficiency, we developed a software tool, Auto-GLIM, to automatically analyze ministack images and calculate <italic>LQ</italic>s by using a deep learning algorithm (the manuscript will be published elsewhere). We found that Auto-GLIM can produce <italic>LQ</italic>s similar to the conventional manual analysis method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Fig. 1 H-M</xref>) but requires much less user interaction, therefore increasing our image analysis efficiency.

<title>The intra-Golgi transport kinetics of collagenX, a cisternal rim partitioned secretory cargo, resemble those of conventional cargos</title>
<p>CollagenX has been known to assemble into oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kwan et al., 1991</xref>). We previously reported that the collagenX RUSH reporter, SBP-GFP-collagenX, forms large aggregates containing ∼ 190 copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tie et al., 2018</xref>). With an estimated mean size of ∼ 40 nm, these aggregates are much smaller than FM4 aggregates and procollagen I (&gt; 300 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonfanti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Volchuk et al., 2000</xref>) and, therefore, are not excluded from conventional transport vesicles, which typically have a size of 50 – 100 nm. However, our previous findings showed that while conventional secretory cargos partition to the cisternal interior during intra-Golgi transport, large cargos such as FM4 aggregates and collagenX preferentially localize to the cisternal rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tie et al., 2018</xref>), highlighting distinct intra-Golgi transport behavior for different cargo sizes. Hence, we asked if collagenX follows the same intra-Golgi transport kinetics as conventional secretory cargos.</p>

<title>Golgi residence times vary significantly among different secretory cargos</title>
<p>Once cargos transit through the Golgi stack, the classic cisternal progression model predicts that cargos depart the Golgi in a linear kinetics. However, studies have demonstrated that cargos exit the Golgi by following the first-order exponential kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patterson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). While we could apply a hypothetical rate-limiting step to the classic cisternal progression and stable compartment models to rationalize the exponential kinetics of cargo exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Luini, 2011</xref>), the classic cisternal progression model encounters more significant challenges. Firstly, the first-order exponential Golgi exit implies that clearing a synchronized wave of secretory cargo from the <italic>trans</italic>-cisternae would take an indefinite time, which is inconsistent with the transient nature of the <italic>trans</italic>-cisternae as described by the classic cisternal progression model. Secondly, since cargos are considered passive in the classic cisternal progression model, the exit kinetics, as measured by the Golgi residence times, should be the same across all secretory cargos.</p>
<p>The Golgi residence time is a cargo’s duration at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi cisternae before exit and is a metric for Golgi retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). The first step to determine this metric involves synchronizing a transmembrane protein at the Golgi. For Golgi transmembrane resident proteins like glycosyltransferases and secretory transmembrane proteins with a substantial Golgi localization at the steady state, such as GFP-Tac-TC, synchronization is not required. However, for secretory transmembrane cargos lacking a significant Golgi pool at the steady state, such as TfR-GFP, GFP-Tac, and RUSH reporters like TNFα-SBP-GFP, synchronization is achieved through a 20°C temperature block. Subsequently, live imaging at 37 °C is performed to capture the Golgi fluorescence intensity decay of the protein in the presence of cycloheximide. The Golgi residence time is calculated as the half-time (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) by fitting the intensity decay to a first-order exponential function.</p>
<p>Our extensive measurement demonstrated that Golgi residence times of secretory cargos display a wide range of values (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For example, TNFα-SBP-GFP has a Golgi residence time of 6.0 ± 0.4 min (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 73), one of the shortest, while SBP-GFP-CD59 has a Golgi residence time of 16 ± 2 min (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 29) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>). Hence, our data suggest that different secretory cargos reside at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi cisternae for varying durations, contradicting predictions from the classic cisternal progression model.</p>

<title>Cargos exhibiting prolonged Golgi residence times suggest the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi interior might be a stable domain</title>
<p>The classic cisternal progression model could be modified to explain the diverse intra-Golgi transport kinetics. For example, accelerated anterograde or retrograde transport might be introduced on top of the basal cisternal progression to account for the wide range of intra-Golgi transport velocities and Golgi residence times we observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Accelerated anterograde transport mechanisms might include continuity-based direct diffusion across cisternae via heterologous cisternal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beznoussenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marsh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, secretory cargo with such a mechanism would have a faster intra-Golgi transport velocity. This mechanism might explain the rapid and diverse intra-Golgi transport velocity of secretory cargos such as VSVG, insulin, albumin, and alpha1-antitrypsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beznoussenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marsh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, active recruitment to exocytic carriers budding at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi possibly might shorten the Golgi residence time. On the other hand, COPI-coated carriers might facilitate retrograde intra-Golgi transport to counter the cisternal progression, accounting for the slow intra-Golgi transport velocity and prolonged Golgi residence time of cargos. Indeed, COPI has been known to maintain certain glycosyltransferases’ Golgi retention by direct or indirect interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eckert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pereira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rizzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schmitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tu et al., 2008</xref>). However, such a retrograde mechanism requires the interaction between secretory cargo and the COPI coat.</p>
<p>Earlier, we identified truncation mutants of two typical secretory cargos, GFP-Tac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>) and GFP-CD8a, which reside in the Golgi nearly as stably as Golgi glycosyltransferases. GFP-Tac and GFP-CD8a are type I transmembrane proteins comprising from their N- to C-termini a signal sequence, GFP, luminal domain, transmembrane domain (TMD), and cytosolic tail (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Previously, we and others demonstrated that fully glycosylated luminal domain can function as a Golgi exit signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gut et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).

<p>The following evidence suggests that GFP-Tac-TC and GFP-CD8a-TC behave like bona fide Golgi resident transmembrane proteins. Firstly, their Golgi residence times, 3.4 h and 66 min, are comparable to that of a typical Golgi glycosyltransferase, such as ST6GAL1 (5.3 ± 0.6 h, mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Second, their <italic>LQ</italic>s, 0.94 ± 0.02 (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 118) and 0.86 ± 0.05 (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 76), combined with their cisternal interior localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), indicate that they primarily reside within the interior of the <italic>trans</italic>-cisternae, similar to many Golgi glycosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tie et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, GFP-Tac-TC follows GalT-mCherry to localize to the ER under the BFA treatment reversibly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the modified cisternal progression model above, GFP-Tac-Tc could have an active retrieval mechanism mediated by an unidentified signal in its cytosolic tail or TMD to counter the cisternal progression. Considering that GFP-Tac-TC’s <italic>LQ</italic> (0.94) is close to its Golgi exit site, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> (0.95 – 1.16) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2M-O</xref>), measured by its RUSH version, there are two possible retrieval pathways, acting at either post-Golgi or intra-Golgi stages. To test if GFP-Tac-Tc possesses a Golgi retrieval pathway after its Golgi exit, we incubated HeLa cells transiently expressing MGAT1-GFP (negative control) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), MGAT2-GFP (positive control) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), GFP-Tac, or GFP-Tac-TC with a recombinant mCherry-fused anti-GFP nanobody (VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry) continuously for 8 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). By binding to the cell surface-exposed GFP, VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry serves as a sensitive probe to track the endocytic trafficking itinerary of the above GFP-fused transmembrane proteins.</p>
<p>We found that VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry localized to the Golgi in a significant fraction of MAGT2-GFP-expressing cells (32%, <italic>n</italic> = 266) but not in MGAT1-GFP cells (0%, <italic>n</italic> = 102) after 8 h continuous internalization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). This result is consistent with our previous report that MGAT2, but not MAGT1, has a Golgi retrieval mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2021</xref>), although its molecular mechanism is still unknown. In contrast, VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry did not localize to the Golgi in cells expressing other constructs, including GFP-Tac-TC, suggesting that GFP-Tac-TC might not possess a post-Golgi retrieval mechanism targeting the Golgi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Next, we reason that given GFP-Tac’s short Golgi residence time (16 min), its cytosolic tail and TMD might not facilitate any active intra-Golgi retrograde transport mechanism, such as COPI coat binding, to recycle GFP-Tac-TC from Golgi exiting. Since GFP-Tac and GFP-Tac-TC share identical TMD and cytosolic tail sequences, if such a retrograde mechanism existed, GFP-Tac would have a similar Golgi residence time to GFP-Tac-TC. The same observation and reasoning also apply to GFP-CD8a-TC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, we argue that GFP-Tac-TC and GFP-CD8a-TC might not have retrieval signals to facilitate their Golgi residence, although proving a protein does not possess a transport signal is challenging. Since the cisternal interior is continuous with the cisternal rim both in membrane and lumen, our findings suggest that the cisternal interior at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi might be a stable domain. In summary, our data implies that retention within the <italic>trans</italic>-side stable domain, rather than continuous retrieval to counter the cisternal progression (treadmilling), could be the primary mechanism for the long Golgi residence times of GFP-Tac-TC and GFP-CD8a-TC.</p>

<title>The Golgi maintains its stacked organization after 30 min BFA treatment</title>
<p>COPI functions in the retrograde direction at the ER-Golgi interface and within the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Glick and Luini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Popoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rabouille and Klumperman, 2005</xref>). According to the classic cisternal progression model, COPI-mediated retrograde intra-Golgi transport recycles resident transmembrane proteins, such as glycosyltransferases and transport machinery components. This model predicts that upon the compromise of COPI, intra-Golgi recycling would stop, and the Golgi stack would continuously lose its materials and eventually disappear, depending on the cisternal progression rate. In addition to its retrograde role, COPI has also been documented to function in the anterograde ER-to-Golgi transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Monetta et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Weigel et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the role of COPI in the Golgi organization, we employed BFA, a small molecule fungal metabolite that rapidly dissociates COPI and clathrin from the Golgi, inhibits the ER-to-Golgi trafficking, and causes the fusion of the Golgi with the ER in 10 - 20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Klausner et al., 1992</xref>). It does so by rapidly inactivating class I ARFs, which recruit COPI and clathrin coats to the Golgi membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Donaldson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Helms and Rothman, 1992</xref>). In contrast to the native Golgi, nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks have been documented to be more resistant to BFA, and, hence, the disappearance of Golgi occurs at a much later time (&gt; 30 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1990</xref>). However, it is unclear if the nocodazole-induced Golgi maintains a similar stacked organization under the BFA treatment.</p>
<p>To address this, we studied the <italic>LQ</italic>s of several Golgi markers following 30 – 60 min of BFA treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. 5A,B</xref>). The fast dissociation of Arf1-GFP from Golgi ministacks confirmed the effectiveness of BFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). We also observed that extended BFA treatment considerably reduced the number of intact Golgi ministacks. We measured the <italic>LQ</italic>s of six transmembrane Golgi markers, GFP-golgin-84, GS15, ST6GAL1-GFP, TGN46, CD8a-furin, and CD8a-CI-M6PR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). GS15’s <italic>LQ</italic> was monitored for 60 min, with the rest for 30 min. Strikingly, we observed that Golgi puncta are still stacked as all measured <italic>LQ</italic>s exhibited a relative arrangement similar to those of the pre-BFA treatment (<italic>t</italic> = 0 min) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). For example, <italic>LQ</italic>s of ST6GAL1 and GS15 remained largely unchanged after 30 min BFA treatment. Although the <italic>LQ</italic> of golgin-84 increased from 0.2 to 0.4, it still remained between the <italic>LQ</italic>s of GM130 and GS15. The stacked organization of BFA-treated ministacks was further confirmed by the side-averaging images of GM130, Giantin, GalT-mCherry, and CD8a-furin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G,H</xref>).</p>

<p>However, BFA treatment altered the physical dimensions of ministacks. We defined the distance between two Golgi markers as the distance between their Gaussian peak centers in the axial line intensity profile (see the Materials and Methods). We observed the distance from GM130 to GalT-mCherry, <italic>d</italic><sub>(GM130-GalT-mCherry)</sub>, decreased from 300 ± 10 nm (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 34) to 190 ± 30 (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 13) after 30 min of BFA treatment, indicating axial shrinkage of ministacks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>LQ</italic>s of all three TGN markers, TGN46, CD8a-furin, and CD8a-CI-M6PR, decreased and approached that of the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi, suggesting a collapse of the TGN (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), possibly due to the dissociation of clathrin and its adaptor proteins. This collapse of the TGN was further supported by the side-averaging images, in which CD8a-furin gradually approached the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi labeled by GalT-mCherry over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). We found the distance from GalT-mCherry to CD8a-furin, <italic>d</italic><sub>(GalT-mCherry-CD8a-furin)</sub>, decreased from 200 ± 20 nm (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 30) to 100 ± 30 nm (mean ± SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 20) after 30 min of BFA treatment.</p>
<p>Despite dramatic changes in the TGN and shrinkage of the axial length of the Golgi minitack, our data demonstrate that the Golgi maintains its stacked organization for at least 30 – 60 min, even in the absence of COPI-mediated intra-Golgi retrograde transport. Our findings suggest that the Golgi might not be a dynamic equilibrium between the cisternal progression and retrograde trafficking and argue for a by-default stable nature of the Golgi stack. It is worth noting that the cellular effect of BFA is complex and pleiotropic. For example, in addition to Arfs, it can inhibit lipid metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">De Matteis et al., 1994</xref>). So, the disassociation of COPI might not be the sole factor responsible for our observations.</p>

<title>Our data supports the rim progression model, a modified version of the stable compartment model</title>
<p>Previously, we discovered that Golgi glycosyltransferases tend to localize to the cisternal interior, while trafficking machinery components localize primarily to the cisternal rim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tie et al., 2018</xref>). Combined with our current observations of differential intra-Golgi transport velocities among distinct secretory cargos (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>) and the stable <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi interior localization of GFP-Tac-TC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sun et al., 2020</xref>) and GFP-CD8a-TC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), these findings support the modified version of the stable compartment model – the rim progression model. This model explains the retention of Golgi glycosyltransferases in the cisternal interior, given that many do not recycle via COPI-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) or possess a post-Golgi retrieval pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). It also readily accounts for the diverse intra-Golgi transport velocities of secretory cargos by suggesting that each cargo type may have a different retention time within the stable cisternal interior domain.</p>
<p>The Golgi glycosyltransferases at the cisternal interior might assemble a dense protein matrix based on fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tie et al., 2018</xref>) and EM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Engel et al., 2015</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the enzyme matrix could provide the molecular basis for the stable cisternal interior domain and functionally mirror a gel-filtration chromatography matrix with a defined porosity. Hence, large secretory cargos, such as FM4 aggregates and collagenX, are excluded from the interior, where the enzyme matrix localizes, while small secretory cargos can enter and become kinetically trapped there. The progressive reduction in intra-Golgi transport of secretory cargo might result from the enzyme matrix’s retention at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi. As the secretory cargos progress along the Golgi stack from the <italic>cis</italic> to the <italic>trans</italic>-side, more and more cargos become temporarily retained in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi region, gradually reducing their overall intra-Golgi transport velocity. If the release or Golgi exit of these cargos from the enzyme matrix follows a constant probability per unit time, i.e., a first-order kinetics process, the rate of cargo exiting from the Golgi should follow the first-order exponential function. Since the mechanism underlying intra-Golgi transport kinetics reflects fundamental molecular and cellular processes of the Golgi, further experimental data are essential to rigorously test this hypothesis.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>We introduced new quantitative data on the intra-Golgi transport dynamics. However, our study has limitations. First, our approach relied on the overexpression of fluorescence protein-tagged cargos. The synchronized release of a large amount of cargo could significantly saturate and skew the intra-Golgi transport. Second, we utilized nocodazole-induced ministacks instead of the native Golgi to analyze the intra-Golgi transport, which could raise concerns about the impact of depolymerizing microtubules on the intra-Golgi transport and Golgi organization. Third, with the exception of furin and its mutants, all RUSH reporters used in this study are constitutive secretory cargos. As a result, the intra-Golgi transport dynamics observed here might not reflect those of regulated secretion, which involves the synchronized release of a large quantity of cargo in response to a specific signal.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that the Golgi cisternal interior might be a stable domain, therefore supporting a modified version of the stable compartment model, the rim progression model. However, we do not think our data alone can resolve the two models, which have been the subject of debate for several decades. Further refinement of the classic cisternal progression model might also account for our data. We anticipate further development using our approach will provide more systematic data to test and refine future intra-Golgi transport models. Moreover, we hope that our study will stimulate further research into this longstanding and intriguing question.</p>

Ministacks with en face views were identified by giantin rings. They were subsequently normalized, expanded, and aligned with the center of the image, followed by averaging using Fiji. The radial mean intensity profile was acquired by Fiji macros (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tie et al., 2018</xref>). Ministacks with side views were identified by giantin double puncta and subjected to rotation, expansion, and normalization before averaging in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tie et al., 2022</xref>). In a side average image, we define the axial position of a Golgi protein <italic>i</italic> as the <italic>y</italic> component of its center of mass coordinate, <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic>. In <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <italic>LQ</italic><sup>side</sup> of SBP-GFP-collagenX is calculated as below.

<italic>y</italic><sub>SBP-GFP-collagenX</sub><italic>, y</italic><sub>GM130</sub>, and <italic>y</italic><sub>GalT-mCherry</sub> are axial positions of SBP-GFP-collagenX, GM130, and GalT-mCherry in their side average images, respectively. <italic>y</italic><sub>GM130</sub>, and <italic>y</italic><sub>GalT-mCherry</sub> were measured previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tie et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, the distance from GM130 to GalT-mCherry, <italic>d</italic><sub>(GM130-GalT-mCherry)</sub>, was measured from individual ministacks with side views. The axial line intensity profile of GM130 or GalT-mCherry was subjected to Gaussian fitting in OriginPro2020 (Analysis&gt;Fitting&gt;Non-Linear Curve Fit). The calculated <italic>Xc</italic> represents the axial position of each protein. <italic>d</italic><sub>(GM130-GalT-mCherry)</sub> of each Golgi ministack is then calculated as

<caption><title>GLIM and the Auto-GLIM tool.</title>
<p>(A) A diagram that illustrates the principle behind GLIM. In the Golgi ministack, three proteins, GM130 (endogenous, <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker), GalT-mCherry (transfected, <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi marker), and protein X (transfected or endogenous, Golgi protein of interest) are fluorescently labeled. The centers of fluorescence mass (centers) of the three proteins can be calculated. The Golgi axis is defined as the vector from the center of GM130 to that of GalT-mCherry. The distance from the center of GM130 to that of GalT-mCherry is denoted as <italic>d</italic>1, while the distance from the center of GM130 to that of protein X is <italic>d</italic>x. The <italic>LQ</italic> is then calculated as <italic>d</italic><sub>x</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub>. (B-E) An example that illustrates the study of intra-Golgi transport kinetics using the RUSH reporter (SBP-GFP-Tac) and GLIM. HeLa cells co-expressing SBP-GFP-Tac and GalT-mCherry were treated with nocodazole for 3 h, followed by a biotin chase for various durations. Cells were then immunostained for endogenous GM130 and imaged using wide-field microscopy (B). Scale bar, 10 µm. The image acquired after 20 min biotin chase was selected to demonstrate the image processing for GLIM. The background-subtracted image is displayed in binary intensity to enhance the visualization of ministacks with varying intensities (C). Analyzable ministacks (outlined by yellow contours) were manually selected after intensity thresholding (D). A gallery of 31 analyzable ministacks from (D) and the corresponding <italic>LQ</italic> histogram (<italic>n</italic> = 1 cell) are shown in (E) and (F), respectively. The <italic>LQ</italic> histogram of <italic>n</italic> = 8 cells is shown in (G). (H-M) Assessing the Auto-GLIM tool. HeLa cells co-expressing GalT-mCherry and SBP-GFP-Tac-TC were treated with nocodzole for 3 h, fixed, and immunostained for endogenous GM130. The image in (H) was acquired by wide-field microscopy. It is subjected to the Auto-GLIM tool with a frame of 72 × 72 pixels to detect the cell contour (marked by the yellow line) (I), conduct background-subtraction (J), and select analyzable Golgi ministacks (marked by yellow lines) (K). Scale bar, 10 µm. The resulting histogram of <italic>LQ</italic>s is shown in (L). We also acquired <italic>LQ</italic>s using the conventional manual method (M), demonstrating strong agreement between the two approaches.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Acquiring Golgi residence times of SBP-GFP-CD59 and GFP-CD8a-TC.</title>
<p>(A) HeLa cells were transiently transfected to co-express RUSH reporter, SBP-GFP-CD59, and GalT-mCherry. Cells were incubated with biotin and cycloheximide at 20 °C to accumulate the RUSH reporter in the Golgi before live-cell imaging under a wide-field microscope at 37 °C. Only SBP-GFP-CD59 images are shown. (B) HeLa cells transiently co-expressing GFP-CD8a-TC and GalT-mCherry were treated with cycloheximide and imaged live under a wide-field microscope. Only GFP-CD8a-TC images are shown. In both (A) and (B), the total fluorescence intensity within the Golgi was quantified, normalized, and plotted against the time. Each intensity series was fitted to the first-order exponential function to calculate <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>.

<caption><title>The effect of BFA treatment on Golgi markers.</title>
<p>(A) Arf1 quickly dissociates from the Golgi under the treatment of nocodazole and BFA. HeLa cells transiently expressing Arf1-GFP and ST6GAL1-DMyc were treated with nocodazole for 3 h. This was followed by additional treatment with nocodazole and 5 µM BFA for 5 min before fixation and immunostaining of Myc-tag and endogenous giantin. Images were acquired by Airyscan microscopy. (B) HeLa cells transiently expressing GalT-mCherry were treated with nocodazole for 3 h. This was followed by additional treatment with nocodazole and 5 µM BFA for variable durations before fixation and immunostaining endogenous GS15 and GM130. Images were acquired by spinning disk confocal microscopy. Representative images at 0 and 60 min are shown. Scale bar, 10 µm.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study offers <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that intra-Golgi transport slows from cis to trans and varies between cargos even within the same cisternae, supporting a more stable compartment model. Using nocodazole-induced ministacks, the authors show cargo-specific transport kinetics with distinct velocities and residence times. These findings refine the cisternal progression model and prompt further investigation into alternative mechanisms, such as rapid partitioning or rim progression. This study will be of interest to cell biologists studying membrane trafficking, Golgi organization, and protein secretion, as well as researchers investigating the mechanisms of organelle dynamics and the molecular basis of intracellular transport.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the manuscript by Tie et.al., the authors couple the methodology which they have developed to measure LQ (localization quotient) of proteins within the Golgi apparatus along with RUSH based cargo release to quantify the speed of different cargos traveling through Golgi stacks in nocodazole induced Golgi ministacks to differentiate between cisternal progression vs stable compartment model of the Golgi apparatus. The debate between cisternal progression model and stable compartment model has been intense and going on for decades and important to understand the basic way of function/organization of the Golgi apparatus. As per the stable compartment model, cisterna are stable structures, and cargo moves along the Golgi apparatus in vesicular carriers. While as per cisternal progression model, Golgi cisterna themselves mature acquiring new identity from the cis face to the trans face and act as transport carriers themselves. In this work, authors provide a missing part regarding intra-Golgi speed for transport of different cargoes as well as the speed of TGN exit and based on the differences in the transport velocities for different cargoes tested favor a stable compartment model. The argument which authors make is that if there is cisternal progression, all the cargoes should have a similar intra-Golgi transport speed which is essentially the rate at which the Golgi cisterna mature. Furthermore, using a combination of BFA and Nocodazole treatments authors show that the compartments remain stable in cells for at least 30-60 minutes after BFA treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The method to accurately measure localization of a protein within the Golgi stack is rigorously tested in the previous publications from the same authors and in combination with pulse chase approaches has been used to quantify transport velocities of cargoes through the Golgi. This is a novel aspect in this paper and differences in intra-Golgi velocities for different cargoes tested makes a case for a stable compartment model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript describes the use of quantitative imaging approaches, that have been a key element of the labs work over the past years, to address one of the major unresolved discussions in trafficking: intra-Golgi transport. The approach used has been clearly described in the labs previous papers, and is thus clearly described. The authors clearly address the weaknesses in this manuscript, and do not overstate the conclusions drawn from the data. The only weakness not addressed is the concept of blocking COPI transport with BFA, which is a strong inhibitor and causes general disruption of the system. This is an interesting element of the paper, which I think could be improved upon by using more specific COPI inhibitors instead, although I understand that this is not necessarily straightforward.</p>
<p>I commend the authors on their clear and precise presentation of this body of work, incorporating mathematical modelling with a fundamental question in cell biology. In all, I think that this is a very robust body of work, that provides a sound conclusion in support of the stable compartment model for the Golgi.</p>
<p>General points:</p>
<p>
The manuscript contains a lot of background in its results sections, and the authors may wish to consider rebalancing the text: The section beginning at Line 175 is about 90% background and 10% data. Could some data currently in supplementary be included here to redress this balance, or this part combined with another?</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>
Equation 2: A should be in front of the ln2. It's already resolved in equation 3, so likely only needs changing in the text</p>
<p>Line 152: Why is there a lack of experimental data? High ER background and low golgi signal make it difficult to select ministacks: would be good to see examples of these images. Is 0 a relevant timepoint as cargo is still at the ER? Instead would a timepoint &lt;5' be better demonstrate initial arrival in fast cargo, and 0' discarded?</p>
<p>Table 1 Line 474: 1-3 independent replicates: is there a better way of incorporating this into the table to make it more streamlined? It would be useful to see each cargo as a mean with error. Is there a more demonstrative way to present the table, for example (but does not have to be) fastest cargo first (Tintra) as in Table 2?</p>
<p>Line 264 / Fig 3B: It's unclear to me why the VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry internalisation approach was used, when the cells were expressing GFP, that could be used for imaging. Also, this introduces a question over trafficking of the VHH itself, to access the same compartments as the GFP-proteins are localised. It would be useful to describe the choice of this approach briefly in the text.</p>

<p>Post-Revision</p>
<p>I thank the authors for their work revising the paper in light of our comments. I am satisfied with their response, and I have no other comments.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Tie et al. provides a quantitative assessment of intra-Golgi transport of diverse cargos. Quantitative approaches using fluorescence microscopy of RUSH synchronized cargos, namely GLIM and measurement of Golgi residence time, previously developed by the author's team (publications from 20216 to 2022), are being used here.</p>
<p>Most of the results have been already published by the same team in 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2021. In this manuscript, the authors have put together measurement of intra-Golgi transport kinetics and Golgi residence time of many cargos. The quantitative results are supported by a large number of Golgi mini-stacks/cells analyzed. They are discussed with regard to the intra-Golgi transport models being debated in the field, namely the cisternal maturation/progression model and the stable compartments model.</p>
<p>The authors show that different cargos have distinct intra-Golgi transport kinetics and that the Golgi residence time of glycosyltransferases is high. From this and experiment using brefeldinA, the authors suggest that the rim progression model, adapted from the stable compartments model, fits with their experimental data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The major strength of this manuscript is to put together many quantitative results that the authors previously obtained and to discuss them to advance our understanding of the intra-Golgi transport mechanisms.</p>
<p>
The analysis by fluorescence microscopy of intra-Golgi transport is tough and this is a tour de force of the authors even though their approach shows limitations, which are clearly stated. Their work is remarkable in regards of the numbers of Golgi markers and secretory cargos which have been analyzed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Most of the data provided here were already published and thus accessible for the community.

<p>The use of nocodazole might affect cellular homeostasis but this is clearly stated by the authors and is acceptable as we need to perturb the system to conduct this analysis.</p>
<p>The manual selection of the Golgi mini-stack being analyzed (where the cargo and the Golgi reference markers are clearly detectable ) might introduce a bias in the analysis.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript by Tie et.al., the authors couple the methodology which they have developed to measure LQ (localization quotient) of proteins within the Golgi apparatus along with RUSH based cargo release to quantify the speed of different cargos traveling through Golgi stacks in nocodazole induced Golgi ministacks to differentiate between cisternal progression vs stable compartment model of the Golgi apparatus. The debate between cisternal progression model and stable compartment model has been intense and going on for decades and important to understand the basic way of function/organization of the Golgi apparatus. As per the stable compartment model, cisterna are stable structures and cargo moves along the Golgi apparatus in vesicular carriers. While as per cisternal progression model, Golgi cisterna themselves mature acquiring new identity from the cis face to the trans face and act as transport carriers themselves. In this work, authors provide a missing part regarding intra-Golgi speed for transport of different cargoes as well as the speed of TGN exit and based on the differences in the transport velocities for different cargoes tested favor a stable compartment model. The argument which authors make is that if there is cisternal progression, all the cargoes should have a similar intra-Golgi transport speed which is essentially the rate at which the Golgi cisterna mature. Furthermore, using a combination of BFA and Nocodazole treatments authors show that the compartments remain stable in cells for at least 30-60 minutes after BFA treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The method to accurately measure localization of a protein within the Golgi stack is rigorously tested in the previous publications from the same authors and in combination with pulse chase approaches has been used to quantify transport velocities of cargoes through the Golgi. This is a novel aspect in this paper and differences in intra-Golgi velocities for different cargoes tested makes a case for a stable compartment model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Experiments are only tested in one cell line (HeLa cells) and predominantly derived from experimental paradigm using RUSH assays where a secretory cargo is released in a wave (not the most physiological condition) and therefore additional approaches would make a more compelling case for the model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the use of quantitative imaging approaches, which have been a key element of the labs work over the past years, to address one of the major unresolved discussions in trafficking: intra-Golgi transport. The approach used has been clearly described in the labs previous papers, and is thus clearly described. The authors clearly address the weaknesses in this manuscript and do not overstate the conclusions drawn from the data. The only weakness not addressed is the concept of blocking COPI transport with BFA, which is a strong inhibitor and causes general disruption of the system. This is an interesting element of the paper, which I think could be improved upon by using more specific COPI inhibitors instead, although I understand that this is not necessarily straightforward.</p>
<p>I commend the authors on their clear and precise presentation of this body of work, incorporating mathematical modelling with a fundamental question in cell biology. In all, I think that this is a very robust body of work, that provides a sound conclusion in support of the stable compartment model for the Golgi.</p>
<p>General points:</p>
<p>The manuscript contains a lot of background in its results sections, and the authors may wish to consider rebalancing the text: The section beginning at Line 175 is about 90% background and 10% data. Could some data currently in supplementary be included here to redress this balance, or this part combined with another?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revamped manuscript, we have moved the background information on rapid partitioning and rim progression models to the Introduction.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript by Tie et al. provides a quantitative assessment of intra-Golgi transport of diverse cargos. Quantitative approaches using fluorescence microscopy of RUSH synchronized cargos, namely GLIM and measurement of Golgi residence time, previously developed by the author's team (publications from 20216 to 2022), are being used here.</p>
<p>Most of the results have been already published by the same team in 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2021. In this manuscript, very few new data have been added. The authors have put together measurements of intra-Golgi transport kinetics and Golgi residence time of many cargos. The quantitative results are supported by a large number of Golgi mini-stacks/cells analyzed. They are discussed with regard to the intra-Golgi transport models being debated in the field, namely the cisternal maturation/progression model and the stable compartments model. However, over the past decades, the cisternal progression model has been mostly accepted thanks to many experimental data.</p>
<p>The authors show that different cargos have distinct intra-Golgi transport kinetics and that the Golgi residence time of glycosyltransferases is high. From this and the experiment using brefeldinA, the authors suggest that the rim progression model, adapted from the stable compartments model, fits with their experimental data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of this manuscript is to put together many quantitative results that the authors previously obtained and to discuss them to give food for thought about the intraGolgi transport mechanism.</p>
<p>The analysis by fluorescence microscopy of intra-Golgi transport is tough and is a tour de force of the authors even if their approach show limitations, which are clearly stated. Their work is remarkable in regards to the numbers of Golgi markers and secretory cargos which have been analyzed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, most of the data provided here were already published and thus accessible for the community. Is there is a need to publish them again?</p>
<p>The authors' discussion about the intra-Golgi transport model is rather simplistic. In the introduction, there is no mention of the most recent models, namely the rapid partitioning and the rim progression models. To my opinion, the tubular connections between cisternae and the diffusion/biochemical properties of cargos are not enough taken into account to interpret the results. Indeed, tubular connections and biochemical properties of the cargos may affect their transit through the Golgi and the kinetics with which they reach the TGN for Golgi exit.</p>
<p>Nocodazole is being used to form Golgi mini-stacks, which are necessary to allow intra-Golgi measurement. The use of nocodazole might affect cellular homeostasis but this is clearly stated by the authors and is acceptable as we need to perturb the system to conduct this analysis. However, the manual selection of the Golgi mini-stack being analyzed raises a major concern. As far as I understood, the authors select the mini-stacks where the cargo and the Golgi reference markers are clearly detectable and separated, which might introduce a bias in the analysis.</p>
<p>The terms 'Golgi residence time ' is being used but it corresponds to the residence time in the trans-cisterna only as the cargo has been accumulated in the trans-Golgi thanks to a 20{degree sign}C block. The kinetics of disappearance of the protein of interest is then monitored after 20{degree sign}C to 37{degree sign}C switch.</p>
<p>Another concern also lies in the differences that would be introduced by different expression levels of the cargo on the kinetics of their intra-Golgi transport and of their packaging into post-Golgi carriers.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The data shown by the authors to measure differential intra Golgi velocities based on previously established methodology make a case for a stable compartment model, however more data is needed to make a complete story and the clarity of presentation can be improved.</p>

Your input has been instrumental in improving both the scientific rigor and presentation of our findings. Thank you for your thorough and thoughtful review.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Main points:</p>
<p>(1) Along with the studies in yeast, which authors describe in this paper, the main evidence for cisternal maturation model in mammalian cells comes from Bonfanti <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://et.al">et.al</ext-link>., (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81723-7">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81723-7</ext-link>), which used EM to visualize a wave of Collagen through Golgi stacks. It is therefore important this work needs to include collagen as one of the cargos tested. Can the authors use the RUSH-Col1AGFP (see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202005166">https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202005166</ext-link>) as a cargo to monitor intra-Golgi velocities?</p>
<p>I understand that Hela cells are not professional collagen-secreting, but the authors can use U2OS cells to measure collagen export and two other extreme (slow and fast) cargos to validate the same trend in intra-Golgi transport velocities is seen in other cell lines. This will address three concerns: a. This is not a Hela-specific phenomenon; b. Transport of large cargoes like collagen agree with their proposal; c. To see if the same cargo has the same (similar) intra-Golgi speed and the trend between different cargoes is conserved across cell lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Due to the difficulty of manipulating and imaging the procollagen-I RUSH reporter, we selected the collagenX-RUSH reporter (SBP-GFP-collagenX) instead. Our previous study (Tie et al., eLife, 2028) demonstrated that SBP-GFP-collagenX assembles as a large molecular weight particle, each having ~ 190 copies of SBP-GFP-collagenX. With an estimated mean size of ~ 40 nm, these aggregates are not as large as FM4 aggregates and procollagen-I (&gt; 300 nm) and, therefore, are not excluded from conventional transport vesicles, which typically have a size of 50 – 100 nm. However, collagenX has distinct intra-Golgi transport behaviour from conventional secretory cargos -- while conventional secretory cargos localize to the cisternal interior, collagenX partitions to the cisternal rim (Tie et al., eLife, 2028).</p>
<p>We studied the intra-Golgi transport of SBP-GFP-collagenX in HeLa cells via GLIM and side averaging. The new results are included in Figure 3 of the revamped manuscript. CollagenX has similar intra-Golgi transport kinetics as conventional secretory cargos, displaying the first-order exponential function in <italic>LQ</italic> vs. time and velocity vs. time plots.</p>
<p>The side-averaging images are consistent with previous and current results. collagenX displays a double-punctum during the intra-Golgi transport, indicating a cisternal rim localization, as expected for large secretory cargos. Therefore, our new data demonstrated that cisternal rim partitioned large-size secretory cargos might follow intra-Golgi transport kinetics similar to those of cisternal interior partitioned conventional secretory cargos.</p>
<p>We tried SBP-GFP-CD59 and SBP-GFP-Tac-TC, cargos with fast and slow intra-Golgi transport velocities, respectively, in 293T cells. Results are included in Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 2, and Table 1 of the revamped manuscript. We found that SBP-GFPTac-TC showed similar <italic>t</italic><sub>intra</sub>s, 17 and 14 min, respectively, in HeLa and 293T cells. Considering our previous finding that glycosylation has an essential role in the Golgi exit (Sun et al., JBC, 2020), the distinct intra-Golgi transport kinetics of SBP-GFP-CD59 (<italic>t</italic><sub>intra</sub>s, 13 and 5 min, respectively, in HeLa and 293T cells) might be due to its distinct luminal glycosylation between HeLa and 293T cells. Supporting this hypothesis, SBP-GFP-Tac-TC does not have any glycosylation sites due to the truncation of the Tac luminal domain.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) RUSH assay has its own caveats which authors also refer to in the manuscript. Authors should test their model by using pulse chase approaches by SNAP tagged constructs which will allow them to do pulse chase assays without the requirement to release cargo as a wave (see: doi: 10.1242/jcs.231373). It is not necessary to test all the cargoes but the two on the ends of the spectrum (slow and fast). To avoid massive overexpression, authors could express the proteins using weaker promoters. Authors could also use this approach to simultaneously measure the two cargoes by tagging them with CLIP and SNAP tags and doing the pulse chase simultaneously (see: DOI: 10.1083/jcb.202206132). In this case it may be difficult to stain both GM130 and TGN, but authors could monitor the rate of segregation from the GM130 signal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>During the RUSH assay, the sudden release of a large amount of secretory reporters does not occur under native secretory conditions and, consequently, might introduce artifacts. The reviewer suggests using pulse-chase labeling of SNAP (or CLIP)-tagged secretory cargos, which occurs in a steady state and hence more closely resembles native secretory transport. This is an excellent suggestion. However, we have not yet tested this method due to the following concerns.</p>
<p>The standard protocol involves blocking existing reporters, pulse-labeling newly synthesized reporters, and chasing their movement along the secretory pathway. However, the typical 20minute pulse labeling period used in the two references would be too long, as a substantial portion of the reporters would already reach the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi or exit the Golgi before the chase begins. Conversely, reducing the pulse labeling time would significantly weaken the GLIM signal.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) While the intra-Golgi velocities are different for different cargoes tested, authors should show a control that the arrival of the cargoes from ER to the cis-Golgi follows similar kinetics or if there are differences there is no correlation with the intra-Golgi velocities. In other words, do cargoes which show slow intra-Golgi velocities also take more time to reach the cis-Golgi and vice versa.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks, the ER exit site, ERGIC, and <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi are spatially closely associated. At the earliest measurable time point—5 minutes after biotin treatment— we observed that the secretory cargo had already reached the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2). The rapid ER-to-<italic>cis</italic>-Golgi transport exceeds the temporal resolution of our current protocol, making it difficult to address the reviewer’s question (see our reply to Minor Points (2) of Reviewer #2 for more detailed discussion on this).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Were the different cargos traveling (at different speeds) through Golgi at the rims, or in the middle of ministack, or by vesicles?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please also refer to our reply to Question 1 of Reviewer #1. For the nocodazole-induced Golgi ministack, we previously investigated the lateral cisternal localization of RUSH secretory reporters using our en face average imaging (Tie et al., eLife, 2018). We found that small or conventional cargos (such as CD59 and E-cadherin) partition to the cisternal interior while large cargos (collagenX and FM4-CD8a) partition to the cisternal rim during their intra-Golgi transport. Using GLIM, we showed that the intra-Golgi transport kinetics of collagenX is similar to that of small cargos as both follow the first-order exponential function (Figure 3A-C). Therefore, cisternal rim partitioned large size secretory cargos might have intra-Golgi transport kinetics similar to those of cisternal interior partitioned conventional secretory cargos.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 4, under both nocodazole and BFA treatment for 30mins, would the stacks have the same number (274 nm per LQ) as thickness? Or does it shrink a little? Considering extended BFA treatment reduced intact Golgi ministacks. This is important to understand the LQ numbers of those Golgi proteins. Besides, can they include one ERGIC marker in this assay, would it be approaching cis-Golgi? Images used for quantification in Figure 4 should be shown in the main figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We define the axial size of the Golgi ministack as the axial distance from the GM130 to the GalT-mCherry, <italic>d</italic><sub>(GM130-GalT-mCherry)</sub>, measured using the Gaussian centers of their line intensity profiles. As the reviewer suggested, we measured the axial size of the ministack during the nocodazole and BFA treatment. Indeed, we found a decrease in the ministack axial size from 300 ± 10 nm at 0 min to 190 ± 30 nm at 30 min of BFA treatment. This observation is further confirmed by our side average imaging. The new data is presented in Fig. 6G.</p>
<p>Our study focuses on changes in the organization of the Golgi ministack. So, we didn’t include ERGIC53 in the current analysis. Instead, we quantified the axial distance between GalTmCherry and CD8a-furin, <italic>d</italic><sub>(GalT-mCherry-CD8a-furin)</sub>, and found that it decreased from 200 ± 20 nm at 0 min to 100 ± 30 nm at 30 min of BFA treatment, suggesting the collapse of the TGN. The collapse of the TGN is further visualized by our side average imaging. The new data is presented in Fig. 6H.</p>
<p>Therefore, our new data demonstrates that the Golgi ministack shrinks, and the TGN collapses under BFA treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) The LQ data come from confocal/airy scan images, but no such images were shown in this paper. The authors can't assume every reader to have prior knowledge of their previous work. It will be beneficial to have one example image and how the LQ was measured.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As advised by the reviewer, we have prepared Supplementary Figure 1 to provide a brief illustration of the principle behind GLIM and image processing steps involved.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The cargos used in this paper need to be introduced: what are they, how were they used in previous literature. Especially the furin constructs come out of the blue (also see point 7).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have included a schematic diagram in Fig. 1 of the revised manuscript to illustrate all RUSH reporters and their corresponding ER hooks. In this diagram, we also highlight the key sequence differences in the cytosolic tails of different furin mutants.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have added references for each RUSH reporter at the beginning of the Results and Discussion section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) There are two categories of exocytosis, constitutive and regulated. It important to state that the phenomenon observed is in cells predominantly showing only constitutive secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer advised, we have added the following sentences in the section titled “Limitations of the study”.</p>
<p>“Third, all RUSH reporters used in this study are constitutive secretory cargos. As a result, the intra-Golgi transport dynamics observed here might not reflect those of regulated secretion, which involves the synchronized release of a large quantity of cargo in response to a specific signal.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) All the cargoes show a progressive reduction in instantaneous velocities from cis to medial to trans. Authors should discuss how do they mechanistically explain this. Is the rate of vesicle production progressively decreasing from cis to trans and if so, why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As our imaging methods cannot differentiate vesicles from the cisternal rim, we could not tell if the vesicle production rate had changed during the intra-Golgi transport. We have provided an explanation of the progressive reduction of the intra-Golgi transport velocity in the Results and Discussion section. Please see the text below.</p>
<p>“The progressive reduction in intra-Golgi transport of secretory cargo might result from the enzyme matrix's retention at the trans-Golgi. As the secretory cargos progress along the Golgi stack from the cis to the trans-side, more and more cargos become temporarily retained in the trans-Golgi region, gradually reducing their overall intra-Golgi transport velocity. If the release or Golgi exit of these cargos from the enzyme matrix follows a constant probability per unit time, i.e., a first-order kinetics process, the rate of cargo exiting from the Golgi should follow the first-order exponential function. Since the mechanism underlying intra-Golgi transport kinetics reflects fundamental molecular and cellular processes of the Golgi, further experimental data are essential to rigorously test this hypothesis.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The supp file 1 nicely listed the raw data for plotting, and n for numbers of ministacks. Could the authors also show number of cells or experiment repeats?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revamped version of the Supplementary File 1, we have added the cell number for each <italic>LQ</italic> measurement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) This recent work used novel multiplexing methods to show that nocodazole-treated cells had similar protein organization as in control may be cited.

</disp-quote>
<p>We have added this reference to the Introduction section to support that nocodazole-induced Golgi ministacks have a similar organization as the native Golgi. However, our BFA treatment was combined with the nocodazole treatment, while this paper’s BFA treatment does not contain nocodazole.</p>

<p>(7) Figure 1G-J, authors should show a schematic to show the difference between different furin constructs. Also, LQ values in Fig 1I start from 1. Authors may need to include even earlier timepoints.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have shown the domain organization of wild type and mutant furin RUSH reporters in Figure 1, highlighting key amino acids in the cytosolic tail. Please also see our reply to Minor Points (2) of Reviewer #1.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, Fig. 1l (SBP-GFP-CD8a-furin-AC #1) has been updated to become Fig. 2J. In this dataset, the first time point was selected at a relatively late stage (20 min), resulting in an initial <italic>LQ</italic> value of 0.92. However, this should not pose an issue, as SBP-GFPCD8a-furin-AC reaches a plateau of ~ 1.6. The number of data points is sufficient to capture the rising phase and fit the first-order exponential function curve with an adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99. Furthermore, we have four independent datasets in total on the intra-Golgi transport of SBPGFP-CD8a-furin-AC (#1-4), demonstrating the consistency of our measurements.</p>

<p>(8) Figure 2A need to show the data points, not just the lines.</p>

<p>(2) Line 152: Why is there a lack of experimental data? High ER background and low golgi signal make it difficult to select ministacks: would be good to see examples of these images. Is 0 a relevant timepoint as cargo is still at the ER? Instead would a timepoint &lt;5' be better demonstrate initial arrival in fast cargo, and 0' discarded?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observed that RUSH reporters typically do not exit the ER in &lt; 5 min of biotin treatment, resulting in a high ER background and low Golgi signal. Example images of SBP-GFP-CD59 are shown below (scale bar: 10 µm). Possible reasons include: 1) the time required for biotin diffusion into the ER, 2) the time needed to displace the RUSH hook from the RUSH reporter, and 3) the time for recruitment of RUSH reporters to ER exit sites. As a result, we could not obtain <italic>LQ</italic>s for time points earlier than 5 min during the biotin chase.</p>

<p>Despite the challenge in measuring <italic>LQ</italic>s at early time points, 0 is still a relevant time point. At <italic>t</italic> = 0 min, RUSH reporters should be at the ER membrane near the ER exit site, a definitive pre-Golgi location along the Golgi axis, although we still don’t have a good method to determine its <italic>LQ</italic>.</p>

<p>(3) Table 1 Line 474: 1-3 independent replicates: is there a better way of incorporating this into the table to make it more streamlined? It would be useful to see each cargo as a mean with error. Is there a more demonstrative way to present the table, for example (but does not have to be) fastest cargo first (Tintra) as in Table 2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we revised Table 1. We calculated the mean and SD of <italic>t</italic><sub>intra</sub> and arranged our RUSH reporters in ascending order based on their <italic>t</italic><sub>intra</sub> values.</p>

<p>(4) Line 264 / Fig 3B: It's unclear to me why the VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry internalisation approach was used, when the cells were expressing GFP, that could be used for imaging. Also, this introduces a question over trafficking of the VHH itself, to access the same compartments as the GFP-proteins are localised. It would be useful to describe the choice of this approach briefly in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here, the surface-labeling approach is used to investigate if GFP-Tac-TC possesses a Golgi retrieval pathway after its exocytosis to the plasma membrane. When VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry is added to the tissue culture medium, it binds to the cell surface-exposed GFP-fused MGAT1, MGAT2, Tac, Tac-TC, CD8a, and CD8a-TC. Next, VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry traces the internalized GFP-fused transmembrane proteins. The surface-labeling approach has two advantages in this case. 1) It is much more sensitive in revealing the minor number of GFPtransmembrane proteins at the plasma membrane and endosomes, which are usually drowned in the strong Golgi and ER background fluorescence in the GFP channel. 2) While the GFP fluorescence distribution has reached a dynamic equilibrium, the surface labeling approach can reveal the endocytic trafficking route and dynamics.</p>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, we added the following sentence to describe the choice of the cellsurface labeling – “By binding to the cell surface-exposed GFP, VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry serves as a sensitive probe to track the endocytic trafficking itinerary of the above GFP-fused transmembrane proteins”.</p>
<p>Regarding the trafficking of VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry itself, in HeLa cells that do not express GFP-fused transmembrane proteins, VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry can be internalized by fluidphase endocytosis. However, the fluid-phase endocytosis is negligible under our experimental condition, as we previously demonstrated (Sun et al., JCS, 2021; PMID: 34533190).</p>

<p>(1) Line 48: Tie at al. 2016 is cited. Please add references to original work showing that cargos transit from cis to trans Golgi cisternae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>After reviewing the literature, we identified two references that provide some of the earliest morphological evidence of secretory cargo transit from the <italic>cis</italic>- to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi:</p>
<p>(1) Castle et al, JCB, 1972; PMID: 5025103</p>
<p>(2) Bergmann and Singer, JCB, 1983; PMID: 6315743</p>
<p>The first study utilized pulse-chase autoradiographic EM imaging to track secretory protein movement, while the second employed immuno-EM imaging to observe the synchronized release of VSVGtsO45. Accordingly, we have removed Tie et al., 2016 and replaced it with these newly identified references.</p>

<p>(3) Figure 1: LQ vs. time plot for SBP-GFP-CD8a-furinAC (panel I, 0.9 to 1.75 in 150 min) is different from Fig 7G of Tie et al. 2016 (LQ O-1.5 in 100 min). Please comment on why those 2 sets of data are different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out this error. In our previous publication (Tie et al., MBoC, 2016), we presented a total of four datasets on SBP-GFP-CD8a-furin-AC. However, in the earlier version of our manuscript, we mistakenly listed only three datasets, inadvertently omitting Fig. 7G from Tie et al., MBoC, 2016.</p>
<p>In the revised version, we have now included Fig. S2T (SBP-GFP-CD8a-furin-AC #4), which corresponds to Fig. 7G from Tie et al., MBoC, 2016.</p>

<p>(4) As mentioned in the public review, I think measurement of the expression level of the cargos is necessary to compare their transport kinetics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises a valid concern that is challenging to address. All our data were obtained by imaging overexpressed reporters, and we assume that their overexpression does not significantly impact the Golgi or the secretory pathway. Our previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression does not substantially affect <italic>LQ</italic>s (Figure S2 of Tie et al., MBoC, 2016, and Figure S1 of Tie et al., JCB, 2022).</p>
<p>We acknowledge this concern as one of the limitations in our study at the end of our manuscript:</p>
<p>“First, our approach relied on the overexpression of fluorescence protein-tagged cargos. The synchronized release of a large amount of cargo could significantly saturate and skew the intra-Golgi transport.”</p>

<p>(5) To my opinion, cisternal continuities would also affect retrograde transport (accelerate) (by diffusion for instance) and not only retrograde transport. Please comment on how this would affect intra-Golgi transport kinetics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the reviewer is suggesting “cisternal continuities would also affect retrograde transport (accelerate) (by diffusion for instance) and not only anterograde transport.”</p>
<p>Transient cisternal continuities have been reported to facilitate the anterograde transport of large quantities of secretory cargos (Beznoussenko et al., 2014; PMID: 24867214) (Marsh et al., 2004; PMID: 15064406) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>; PMID: 15502824). However, we are not aware of any reports demonstrating that such continuities facilitate the retrograde transport of secretory cargo, although Trucco et al. (2004) speculated that Golgi enzymes might use these connections to diffuse bidirectionally (anterograde and retrograde direction). For this reason, we did not discuss this scenario in our manuscript.</p>

<p>(6) Lines 188-190: I don't understand why the rapid partitioning model is excluded. Please detail more the arguments used for this statement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Below is the section from the Introduction that addresses the reviewer's question.</p>
<p>“This model (rapid partitioning model) suggests that cargos rapidly diffuse throughout the Golgi stack, segregating into multiple post-translational processing and export domains, where cargos are packed into carriers bound for the plasma membrane. Nonetheless, synchronized traffic waves have been observed through various techniques, including EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Trucco et al., 2004</xref>) and advanced light microscopy methods we developed, such as GLIM and side-averaging(Tie et al., 2016; Tie et al., 2022). These findings suggest that the rapid partitioning model might not accurately represent the true nature of the intra-Golgi transport.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) I would suggest replacing the 'Golgi residence time' by another name as it reflects mainly the time of Golgi exit if I am not mistaken.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe the term “Golgi residence time” more accurately reflects the underlying mechanism – retention. The same approach to measure the Golgi residence time can also be applied to Golgi enzymes such as ST6GAL1. Its slow Golgi exit kinetics (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 5.3 hours) (Sun et al., JCS, 2021) should be primarily due to a strong Golgi retention at its steady state Golgi localization.</p>
<p>In contrast, the conventional secretory cargos’ Golgi exit times are usually much shorter (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> &lt; 20 min) (Table 2) due to weaker Golgi retention. In a broader sense, the Golgi exit kinetics of a secretory cargo should be influenced by its Golgi retention. Furthermore, we have consistently used the term “Golgi residence time” in our previous publications. So, we propose maintaining this terminology in the current manuscript.</p>

<p>(8) Lines 300-306: I would suggest that the authors remove this part as it is highly speculative and not supported by data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have relocated this discussion to the section titled &quot;Our data supports the rim progression model, a modified version of the stable compartment model.&quot;</p>
<p>Our enzyme matrix hypothesis offers a potential explanation for key observations, including the differential cisternal localization of small and large cargos and the interior localization of Golgi enzymes. Cryo-FIB-ET has shown that the interior of Golgi cisternae is enriched with densely packed Golgi enzymes (Engel et al., PNAS, 2015; PMID: 26311849), supporting this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Additionally, this hypothesis helps explain the gradual reduction in intra-Golgi transport velocities of secretory cargos, as requested by Reviewer #1 (Minor Points 4). For these reasons, we propose retaining this discussion in the manuscript.</p>

<p>(9) In Figure 3B, percentage of MGAT2-GFP cells with anti-GFP signal at the Golgi is of 41% while Sun et al. 2021 reported 25%, please comment this difference. Reply:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We included more cells for the quantification. The percentage of cells showing Golgi localization of VHH-anti-GFP-mCherry is now 32% (<italic>n</italic> = 266 cells). The observed difference, 32% vs. 25% (Sun et al., JCS, 2021), is likely due to uncontrollable variations in experimental conditions, which might have influenced the endocytic Golgi targeting efficiency.</p>

<p>(10) The effects of brefeldinA are pleiotropic as it disassembles COPI and clathrin coats but also induces tubulation of endosomes. I would recommend using Golgicide A, which is more specific.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that Golgicide A might be more specific as an inhibitor of Arf1. We will certainly consider using this inhibitor next time.</p>
