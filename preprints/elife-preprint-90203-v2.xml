<title>Abstract</title><p>Despite rapid evolution across eutherian mammals, the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are located in a region flanked by two highly conserved protein-coding genes (<italic>Slitrk2</italic> and <italic>Fmr1</italic>) on the X chromosome. Intriguingly, these miRNAs are predominantly expressed in the testis, suggesting a potential role in spermatogenesis and male fertility. Here, we report that the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs were derived from the MER91C DNA transposons. Selective inactivation of individual miRNAs or clusters caused no discernable defects, but simultaneous ablation of five clusters containing nineteen members of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family led to reduced male fertility in mice. Despite normal sperm counts, motility and morphology, the KO sperm were less competitive than wild-type sperm when subjected to a polyandrous mating scheme. Transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses revealed that these X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs, in addition to targeting a set of conserved genes, have more targets that are critical for spermatogenesis and embryonic development during evolution. Our data suggest that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs function to enhance sperm competitiveness and reproductive fitness of the male by finetuning gene expression during spermatogenesis.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>The X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family has rapidly evolved in mammals, but their physiological significance remains elusive. Given their abundant and preferential expression in the testis and sperm, these X-linked miRNAs likely play a functional role in spermatogenesis and/or early embryonic development. However, the deletion of either individual miRNA genes or all of the five miRNA clusters encoding 38 mature miRNAs did not cause major fertility defects in mice. When these mutant males were subjected to conditions resembling polyandrous mating, the mutant sperm were much less competitive than the wild-type sperm, rendering the mutant males “functionally sub-fertile”. Our data suggest that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family of miRNAs regulates sperm competition and the reproductive fitness of the male.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is highly conserved among all vertebrates. Although it generally consists of three phases (mitotic, meiotic, and haploid), many characteristics appear to be species-specific, <italic>e.g.,</italic> the duration of each of the three phases, the seminiferous epithelial organization, and the shape and length of spermatozoa, likely reflecting the adaptive changes during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Several cellular events are unique to the male germ cells, <italic>e.g.,</italic> postnatal formation of the adult male germline stem cells (i.e., spermatogonial stem cells), pubertal onset of meiosis, and haploid male germ cell differentiation (i.e., spermiogenesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Unique cellular processes are often accompanied by a more complex yet unique transcriptome, which may explain why the testis expresses more genes than any other organs in the body, with the possible exception of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Regulation of gene expression during spermatogenesis occurs at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). As a post-transcriptional regulator, miRNAs are abundantly expressed in the testis and are required for spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). miRNAs typically function at post-transcriptional levels by binding the complementary sequences in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs – particularly in the 3’UTRs through the “seed sequence” (2<sup>nd</sup>-7<sup>th</sup> nucleotides)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Numerous miRNAs are subject to rapid evolution, probably in response to the accelerated rate of divergence of UTRs compared to the exonic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Divergence of genomic sequences can be mediated by transposable elements (TEs), which are known as building blocks of the genome and mostly map to UTRs and intronic regions of protein-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Each miRNA can bind numerous target mRNAs, and one mRNA can be targeted by multiple different miRNAs. This “one-to-multiple” relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs amplifies their potential to coordinate gene expression in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Moreover, miRNA genes often exist in clusters, which are transcribed as a unit followed by nuclear and cytoplasmic cleavage events to generate individual miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple clusters of miRNA genes containing the same seed sequences are categorized as a miRNA family, and miRNAs within the same family likely evolved from a common ancestor sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Of great interest, many of the testis-enriched miRNA clusters map to the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Sex-linked genes are generally subject to the male germline-specific phenomenon called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which silences transcription during most, if not all, of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Indeed, prior to 2009, there were no confirmed reports of any sex-linked genes escaping the repressive effects of MSCI. Surprisingly, however, we found that many X-linked miRNA genes do escape MSCI, suggesting that they may contribute to particularly important functions during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). This notion has since been tested by the generation of knockouts (KOs) of individual miRNA genes or individual clusters of miRNA genes normally expressed during spermatogenesis. However, these KOs resulted in minimal, if any, phenotypic effects and did not appear to impede normal spermatogenesis or male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). This left the field facing multiple unanswered questions, including 1) why do so many X-linked miRNAs express uniquely or preferentially during spermatogenesis and escape MSCI, 2) what’s their origin, and 3) how and why did they evolve rapidly?</p>
<p>To address these questions and better understand the functional role played by these X-linked miRNAs, we investigated the evolutionary history of this unique miRNA family and also generated KOs of individual, paired, triple, quadruple, or quintuple sets of miRNA clusters within this family and tested the effects on male fertility, initially by standard monandrous mating assays. Consistent with previous efforts to inactivate miRNA genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), KOs of either individual members or individual clusters of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family induced no discernable phenotypes and did not impact male fertility. This may reflect the level of functional redundancy inherent within the members and clusters of this miRNA family. It was only when four or more clusters of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family were ablated that relevant phenotype became detectable, which was manifested in the form of reduced litter size despite normal sperm counts, motility, and morphology.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the most common male fertility testing for lab rodents is based on a monandrous mating scheme, <italic>i.e.,</italic> one fertility-proven female mated with one male. However, there are additional aspects of male fertility in many mammalian species, particularly those that are normally litter-bearing. In the wild, litter-bearing females often mate with multiple different males such that a single litter may include pups sired by more than one male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). This polyandrous mating introduces the potential for additional aspects of male reproductive fitness to accrue, one of which involves sperm competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Sperm competition can occur when sperm from more than one male are present in the female reproductive tract simultaneously, such that they then compete to fertilize each oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Sperm competition has been now recognized as a significant evolutionary force directly impacting male reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Using experiments that mimic polyandrous mating, we found that the quinKO male mice indeed displayed compromised sperm competition. Hence, the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs appear to function to finetune spermatogenesis to enhance sperm competition and, consequently, male reproductive fitness.</p>

<title>X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs flanked by two highly conserved protein-coding genes <italic>Slitrk2</italic> and <italic>Fmr1</italic> rapidly evolved across species</title>
<p>X-linked genes are generally more divergent between species than autosomal ones, a phenomenon known as the “faster-X effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). However, despite a high degree of conservation of two protein-coding genes, <italic>Slitrk2</italic> and <italic>Fmr1</italic>, on the X chromosome across species, the miRNA genes located between these two loci are divergent among clades across the eutherian mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Through tracing the evolution of this genomic region, we found that <italic>Slitrk2</italic> and <italic>Fmr1</italic> mapped to chromosome 4 (syntenic with mammalian X chromosome) in zebrafish and birds, but to the X chromosome in most mammals, with divergence and multiplication of numerous miRNA genes that belong to the <italic>miR-506</italic> family in between (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and Table S1). By mapping these miRNAs of various species using the UCSC genome browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), we found that all members of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family are located in a region flanked by <italic>Slitrk2</italic> and <italic>Fmr1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), <italic>Slitrk2</italic> and <italic>Fmr1</italic> are usually on the positive strand, whereas the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are in the reverse orientation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Based on the location of these miRNAs, we named the miRNAs proximal to <italic>Slitrk2</italic> (<italic>miR-892c</italic> ∼ <italic>miR-891a</italic> in humans) and <italic>Fmr1</italic> (<italic>miR-513c ∼ miR-514a3</italic> in humans) SmiRs (<italic>Slitrk2</italic>-proximal miRNAs) and FmiRs (<italic>Fmr1</italic>-proximal miRNAs), respectively.</p>

<p>To evaluate the sequence conservation of these miRNAs across species, we adopted the Multiz Alignment and Conservation pipeline, which utilizes PhastCons and PhyloP algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), to search miRNA datasets from 100 different species using the human genome as a reference (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and Fig. S1). The mean values of phyloP and phastCons of the <italic>Fmr1</italic> and <italic>Slitrk2</italic> coding sequences (CDS) were ∼4.9 and ∼0.97, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C and D</xref>), indicating that these regions are highly conserved. In contrast, the mean values of phyloP and phastCons of SmiRs were ∼1.0 and ∼0.002, respectively, and those of FmiRs are ∼0.03 and ∼0.11, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C and D). The phyloP and phastCons values of the CDS, FmiRs, and SmiRs are significantly different from each other (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C and D), indicating that FmiRs and SmiRs are highly divergent, and SmiRs are more divergent than FmiRs.</p>
<p>We then assessed the genomic sequence similarity among various species using D-GENIES-based dot plot analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Although the <italic>Slitrk2</italic>-<italic>Fmr1</italic> genomic regions were highly variable among different species, the sequences within some clades shared a high degree of similarities, e.g., primates (rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans), <italic>cetartiodactyla</italic> (sheep and cows), <italic>rodentia</italic> (e.g., mice and rats) and <italic>carnivora</italic> (e.g., dogs and cats) (Fig. S2A). Although the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs were highly divergent, some orthologs displayed a higher degree of sequence conservation (Fig. S2 B and C), e.g., the SmiRs within primates were similar (Fig. S2B); <italic>miR-891a</italic> and <italic>miR-891b</italic> in rhesus monkeys were similar to <italic>miR-891b</italic> and <italic>miR-891a</italic> in humans and chimpanzees, respectively, and <italic>miR-892b</italic> in chimpanzees was homologous to <italic>miR-892c</italic> in humans and rhesus monkeys in terms of sequence and location (Figs. S2B). The FmiRs, including <italic>miR-201</italic> (assigned as <italic>Mir-506-P1</italic> (paralogue 1) in MirGeneDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>)), <italic>miR-547</italic> (<italic>Mir-506-P2</italic>), and <italic>miR-509</italic> (<italic>Mir-506-P7</italic>) in mice and rats, are orthologues of <italic>miR-506</italic>, <italic>miR-507</italic> and <italic>miR-509</italic> in humans, respectively (Fig. S2C, and Table S1). Of interest, although the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are highly divergent, the seed sequences of some miRNAs, such as <italic>Mir-506-P6</italic> and <italic>Mir-506-P7</italic>, remain conserved (Fig. S2C), and these miRNAs represent the dominant mature miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). It is noteworthy that the majority of the substitutions among the <italic>miR-506</italic> family are U↣C and A↣G (Fig. S2 B and C). Furthermore, we analyzed the conservation of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family in modern humans using data from the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E and F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We compared SmiRs, FmiRs, and all miRNAs with pachytene piRNAs, which are known to be highly divergent in modern humans but barely exert any biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Of interest, the derived allele frequency (DAF) and mean nucleotide diversity (MND) of FmiRs and all miRNAs were significantly smaller than that of the pachytene piRNAs, whereas SmiRs were significantly smaller than all miRNAs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> E and F) (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test), suggesting that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are more conserved than pachytene piRNAs in modern humans. Taken together, these data indicate that the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family, although rapidly evolving as a whole, contains both divergent and conserved miRNAs, suggesting both conserved and novel functions across species.</p>

<title>X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are derived from MER91C DNA transposons</title>
<p>To visualize the family history of these miRNAs, we built a phylogram for the <italic>miR-506</italic> family (Fig. S3). The phylogram suggests that these miRNAs shared a common ancestor and that the FmiRs emerged earlier than the SmiRs, which is also supported by the fact that some FmiRs exist in green sea turtles (Figs. S1 and S3). These data suggest that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs arose much earlier than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The two subfamilies, FmiRs and SmiRs, despite their common ancestors, may have evolved at different paces and thus, might be functionally divergent.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that transposable elements (TEs) drive evolution through transpositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). CRISPR-Cas9/Cas12a genome editing can induce irreversible small indels at the cutting sites (also called “scars”)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), which have been used for lineage tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Inspired by this strategy, we attempted to trace the evolution of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs by searching the transposon database for the transpositional “scars” (partial TE sequences) after transposition. To search the potential TE sources of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs, we downloaded all transposons in the human, horse, dog, and guinea pig genomes and aligned them to their corresponding <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The nonautonomous MER91C DNA transposon (∼100-150 million years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) was the only transposon that aligned to FmiRs of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family (&gt; 94% identical matches) in all four species (Table S2).</p>
<p>Given that the FmiRs (e.g., <italic>miRs-506∼509</italic>) emerged much earlier than the SmiRs (fig. S1 and fig. S3) and that <italic>miR-513</italic> (belonging to FmiRs) and SmiRs (including <italic>miR-891a</italic> and <italic>miR-891b</italic>) share a common ancestor (Fig. S3), we reasoned that the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family might be derived from the <italic>MER91C</italic> DNA transposon. To test this hypothesis, we first aligned the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs from several species to a human MER91C DNA transposon.</p>
<p>Indeed, numerous FmiRs of almost all species analyzed aligned to the MER91C DNA transposon despite few mismatches (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The phylogenetic tree further confirmed that the MER91C is the sister group of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Fig. S4), suggesting that the MER91C DNA transposon is the likely source of the older <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs. Further supporting this notion, the MER91C DNA transposons could form hairpin structures, which is a prerequisite for miRNA biogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and Fig. S5A). Moreover, analyses of the testis small RNA datasets from humans, marmosets, dogs, and horses revealed the peaks corresponding to these miRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and Fig. S5A). Finally, by overexpressing several MER91C DNA regions randomly selected from humans, dogs, and horses in HEK293T cells, we found that these DNA regions were indeed capable of producing miRNAs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> E and F, and Fig. S5 B and C). Co-expression of MER91C DNA regions and AGO2 significantly increased the abundance of human MER91C miRNAs, as compared with overexpression of MER91C DNA regions alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> E and F), suggesting that these miRNAs could be loaded onto and protected by AGO2. Taken together, these results indicate that the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> miRNAs were originally derived from the MER91C DNA transposon.</p>

<title>X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are predominantly expressed in spermatogenic cells and sperm</title>
<p>Several previous studies have shown that the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are predominantly expressed in the testis of multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). By analyzing the publicly available small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) datasets from multiple species, including humans, rhesus monkeys, mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, and cows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), we further confirmed that <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs were indeed highly abundant in the testis, but barely expressed in other organs (Fig. S6, and Table S3). To further determine whether these miRNAs are expressed in male germ cells in rodent testes, we conducted sRNA-seq using pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids, and sperm purified from adult mice (Fig. S7A and Table S3). Consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), these miRNAs were abundantly expressed in spermatogenic cells in murine testes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). ∼80% of these miRNAs were significantly upregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05) when pachytene spermatocytes developed into round spermatids, and ∼83.3% were significantly upregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05) when developed into cauda sperm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). By analyzing the publicly available sRNA-seq datasets from humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), marmosets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), we determined the expression patterns of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs in the testes of these species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B, C and D, Table S3). The significantly increasing abundance of the SmiRs from immature to mature testes in horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) supports the elevated expression in haploid male germ cells (round, elongating/elongated spermatids, and sperm) compared to meiotic male germ cells (spermatocytes) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). More interestingly, the SmiRs and FmiRs appear to be differentially expressed in the testes of various species, e.g., relative levels of the SmiRs were greater than those of the FmiRs in mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A and Table S3). Both the SmiRs and FmiRs were highly expressed in horses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and Table S3). Levels of the FmiRs in marmoset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and human testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) were much greater than in those of the SmiRs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> B and C and Table S3). Overall, the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are abundant in the testis and predominantly expressed in haploid male germ cells, <italic>i.e.,</italic> spermatids and spermatozoa.</p>

<title>Ablation of X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs compromises male fertility due to reduced sperm competitiveness</title>
<p>To define the physiological role of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family, we sequentially deleted these miRNA genes using CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). We first generated the KO mice lacking either the <italic>miR-883</italic> single cluster (<italic>miR-883</italic> sKO) or the <italic>miR-465</italic> single cluster (<italic>miR-465</italic> sKO) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), as these two clusters are the most abundantly expressed in the mouse testes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A and Fig. S6). No discernable defects were observed, and these KO males developed normally and were fertile (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B and C). On the <italic>miR-883</italic> sKO background, we further deleted the <italic>miR-741</italic> cluster, which we termed double KO (dKO) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A), but no discernable abnormalities were observed in the dKO males either (Fig. S7 B-E). On the dKO background, we next deleted either the <italic>miR-465</italic>, termed triple KO (tKO), or the <italic>miR-471</italic> and <italic>miR-470</italic> clusters, termed quadruple KO (quadKO) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). Lastly, we ablated the <italic>miR-465</italic> cluster on the quadKO background, named quintuple KO (quinKO) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). To reduce potential off-target effects due to multiple rounds of CRISPR-Cas9 targeting, we also generated a KO mouse line with only 4 guide RNAs (gRNAs) flanking the SmiR region, named X-linked SmiR KO (XS) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). The XS mice were genetically equivalent to the quinKO mice, and phenotypically identical to quinKOs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B and C), suggesting the phenotype observed was not due to the accumulating off-target effects. To further exclude the potential off-target effect, all KO mouse strains were backcrossed with WT C57BL/6J mice for at least 5 generations before data collection. In addition, T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assays showed no discernable off-target effects in the quinKO mice (Fig. S7F).</p>

<p>While the litter size was still comparable between the tKO and WT control mice, the quadKO, quinKO, and XS males produced significantly smaller litters (∼5 <italic>vs.</italic> ∼8 pups/litter) (adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, One-Way ANOVA) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B). Of interest, no significant changes were detected in litter interval, testis weight or histology in any of the four types of KOs, as compared to WT controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> C, D and G). Computer-assisted sperm analyses (CASA) revealed no significant differences in sperm counts and motility parameters among the four types of KOs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> E and F and Fig. S7H). Overall, there appears to be an inverse correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9139, p &lt; 0.05, F-test) between the number of miRNAs inactivated and the litter size (Fig. S7G). Interestingly, several human studies have correlated the dysregulated <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs with impaired male fertility due to maturation arrest and oligo-asthenozoospermia (Table S4)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). These data suggest that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family may play an important role in spermatogenesis and male fertility.</p>
<p>Most of the protein-coding genes that are exclusively or preferentially expressed in the testis with an essential role in spermatogenesis are highly conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Despite their male germ cell-predominant expression, the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs appear to have evolved rapidly to diverge their sequences, suggesting that these miRNAs might control certain “non-conserved” aspects of spermatogenesis, leading to enhanced sperm competitiveness for male reproductive success. Supporting this hypothesis, previous reports have documented that females of most species throughout the animal kingdoms mate with multiple males before pregnancy, suggesting that sperm competition may serve as a selection mechanism to bias the birth of offspring sired by the males with more competitive sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Studies have also shown female rodents in the wild mate with multiple males and produce litters of mixed paternity, and that pups born to the females following such polyandrous mating display greater survival rates than those produced from females following monandrous mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Given that CASA detected no difference in swimming patterns between quinKO and WT sperm (Fig. S7H), we next carried out sperm competition experiments that mimic polyandrous mating in the wild. Since the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are X-linked, the Y sperm from the quinKO mice are genetically indistinguishable from those of WT controls. We, therefore, adopted the mTmG male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) for sperm competition experiments because the embryos or offspring fathered by the mTmG males can be easily identified based on the constitutively expressed membrane-tagged tomato red (mT) fluorescence and/or PCR genotyping.</p>
<p>We first conducted sequential mating with two mating events ∼6-8 hours apart. Interestingly, all of the pups born were fathered by mTmG males (n=8) when the WT females were mated first with mTmG males and subsequently with the quinKO males. In contrast, when the WT females were mated first with quinKO males and subsequently with mTmG males, ∼89% of the pups born were fathered by quinKO males, and the remaining ∼11% of pups were from mTmG males (n=28) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> H-I). It is noteworthy that in the sequential mating experiments, the two coituses occurred ∼6-8 hours apart due to practical reasons, whereas in the wild, polyandrous mating may take place much faster. To better mimic polyandrous mating <italic>in vitro</italic>, we mixed the WT and quinKO sperm in different ratios and used the mixed sperm to perform <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF). MII oocytes fertilized by mTmG, quinKO, or a mixture of two types of sperm at three ratios (mTmG: quinKO = 1:1, 4:1 and 1:4) all displayed comparable rates at which fertilized oocytes developed into blastocysts (Fig. S7I). Interestingly, when a 1:1 ratio (mTmG sperm: quinKO sperm) was used, ∼73% of the resulting blastocysts were derived from mTmG sperm, whereas the remaining ∼27% were from quinKO sperm (n=179) (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi-squared test) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> J). When a 4:1 sperm ratio (mTmG: quinKO) was used, ∼92% of the blastocysts were from mTmG sperm and only 8% were from quinKO sperm (n=170) (p &lt; 0.05, Chi-squared test) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> J). In contrast, when a 1:4 sperm ratio (mTmG: quinKO) was used, blastocysts derived from mTmG and quinKO sperm represented ∼28% and ∼72% of the total, respectively (n=135) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> J). We also performed co-artificial insemination (AI) using mTmG and quinKO sperm. When a 1:1 sperm ratio (mTmG: quinKO) was used, ∼62.5% of the embryos (n=96) were derived from mTmG sperm (p&lt; 0.05, Chi-squared test) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> K). When a 1:4 ratio was used, ∼35.3% of the embryos (n=17) were from the mTmG mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref> and Fig. S7J). Together, these results indicate that the quinKO sperm are less competitive than the control mTmG sperm both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Previous studies suggest that sperm aggregation and midpiece size might be involved in sperm competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), but no changes in these two parameters were observed in the quinKO sperm (Fig. S7 K and L). Although the blastocyst rate (out of 2-cell embryos) of quinKO was comparable to that of the mTmG mice, the 2-cell rates (out of zygotes) were significantly reduced (p&lt; 0.05, paired t-test) in the quinKO mice (∼39%, n=67) when compared to the mTmG mice (∼88%, n=58) (Fig. S7M), implying that the quinKO sperm is indeed less efficient in fertilizing eggs and/or supporting early embryonic development, especially the first cleavage of the zygotes.</p>

<title>X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs mostly target the genes involved in spermatogenesis and embryonic development and compensate for each other</title>
<p>To identify the target genes of these X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs, we performed RNA-seq analyses using testis samples from the five types of KOs (<italic>miR-465</italic> sKO, dKO, tKO, quadKO, and quinKO) (Fig. S8A and Table S5). Comparisons between the KO and WT testes revealed thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (fold change ≥ 2, FDR&lt; 0.05, Fig. S8A and Table S5). The DEGs identified were then compared with the predicted <italic>miR-506</italic> target genes using four different databases, including TargetScan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.org">microrna.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), miRWalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) and mirDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), to predict the differentially expressed targets (DETs) of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs (Fig. S8A and Table S5). We obtained 2,692, 2,028, 1,973, 3,405, and 1,106 DETs from <italic>miR-465</italic> sKO, dKO, tKO, quadKO and quinKO testes, respectively. GO terms of DETs from each KO testis revealed that the DETs were mostly involved in embryonic development, response to stimulus, centrosome cycle, epithelium morphogenesis, organelle organization, cell projection, RNA metabolic process, and DNA repair (Fig. S8B). The 431 DETs identified to be shared across all five KO testes were also enriched in similar pathways (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> An and B). Several genes, including <italic>Crisp1</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, and <italic>Trpv4</italic>, were selected for validation using qPCR, Western blots and luciferase-based reporter assays. Consistent with the RNA-seq data, qPCR showed that <italic>Crisp1</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, and <italic>Trpv4</italic> were significantly downregulated in the quinKO testes (Fig. S8C). <italic>CRISP1</italic> is enriched in the sperm principle piece and head (Fig. S8D). Western blots also confirmed that <italic>CRISP1</italic> is downregulated in the quinKO testis when compared to the WT testis (Fig. S8E). Luciferase assays further confirmed that <italic>Egr1</italic> and <italic>Crisp1</italic> are targets of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family members (Fig. S8 F and G). <italic>Egr1</italic> 3’UTR luciferase activity was upregulated by <italic>miR-465c</italic>, while downregulated by <italic>miR-743b</italic> (Fig. S8F). <italic>miR-465a</italic>, <italic>miR-465c</italic>, <italic>miR-470</italic>, <italic>miR-741</italic>, and <italic>miR-743a</italic> upregulated <italic>Crisp1</italic> 3’UTR luciferase activity, while <italic>miR-743b</italic> exerted the opposite effect (Fig. S8G).

<p>The inverse correlation between the number of miRNAs inactivated and the severity of the phenotype strongly hints that these miRNAs compensate for each other (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and Fig. S7G). To test this hypothesis, we performed sRNA-seq on four KO (<italic>miR-465</italic> sKO, tKO, quadKO and quinKO) testes. The sRNA-seq data showed that these miRNAs were no longer expressed in the corresponding KOs, confirming the successful deletion of these miRNAs in these KOs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and Table S6). Interestingly, in <italic>miR-465</italic> sKO testes, <italic>miR-201, miR-547, miR-470</italic>, <italic>miR-471</italic>, <italic>miR-742, miR-871</italic>, <italic>miR-881, miR-883a,</italic> and <italic>miR-883b</italic> were all significantly upregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05).

<p>We considered two likely explanations for the paradox where the majority of their target genes were shared across species despite the rapid evolution of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs: 1) The 3’UTR sequences in extant target genes became increasingly divergent during evolution such that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs had to adapt to maintain their ability to bind these 3’UTRs; or 2) that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs evolved rapidly in a manner that allowed them to target mRNAs encoded by additional genes involved in spermatogenesis. To distinguish the two possibilities, we first compared the extent of similarities among the 3’UTR sequences of the 2,510 shared target genes between humans and mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A and Table S7). We adopted the PhyloP scores to measure the evolutionary conservation at individual nucleotide sites in the 3’UTRs of the shared target genes. The overall conservation appeared to be greater in the regions targeted by <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs than in the non-target regions in the 3’UTRs of the shared target genes in both mice and humans (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B and C) with few exceptions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> D and E) (p &lt; 0.05, t-test). These data suggest that the regions targeted by the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are under relatively stronger purifying, rather than adaptive, selection. We then tested the second hypothesis that the rapid evolution of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family resulted in more extant mRNAs being targeted by these miRNAs. We first compared the average target numbers of each <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNA between humans and mice using the 2,510 shared targets between predicted targets in humans and the dysregulated targets in mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> A and F). Among these shared targets, the human <italic>miR-506</italic> family members could target ∼1,268 unique transcripts per miRNA, whereas the murine <italic>miR-506</italic> family members could only target ∼1,068 (p &lt; 0.05, t-test) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> F), indicating that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs target more genes in humans than in mice. Furthermore, we analyzed the number of all potential targets of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs predicted by the aforementioned four algorithms among humans, mice, and rats. The total number of targets for all the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs among different species did not show significant enrichment in humans (Fig. S9C), suggesting the sheer number of target genes does not increase in humans. We then compared the number of target genes per miRNA. When comparing the number of target genes per miRNA for all the miRNAs (baseline) between humans and mice, we found that on a per miRNA basis, human miRNAs have more targets than murine miRNAs (p&lt;0.05, t-test) (Fig. S9D), consistent with higher biological complexity in humans. This became even more obvious for the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family (p&lt;0.05, t-test) (Fig. S9D). In humans, the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family, on a per miRNA basis, targets a significantly greater number of genes than the average of all miRNAs combined (p&lt;0.05, t-test) (Fig. S9D). In contrast, in mice, we observed no significant difference in the number of targets per miRNA between X-linked miRNAs and all of the mouse miRNAs combined (mouse baseline) (Fig. S9D).</p>
<p>These results suggest that although the sheer number of target genes remains the same between humans and mice, the human X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family targets a greater number of genes than the murine counterpart on a per miRNA basis. We also investigated the number of <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNA targeting sites within the individual target genes in both humans and mice, but no significant differences were found between humans and mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> G). To determine whether increased target sites in humans were due to the expansion of the MER91C DNA transposon, we analyzed the MER91C DNA transposon-containing transcripts and associated them with our DETs. Of interest, 28 human and 3 mouse mRNAs possess 3’UTRs containing MER91C DNA sequences, and only 3 and 0 out of those 28 and 3 genes belonged to DETs in humans and mice, respectively (Fig. S9E), suggesting a minimal effect of MER91C DNA transposon expansion on the number of target sites. Taken together, these results suggest the human X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family has been subjected to additional selective pressure, causing them to exert additional regulatory functions by targeting more mRNAs expressed during spermatogenesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> H).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Successful reproduction is pivotal for the perpetuation of species, and sperm are constantly facing selective pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). To enhance their chance to fertilize eggs, sperm need to adapt accordingly, and miRNAs-mediated regulation of gene expression in spermatogenesis provides a rapidly adaptable mechanism toward this end. Although miRNAs were initially believed to be evolutionarily conserved, the number of non-conserved miRNAs has been steadily increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Among the non-conserved miRNAs, many are derived from TEs, suggesting that TEs may serve as a major source of miRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). The delayed recognition of TE-derived miRNAs, in part, results from the fact that repetitive sequences were usually excluded during the computational annotation of miRNAs. In theory, TEs can serve as a good donor of miRNA sequences for the following reasons: 1) TEs are ubiquitous and abundant in the genome and are known to contribute to the regulatory elements of the coding genes, e.g., UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). As one of the regulatory factors that target mainly the 3’UTRs, TE-derived miRNAs can regulate a larger number of mRNAs with multiple miRNA-targeting sites. 2) TEs are among the most rapidly evolving sequences in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) and thus, can continuously produce species/lineage-specific miRNA genes to diversify their regulatory effects.</p>
<p>Consistent with these notions, the present study provides evidence supporting that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs originated from the MER91C DNA transposons. Of more interest, the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs, despite their rapid evolution, are all expressed in spermatogenic cells in the testis and sperm, supporting a lineage-specific functional diversification of TE-derived miRNAs. In fact, the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs were among the first reported TE-derived miRNAs because of their location in a small region of the X chromosome and their confined, abundant expression in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). RNAs are much less abundant in sperm than in somatic or spermatogenic cells (∼1/100) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Sperm-borne small RNAs represent a small fraction of total small RNAs expressed in their precursor spermatogenic cells, including spermatocytes and spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Therefore, when the same amount of total/small RNAs are used for quantitative analyses, sperm-borne small RNAs (e.g., <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs) would be proportionally enriched in sperm compared to other spermatogenic cells.</p>
<p>It has been demonstrated that under certain circumstances, genes that evolve under sexual conflicts tend to move to the X chromosome, especially when they are male-beneficial, female-deleterious, and act recessively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). The X chromosome is enriched with genes associated with male reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). The rapid evolution of the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family strongly suggests that these miRNA genes were under selection to expand and diversify their regulatory effects on spermatogenesis. Indeed, our data strongly suggest that targeting new mRNAs was likely the driving force for the rapid evolution of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family of miRNAs. However, expansion and sequence divergence of the X-linked <italic>miR-506</italic> family may simply reflect natural drifting without functional significance, similar to some of the pachytene piRNA clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). We argue that the neutral drifting theory may not be true to the <italic>miR-506</italic> family for the following reasons: 1) Despite highly divergent overall sequences of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family, some miRNAs share the same seed regions across multiple species, suggesting that these regions may undergo strong selections. 2) The <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs, especially the FmiRs, are highly conserved in modern humans, implying a strong selection of these miRNAs. 3) Knockout the <italic>miR-506</italic> family (either quinKO or XS) results in male subfertility, reflecting a biological function. 4) The quinKO sperm are less competitive than the WT sperm both in <italic>vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. 5) Several human studies have linked the dysregulation of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family with male infertility/subfertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Similarly, one study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also showed that the rapidly evolving testis-restricted miRNAs underwent adaptive evolution rather than neutral drifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>).</p>
<p>Since TEs are abundant in UTRs, TE-derived miRNAs can target a much greater number of mRNAs than those derived from distinct non-repetitive genomic loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Indeed, thousands of the dysregulated genes detected in the <italic>miR-465</italic> sKO, dKO, tKO, quadKO and quinKO testes are involved in multiple pathways of spermatogenesis. By analyzing the sequence divergence, we noticed that the most common sequence substitutions among all of the <italic>miR-506</italic> miRNA sequences were U-to-C and A-to-G, which were likely mediated by ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) that can change A to I (which is functionally equivalent to G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Interestingly, ∼90% of the A-to-I editing appears to have occurred in Alu elements (belonging to the SINE family), and some of the edits occurred in miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). Since G and U can form the so-called G-U wobble base pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), those U-to-C or A-to-G substitutions can, in theory, target similar sequences and exert regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>), suggesting that the evolving miRNA sequences could target not only the original sequences but also new sites with similar sequences. Consistent with this notion, the predicted target genes of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family in mice can also be found in rats and humans, suggesting the target genes are shared across species despite the quick divergence of the miRNA sequences across species. This is also supported by our data showing that the binding sites for the <italic>miR-506</italic> family of miRNAs are more conserved than the surrounding, non-targeting regions in the 3’UTRs of the predicted target mRNAs. Furthermore, seed sequences among some <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs remain the same despite the high divergence of these miRNAs, and these conserved seed sequences appear to be present in the dominant mature miRNAs. Thus, the seed region of these miRNAs appears to have undergone strong selection. Supporting this notion, previous studies have shown correlations between miRNA expression and the evolution of miRNAs and target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). In general, miRNAs repress their target gene expression. However, numerous studies have also shown that some miRNAs, such as human <italic>miR-369-3</italic>, <italic>Let-7</italic>, and <italic>miR-373</italic>, mouse <italic>miR-34/449</italic> and the <italic>miR-506</italic> family, and the synthetic miRNA <italic>miRcxcr4</italic>, activate gene expression both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>). Earlier reports have shown that these miRNAs can upregulate their target gene expression, either by recruiting <italic>FXR1</italic>, targeting promoters, or sequestering RNA subcellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). Of interest, miRNAs with the same seed sequences may exert divergent functions. For example, the mature <italic>miR-465a</italic>, <italic>miR-465b</italic>, and <italic>miR-465c</italic> only have a few mismatches outside of the seed region, but only <italic>miR-465c</italic> exerts functional activation of <italic>Egr1</italic>. A similar effect has also been reported in the <italic>miR-465</italic> cluster on the <italic>Alkbh1</italic> 3’UTR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Similarly, despite the same seed sequences in the <italic>miR-465</italic> or <italic>miR-743</italic> cluster, <italic>miR-465a</italic> and <italic>miR-465c</italic> have differential activating effects on the 3’UTR of <italic>Crisp1</italic>, and <italic>miR-743a</italic> and <italic>miR-743b</italic> exert opposite effects on the <italic>Crisp1</italic> 3’UTR, further confirming their functional divergence. Therefore, the sequences outside of the miRNA seed region may play an important role in their functions, which have also been observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>). To unequivocally demonstrate the physiological role of miRNAs, it would be ideal to delete not only the miRNAs but also their binding sites in their target transcripts <italic>in vivo</italic>. A few previous studies have established the miRNA: target relationship by deleting the miRNA-binding sites in target transcripts in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>), but similar studies have not been reported in mice or humans. The strategy may work in mRNAs with 3’UTRs containing only one or two miRNA-binding sites, but for more complex 3’UTRs of mRNAs in mice and humans that often contain multiple binding sites for the same or different miRNAs, deletion of one miRNA binding site may not cause any discernable effects as the loss of function can easily be compensated by other miRNAs. Nevertheless, by deleting all five highly expressed clusters of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family one by one, we were able to overcome the compensatory effects among the family members/clusters and successfully revealed the physiological role of this miRNA family. Based on small RNA-seq, some FmiRs, e.g., <italic>miR-201</italic> and <italic>miR-547</italic>, were upregulated in the SmiRs KO mice, suggesting that this small cluster may act in concert with the other 5 clusters and thus, worth further investigation.</p>
<p>It is well-known that mice in the wild are promiscuous, and one female often mates with multiple males sequentially, giving rise to polyandrous litters derived from sperm from more than one sire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Polyandrous mating establishes a situation where sperm from multiple males co-exist in the female reproductive tract, with the most competitive ones fertilizing eggs and producing offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, a male that may be fertile in the monandrous mating scheme may rarely sire offspring in a polyandrous mating scenario, rendering this male functionally “sub-fertile” or even “infertile.” Therefore, sperm competitiveness reflects the general reproductive fitness of the male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Although the quinKO males tend to produce smaller litters under the monandrous mating scheme, their sperm counts, sperm motility and morphology are indistinguishable from those of WT sperm. This is not surprising given that miRNAs of the <italic>miR-506</italic> family most likely function to control certain non-essential aspects of spermatogenesis. Sperm can be subject to competition at multiple steps during fertilization, including their migration through the female reproductive tract (cervix, uterine cavity and oviduct), binding the cumulus-oocyte complexes, penetration of zona pellucida, etc. Therefore, IVF may not be ideal for evaluating sperm competition in the real world as it bypasses several key sites where sperm competition likely takes place. Artificial insemination (AI) may represent a better way to assess sperm competition than IVF, but it is probably less desirable than polyandrous mating for the following reasons: First, in the wild, sperm from two males rarely, if not never, enter the female reproductive tract simultaneously. We had tried to place two males into the cage with one female, but the two males ended up fighting, and the submissive one never mated. Second, sperm are delivered directly into the uterus or oviduct during AI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>), thus bypassing the potential sites for sperm competition (e.g., cervix and uterine cavity). Although our breeding scheme also involves sperm competition, by shortening the time between the two mating events in a laboratory setting, the sequential mating method reported here may be further improved to better mimic the natural polyandrous mating in the future. Moreover, future analyses of the quinKO sperm may help identify biochemical or molecular biomarkers for sperm competitiveness.</p>
<p>In summary, our data suggest that the <italic>miR-506</italic> family miRNAs are derived from the MER91C DNA transposon. These miRNAs share many of their targets and can compensate for each other’s absence, and they work jointly through regulating their target genes in spermatogenesis to ensure sperm competitiveness and male reproductive fitness.</p>

Adult (8-12 weeks of age) C57BL/6J females were injected (<italic>i.p.</italic>) with 7 IU PMSG at 8 p.m., followed by 7 IU hCG 48h later. After hCG, the first male mouse was put into the cage of one female from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next day. The first plug was marked with a marker pen. A second male mouse was then introduced into the cage of the plugged female, which was checked every 30-40 min to identify a new plug (non-marked). Females that were plugged twice were kept for producing pups for paternity analyses.</p>

<p>Adult (8-12 weeks) C57BL/6J female mice were first treated with 7 IU pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG, Cat.# HOR-272, Prospecbio) through intraperitoneal (<italic>i.p.</italic>) injection followed by <italic>i.p.</italic> injection of 7 IU hCG 48h later. Oocytes were collected from the ampulla ∼14 h after the hCG (Cat.# HOR-250, Prospecbio) treatment, and the cumulus cells surrounding oocytes were removed by treatment with bovine testicular hyaluronidase (1.5 mg/ml; Cat.# H3506, Sigma,) in M2 (Cat.# MR-015-D, Millipore) at 37°C for 2 min. The cumulus-free oocytes were washed and kept in equilibrated HTF (Cat# MR-070-D, Millipore) at a density of 20-30 oocytes per 60 µl HTF at 37°C in an incubator with air containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub> prior to IVF. Cauda epididymal sperm were collected in 100 µl of equilibrated HTF medium, allowing spermatozoa to capacitate for ∼30 min at 37°C in an incubator containing 5% CO2 air. After capacitation, spermatozoa (2 µl) were diluted by 10 folds and subjected to computer-assisted sperm analyses (CASA) using the Sperm Analyzer Mouse Traxx (Hamilton-Thorne). Based on the sperm concentration, an aliquot of 2.5 x 10<sup>8</sup> spermatozoa was added into each HTF-oocytes drop (∼60µl) for IVF. ∼4 h later, zygotes were washed and cultured in KSOM+AA (Cat.# MR-121-D, Millipore) until the blastocyst stage at 37°C in an incubator with air containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The 2-cell embryos were counted 24-26 h after IVF, and blastocysts were counted and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope 70-72 h after IVF.</p>

<title>Artificial insemination (AI)</title>
<p>At least 2-month-old female CD1 or C57BL/6J mice were administrated with 2.5 IU of PMSG (Cat.# HOR-272, Prospecbio) at 5:30 PM 3 days before artificial insemination, followed by 2.5 IU of hCG (Cat.# HOR-250, Prospecbio) at 5:00 PM 1 day prior to AI. The next morning at 8:00 AM, ∼2-month-old mTmG and quinKO male mice were sacrificed, the cauda epididymis was dissected, and fat tissue and blood were removed before placing the cauda epididymis into 500μl or 150μl of EmbryoMax® Human Tubal Fluid (HTF) (1X) (Cat.# MR-070-D, Millipore Sigma) containing 4mg/ml BSA (Cat.# 12659-250GM, EMD Millipore Corp.) (HTF-BSA) covered with 4 ml of mineral oil (Cat.# M8410-500ML, Sigma). Three incisions were made on the cauda to allow sperm to swim out and to get capacitated for at least 30 min. 25 μl of mTmG and 25 μl quinKO sperm suspensions were mixed, and 40μl (if using 500 μl HTF-BSA) or 25μl (if using 150 μl HTF-BSA) of the mixed sperm were delivered to superovulated females using C&amp;I Device for Mice (Cat.# 60020, Paratech) at 9:00 AM. Recipients were immediately paired with vasectomized males overnight. The next day, the plug was checked and the female mice with plugs were used for collecting embryonic day 10 (E10) embryos, and the ones without plugs were used for collecting zygotes, 2-cell embryos, morulae, or blastocysts embryos.</p>

For each KO mouse sample, the genes with a fold change ≥ 2 and FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered DEGs. The DEGs in each KO mouse were then intersected with the corresponding miRNA targets predicted by four different algorithms, including TargetScan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.org">microrna.org</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), miRWalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), and mirDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). The gene is considered a putative target (differentially expressed target, DETs) as long as it intersects with the targets predicted by any method mentioned above.

<p>Wang et al investigated the evolution, expression, and function of the X-linked miR-506 miRNA family. They showed that the miR-506 family underwent rapid evolution. They provided evidence that miR-506 appeared to have originated from the MER91C DNA transposons. Human MER91C transposon produced mature miRNAs when expressed in cultured cells. A series of mouse mutants lacking individual clusters, a combination of clusters, and the entire X-linked cluster (all 22 miRNAs) were generated and characterized. The mutant mice lacking four or more miRNA clusters showed reduced reproductive fitness (litter size reduction). They further showed that the sperm from these mutants were less competitive in polyandrous mating tests. RNA-seq revealed the impact of deletion of miR-506 on the testicular transcriptome. Bioinformatic analysis analyzed the relationship among miR-506 binding, transcriptomic changes, and target sequence conservation. The miR-506-deficient mice did not have apparent effect on sperm production, motility, and morphology. Lack of severe phenotypes is typical for miRNA mutants in other species as well. However, the miR-506-deficient males did exhibit reduced litter size, such an effect would have been quite significant in an evolutionary time scale. The number of mouse mutants and sequencing analysis represent a tour de force.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is a comprehensive investigation of the X-linked miR-506 miRNA family. It provides important insights into the evolution and function of the miR-506 family.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors conducted a comprehensive study of the X-linked miR-506 family miRNAs in mice on its origin, evolution, expression, and function. They demonstrate that the X-linked miR-506 family, predominantly expressed in the testis, may be derived from MER91C DNA transposons and further expanded by retrotransposition. By genetic deletion of different combinations of 5 major clusters of this miRNA family in mice, they found these miRNAs are not required for spermatogenesis. However, by further examination, the mutant mice show mild fertility problem and inferior sperm competitiveness. The authors conclude that the X-linked miR-506 miRNAs finetune spermatogenesis to enhance sperm competition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive study with extensive computational and genetic dissection of the X-linked miR-506 family providing a holistic view of its evolution and function in mice. The finding that this family miRNAs could enhance sperm competition is interesting and could explain their roles in finetuning germ cell gene expression to regulate reproductive fitness.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

It provides important insights into the evolution and function of the miR-506 family.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this preprint are mostly supported by the data except being noted below. Some descriptions need to be revised for accuracy.</p>
<p>L219-L285: The conclusion that X-linked miR-506 family miRNAs are expanded via LINE1 retrotransposition is not supported by the data. LINE1s and SINEs are very abundant, accounting for nearly 30% of the genome. In addition, the LINE1 content of the mammalian X chromosome is twice that of the autosomes. One can easily find flanking LINE1/SINE repeat. Therefore, the analyses in Fig. 2G, Fig. 2H and Fig. S3 are not informative. In order to claim LINE1-mediated retrotransposition, it is necessary to show the hallmarks of LINE1 retrotransposition, which are only possible for new insertions. The X chromosome is known to be enriched for testis-specific multi-copy genes that are expressed in round spermatids (PMID: 18454149). The conclusion on the LINE1-mediated expansion of miR-506 family on the X chromosome is not supported by the data and does not add additional insights. I think that the LINE1 related figure panels and description (L219-L285) need to be deleted. In discussion (L557558), &quot;...and subsequently underwent sequence divergence via LINE1-mediated retrotransposition during evolution&quot; should also be deleted. This section (L219-L285) needs to deal only with the origin of miR506 from MER91C DNA transposons, which is both convincing and informative.</p>

<p>Reply: Agreed, the corresponding sentences were deleted.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig. 3A: can you speculate/discuss why the miR-506 expression in sperm is higher than in round spermatids?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: RNAs are much less abundant in sperm than in somatic or spermatogenic cells (~1/100). Spermborne small RNAs represent a small fraction of total small RNAs expressed in their precursor spermatogenic cells, including spermatocytes and spermatids. Therefore, when the same amount of total/small RNAs are used for quantitative analyses, sperm-borne small RNAs (e.g., miR-506 family miRNAs) would be proportionally enriched in sperm compared to other spermatogenic cells. We discussed this point in the text (Lines 550-556).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>**Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</p>
<p>In this paper, Wang and collaborators characterize the rapid evolution of the X-linked miR-506 cluster in mammals and characterize the functional reference of depleting a few or most of the miRNAs in the cluster. The authors show that the cluster originated from the MER91C DNA transposon and provide some evidence that it might have expanded through the retrotransposition of adjacent LINE1s. Although the animals depleted of most miRNAs in the cluster show normal sperm parameters, the authors observed a small but significant reduction in litter size. The authors then speculate that the depletion of most miRNAs in the cluster could impair sperm competitiveness in polyandrous mating. Using a successive mating protocol, they show that, indeed, sperm lacking most X-linked miR-506 family members is outcompeted by wild-type sperm. The authors then analyze the evolution of the miR-506 cluster and its predicted targets. They conclude that the main difference between mice and humans is the expansion of the number of target sites per transcript in humans.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the paper are, in most cases, supported by the data; however, a more precise and indepth analysis would have helped build a more convincing argument in most cases.</p>
<p>(1) In the abstracts and throughout the manuscript, the authors claim that &quot;... these X-linked miRNA-506 family miRNA [...] have gained more targets [...] &quot; while comparing the human miRNA-506 family to the mouse. An alternative possibility is that the mouse has lost some targets. A proper analysis would entail determining the number of targets in the mouse and human common ancestor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: This question alerted us that we did not describe our conclusion accurately, causing confusion for this reviewer. Our data suggest that although the sheer number of target genes remains the same between humans and mice, the human X-linked miR-506 family targets a greater number of genes than the murine counterpart on a per miRNA basis. In other words, mice never lost any targets compared to humans, but per the miR-506 family miRNA tends to target more genes in humans than in mice.</p>
<p>We revised the text to more accurately report our data. The pertaining text (lines 490-508) now reads: “Furthermore, we analyzed the number of all potential targets of the miR-506 family miRNAs predicted by the aforementioned four algorithms among humans, mice, and rats. The total number of targets for all the X-linked miR-506 family miRNAs among different species did not show significant enrichment in humans (Fig. S9C), suggesting the sheer number of target genes does not increase in humans. We then compared the number of target genes per miRNA. When comparing the number of target genes per miRNA for all the miRNAs (baseline) between humans and mice, we found that on a per miRNA basis, human miRNAs have more targets than murine miRNAs (p&lt;0.05, t-test) (Fig. S9D), consistent with higher biological complexity in humans. This became even more obvious for the X-linked miR-506 family (p&lt;0.05, t-test) (Fig. S9D). In humans, the X-linked miR-506 family, on a per miRNA basis, targets a significantly greater number of genes than the average of all miRNAs combined (p&lt;0.05, t-test) (Fig. S9D). In contrast, in mice, we observed no significant difference in the number of targets per miRNA between X-linked miRNAs and all of the mouse miRNAs combined (mouse baseline) (Fig. S9D). These results suggest that although the sheer number of target genes remains the same between humans and mice, the human X-linked miR-506 family targets a greater number of genes than the murine counterpart on a per miRNA basis.”</p>
<p>We also changed “have gained” to “have” throughout the text to avoid confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors claim that the miRNA cluster expanded through L1 retrotransposition. However, the possibility of an early expansion of the cluster before the divergence of the species while the MER91C DNA transposon was active was not evaluated. Although L1 likely contributed to the diversity within mammals, the generalization may not apply to all species. For example, SINEs are closer on average than L1s to the miRNAs in the SmiR subcluster in humans and dogs, and the horse SmiR subcluster seems to have expanded by a TE-independent mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Agreed. We deleted the data mentioned by this reviewer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Some results are difficult to reconcile and would have benefited from further discussion. The miR-465 sKO has over two thousand differentially expressed transcripts and no apparent phenotype. Also, the authors show a sharp downregulation of CRISP1 at the RNA and protein level in the mouse. However, most miRNAs of the cluster increase the expression of Crisp1 on a reporter assay. The only one with a negative impact has a very mild effect. miRNAs are typically associated with target repression; however, most of the miRNAs analyzed in this study activate transcript expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Both mRNA and protein levels of Crisp1 were downregulated in KO mice, and these results are consistent with the luciferase data showing overexpression of these miRNAs upregulated the Crisp1 3’UTR luciferase activity. We agree that miRNAs usually repress target gene expression. However, numerous studies have also shown that some miRNAs, such as human miR-369-3, Let-7, and miR-373, mouse miR-34/449 and the miR-506 family, and the synthetic miRNA miRcxcr4,  activate gene expression both in vitro (1, 2) and in vivo (3-6). Earlier reports have shown that these miRNAs can upregulate their target gene expression, either by recruiting FXR1, targeting promoters, or sequestering RNA subcellular locations (1, 2, 6). We briefly discussed this in the text (Lines 605-611).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) More information is required to interpret the results of the differential RNA targeting by the murine and human miRNA-506 family. The materials and methods section needs to explain how the authors select their putative targets. In the text, they mention the use of four different prediction programs. Are they considering all sites predicted by any method, all sites predicted simultaneously by all methods, or something in between? Also, what are they considering as a &quot;shared target&quot; between mice and humans? Is it a mRNA that any miR-506 family member is targeting? Is it a mRNA targeted by the same miRNA in both species? Does the targeting need to occur in the same position determined by aligning the different 3'UTRs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Since each prediction method has its merit, we included all putative targets predicted by any of the four methods. The &quot;shared target&quot; refers to a mRNA that any miR-506 family member targets because the miR-506 family is highly divergent among different species. We have added the information to the “Large and small RNA-seq data analysis” section in Materials and Methods (Lines 871-882).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors highlight the particular evolution of the cluster derived from a transposable element. Given the tendency of transposable elements to be expressed in germ cells, the family might have originated to repress the expression of the elements while still active but then remained to control the expression of the genes where the element had been inserted. The authors did not evaluate the expression of transcripts containing the transposable element or discuss this possibility. The authors proposed an expansion of the target sites in humans. However, whether this expansion was associated with the expansion of the TE in humans was not discussed either. Clarifying whether the transposable element was still active after the divergence of the mouse and human lineages would have been informative to address this outstanding issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Agreed. The MER91C DNA transposon is denoted as nonautonomous (7); however, whether it was active during the divergence of mouse and human lineages is unknown. To determine whether the expansion of the target sites in humans was due to the expansion of the MER91C DNA transposon, we analyzed the MER91C DNA transposon-containing transcripts and associated them with our DETs. Of interest, 28 human and 3 mouse mRNAs possess 3’UTRs containing MER91C DNA sequences, and only
3 and 0 out of those 28 and 3 genes belonged to DETs in humans and mice, respectively (Fig. S9E), suggesting a minimal effect of MER91C DNA transposon expansion on the number of target sites. We briefly discussed this in the text (Lines 511-518).</p>

<p>Post-transcriptional regulation is exceptionally complex in male haploid cells, and the functional relevance of many regulatory pathways remains unclear. This manuscript, together with recent findings on the role of piRNA clusters, starts to clarify the nature of the selective pressure that shapes the evolution of small RNA pathways in the male germ line.</p>

<p>Reply: Agreed. We appreciate your insightful comments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors conducted a comprehensive study of the X-linked miR-506 family miRNAs in mice on its origin, evolution, expression, and function. They demonstrate that the X-linked miR-506 family, predominantly expressed in the testis, may be derived from MER91C DNA transposons and further expanded by retrotransposition. By genetic deletion of different combinations of 5 major clusters of this miRNA family in mice, they found these miRNAs are not required for spermatogenesis. However, by further examination, the mutant mice show mild fertility problem and inferior sperm competitiveness. The authors conclude that the X-linked miR-506 miRNAs finetune spermatogenesis to enhance sperm competition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive study with extensive computational and genetic dissection of the X-linked miR506 family providing a holistic view of its evolution and function in mice. The finding that this family miRNAs could enhance sperm competition is interesting and could explain their roles in finetuning germ cell gene expression to regulate reproductive fitness.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors specifically addressed the function of 5 clusters of X-link miR-506 family containing 19 miRNAs. There is another small cluster containing 3 miRNAs close to the Fmr1 locus. Would this small cluster act in concert with the 5 clusters to regulate spermatogenesis? In addition, any autosomal miR-506 like miRNAs may compensate for the loss of X-linked miR-506 family. These possibilities should be discussed.</p>

<p>Reply: The three FmiRs were not deleted in this study because the SmiRs are much more abundant than the FmiRs in WT mice (Author Response image 1, heatmap version of Fig. 5C). Based on small RNA-seq, some FmiRs, e.g., miR-201 and miR-547, were upregulated in the SmiRs KO mice, suggesting that this small cluster may act in concert with the other 5 clusters and thus, worth further investigation. To our best knowledge, all the miR-506 family miRNAs are located on the X chromosome, although some other miRNAs were upregulated in the KO mice, they don’t belong to the miR-506 family. We briefly discussed this point in the text (Lines 635-638).</p>

<p>Direct molecular link to sperm competitiveness defect remains unclear but is difficult to address.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: In this study, we identified a target of the miR-506 family, i.e. Crisp1. KO of Crisp1 in mice, or inhibition of CRISP1 in human sperm (7, 8), appears to phenocopy the quinKO mice, displaying largely normal sperm motility but compromised ability to penetrate eggs. The detailed mechanism warrants further investigation in the future.</p>

<p>Lines 84-85: &quot;Several cellular events are unique to the male germ cells, e.g., meiosis, genetic recombination, and haploid male germ cell differentiation (also called spermiogenesis)&quot;. This statement is not accurate. Please revise. Meiosis and genetic recombination are common to both male and female germ cells. They are highly conserved in both sexes in many species including mouse.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Agreed. We have revised the sentence and it now reads: “Several cellular events are unique to the male germ cells, e.g., postnatal formation of the adult male germline stem cells (i.e., spermatogonia stem cells), pubertal onset of meiosis, and haploid male germ cell differentiation (also called spermiogenesis) (9)” (Lines 83-86).</p>

<p>Lines 163-164: &quot;we found that Slitrk2 and Fmr1 were syntenically linked to autosomes in zebrafish and birds (Fig. 1A), but had migrated onto the X chromosome in most mammals&quot;. This description is not accurate. Chr 4 in zebrafish and birds is syntenic to the X chromosome in mammals. The term &quot;migrated&quot; is not appropriate. Suggestion: Slitrk2 and Fmr1 mapped to Chr 4 (syntenic with mammalian X chromosome) in zebrafish and birds but to the X chromosome in most mammals.</p>

<p>Reply: Agreed. Revised as suggested.</p>

<p>(1) In the significance statement, the authors mention that the mutants are &quot;functionally infertile,&quot; although the decrease in competitiveness is partial. I suggest referring to them as &quot;functionally sub-fertile.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Agreed. Revised as suggested.</p>

<p>(2) I will urge the authors to explain in more detail how some figures are generated and what they mean. Some critical information needs to be included in various panels.</p>
<p>(2a) Figure S1. The phastCons track does not seem to align as expected with the rest of the figure. The highest conservation peak is only present in humans, and the sequence conserved in the sea turtle has the lowest phastCons score. I was expecting the opposite from the explanation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: The tracks for phyloP and phastCons are the scores for all 100 species, whereas the tracks with the species names on the left are the corresponding sequences aligned to the human genome. We have revised our figure to make it clearer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2b) Figure 2A and Figure S2C. Although all the functional analysis of the manuscript has been done in mice, the alignments showing sequence conservation do not include the murine miRNAs. Please include the mouse miRNAs in these panels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: The mouse has Mir-506-P7 with the conserved miRNA-3P seed region, which was included in the lower panel in Figure S2C. However, mice do not have Mir-506-P6, which may have been lost or too divergent to be recognized during the evolution and thus, were not included in Figure 2A and the upper panel in Figure S2C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2c) Figure S7H. The panel could be easier to read.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Agreed. We combined all the same groups and turned Figure S7H (now Figure S6H) into a heatmap.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2d) The legend of Figure 6G reads, &quot;The number of target sites within individual target mRNAs in both humans and mice .&quot; Can the author explain why the value 1 of the human &quot;Number of target sites&quot; is connected to virtually all the &quot;Number of target sites&quot; values in mice?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Sorry for the confusion. For example, for gene 1, we have 1 target site in the human and 1 target site in the mouse; but for gene 2, we have 1 target site in the human and multiple sites in the mouse; therefore, the value 1 is connected to more than one value in the mouse.</p>

<p>CRISP1 and EGR1 protein localization in WT and mutant sperm by immunostaining would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: Agreed. We performed immunostaining for CRISP1 on WT sperm, and the new results are presented in Figure S8D. CRISP1 seems mainly expressed in the principal piece and head of sperm.</p>

<p>The detailed description of the generation of various mutant lines should be included in the Methods.</p>
