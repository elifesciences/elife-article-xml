<title>Abstract</title><p>Nutrient limitation is a characteristic feature of poorly perfused tumors. In contrast to well-perfused tissues, nutrient deficits in tumors perturb cellular metabolic activity, which imposes metabolic constraints on cancer cells. The metabolic constraints created by the tumor microenvironment can lead to vulnerabilities in cancers. Identifying the metabolic constraints of the tumor microenvironment and the vulnerabilities that arise in cancers can provide new insight into tumor biology and identify promising antineoplastic targets. To identify how the microenvironment constrains the metabolism of pancreatic tumors, we challenged pancreatic cancer cells with microenvironmental nutrient levels and analyzed changes in cell metabolism. We found that arginine limitation in pancreatic tumors perturbs saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid synthesis by suppressing the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1. Synthesis of these fatty acids is critical for maintaining a balance of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes. As a consequence of microenvironmental constraints on fatty acid synthesis, pancreatic cancer cells and tumors are unable to maintain lipid homeostasis when exposed to polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to cell death by ferroptosis. In sum, arginine restriction in the tumor microenvironment constrains lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancers, which renders these tumors vulnerable to polyunsaturated-enriched fat sources.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tissues are fed by perfusion from the circulatory system. This delivers nutrients and removes waste to meet the metabolic demands of the tissue. Normal vasculature supports effective perfusion and results in tissue microenvironments that are in metabolic equilibrium with the circulatory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In contrast to healthy tissues, many tumors have abnormal and dysfunctional vasculature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This is especially true for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC), which are amongst the least vascularized tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The limited blood vessels that do infiltrate PDAC tumors are largely collapsed and non-functional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. This dysfunctional vasculature, coupled with high metabolic activity of malignant and stromal cells in tumors, results in a tumor microenvironment (TME) that is not in metabolic equilibrium with the circulation and has substantially different nutrient levels than healthy tissues. Analysis of tumor interstitial fluid (TIF), the local perfusate of the TME, confirms that metabolite availability in the TME of many solid tumors is substantially different from metabolite levels in the circulatory system and healthy tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, abnormal vasculature limits perfusion in tumors, resulting in abnormal nutrient availability in the TME.</p>
<p>Limited perfusion of the TME alters cancer cell metabolism by subjecting cancer cells to nutrient limitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Cancer cells must adapt to these metabolic constraints to survive and proliferate in the TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Since healthy tissues do not face these constraints or require similar adaptive mechanisms, such adaptations could be novel anti-neoplastic drug targets that may be targetable with a wide therapeutic index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. As a result, there is a significant interest in understanding how cancers adapt to TME metabolic stresses. However, both the metabolic landscape of the TME and the consequent adaptations by tumors are poorly defined.</p>
<p>We sought to identify how abnormal nutrient levels in the TME constrain the metabolism of PDAC tumors. To do so, we measured nutrient concentrations in TIF from murine models of PDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We then developed a cell culture medium termed Tumor Interstitial Fluid Medium (TIFM) that contains PDAC TIF levels of nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. This medium allows ex vivo culture and analysis of cells challenged with TME nutrient constraints. Additionally, as the medium is chemically defined, TIFM enables identification of specific nutrient stresses that drive phenotypes in malignant PDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> or stromal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we performed transcriptomic and metabolic analysis of PDAC cells in TIFM and animal models of PDAC. We found that nutrient stress in the TME inhibits fatty acid synthesis so acutely that it causes PDAC cells to rely on exogenous fatty acids for growth. Mechanistically, we found arginine restriction inhibits fatty acid synthesis by suppression of the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP1. Furthermore, we found these TME constraints on fatty acid synthesis challenge the ability of PDAC to maintain lipid homeostasis. Cells must tightly regulate the saturation of fatty acids in cellular lipids to ensure homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Fatty acid synthesis generates saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids that allow cells to prevent toxic fatty acid imbalances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, which can be brought upon by exposure to exogenous fatty acid sources enriched in either highly saturated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> or polyunsaturated fats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We found that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis, due to arginine deprivation, renders both cultured PDAC cells and tumors incapable of buffering their lipidome from exposure to exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids. Collectively, this work delineates how arginine limitation, a metabolic limitation of the TME, constrains PDAC fatty acid synthesis, rendering these tumors vulnerable to dietary interventions that alter lipid saturation in tumors.</p>

<title>Physiological nutrient availability perturbs <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis in PDAC cancer cells by reducing SREBP1 protein expression</title>
<p>To study how nutrient availability in the TME impacts PDAC biology, we previously developed Tumor Interstitial Fluid Medium (TIFM) that enables culture of cells in nutrient levels representative of the murine PDAC TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We then derived paired cell lines from murine <italic>LSL-Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup>; Trp53<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Pdx-1-Cre</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> tumors in standard cell culture medium (RPMI-1640; herein RPMI) or TIFM, termed mPDAC-RPMI or mPDAC-TIFM cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We performed transcriptomic analysis of these cell lines to identify pathways altered by nutrient availability in the TME in PDAC cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> identified significant changes in a metabolic pathways in mPDAC-TIFM cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Sets of SREBP target genes, a transcription factor involved in lipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, were three of the most downregulated metabolic gene sets in TIFM cultured cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-D</xref>). Analysis of transcriptomic data from mPDAC3-RPMI cells either cultured in standard media or grown as an orthotopic allograft tumor in mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> showed that SREBP target gene expression is similarly downregulated in PDAC cells in vivo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F,G</xref>). Together, these data indicate that nutrient availability in the TME, modeled in TIFM, suppresses SREBP target gene expression. To see if the TME suppresses SREBP target gene expression in human tumors, we used MERAV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> to compare transcriptomic data from primary PDAC specimens and human PDAC cell lines. We found that PDAC tumors exhibit markedly lower SREBP target gene expression than that of PDAC cell lines grown in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H,I</xref>). SREBP targets and lipid synthesis genes are also downregulated in murine PDAC compared to healthy pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and analysis of Human Protein Atlas data indicates that protein expression of SREBP target genes is decreased in PDAC compared to normal pancreases (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 â Figure supplement 1A</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that the TME suppresses SREBP target gene expression in murine and human PDAC, and that TIF nutrient availability is sufficient to downregulate expression of SREBP target genes.</p>

<p>SREBP transcription factors act as master regulators of lipid synthesis by facilitating the transcription of genes important for fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. There are two major isoforms of SREBP: SREBP1, which primarily controls fatty acid synthesis by enhancing the transcription of fatty acid synthesis proteins, and SREBP2, which mainly controls expression proteins involved in sterol synthesis and uptake. Analysis of SREBP1-specific and SREBP2-specific transcripts in mPDAC cells indicated that SREBP1 targets were specifically downregulated by TIFM culture (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 â Figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, we focused our studies on SREBP1 regulation in the PDAC TME.</p>
<p>SREBP activity is regulated both by modulation of SREBP1 expression and by proteolytic processing of SREBP to the mature nuclear localized transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. To determine how TME nutrients regulate SREBP1, we performed immunoblotting for SREBP1 in mPDAC cells cultured in TIFM and RPMI. Both full length and mature SREBP1 protein levels were significantly lower in TIFM-cultured mPDAC cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). In contrast, the ratio of mature to full length SREBP1 (a proxy of proteolytic activation of SREBP1) was not significantly different in TIFM cultured cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). We also assessed if TIFM culture affects human PDAC SREBP1 levels. We found that human PDAC cells in TIFM similarly have lower levels of full-length and mature SREBP1 (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 â Figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, the major mechanism by which nutrient stress in the TME suppresses SREBP1 in murine and human PDAC is by regulating SREBP1 expression rather than processing.</p>
<p>Lastly, given the suppression of SREBP1, we assessed whether TIFM culture suppresses fatty acid biosynthesis. To do this, we performed deuterium stable isotope labeling of fatty acids in cells cultured in TIFM or in standard cell culture media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We found that mPDAC cells cultured in TIFM synthesize fewer fatty acids than cells cultured in standard media (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1L</xref>), and that synthesized fatty acids represent a smaller fraction of the cellular fatty acid pool (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 â Figure supplement 1D</xref>). Similarly, human PDAC cells in TIFM synthesize fewer fatty acids than when cultured in standard conditions (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 â Figure supplement 1E</xref>) and synthesis is a smaller contributor to cellular fatty acid pool (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 â Figure supplement 1F</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that physiological nutrient stress in the PDAC TME reduces SREBP1 activity and fatty acid biosynthesis in PDAC cells.</p>

<title>Arginine restriction reduces SREBP1-mediated fatty acid synthesis in PDAC</title>
<p>TIFM and standard media, such as RPMI, differ both in the concentration of shared nutrients and the presence of nutrients unique to TIFM (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 â Figure supplement 1A</xref>). We sought to identify the specific changes in nutrient availability responsible for decreased SREBP1-mediated fatty acid synthesis in PDAC. To develop a high throughput assay to assess SREBP1 expression and fatty acid synthesis in culture, we reasoned that mPDAC cells cultured in TIFM would be unable to grow without exogenous lipids, while mPDAC cells in RPMI could grow normally in the absence of exogenous lipids. To test this hypothesis, we chemically stripped lipids from FBS to make TIFM and RPMI media with depleted levels of exogenous lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. We then compared cell growth of mPDAC cells cultured in each medium with or without depletion of exogenous lipids. As predicted, we found that mPDAC cells deprived of exogenous lipids in TIFM grew significantly slower compared with cells cultured in RPMI (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 â Figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>We then used this assay to identify which nutrients in TIFM are responsible for perturbing fatty acid synthesis in PDAC. TIFM was constructed using separate nutrient pools that are readily swappable with their RPMI counterparts (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 â Figure supplement 1C</xref>). This allows us to systematically grow mPDAC cells with different pools of TME nutrients and identify the subset of nutrients responsible for a phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, such as ability to grow without exogenous lipids. Once a subset of phenotype-driving nutrients is identified, further subsets or individual metabolites from the pool can be assessed. Using this approach we identified differences in arginine levels between TIFM and RPMI as a major driver of the ability of mPDAC cells to grow without exogenous lipids (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 â Figure supplement 1D</xref>). Arginine is present in TIFM at the pathophysiologically low TME concentration of 2.27 ÂµM while it is at the supraphysiological concentration of 1149 ÂµM in RPMI. This led us to hypothesize that arginine deprivation in TIFM was responsible for decreased SREBP1 activity and fatty acid synthesis in PDAC cells under nutrient stress in the TME. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that supplementing TIFM with arginine increased SREBP1 protein abundance to levels comparable to RPMI-cultured mPDAC cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This was accompanied by an increase in fatty acid synthesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Arginine restriction also lowers SREBP1 levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and fatty acid synthesis in RPMI cultured mPDAC cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Altogether, this data suggests that arginine restriction suppresses SREBP1 and fatty acid synthesis in PDAC cells.</p>
<p>We next sought to determine whether arginine deprivation suppresses SREBP1 and fatty acid biosynthesis in vivo. We previously found that arginine is depleted in PDAC tumors due to arginase-1 activity from myeloid cells in the PDAC TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We established orthotopic allograft tumors by implanting YFP labeled mPDAC cells in <italic>Lyz2-Cre<sup>+/+</sup>; Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, which harbor myeloid cell specific arginase-1 knockout, or control <italic>Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). We confirmed that loss of myeloid arginase-1 increases arginine in the interstitial fluid of murine PDAC tumors to plasma levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, this animal model allows us to compare PDAC tumors with or without arginine restriction in the TME. We examined SREBP1 levels by immunofluorescence (IF) as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> in sections from PDAC tumors from <italic>Lyz2-Cre<sup>+/+</sup>; Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> hosts. We found increased levels of SREBP1 in PDAC cells from arginase-1 knockout hosts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). IF analysis of tissues with high and low expression of SREBP1 confirmed that the antibody and IF protocol we used yields signals proportional to tissue SREBP1 expression (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 â Figure supplement 2</xref>). To determine if arginine restriction in the TME affects fatty acid synthesis in PDAC, we administered deuterated water to PDAC bearing mice as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. We then sorted PDAC cells from the tumors and assessed incorporation of deuterium into fatty acids, as a measure of fatty acid synthesis. We found that mPDAC cells from <italic>Lyz2-Cre<sup>+/+</sup>; Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> hosts had increased fatty acid synthesis compared to control hosts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Importantly, label incorporation in circulating fatty acids was not different between <italic>Lyz2-Cre<sup>+/+</sup>; Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and control animals. This suggests the difference in fatty acid labeling we see in mPDAC cells from <italic>Lyz2-Cre<sup>+/+</sup>; Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and control mice is not due to uptake of differently labeled fatty acids from the circulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Altogether, these data show that arginine deprivation reduces the expression of SREBP1 in PDAC cancer cells both in TIFM and in vivo, leading to the suppression fatty acid synthesis.</p>

<title>SREBP1 inactivation by arginine deprivation in the TME leads to changes in cellular lipidome</title>
<p>We observed that arginine restriction in the TME reduces fatty acid synthetic capacity in PDAC cells. As a result, we expected arginine restriction would lead to changes in the cellular lipidome. To determine if arginine affected the PDAC cellular lipidome, we performed mass spectrometry-based lipidomics analysis of mPDAC cells in TIFM, RPMI and TIFM supplemented with arginine (TIFM + arg). De novo lipogenesis generates saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) in mammalian cells, while essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and their derivatives are primarily taken up from the cellular environment. Therefore, we reasoned that arginine deprivation, by inhibiting SREBP1 and de novo lipogenesis, would lead to an increase in the ratio of PUFAs to MUFAs (PUFA/MUFA) in PDAC cellular lipids. Consistent with this hypothesis, analysis of PUFA, MUFA, SFA abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> in the PDAC lipidome showed that TIFM cultured cells had a higher PUFA/MUFA ratio than cells cultured in standard media or TIFM + arg (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Interestingly, this increase in PUFA/MUFA ratio is not apparent across all lipid species. Arginine starved PDAC cells have increased PUFA/MUFA ratio in certain lipid species (triglycerides [TG], phosphatidylethanolamines [PE], diacylglycerols [DG], ceramides [Cer], and sphingomyelin [SM]) but not others (phosphatidylcholines [PC], cholesterol esters [ChE], Hexosylceramides [Hex1-Cer], lysophosphatidylcholines [LPC] and lysophosphatidylethanolamines [LPE]) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Arginine starved PDAC cells also had other lipidomic features of impaired fatty acid synthesis. Cells with impaired fatty acid synthesis accumulate TG in lipid droplets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. TIFM cultured cells also had higher levels of most TG species than mPDAC cells cultured in RPMI or TIFM + arg (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Consistent with the increase in TGs, TIFM cultured cells also contained more lipid droplets (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 â Figure supplement 1</xref>). While most TG species followed this trend, ether-linked TG species were suppressed by culture in TIFM and levels of these lipids were not rescued by arginine supplementation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, this class of ether-linked neutral lipids may be regulated differently by SREBP1 than other TGs. Altogether, these data indicate that arginine restriction leads to significant changes in the PDAC lipidome, which are consistent with suppression of SREBP1 and fatty acid synthesis.</p>

<title>Arginine deprivation prevents PDAC cancer cells from adapting to changes in exogenous lipid availability</title>
<p>An important function of SREBP1 is driving transcription of lipid synthesis genes upon depletion of lipids cellular which occurs upon starvation of exogenous lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Given that arginine restriction suppresses SREBP1 in PDAC, we asked if arginine restriction in the TME would impair the ability of mPDAC cells to cope with lipid starvation. We found mPDAC cells cultured in RPMI robustly increased SREBP1 protein levels and expression of SREBP1 target genes in response to lipid depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 â Figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). In contrast, mPDAC cells in TIFM had decreased activation of SREBP1 and less induction of SREBP1 target genes in lipid depleted conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D,E</xref>). Similarly, human PDAC cells in TIFM were less able to induce SREBP1 target genes upon lipid starvation compared to human PDAC cells cultured in RPMI (<xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 â Figure supplement 2C</xref>). Addition of arginine to TIFM increased the induction of SREBP1 and SREBP1 target gene expression upon lipid starvation in mPDAC cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F,G</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with arginine restriction impairing SREBP1 induction upon lipid starvation, we found that induction of fatty acid synthesis upon lipid starvation was blunted in TIFM cultured cells and rescued by the addition of arginine to culture media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). These data reveal that arginine restriction prevents PDAC cells from responding to changes in lipid availability via SREBP1 signaling and induction of de novo lipid synthesis.</p>
<p>We next asked if impaired SREBP1 signaling and de novo lipogenesis would prevent arginine-restricted PDAC cells from maintaining lipid homeostasis under lipid starvation. To ask this, we deprived PDAC cells of lipids for 24 hours and performed lipidomic analysis. The lipidome of TIFM cultured cells was perturbed by lipid starvation, as lipid replete and lipid starved samples clustered separately in principal component analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). In contrast, lipid starvation did not lead separate clustering in PDAC cells cultured with supplemental arginine (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). Analysis of individual lipid species also indicated that more lipid species were significantly depleted upon lipid starvation in arginine-restricted cultures compared to arginine replete (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J-L</xref>) and standard media cultures (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 â Figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Neutral lipids such as TG and cholesterol esters (ChE) were particularly depleted upon lipid deprivation in TIFM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>). These effects were ameliorated by arginine addition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>) or culture in standard conditions (<xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 â Figure supplement 3B</xref>). TGs and ChEs function as lipid storage molecules that reside in lipid droplets, indicating that TIFM-cultured PDAC cells rapidly deplete these stores when deprived of lipids, whereas arginine supplemented cells are able to maintain lipid stores during starvation. Analysis of changes in the fatty acyl content of the cellular lipidome indicated that MUFA and SFA containing species were particularly depleted relative to PUFA containing species in TIFM-cultured cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 â Figure supplement 3C</xref>). This finding is consistent with arginine restriction preventing SREBP1-driven synthesis of MUFA and SFA species that enable PDAC adaptation to exogenous lipid starvation</p>
<p>Lastly, we asked if inhibition of SREBP1 signaling would prevent arginine restricted cells from being able to adapt to lipid starvation. We found that mPDAC cells cultured in TIFM cannot grow without exogenous lipids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N</xref>). In contrast, mPDAC cells cultured in TIFM with arginine supplementation can grow in the absence of lipids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N</xref>). SREBP1 is required for arginine supplementation to enable mPDAC cells to grow without exogenous lipids, as CRISPR-mediated knockout of SREBP1 prevents arginine supplemented mPDAC cells from growing upon lipid starvation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3O,P</xref>). We additionally asked if expression of mature SREBP1 would rescue lipid auxotrophy caused by arginine deprivation. However, we found that we were unable to express mature SREBP1 in TIFM-cultured mPDAC cells, despite successful overexpression in RPMI-cultured mPDAC cells (<xref rid="fig3s4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 â Figure Supplement 4</xref>). Intriguingly, this suggests that nutrient stress in the TME may select against SREBP1 expression. Altogether, this data suggests that arginine restriction alters the lipidome of PDAC, increasing PUFA and TG content, while preventing PDAC cells from adapting to changes in exogenous lipid availability.</p>

<title>Arginine deprivation prevents PDAC cells from maintaining lipid homeostasis upon exposure to exogenous PUFAs</title>
<p>We next explored the implications of SREBP1 suppression in PDAC cells exposed to nutrient stress in the TME. PUFA-enriched cells are more sensitive to ferroptosis-inducing treatments because PUFAs have increased oxidative susceptibility in the cellular lipidome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In addition to finding increased PUFA/MUFA in arginine-restricted cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,B</xref>), we also calculated the Cellular Peroxidation Index (CPI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, a metric for the oxidative potential of the lipidome, of mPDAC cells cultured in TIFM with or without supplemented arginine. We found that TIFM cells without exogenous arginine had a significantly higher CPI than those with added arginine (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Interestingly, as with PUFA/MUFA ratio (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), the increase in CPI in arginine restricted cells was not apparent in every lipid class. Specifically, TG, DG, SM and Cer species had increased CPI in arginine-restricted cultures, while PE, PC, ChE, LPC LPE and Hex1-Cer species did not have increased CPI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, given the increase in relative PUFA content and CPI, we hypothesized that arginine-restricted PDAC cells would be more sensitive to induction of ferroptosis, a form of cell death involving lipid oxidation that cells enriched in polyunsaturated lipids are prone to undergo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Surprisingly, arginine-restricted mPDAC cells were not sensitized to xCT or GPX4 inhibitors that trigger ferroptosis (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 â Figure supplement 1A-F</xref>). Thus, SREBP1-suppression by arginine restriction in the TME does not sensitize PDAC cells to ferroptosis inducers that target cysteine metabolism or GPX4.</p>

<p>Fatty acid synthesis maintains cellular lipid homeostasis by moderating the relative abundance PUFAs, MUFAs and SFAs in cellular lipids, primarily by producing MUFAs and SFAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and lowering PUFA uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Imbalanced fatty acyl species in the cellular lipidome can result in impaired membrane function and cell death by apoptosis, due to SFA toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, or ferroptosis, due to PUFA enrichment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Because arginine restriction impairs fatty acid synthesis in PDAC cells, leading them to rely on uptake of exogenous fatty acids, we reasoned that arginine restriction would render PDAC cell sensitive to exogenous lipids that are enriched in one class of fatty acids, such as PUFAs. To test this, we treated PDAC cell lines grown in TIFM with various PUFAs and measured their growth. PDAC cell lines grown in TIFM were potently sensitive to the addition of PUFAs, whereas cells grown in standard media were less affected by PUFA treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Thus, while arginine-restriction does not sensitize PDAC cells to cysteine/GPX4-targeting ferroptosis inducers, arginine-restriction does sensitize PDAC to exogenous PUFAs.</p>
<p>We next sought to understand why arginine-restricted PDAC cells are sensitive to exogenous PUFAs. We chose to focus our studies on the PUFA Î±-eleostearic acid (Î±-ESA) because TIFM cultured mPDAC cells are sensitive to this PUFA at low concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Additionally, conjugated linolenic (18:3) acids like Î±-ESA are being investigated for their anti-neoplastic activity in culture and animal models of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. We treated PDAC cells grown in TIFM or in TIFM with supplemental arginine with Î±-ESA. We found that TIFM-cultured PDAC cells were highly sensitive to Î±-ESA, as we observed previously (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4. Figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Addition of arginine significantly decreased sensitivity to Î±-ESA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Importantly, treatment with ferrostatin rescued growth Î±-ESA treated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), indicating that Î±-ESA treatment was suppressing the growth of arginine-restricted mPDAC cells by causing ferroptosis. Similarly, arginine restriction sensitized human PDAC cells to Î±-ESA induced ferroptosis (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 â Figure supplement 2C</xref>). We next found that genetic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) or pharmacological inhibition of SREBP1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>) sensitized mPDAC cells to Î±-ESA in arginine replete conditions. We also found MUFA supplementation ameliorated Î±-ESA toxicity in arginine-restricted mPDAC cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that arginine-restriction, by limiting SREBP1 activity, sensitizes PDAC to increases in exogenous PUFAs.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that arginine-restricted cells are sensitive to exogenous PUFAs because impaired SREBP1 activity and fatty acid synthesis could lead to PUFA overloading, or an increase in PUFA content that is incompatible with cellular viability. To test this, we performed lipidomic analysis on Î±-ESA-treated PDAC cells with or without supplemental arginine. In principal component analysis, Î±-ESA treated cells cluster separately from untreated samples in TIFM cultured mPDAC cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). In contrast, mPDAC cells cultured in TIFM + arg (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>) or cultured in RPMI (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 â Figure supplement 3A</xref>) do not cluster separately in this analysis.</p>
<p>This indicates that Î±-ESA treatment has a larger impact on the cellular lipidome in arginine-restricted PDAC cells compared to PDAC cells not starved of arginine. We next investigated into which classes of lipids Î±-ESA was incorporated in mPDAC cells. We found that Î±-ESA treatment primarily increased levels of 18:3 fatty acid containing TG and PE lipids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). This prompted us to analyze how arginine availability affected the impact of Î±-ESA supplementation on these lipid species. We found that arginine supplementation significantly reduced the incorporation of 18:3 fatty acids into PEs and TGs in TIFM cultured mPDAC cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Culture in RPMI similarly led to reduced 18:3 fatty acids in PE and TG species (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 â Figure supplement 3B</xref>). Along with the increase of 18:3 containing PE and TG, Î±-ESA treatment reduced levels of MUFA and SFA containing TG and PE species in TIFM cultured cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K,M</xref>). This effect was also blunted by arginine supplementation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L,N</xref>) or culture in RPMI (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 â Figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Consistent with the finding that arginine supplementation blunts both the loss of MUFA/SFA and the incorporation of Î±-ESA into lipids, arginine supplemented cells had a lower TG CPI index (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref>). Notably, the CPI of PE species was largely unaffected by both arginine and Î±-ESA supplementation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4P</xref>).</p>
<p>While polyunsaturated membrane phospholipids are thought to be primary drivers of ferroptotic cell death, recent reports indicate that neutral lipids can contribute to ferroptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. The above results indicate that Î±-ESA incorporation into TGs may contribute to ferroptotic cell death in arginine starved PDAC cells. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited diacylglyceride transferase 1 and 2 (DGAT1/2) to abrogate new synthesis of TGs and assessed the impact on Î±-ESA induction of ferroptosis in TIFM cultured cells. We found DGAT1/2 inhibition reduced the induction of ferroptosis in Î±-ESA treated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Q</xref>), which indicates that enhanced incorporation of Î±-ESA into neutral lipids contributes to ferroptosis induction by this PUFA in arginine-restricted PDAC cells. Altogether, these data show that arginine-restriction prevents cells from buffering their lipidome from exogenous PUFA supplementation, which results in PUFA overload in TGs that causes ferroptosis.</p>

<title>Arginine-restricted PDAC cells and tumors are sensitive to PUFA enriched oils</title>
<p>Many lipids in the circulation are derived from dietary sources, which makes it possible to manipulate systemic lipid availability through dietary interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. We sought to determine if arginine-restriction in the PDAC TME would sensitize PDAC tumors to increased systemic PUFA availability brought on by dietary changes. We used tung oil to test this which is rich in Î±-ESA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) and has previously been tested in animals as an anti-neoplastic dietary supplement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We found, as with purified Î±-ESA, TIFM-cultured mPDAC cells are more sensitive to ferroptosis when treated with tung oil than arginine-replete cultures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Tung oil treatment also increases 18:3 PUFA content and CPI of TGs in TIFM cultured cells, an effect which is blunted by arginine supplementation (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 â Figure Supplement 1A-D</xref>). To determine if tung oil treatment raises PUFA levels of PDAC tumors, we established orthotopic allograft tumors in mice and orally administered tung oil or safflower oil as a control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), which contains balanced contents of SFAs/MUFAs/PUFAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). To determine if tung oil administration altered circulating fatty acid levels when orally administered, we measured the fatty acid content of the plasma in safflower and tung oil treated mice. Importantly, the only fatty acid modulated in the plasma by tung oil administration was Î±-ESA, which was enriched in tung oil treated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Tung oil treatment in tumor-bearing mice led to a significant decrease in tumor mass, which correlated with plasma Î±-ESA levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E,F</xref>). Notably, tung oil administration increased the PUFA/MUFA ratio of PDAC tumors but not of healthy tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Thus, tung oil administration can be used to modulate plasma fatty acid PUFA content, specifically increase PUFA/MUFA ratio of tumors, and suppress the growth of established PDAC tumors.</p>

<p>We next asked if arginine restriction in the TME and PUFA overloading contribute to suppression of PDAC growth by dietary PUFA supplementation with tung oil.

We then treated mice with tung or safflower oil (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). After treatment, tumor mass was measured and PDAC cells were sorted for lipidomic analysis. We observed that tung oil supplementation significantly impaired PDAC growth in control <italic>Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> host animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>).

We asked if these differences in tumor growth could be driven by differences in PUFA levels between arginine-rich and arginine-starved PDAC tumors. Given our findings that Î±-ESA accumulates in TG species, we assessed how arginine levels in the TME affected PUFA levels in TGs, and in turn TG oxidation potential. We found that tung oil administration significantly increased the CPI of TGs in control <italic>Arg1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>host animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>).

<title>Combining PUFA treatment with ferroptosis inducers may effectively target arginine-deprived PDAC tumors</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that arginine starvation increases sensitivity to PUFA-induced ferroptosis in PDAC cells, but not ferroptosis induction by inhibitors of cysteine uptake and GPX4 (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 â Figure supplement 1A-F</xref>). Previous studies have found that Ras mutant tumors are sensitive to ferroptosis inducers that target these pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. PDAC tumors respond to targeting cysteine uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, although responses are incomplete<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> and there is interest in identifying resistance mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> and methods to improve PDAC response to such treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Therefore, we asked if PUFA supplementation could synergize with targeting GPX4 and cysteine uptake in arginine starved PDAC cells. To test this, we analyzed growth of mPDAC cells in TIFM or RPMI treated with sublethal doses of Î±-ESA in conjunction with RSL3, to inhibit GPX4, and cystine withdrawal or erastin, to target cysteine uptake. Interestingly, we first noted that mPDAC cells in TIFM are more resistant to RSL3, erastin and cystine withdrawal (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>). This suggests that nutrient availability in the TME may contribute to resistance to targeting ferroptosis via GPX4 inhibition or cysteine uptake in PDAC. We next found ferroptosis inducers killed cancer cells more effectively upon co-treatment with low doses of Î±-ESA that otherwise do not affect cell viability or proliferation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>). Critically, we found that sensitivity to ferroptosis inducers increased more in TIFM cultured cells compared to RPMI cultures, indicating that arginine restriction potentiates the effect of combining PUFA treatment with ferroptosis inducing drugs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>). We also examined if FSP1 inhibition would interact with Î±-ESA supplementation as FSP1 has recently been shown to reduce lipid peroxides in TGs in lipid droplets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. However, we observed no growth perturbations in mPDAC cell lines upon FSP1 inhibition (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 â Figure Supplement 1</xref>). Together, these data suggest that PUFA supplementation can synergize with ferroptosis induction by targeting GPX4 and cysteine metabolism. Such combinations may prove useful in overcoming resistance to ferroptosis inducers in PDAC, which our data further suggest may be driven by TME nutrient availability.</p>

<title>Lipid metabolism in pancreatic cancer responds to arginine deprivation in the tumor microenvironment</title>
<p>Lipid metabolism in tumors is tightly linked to oncogenic mutations that cause cellular transformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Transformation activates lipid synthesis in cultured cells which promotes unrestricted cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. As a result, targeting lipid synthesis in cancer cells has garnered attention as a potential cancer therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. However, cancer metabolism is not solely determined by cell-intrinsic features of cancer cells. Cancer cells also respond to cell-extrinsic stimuli in the tumor microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Importantly, many microenvironmental features of tumors suppress cellular lipid synthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. How do these conflicting cues from cell-intrinsic oncogenic signals and the TME interact and influence the lipid metabolism of cancers?</p>
<p>Oncogenic Ras signaling leads to increased fatty acid synthesis in cultured cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Despite activation of Ras in our PDAC models, transcriptomic analysis of PDAC cells in TIFM and in vivo shows that nutrient stress from the PDAC TME suppress SREBP1 signaling and fatty acid synthesis. These data suggest the cell-extrinsic cues are dominant over cell-intrinsic oncogenic signaling in dictating whether or not PDAC cells engage in fatty acid synthesis. This has several implications. First, cell culture studies that do not incorporate stimuli from the TME may overestimate the contribution of SREBP1 signaling and de novo synthesis to PDAC lipid metabolism and growth. Instead, given the constraints of the TME on <italic>de novo</italic> lipid synthesis, PDAC tumors likely require lipid uptake. Studies across tumor types support this, suggesting that uptake is the primary mechanism by which cancer cells acquire fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. Thus, future studies delineating the molecular mechanisms by which PDAC takes up lipids will be essential to understanding how lipid homeostasis is maintained in the metabolically constrained TME, given the lack of fatty acid synthesis in cancer cells.</p>
<p>The TME has many features that suppress de novo lipid synthesis in cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. We found that in vitro culture in TIFM, which models nutrient stress in the TME, recapitulates the suppression of SREBP1 signaling and lipid synthesis seen in vivo. This demonstrated that nutrient levels in the TME are important regulators of lipid metabolism. It also provided an opportunity to systematically identify specific metabolic cues in the TME that regulate SREBP1. Using TIFM, we showed specifically that low arginine levels found in PDAC tumors can suppress SREBP1 signaling and lipid synthesis. Alleviating arginine restriction in the TME increased SREBP1 levels and lipid synthesis, suggesting arginine starvation is a key constraint on lipid metabolism in PDAC tumors. Thus, in addition to known suppressors of lipid synthesis in the TME like hypoxia, amino acid stress also constrains lipid synthesis in PDAC. Arginine restriction regulates lipid metabolism in PDAC cells via downregulation of SREBP1 protein levels. How arginine regulates SREBP1 remains to be mechanistically delineated. SREBP1 is regulated by the arginine responsive nutrient sensors GCN2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> and mTOR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. These pathways are therefore likely candidates for how arginine levels in the TME restrict SREBP1 in PDAC cells, but future efforts are required to fully elucidate this mechanism.</p>

<title>Stromal cells constrain the metabolism of pancreatic cancers</title>
<p>Solid tumors contain both malignant cells and a diverse population of stromal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. There is a growing appreciation that malignant and stromal cells interact metabolically in the TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. Cancer-stromal metabolic interactions have largely been studied through the lens of how stromal cells facilitate the metabolism of cancer cells despite metabolic constraints in the TME. For example, lipid exchange from the stroma to PDAC cells contributes to PDAC metabolism and progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. Thus, the metabolism of stromal cells and subsequent nutrient exchange with cancer cells can promote the ability of cancer cells to overcome the metabolic challenges of the TME. However, the interactions between cancer cells and the stroma do not necessarily increase the metabolic capacity of tumor cells. There is increasing evidence that some stromal-cancer metabolic interactions constrain the metabolic capabilities of cancer cells. For example, myeloid cells have been found to outcompete malignant cells for glucose in the TME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. We find that myeloid cells, by severely restricting arginine levels in the PDAC TME, suppress SREBP1 and lipid synthesis in PDAC tumors. Thus, stromal metabolic activity can impose metabolic limitations in the TME that constrain the metabolic capacity of tumors.</p>

<title>Microenvironmental constraints on lipid synthesis render pancreatic cancers sensitive to polyunsaturated fatty acids: implications for therapeutically targeting ferroptosis</title>
<p>Precision dietary interventions targeting the metabolic liabilities of tumors are promising avenues in cancer therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>. We have found that suppression of SREBP1 by arginine deprivation in the TME sensitizes PDAC cells to increased levels of exogenous PUFAs. Furthermore, arginine starvation sensitizes established murine PDAC tumors to dietary PUFA consumption. Intriguingly, dietary PUFA supplementation also suppresses colorectal cancer (CRC) progression in animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref></sup> and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>. CRC tumors have recently been found to experience profound arginine depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. These findings suggest diets that manipulate PUFA levels could effectively suppress progression of tumors that are arginine starved, like PDAC and CRC. PUFA rich diets may also have an impact in tumors for which arginine deprivation therapy is being investigated clinically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>. More broadly, our study suggests that the nutrient limitations of the TME, and the resulting constraints on cellular metabolism, are critical determinants of how diet intersects with tumor metabolism and progression.</p>
<p>PDAC tumors are prone to ferroptosis and can be targeted with ferroptosis-inducing therapies such as systemic cysteine depletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. The underlying biochemistry that sensitizes PDAC to ferroptosis is incompletely understood. Oncogenic Ras signaling is known to increase the sensitivity of cells to ferroptotic cell death, especially cell death brought on by restriction of cysteine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup>. Thus, Ras signaling in PDAC likely contributes to ferroptotic sensitivity in these tumors. We have found that constraints on PDAC lipid synthesis arising from arginine starvation in the TME cause increased PUFA levels in PDAC cells. Further, arginine starvation sensitizes PDAC cells and tumors to PUFA overload and ferroptotic cell death upon PUFA supplementation. Thus, the TME, by restricting tumor lipid synthesis, also contributes to PDAC ferroptosis sensitivity. Our work suggests future studies are needed to understand how the TME regulates ferroptosis and response to therapies targeting this cell death mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Lastly, in contrast to oncogenic Ras signaling, arginine starvation in the TME and suppression of lipid synthesis does not sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis inducers that target proteins that quench lipid peroxides or uptake cysteine. Instead, arginine starved PDAC cells are sensitive to ferroptotic induction by PUFA supplementation. PDAC exhibits incomplete responses to ferroptosis induction by targeting cysteine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. In this study, we show even a sublethal dose of PUFAs potently sensitizes PDAC cell lines to canonical ferroptosis inducers, particularly when they are exposed to levels of arginine present in the TME. This suggests combining PUFA-rich diets may increase the efficacy of other ferroptosis inducing therapies. Importantly, dietary PUFA supplementation specifically raises the PUFA content of PDAC, but not healthy tissues. Thus, future experiments to assess whether dietary PUFA supplementation increases the therapeutic window for targeting ferroptosis in tumors with limited lipid synthetic capacity are critical.</p>

After lipid stripping, the aqueous layer was mixed under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas at room temperature for 2 hours to evaporate excess ether. This layer, as well as the non-delipidated fraction of FBS, was dialyzed against 9 g/L NaCl for 5 days at 4C using 10 kd SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing (FisherScientific, PI88243). Dialysis buffer was changed every 24 hours. Before use, protein concentration was measured by BCA assay and protein concentration was normalized between lipid stripped and lipid replete FBS samples by addition of 9 g/L NaCl as needed.</p>

<p>Raw peak areas for lipid species were normalized to total LC-MS signal intensity for analysis of lipid starved cells in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Raw peak areas for lipid species were normalized by the average cell number multiplied by cell volume for analysis of tung and Î±-ESA treated samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>,<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Lipids with a cumulative variance (%CV) greater than 30% in pooled QC samples were excluded from analysis. Principal component analysis was performed on mean-centered normalized lipid species peak areas using Metaboanalyst 6.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref></sup>. Volcano plots were generated by performing a Welchâs t-test on normalized peak areas and converting the resulting p-value into âLog<sub>10</sub>(p) value. Log<sub>2</sub> fold change (Log<sub>2</sub>FC) was calculated by calculating the log<sub>2</sub>(treatment condition/control condition). Species not present in all samples were excluded from fold change analysis. The percent distribution of 18:3 containing lipids was calculated by summing the peaks of all 18:3 containing complex lipids for each species and dividing that by the total signal of 18:3 containing lipids.</p>

<title>PUFA/MUFA ratio analysis</title>
<p>To calculate PUFA/MUFA ratios from LC-MS samples, only lipids with full identity were considered (all acyl chains identified in each lipid). Next, the quantity of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated acyl chains was calculated for each phospholipid. That number was then multiplied by the normalized peak area of the phospholipid to generate a monounsaturated or polyunsaturated score for each phospholipid. These values were then summed for all acyl chains for each lipid class (e.g. TGs, PEs etc) or for all lipid species. The sum PUFA score was then divided by the sum MUFA score of each individual sample to generate PUFA/MUFA ratios. An example of the PUFA and MUFA score calculation for a lipid is shown below:</p>

<title>Calculation of the Cellular Peroxidation Index (CPI)</title>
<p>Calculation of CPI was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> using only data from lipids for which we had complete identity. In brief, for each lipid class, or for all cellular lipids, we first calculated a score (as described above for calculating PUFA/MUFA ratios in lipids) for acyl chains containing 0-6 double bonds. We then summed these scores for fatty acyl chains with each double bond count to determine a total intensity score. We then determined the percentage of the total intensity score for acyl chains from 0-6 double bonds. The percentage of acyl chains with a given number of double bonds was calculated by taking the sum of acyl chain scores containing that number of double bonds in all lipid species divided by the sum of scores for all acyl chains in all lipid species. This percentage was then multiplied by its corresponding relative H atom transfer propagation rate constant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. These values were then summed for acyl chains with 0-6 double bonds to generate the CPI.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence analysis of SREBP1 in PDAC tumors</title>
<p>Whole tumors were placed in 15% sucrose dissolved in PBS at 4 Â°C for 6 hours. After 6 hours, tumors were moved into a solution of 30% sucrose dissolved PBS at 4 Â°C for 24 hours. Tumors were removed and embedded in histology cassettes with optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Fisher 23-730-571). Tumors were cut into 5 Âµm thick sections and mounted onto glass microscopy slides. Slides were thawed to room temperature for 15 minutes in the dark, after which slides were washed once with PBS for 5 minutes. Cells were permeabilized for 15 minutes at room temperature in 0.1% Tween-20 dissolved in PBS (PBST). Slides were then blocked for 1 hour in 10% normal goat serum (Invitrogen, 50062Z). Slides were then washed once with PBST and SREBP1 antibody (Abcam ab28481) at 1:150 in 1:1 PBST with 10% goat serum as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Slides were mounted into a humidified chamber at 4 Â°C and allowed to stain in SREBP1 antibody overnight. The following day, slides were washed 3 times for 5 minutes with PBST in the dark. After this, Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Cross-adsorbed secondary antibody (Invitrogen A21244) was added at 1:250 dilution in 1:1 PBST with 10% normal goat serum for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature. Slides were washed 3 times with PBST and mounted using mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen, P36962). Slides were scanned using the Olympus VS200 whole slide scanner using the YFP channel to analyze cancer cells, Cy5 channel for SREBP1, and DAPI channel to scan cell nuclei.</p>
<p>Analysis of SREBP1 in tumors was performed using quPath<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref></sup>. Individual cells were classified by DAPI using quPath cell detection. Cancer cells were identified based on YFP expression using the Object Classifier function. QuPath object classifier then used data from this training to identify other YFP expressing cells in each image. Images were spot checked for accuracy before analysis. For analysis of SREBP1 staining intensity, three sections were selected from each tumor slice based on DAPI intensity as a metric of cellularity. SREBP1 staining intensity (Cy5 channel) was calculated for YFP-expressing cancer cells in that section. Sample identity was blinded prior to selection of sections for analysis. An 361 YFP positive cells were selected from each tumor. 9 tumors were analyzed from both <italic>Lyz2-Cre<sup>-/-</sup>; Arg<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Arg<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> animals. The mean cell intensity of SREBP1 signal was calculated using quPath cell measurement function.

<title>Immunofluorescence analysis of lipid droplets</title>
<p>YFP-expressing mPDAC cells were plated at 300 cells/well in Ibidi 8-well chamber slides (Ibidi, 80806) in RPMI or TIFM media. Cells were allowed to attach overnight. Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 4.0% formaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. After fixation, cells were treated with 1:200 dilution of LipidTox neutral lipid stain (Invitrogen, H34477) in PBS for 30 minutes. Cells were washed once and then imaged on a Zeiss LSM 980 Airyscan 2 microscope at 40x magnification. Cells were identified using the YFP marker and lipid droplets were analyzed. For analysis, cells outlines were defined using the YFP signal and used to measure cellular areas. For lipid droplet analysis, background was subtracted from images and droplets were detected using auto thresholding by the Renyi Entropy method. Images were then smoothed, despeckled, and droplets were quantified using the Analyze Particles function in FIJI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">129</xref></sup> based on LipidTox positivity.</p>

<title>qRT-PCR analysis for SREBP1 target genes in human PDAC cells</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit and optional on-the-column DNAse digestion (QIAGEN, 74104). Extracted RNA was converted to cDNA by reverse transcription using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, 4374967). Expression levels of Elovl6 transcript were amplified using PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (Invitrogen, A25741) and primers targeting human Elovl6 from GeneCopeia (MQP037222). Quantification was performed using a QuantStudio 3 RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The average change in threshold cycle (ÎCt) values was determined for each of the samples relative to actin levels (Genecopeia, HQP016381) and compared with vehicle control (ÎÎCt). Finally, relative gene expression was calculated as (2âÎÎCt). Experiments were performed in triplicate cultures.</p>

Briefly, chemicals unique to TIFM when added to RPMI did not prevent mPDAC1 cells from growing in lipid depleted conditions, nor did removing these chemicals from TIFM improve mPDAC1 growth without lipids. This led us to conclude that alterations of levels of a shared nutrient between TIFM and RPMI was responsible for differences in lipid metabolism. We then observed that mPDAC1 cells grown in TIFM containing RPMI amino acid levels were able to grow without lipids, indicating that differences in amino acid availability altered lipid metabolism. We then found that supplementation of arginine in TIFM to RPMI levels alone was sufficient to improve mPDAC1 growth without lipids to levels nearly seen in RPMI (n=3).</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors set out to define how arginine availability regulates lipid metabolism and to explore the implications of this relationship in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a tumor type known to exist in an arginine-poor microenvironment. Using a combination of rigorous genetic and metabolomic approaches, they uncover a previously underappreciated role for arginine in maintaining lipid homeostasis. Importantly, they demonstrate that arginine deprivation sensitizes PDAC cells to ferroptosis through lipidome perturbations, which can be exploited therapeutically via co-treatment with aESA and ferroptosis inducers (FINs). These findings have meaningful implications for the field. They not only shed light on the metabolic vulnerabilities created by nutrient restriction in PDAC, but also suggest a practical avenue for combination therapies that exploit ferroptosis sensitivity. This is particularly relevant in the context of pancreatic cancer, which is notoriously resistant to conventional treatments. The methods employed are broadly applicable to other nutrient-stress contexts and may inspire similar investigations in other solid tumor types.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>One of the major strengths of the study is the use of complementary and well-controlled approaches-including metabolomic profiling, genetic perturbations, and in vivo models-to support the central hypothesis. The experiments are thoughtfully designed and clearly presented, and the conclusions are, for the most part, well supported by the data. The findings provide mechanistic insight into nutrient-lipid crosstalk and identify a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting arginine-deprived tumors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A key weakness of the study lies in the mechanistic connection between arginine levels and SREBP1 activation. While the authors show that arginine restriction leads to reduced SREBP1 expression, the magnitude of this effect appears modest relative to the substantial changes observed in the lipidome. The study would benefit from a deeper analysis of SREBP1 regulation-particularly whether nuclear translocation or activation is affected. This could be addressed by examining the nuclear pool of SREBP1, using either subcellular fractionation or improved immunofluorescence imaging in both cell lines and tissue samples.</p>
<p>Another area where additional context would strengthen the manuscript is in the transcriptomic profiling of PDAC cells cultured in a tumor interstitial fluid mimic (TIFM). While the study emphasizes lipid-related pathways, highlighting the most significantly upregulated and downregulated pathways in Figure 1B would give readers a broader perspective on how arginine restriction reprograms the PDAC transcriptome. For instance, because polyamines are downstream of arginine and are known to influence lipid metabolism, it would be worth discussing whether these metabolites contribute to the phenotypes observed. Similarly, an evaluation of whether Dgat1/2 expression is altered could help delineate the full scope of lipid metabolic rewiring.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth noting that the KPC mouse model used in this study is based on conditional deletion of p53, which leads to faster-growing tumors and a distinct tumor microenvironment compared to models harboring the p53^R172H point mutation. Including a brief discussion of this distinction would help readers contextualize the translational relevance of the findings.</p>

<p>This study by Jonker et al. examines how the metabolic adaptations to the microenvironment by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) present vulnerabilities that could be used for therapeutic purposes. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is mostly solid, and the multiplicity of models used, as well as the combination of in vitro and in vivo work, are appreciated, but some conclusions would benefit from additional substantiation. This work would be of interest to biologists working on the impact of microenvironment and metabolism in cancer, and especially those investigating pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>In this study, the authors use mostly &quot;doublings per day&quot; as an indicator of cell death, notably for Figures 4 to 6. However, proliferative arrest (or a decrease in the proliferative rate) is not necessarily synonymous with cell death. It might be nice to complement these experiments with a true measure of cell death (e.g., PI uptake).</p>
<p>The composition of Tumor Interstitial Fluid Medium (TIFM) was published previously, but nonetheless a reminder of the composition of this medium in a Supplemental file of this study might be helpful. In particular, at the start of the Results section, the nature of serum/lipids in the different media should be specifically noted, especially given that the subsequent focus of the work is on lipids/SREBP. It is known that differences in the extracellular availability of lipids can profoundly alter de novo lipid biosynthesis pathways.</p>

<p>This important study investigates the impact of nutrient stress in the tumor microenvironment (TME), focusing on lipid metabolism in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).</p>
<p>Understanding TME composition is crucial, as it highlights cancer vulnerabilities independent of intracellular mutations, particularly because PDAC tumors are often exposed to limited nutrient availability due to reduced perfusion.</p>
<p>By utilizing a medium that mimics the nutrient conditions of PDAC tumors, the authors convincingly show that TME nutrient stress suppresses SREBP1, leading to reduced lipid synthesis, with low arginine levels identified as a key driver of this suppression. Importantly, mice with arginine-starved pancreatic tumors respond to a polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich diet. This discovery uncovers a synthetic lethal interaction in the tumor microenvironment that could be leveraged through dietary interventions.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data; however, below are some aspects that could be further clarified.</p>
<p>This study uses PDAC cells from the LSL-Kras G12D/+ ; Trp53 ; Pdx-1-Cre PDAC model. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the cell-extrinsic stimuli of low arginine availability suppress lipid synthesis and thus exert a dominant effect over the cell-intrinsic oncogenic Ras mutation, which is known to enhance fatty acid synthesis. Could the effect of low arginine on lipid synthesis be specific for certain mutations in PDAC? It would be interesting to investigate or discuss whether different mutations show the same SREBP1 reduction caused by low arginine levels, and whether these low SREBP1 levels can be ameliorated by arginine re-supplementation. Here, Jonker et al. show that human PDAC cells cultured in TIFM have reduced SREBP1 levels (Figure 1 - Figure supplement 1C). It would be further supportive of their conclusions if the authors could show that arginine re-supplementation is sufficient to restore SREBP1 levels in human PDAC cells.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that mPDAC cells cultured in RPMI and subsequently implanted into an orthotopic mouse model exhibit reduced expression of SREBP target genes when compared to in vitro cultured mPDAC-RPMI cells. This finding is in line with the observation that culturing PDAC cells in TIFM downregulates SREBP target genes compared to PDAC cells cultured in RPMI. However, caution is needed when directly comparing mPDAC-RPMI cultured cells to those in the orthotopic model, as the latter may include non-tumor cells and additional factors that could confound the results. The authors should explicitly acknowledge this limitation in their study.</p>
<p>The in vivo evidence demonstrating that PUFA-rich tung oil reduces tumor size is compelling. However, the specific in vitro findings regarding its impact on doubling rates per day, particularly in the context of arginine-dependent PUFA supplementation, require further explanation. To enhance the robustness of their data and conclusions, the authors could consider conducting additional cell viability and proliferation assays. Moreover, it would be valuable to assess whether the observed effects on doubling rates per day remain significant after normalizing the data to the initial doubling time prior to PUFA supplementation. This is in particular important regarding the statement that &quot;Addition of arginine significantly decreases sensitivity to a-ESA&quot; as these cells already start with a higher doubling rate prior to a-ESA treatment.</p>
<p>Overall, this paper presents a compelling study that significantly enhances our understanding of the PDAC tumor microenvironment and its complex interactions with the tumor lipid metabolism.</p>
