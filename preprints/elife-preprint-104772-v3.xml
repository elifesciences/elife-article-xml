<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Nodaviridae</italic> infections cause severe mortality in insects and fish, with nervous necrosis virus (NNV) posing significant threats to global fish populations. However, the host factors involved in NNV entry remain poorly understood. We identify myosin light chain 3 from marine medaka (<italic>Oryzias melastigma</italic>) (MmMYL3) as a novel receptor for red-spotted grouper NNV (RGNNV), facilitating internalization via macropinocytosis. MmMYL3 directly binds the RGNNV capsid protein (CP), which dependents on the arm and S domains of CP and the EF-hand2 domain of MmMYL3. In vitro experiments showed that MmMYL3 siRNA, protein, anti-MYL3 antibodies or the arm domain synthetic peptides blocked RGNNV entry. Moreover, in vivo administration of MmMYL3 protein also inhibited RGNNV infection. Ectopic MmMYL3 expression enabled RGNNV internalization into resistant cells. Notably, MmMYL3 facilitated RGNNV internalization through the macropinocytosis pathway via the IGF1R-Rac1/Cdc42 axis. Collectively, our findings underscore MYL3’s crucial role in NNV entry and its potential as an antiviral target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy, also known as viral nervous necrosis, is a highly contagious and pathogenic disease that infects more than 120 marine and freshwater fish species, leading to mass mortalities and severe economic losses in the aquaculture industry. The etiological agent responsible, nervous necrosis virus (NNV), belongs to the <italic>Nodaviridae</italic> family, genus <italic>Betanodavirus</italic> and manifests as a nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Costa and Thompson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Munday et al., 2002</xref>). The NNV genome is composed of two RNA segments: RNA1 encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), while RNA2 encodes the viral capsid protein (CP), which plays a critical role in the initial interaction with host cell surface receptors, thus facilitating viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bandín and Souto, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mori et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Viral entry into host cells is a key determinant of host specificity, tissue tropism, and viral pathogenicity, and involves intricate interactions between viral capsid proteins and host cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Grove and Marsh, 2011</xref>). Viruses utilize sophisticated strategies to attach to one or multiple receptors, enabling them to cross the plasma membrane and access the necessary host cell machinery (Melissa S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Maginnis, 2018</xref>). Viral receptors function not only as attachment moieties but also as entry factors, coordinators of viral trafficking, and activators of signaling events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Marsh and Helenius, 2006</xref>). Therefore, identifying virus receptors and understanding the mechanism of virus-receptor interaction is critical for better preventing viral diseases. Although NNV exhibits a broad host tropism, only heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70), heat shock protein 90ab1 (HSP90ab1) and Nectin1 have been identified as its receptor or co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang and Chi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">2024</xref>). Following NNV CP protein recognizes the cellular surface receptor, the NNV enters the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Viruses usually take advantage of various endocytic pathways to enter host cells, with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), macropinocytosis, and caveolar/raft-dependent endocytosis being the most extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mercer et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies revealed that NNV particles utilize the receptor-mediated CME and macropinocytosis internalization pathways to invade host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2005</xref>), with the former facilitated by HSP90ab1 and HSC70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, the receptor responsible for mediating NNV invasion of host cells through macropinocytosis remains unknown.</p>
<p>Among the diverse cellular factors that can serve as viral receptors, members of the myosin family have emerged as intriguing candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He et al., 2022</xref>). The myosin family comprises a wide range of actin-associated motor proteins that play a role in a variety of cellular activities, including signal transduction, intracellular transport and cell division, etc. Up to date, more than 40 known classes of myosin have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Foth et al., 2006</xref>). Recent studies underscore their significance in various viral infections. For instance, myosin heavy chain 9 has been identified as a crucial factor for various virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA serves as a functional entry receptor for herpes simplex virus-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arii et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, myosin II light chain activation is essential for influenza A virus cell entry through macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Myosin light chain 3 (MYL3), a constituent of the myosin light chain family predominantly found in muscle tissues, particularly the heart and skeletal muscles, plays a pivotal role in muscle contraction by forming the myosin complex with myosin heavy chain and facilitating actin filament sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ingles et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations in the MYL3 gene have been associated with various muscle-related disorders, including cardiomyopathies and skeletal muscle myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mavilakandy and Ahamed, 2022</xref>). However, the role of MYL3 in virus infection remains undiscovered. Huang et al reported that <italic>Epinephelus coioides</italic> MYL3 might interact with native NNV CP by proteomic analysis of immunoprecipitation (IP) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). In our previous study, we also found that marine medaka (<italic>Oryzias melastigma</italic>) MYL3 (MmMYL3) is a potential interacting protein of the purified CP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), yet its involvement in NNV infection, particularly its role in viral invasion, remains uncertain.</p>
<p>In this study, we unveil MmMYL3 as a novel NNV entry receptor, elucidating its facilitation of RGNNV entry into host cells through macropinocytosis, mediated by the IGF1R-Rac1/Cdc42 pathway. These findings offer novel insights into the intricate mechanisms underlying NNV entry and highlight potential targets for the development of antiviral drugs.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Interaction between MmMYL3 and CP</title>
<p>First, a Co-IP assay was conducted to validate the interaction between MmMYL3 and CP. MmMYL3 exhibited colocalization and co-precipitation with CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">B</xref>). GST-tag pull-down assays provided additional confirmation of the direct interaction between MmMYL3 and CP, as well as MmMYL3 and RGNNV virions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>). SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) analysis further confirmed a direct interaction between MmMYL3 and CP, with kinetics revealing association rate constant (Ka), dissociation rate constant (Kd), and equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 1.448 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, 1.679 × 10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, and 2.95 μM, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Additionally, the interaction between CP and MYL3 was consistently observed in another marine fish species, <italic>Lateolabrax japonicus</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). These results robustly affirm the binding affinity of MmMYL3 to CP.</p>

<title>Domain mapping of the association between MmMYL3 and CP</title>
<p>To delineate the domain of MmMYL3 required for interaction with CP, various Myc-tagged distinct domains of MmMYL3 were constructed, and Co-IP assays revealed that deletion of the EF-hand2 domain of MmMYL3 abolished its interaction with CP, suggesting the essential role of the EF-hand2 domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">I</xref>). Furthermore, to ascertain which domain of CP is necessary for interaction with MmMYL3, we generated a series of Myc-tagged CP deletion mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Co-IP assays revealed that deletion of the arm domain and S domain of CP resulted the abrogation of its interaction with MmMYL3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that MmMYL3 interacts with the arm and S domain of CP through its EF-hand2 domain.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Localization of MmMYL3 on the cell surface</title>
<p>We next explored whether MmMYL3 is present on the cell surface, a prerequisite for a functional viral receptor. Immunofluorescence (IF) assays in permeabilized and non-permeabilized hMMES1 and HEK293T cells transfected with Myc-MmMYL3 revealed MmMYL3 localization both at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">B</xref>). Meanwhile, no immunofluorescent signal was detected on the surface of non-permeabilized cells using anti-Actin abs. Conversely, in permeabilized cells treated with Triton X-100, MmMYL3 proteins were found not only on the cell surface but in the cytoplasm. To corroborate the cell surface localization of MmMYL3, a protease protection assay was carried out. Besides, the addition of proteinase K resulted in the significant reduction of MmMYL3 protein in nonpermeabilized HEK293T or hMMES1 cells transfected with pCMV-Myc-MmMYL3 plasmid compared to the control without proteinase K treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>), confirmed that MmMYL3 is exposed on the surface of these cells.</p>

<p>To visualize the colocalization of MmMYL3 with the cell membrane, PKH 26, a red fluorescent dye that binds stably to the lipid region of the cell membrane, was used. Colocalization of MmMYL3 with PKH 26 in hMMES1 cells was observed, further corroborating its membrane association (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-Myc antibody also indicated a proportional increase in MmMYL3 surface expression with increasing MmMYL3 concentrations in HEK293T and hMMES1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Lastly, co-transfection of MmMYL3 with the membrane protein Na+/K+-ATPase alpha 1 (ATP1A1) in HEK293T and hMMES1 cells showed clear colocalization of MmMYL3 with ATP1A1 in both permeabilized and non-permeabilized conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">H</xref>), further affirming the presence of MmMYL3 on the cell surface.

<p>To further substantiate that MmMYL3 functions as a receptor for RGNNV infection, commercial anti-human MYL3 abs and purified GST-tagged MmMYL3 proteins were used to evaluate the role of MmMYL3 in the virus entry process. Notably, recombinant MmMYL3 (Fig. S2) proteins significantly reduced the entry of RGNNV into hMMES1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">H</xref>) and treatment with anti-MYL3 abs (Fig. S3) resulted in a significant reduction in <italic>CP</italic> and <italic>RDRP</italic> levels at 2 and 4 hpi, suggesting inhibition of RGNNV entry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">J</xref>).

<p>Cellular receptors required for virus infection confer infectability when they are expressed in an uninfectable cell type. To further demonstrate the receptor function of MmMYL3, we tested whether overexpression of MmMYL3 could render typically resistant cells susceptible to RGNNV infection. HEK293T cells, which are not naturally permissive to RGNNV, were transfected with MmMYL3 or MmHSP90ab1 (a known NNV receptor). First, we detected CP anti-reverse sequences (<italic>CP (-)</italic>), which is a replicative intermediate for production of viral RNAs, in MmMYL3 or MmHSP90ab1-overexpressing HEK293T cells post RGNNV infection, but not in empty vector transfected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Similar with MmHSP90ab1, overexpression of MmMYL3 promoted the entry of RGNNV into HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The internalization of RGNNV into MmMYL3 overexpressing HEK293T cells was further evidenced by the intracellular immunofluorescence localization of CP at 24 hpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Additionally, like observations in hMMES1 cells, abundant viral particles were observed in the cytoplasm of MmMYL3 overexpressing HEK293T cells post RGNNV infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results further support the susceptibility conferred by MmMYL3 expression, highlighting its role as a receptor for RGNNV.</p>

Fluid-phase uptake is a distinctive feature activated during macropinocytosis. Studies on various viruses entering host cells via macropinocytosis have demonstrated a transient enhancement in fluid-phase uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delpeut et al., 2017</xref>). Dextran served as a macropinocytosis marker, being taken up by cells during macropinocytosis. As expected, cells infected with RGNNV displayed dextran-positive vesicles resembling larger, irregular macropinosomes at 4 hpi, in contrast to mock-infected cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Meanwhile, clusters of MmMYL3 were observed co-localized with RGNNV CP protein in dextran-positive macropinosomes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>NNV, an important fish virus, enters host cells by utilizing a range of host factors that act as receptors and facilitate the process of endocytosis via an orchestrated mechanism. Three host factors, HSP90ab1,HSC70 and Nectin1, have been identified as entry receptors of NNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang and Chi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>, n.d.), however, disrupting their interaction with cells does only partially hinder viral infection, suggesting that NNV likely utilizes additional, yet unidentified host receptors or co-receptors. To establish infection, NNV utilized receptor-mediated endocytosis to induce internalization of the virus/receptor complex, primarily including CME and macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Although previous studies demonstrate that HSP90ab1 and HSC70 are responsible for NNV internalization via CME, the receptor and the molecular mechanisms leading to NNV entry into cells via macropinocytosis remain to be determined. In this study, we found that NNV gain entry into host cells via the interaction between CP and its novel receptor MmMYL3. Subsequently, MmMYL3 engages with IGF1R, leading to the activation of the Rac1/Cdc42 pathway, which induces actin rearrangement and facilitates NNV macropinocytosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7N</xref>).</p>
<p>Numerous data indicate the significance of myosin light chains in the functionality of both cardiac and skeletal muscles. However, little is known about the function of myosin light chains during virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kamm and Stull, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sheikh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we provide several lines of evidence showing that MmMYL3 acts as a novel receptor of NNV. First, ectopic expression of MmMYL3 facilitates internalization of RGNNV, which is mediated by the interaction between the EF-hand2 domain of MmMYL3 and the arm and S domain of CP. Considering that our previous study had reported that MmHSP90ab1, a known NNV receptor, interacted with the linker region of CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we speculated that NNV might have the ability to utilize multiple receptors simultaneously for cell infection through these receptors binding to the different domains of CP. Furthermore, interference with the MmMYL3 and CP interaction with abs against MYL3, MmMYL3 fusion protein and CP arm domain peptides significantly block NNV entry, providing a potential antiviral strategy against NNV infection. In addition to these <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments further confirm the physiological relevance of MmMYL3 in viral pathogenesis and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target in aquaculture. More importantly, virus-resistant HEK293T cells are rendered susceptible to RGNNV infection by overexpression of MmMYL3 alone. The development of MmMYL3 overexpressing HEK293T cells model offers a valuable platform for investigating viral infection mechanisms and conducting drug screening studies. All these results suggested that MmMYL3 is a novel receptor that mediates NNV entry. We also found that the interaction of MYL3 with CP was conserved across NNV sensitive fish. Interestingly, NNV exhibits a broad species tropism, capable of infecting diverse cell lines and various animal species examined thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Munday et al., 2002</xref>). This phenomenon may be attributed in part to the robust conservation of MYL3. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence that MYL3 functions as a functional entry receptor for virus.</p>

In recent years, a novel <italic>Alphanodavirus</italic>, provisionally named covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV), has emerged, causing viral covert mortality disease in shrimp and also affecting farmed marine fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Given the susceptibility of marine fish to CMNV, we investigated the possibility that both <italic>Alphanodavirus</italic> and <italic>Betanodavirus</italic> utilize MYL3 as a common receptor for cellular entry. Sequence comparison results revealed a low homology between the CP protein sequences of CMNV and RGNNV. Additionally, our data indicated that the CP of CMNV did not interact with MmMYL3 (Fig. S4). These findings suggest that MmMYL3 may function as a receptor specific to <italic>Betanodavirus</italic>, rather than being a common receptor for both viral genera. Receptor recognition is typically highly specific, and the binding interactions between viral proteins and host receptors often depend on the structural compatibility between the viral capsid/ viral envelope and the host receptor. Since MYL3 does not interact with CMNV, a virus more closely related to NNV, it is less likely to function as a receptor for viruses that are more distantly related to NNV.</p>
<p>Previous reports have highlighted the dependence of the NNV entry process on both CME and macropinocytosis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). We had demonstrated NNV can use MmHSP90ab1 and MmHSC70 to enter cells via CME pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang and Chi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to these receptors, our findings revealed that MmMYL3 promotes NNV internalization via macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis, characterized as a transient, growth factor-induced, actin-dependent endocytic pathway, facilitates the internalization of fluid and membrane into large vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mercer and Helenius, 2009</xref>). Mounting evidence underscores its pivotal role as an endocytic route exploited by numerous viruses for invading host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Locker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mercer and Helenius, 2008</xref>). Upon binding to the cell membrane, viruses trigger the activation of RTKs or other signaling molecules such as Rac1, Cdc42, and Pak1, initiating intricate intracellular signaling cascades that lead to alterations in actin filament dynamics and induction of plasma membrane ruffling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bar-Sagi and Feramisco, 1986</xref>; Bar-Sagi et al., 1987; Letizia Lanzetti, 2004). RTKs, well-known upstream regulatory factors of macropinocytosis, are involved in the entry process of various viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amyere et al., 2000</xref>; Nicola et al., 2005). To evaluate the significance of RTKs in NNV entry, we conducted a screening of small molecules targeting the activation of specific RTKs. Our findings revealed that AZD-3463 and Picropodophyllin, two inhibitors of IGF1R, could impede MmMYL3-mediated RGNNV entry. IGF1R is a transmembrane RTK involved in mediating cellular responses to IGFs and plays a significant role in cellular processes such as growth, proliferation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hakuno and Takahashi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pellegrino et al., 2024</xref>). Recent studies have revealed an intriguing connection between IGF1R signaling and viral entry mechanisms, particularly through macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Józefiak et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stewart et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings revealed direct binding between MmMYL3 and MmIGF1R, indicating that MmMYL3 might participated in the macropinocytosis-mediated NNV entry through its interaction with MmIGF1R. Previous study had identified IGF1R as an entry receptor for respiratory syncytial virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Griffiths et al., 2020</xref>). Consider the conservation of IGF1R, we investigated whether it could serve as a potential receptor for NNV. However, our analysis indicated that MmIGF1R did not directly bind to CP, indicating that MmIGF1R might not be the receptor for NNV.</p>
<p>To further explore how MmIGF1R promotes macropinocytosis and NNV internalization, we investigate the effect of MmIGF1R downstream signaling on NNV infection. IGF1R can activate GTPases, such as Cdc42 and Rac1, leading to rapid actin reorganization and membrane ruffling, key processes in initiating macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Manara et al., 2016</xref>). Increasing evidence has demonstrate that Cdc42 and Rac1 are essential for various virus entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Swaine and Dittmar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). We found that both MmRac1 and MmCdc42 interact with the intracellular domain of MmIGF1R, and inhibition of MmRac1 and MmCdc42 significantly impaired RGNNV entry. Conversely, overexpression of MmRac1 or MmCdc42 enhanced NNV internalization. Actin filaments play a central role in driving the membrane dynamics necessary for the formation and internalization of macropinosomes during macropinocytosis. We found that there was a notable reorganization of F-actin filaments, accompanied by the presence of actin-driven membrane protrusions that co-localized with virions on the surface of RGNNV infected cells. All these results indicated that cytosis MmIGF1R regulate Rac1/Cdc42 signaling to promotes macropinocytosis during NNV infection. While previous studies have suggested that NNV enters host cells via macropinocytosis, our study was the first to provide a detailed mechanism understanding of this process. The identification of MYL3 as a novel receptor for RGNNV entry, coupled with its role in activating the IGF1R-Rac1/Cdc42 axis to drive macropinocytosis, opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention in aquaculture. MYL3, as a crucial receptor for viral entry, could be inhibited through the development of small molecules, peptides, or monoclonal antibodies that block its interaction with the virus. Additionally, IGF1R inhibitors could prevent macropinocytosis and viral entry by disrupting downstream signaling pathways. Screening libraries of small molecules and natural products for potential inhibitors and testing them in aquaculture models would help evaluate their efficacy. Combining MYL3 and IGF1R inhibitors might offer a synergistic approach to prevent viral infection. These strategies could significantly reduce viral loads and improve fish survival rates, addressing the ongoing viral challenges in aquaculture.</p>
<p>Overall, MmMYL3 was identified as a novel functional receptor for RGNNV. Moreover, MmMYL3 was involved in and facilitated RGNNV internalization through the macropinocytosis pathway via the IGF1R-Rac1/Cdc42 axis. Our findings shed new light on the molecular mechanism of RGNNV entry and provide a new perspective for the development of antiviral therapies.</p>
<p>While our study provides strong evidence that MmMYL3 serves as a receptor for RGNNV <italic>in vitro</italic>, one limitation of our research is the lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments using MmMYL3 knockout marine medaka. Conducting these knockout studies would further validate the role of MmMYL3 in NNV infection in a whole organism context. Unlike well-established model organisms like zebrafish or mice, gene editing in marine medaka is fraught with difficulties, including technical complexity, precise embryo microinjection, and the potential for off-target effects with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The process is time-consuming, requiring multiple breeding generations and thorough molecular screening to establish homozygous knockout lines. Future research aimed at developing these knockout models will greatly benefit from advances in gene editing technologies and standardized protocols tailored to marine medaka.</p>

<p>The findings in this manuscript are <bold>fundamental</bold> because they identify an entry receptor MYL3 that belongs to the myosin family as a possible target that could inhibit a virus that has a high impact on aquaculture. The evidence is <bold>convincing</bold> as it contains strong in vitro and in vivo data that support their conclusions; however, studies on the presence of MYL3 in NNV target tissues will further strengthen their claims</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors discovered MYL3 of marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) as a novel NNV entry receptor, elucidating its facilitation of RGNNV entry into host cells through macropinocytosis, mediated by the IGF1R-Rac1/Cdc42 pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors have performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to prove that MnMYL3 may serve as a receptor for NNV via macropinocytosis pathway. These experiments with different methods include Co-IP, RNAi, pulldown, SPR, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence assays and so on. In general, the results are clearly presented in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript offers an important contribution to the field of virology, especially concerning NNV entry mechanisms. The major strength of the study lies in the identification of MmMYL3 as a functional receptor for RGNNV and its role in macropinocytosis, mediated by the IGF1R-Rac1/Cdc42 signaling axis. This represents a significant advance in understanding NNV entry mechanisms beyond previously known receptors such as HSP90ab1 and HSC70. The data, supported by comprehensive in vitro and in vivo experiments, strongly justify the authors' claims about MYL3's role in NNV infection in marine medaka.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The identification of MmMYL3 as a functional receptor for RGNNV is a significant contribution to the field. The study fills a crucial gap in understanding the molecular mechanisms governing NNV entry into host cells.</p>
<p>(2) The work highlights the involvement of IGF1R in macropinocytosis-mediated NNV entry and downstream Rac1/Cdc42 activation, thus providing a thorough mechanistic understanding of NNV internalization process. This could pave the way for further exploration of antiviral targets.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents a detailed study on the role of MmMYL3 in the viral entry of NNV, focusing on its function as a receptor that mediates viral internalization through the macropinocytosis pathway. The use of both in vitro assays (e.g., Co-IP, SPR, and GST pull-down) and in vivo experiments (such as infection assays in marine medaka) adds robustness to the evidence for MmMYL3 as a novel receptor for RGNNV. The findings have important implications for understanding NNV infection mechanisms, which could pave the way for new antiviral strategies in aquaculture.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors show that MmMYL3 directly binds the viral capsid protein, facilitates NNV entry via the IGF1R-Rac1/Cdc42 pathway, and can render otherwise resistant cells susceptible to infection. This multifaceted approach effectively demonstrates the central role of MmMYL3 in NNV entry.</p>

<p>Specificity of MYL3 Selection:</p>
<p>My previous question focused on why MYL3 was prioritized over other myosin family members. While the response broadly implicates myosins in viral entry, it does not justify why MYL3 was specifically chosen. For clarity, the &quot;Introduction sections&quot; should explicitly state the unique features of MYL3 (e.g., domain structure, binding affinity, or prior evidence linking it to NNV) that distinguish it from other myosins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comment regarding the specificity of MYL3 selection. In response, we have revised the &quot;Introduction&quot; section to explicitly clarify the rationale for prioritizing MYL3 over other myosin family members. Specifically, we have now included prior evidence linking MYL3 to NNV infection, citing our studies that identified MYL3 as a potential host factor interacting with NNV CP protein. In our previous study, sixteen CP-interacting proteins were identified by Co-IP assays followed by MS, including HSP90ab1, Centrosomal protein 170B, MYL3 and so on. In addition to our findings, previous study by other researchers has also reported that <italic>Epinephelus coioides</italic> MYL3 can bind to NNV (page 3, lines 79–81). These revisions provide a clearer justification for the selection of MYL3 and distinguish it from other myosin proteins. The added content can be found in the revised manuscript on page 3, lines 81–84.</p>
