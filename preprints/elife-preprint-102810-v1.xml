<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen causing severe diseases. Recently, <italic>S. aureus</italic> was recognized as intracellular pathogen with the intracellular niche promoting immune evasion and antibiotic resistance. We identified an alternative mechanism governing cellular uptake of <italic>S. aureus</italic> which relies on lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, lysosomal exocytosis and occurs concurrently to other well-known entry pathways within the same host cell population. This internalization pathway is rapid and active within only few minutes after bacterial contact with host cells. Compared to slow bacterial internalization, the rapid pathway demonstrates altered phagosomal maturation as well as translocation of the pathogen to the host cytosol and ultimately results in different rates of intracellular bacterial replication and host cell death. We show that these alternative infection outcomes are caused by the mode of bacterial uptake.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The most abundant sphingolipid, sphingomyelin (SM), resides in the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane and hence is exposed to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). SM is a substrate for sphingomyelinases (SMases) that cleave off the phosphocholine head group to produce the non-polar ceramide. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is a lysosomal enzyme involved in recycling of SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and is linked to infectious diseases, where it was shown to be involved in cellular uptake of several human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a Gram-positive human commensal that asymptomatically colonizes about one third of the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). It is an opportunistic pathogen causing diseases ranging from soft tissue and skin infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) to lethal diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> is notorious for acquiring antibiotic resistances thereby causing &gt;100,000 annual deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> possesses intracellular virulence strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) that contribute to antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) and immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Internalization of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by host cells is mediated by several adhesins on the staphylococcal surface that bind a plethora of receptors on the host cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). For instance, staphylococcal fibronectin-binding proteins that form fibronectin bridges to α<sub>5</sub>β<sub>1</sub> integrins on host cells to initiate internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) or clumping factor B which can interact with the host receptor annexin A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>After internalization, <italic>S. aureus</italic> resides within a phagosome-like compartment that matures by acquiring proteins associated with early and then late endosomes as well as lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In epithelial and endothelial cells, the bacteria translocate to the host cytosol (“phagosomal escape”) where they replicate and cause host cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanism by which pathogens enter their host cells has been suggested to dictate the outcome of infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). For instance, phagosomes formed during natural internalization of <italic>Brucella arbortus</italic> by macrophages possessed different characteristics compared to phagosomes that were artificially generated by phorbol myristate acetate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). The protozoic parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> invades its host cells by a proactive mechanism. Phagosomes generated during active invasion differed from those that were generated during Fc receptor-mediated uptake of antibody-coated parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Since previous observation connecting host cell entry and intracellular fate of pathogens were based on artificial induction of internalization, it is unclear whether pathogens can enter host cells within the same population via different naturally occurring mechanisms and if the entry route has a direct influence on the outcome of an intracellular infection.</p>
<p>Here, we describe the internalization of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by tissue cells via a rapid pathway taking place within minutes after contact between bacteria and host cell surface. This pathway requires nicotinic acid adenosine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP)-dependent mobilization of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, followed by lysosomal exocytosis and thereby release of ASM. Since the rapid uptake is concurrent to previously known internalization pathways, it probably has been missed due to long infection times used in traditional infection protocols (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)).</p>
<p><italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria, which enter host cells of the same cell population via the rapid pathway, cause a distinct infection outcome with altered phagosome maturation, bacterial translocation to host cytosol and eventually host cell death when compared to bacteria that enter host cells at later time points during infection. Thus, the outcome of an infection is decided at the single cell level during bacterial uptake at the host plasma membrane. Bacteria-containing phagosomes that were formed by the ASM-dependent rapid uptake pathway are delayed in their maturation and the bacteria do not escape these organelles efficiently, hence demonstrating a direct link between concurrently active modes of bacterial uptake and the resulting outcomes of intracellular <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection.</p>

<title>S. aureus triggers lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization for host cell invasion</title>
<p>We previously identified that internalization of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by host cells is associated with cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). To delineate the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in this process mechanistically, we pretreated human microvascular endothelial cells (HuLEC) with the calcium ionophore ionomycin, which reduced bacterial invasion efficiency dose-dependently (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, A), at concentrations neither affecting bacterial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, A, B) nor host cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, C).</p>

<p>Since focal adhesions constitute major cellular entry sites for <italic>S. aureus</italic> and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated transient receptor potential ion channel 4 (TRPM4) is located therein, we inhibited TRPM4 with 9-Phenantrol. 9-Phenantrol reduced invasion efficiency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, B), but was not bactericidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, D). Further, treatment of HuLEC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, C) or HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, E) with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator BAPTA-AM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) led to reduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion in a concentration-dependent manner.</p>
<p>The pore-forming staphylococcal α-toxin has been shown to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). However, <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion was independent of toxin production in HeLa and only slightly reduced in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, F). Consequently, omission of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cell culture medium did not affect internalization of bacteria, indicating that invasion is not dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, C).</p>
<p>Since intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores can serve as alternative source of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we next blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation from the ER using 2-APB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) or 8-Bromo-cyclic ADP ribose (8-Bromo-cADPR; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>)) and from lysosomes using <italic>trans</italic>-Ned19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) in HuLEC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, D) or HeLa (Supp. Figure 1, G, H) at concentrations not affecting bacterial viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, I and J). Interference with lysosomal, but not ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release reduced internalization of <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p>
<p>Ned19 antagonizes NAADP, a second messenger that mediates opening of two pore channels (TPCs) which transport Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endo-lysosomal compartment into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Hence, a HeLa cell pool depleted of TPC1 (Supp. Figure 1, K) substantially reduced invasion when compared to unmodified HeLa cells. This was particularly pronounced after a 10 min infection pulse, suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent invasion is important early in infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, E).</p>
<p>CD38 is a well-known producer of NAADP in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Thus, we tested <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion in HeLa cells treated with the specific CD38 inhibitor 78c, even though expression of CD38 in these cells is predicted to be very low (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://proteinatlas.org">proteinatlas.org</ext-link>). We observed no effect on <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion by CD38 inhibition (Supp. Figure 1, L). An alternative NAADP producer, with higher expression in our infection model, is <italic>Sterile Alpha and TIR Motif Containing 1</italic> [SARM1, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>)]. We measured a slightly decreased invasion efficiency 10 min p.i. in a cell pool lacking SARM1 when compared to WT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, M), suggesting that SARM1 might be enrolled in NAADP production during internalization of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by host cells.</p>
<p>Altogether, our findings support the important role of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion as particularly required early in infection.</p>

<title>Rapid S. aureus invasion requires lysosomal exocytosis, ASM and its substrate sphingomyelin on the host cell surface</title>
<p>Ionomycin treatment results in lysosomal exocytosis, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent process in which lysosomes release their content to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Hence, we treated host cells with Vacuolin-1, an inhibitor blocking this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), which reduced invasion efficiency in HuLEC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, A) and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Figure 2</xref>, A), while not affecting survival of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Figure 2</xref>, B).</p>

<p>Synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) is known to support fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Accordingly, Syt7-depleted HeLa cells demonstrated lower bacterial invasion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, B). As already observed for TPC1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, E), this was most pronounced early in infection further supporting our hypothesis that lysosomal exocytosis is important for rapid invasion events.</p>
<p>Lysosomal exocytosis results in release of ASM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Therefore, prior to infection, the cells were exposed to amitriptyline, a functional inhibitor of ASM (FIASMA), or a competitive inhibitor [ARC39, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>)] at concentrations not affecting bacterial survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Figure 2</xref>, C, D). While invasion in HuLEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVEC) and HeLa was sensitive to both inhibitors, invasion in 16HBE14o<sup>-</sup> and EA.hy926 was not or only marginally affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, C). We excluded that differences among cell lines arose from differential ASM activity or sensitivity to the inhibitors by monitoring enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Figure 2</xref>, E; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Figure 2</xref>, F; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>)].</p>
<p>Next, we treated HuLEC with 10 µM ARC39 or 0.5 µM PCK310, a fast-acting ASM inhibitor. Already after 1h preincubation, PCK310 reduced invasion of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, whereas ARC39 required overnight treatment for a similar reduction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, D). Taken together, these results show that ASM is involved in <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion of host cells.</p>
<p>We removed SM, the substrate of ASM, from plasma membranes of HuLEC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, E) and HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Figure 2</xref>, G) by pretreatment with the bacterial SMase β-toxin. Most human pathogenic <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains including JE2, the strain we use in the present study, do not produce β-toxin, due to a genomic integration of a prophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). SMase pretreatment reduced invasion efficiency in a concentration-dependent manner in both cell lines. 10 ng/ml β-toxin were sufficient to decrease invasion to 34.37 ± 6.24% of that measured in untreated control cells. Interestingly, a 250-fold higher concentration did not lead to further reduction. In line with our previous experiments, this suggests that multiple <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion pathways exist within the same host cell population, of which at least one requires SM and its enzymatic breakdown on the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Next, we infected wild-type as well as the TPC1 or Syt7 K.O. cells with <italic>S. aureus</italic> in presence (but without pretreatment) of 100 ng/ml β-toxin and determined the number of intracellular bacteria after 10 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, F). Presence of β-toxin in the culture medium completely rescued the invasion defect of the K.O. cells. This indicates that reduced bacterial internalization in absence of TPC1 and Syt7 results from a lack in ASM delivery to the cell surface by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent lysosomal exocytosis.</p>

<title>ASM- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated invasion is rapid</title>
<p>To study the role of SM in <italic>S. aureus</italic> uptake kinetics, we incubated HuLEC with fluorescent sphingolipid analogs and recorded <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection by time lapse imaging [<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, A; Supp. Video 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Figure 3</xref>; Supp. Video 2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>)]. We observed that the bacteria were rapidly engulfed by SM-containing membrane compartments. While association of bacteria with BODIPY-FL-C12-SM increased over time during the first 30 min of infection, this was not observed for BODIPY-FL-C12-Ceramide, suggesting that <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion specifically relies on interaction with SM in plasma membranes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, B). Next, we determined the invasion efficiency of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in a time-dependent manner and blocked invasion by either ASM inhibitors, ionomycin, BAPTA-AM or β-toxin pretreatment. We found a time-dependent increase in intracellular bacteria, whereby all treatment conditions reduced bacterial invasion at every time point with the untreated control at 30 min set to 100% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, C). By normalizing the data to the untreated control at the corresponding time points, we found that -with exception of β-toxin-the effect of the treatments was most pronounced early (5-10 min) after infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, D). Thus, early during infection bacteria enter the host cell predominantly in an ASM- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner.</p>

<p>While ASM inhibition marginally affected <italic>S. aureus</italic> association with Rab5-positive phagosomes, that with the Rab7-positive compartment was significantly reduced compared to the untreated control. This was restricted to shorter infection pulses (5-45 min) and was not observed for long infection periods (60 min). We also observed a reduced proportion of bacteria associating with Rab7-positive membranes after treatment with PCK310 or bacterial SMase. However, this was not caused by translocation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to the host cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, A, B). Hence, phagosomes generated ASM-dependently possess different maturation dynamics when compared to phagosomes formed in an ASM-independent fashion.</p>
<p>Next, we measured phagosomal escape while simultaneously detecting SM content of disrupted phagosomal membranes. Therefore, we used a HeLa reporter cell line that cytosolically expresses the phagosomal escape reporter RFP-CWT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) as well as the SM reporter Lysenin<sup>W20A</sup>-YFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>), respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, B). Reporter gene expression in the cell line did not alter <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion dynamics under different treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, C). The reporter cells were left untreated or were pre-exposed to ASM inhibitors and were infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain JE2. In addition, <italic>S. aureus</italic> Cowan I, a strain known to have low escape rates, was used for infection. The proportion of bacteria that escaped from the phagosome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, C) as well as the proportion of escape events that additionally were positive for cytosolic SM (Supp. Figure 4, D) were determined 1.5 h and 3 h p.i. (see also Supp. Figure 5, A-D).</p>
<p>Whereas no differences for Lysenin-positive escape events were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, D), a higher proportion of bacteria escaped from phagosomes on abrogation of ASM activity regardless of the inhibitor used (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, E). A similar increase was observed when we blocked lysosomal exocytosis by Vacuolin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, F).</p>
<p>Since blocking of ASM-dependent uptake reduced the number of intracellular bacteria but increased their phagosomal escape rates, we hypothesized that the presence of SM on the plasma membrane affects downstream events during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. To address this question, we pretreated host cells with the bacterial SMase β-toxin to block SM-dependent invasion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, D; 2a, 2b) and either infected the cells in presence (3a) or after removal of the toxin (3b). β-toxin pretreatment, resulted in enhanced phagosomal escape rates of <italic>S. aureus</italic> JE2, independent of the presence of β-toxin during infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, E; 4a, 4b). This was not observed for infection with the non-cytotoxic Cowan I strain, indicating that removal of SM by β-toxin did not affect general phagosomal membrane stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, G). Moreover, β-toxin treatment strongly reduced recruitment of Lysenin<sup>W20A</sup>, demonstrating effective removal of SM from membranes by β-toxin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supp. Figure 5</xref>, E-J).</p>
<p>To investigate if removal of SM was important at the cell surface or within the phagosome, we infected the cells with an <italic>S. aureus</italic> JE2 strain recombinantly overexpressing β-toxin and Cerulean, or a strain solely expressing Cerulean. We did not observe increased phagosomal escape upon overexpression of β-toxin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, E; 4c), although SM levels of phagosomal membranes were reduced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, F) comparably to samples pretreated with β-toxin (see above). Moreover, we did not detect substantial differences in escape rates of <italic>S. aureus</italic> 6850, a strain naturally producing β-toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, H), and an isogenic β-toxin mutant. By contrast, escape of <italic>S. aureus</italic> 6850 again was enhanced upon pretreatment with β-toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, I) accompanied by absence of SM from phagosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, J).</p>

<p>Phagosomal escape of <italic>S. aureus</italic> thus is independent of SM levels within the infected phagosomes, but rather reflects the presence of SM and ASM at the plasma membrane during host cell entry.</p>
<p>To demonstrate that phagosomal escape is dependent on the pathway of cell entry, we infected reporter cells with <italic>S. aureus</italic> for either a 10 min (“early invaders”) or a 30 min infection pulse (“early and late invaders”). Subsequently, we determined phagosomal escape rates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, H) as well as the number of invaded bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, K). Independent of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) used, bacteria taken up within the first 10 min demonstrated significantly lower escape rates when compared to bacteria that were cocultured with host cells for 30 min.</p>
<p>This was corroborated by HeLa YFP-CWT infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic> expressing a fluorescent protein (e.g. mRFP) for 30 min (“early and late invaders”). After 20 min, we initiated a second infection pulse for 10 min (“early invaders”) with a <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain expressing another fluorescence protein (e.g. Cerulean) and determined phagosomal escape rates of both bacterial recombinants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, I). Again, early invaders demonstrated lower escape rates when compared to the 30 min control. This was independent of the fluorescence expressed by the strain that was used for each infection pulse.</p>
<p>We next monitored phagosomal escape over 10 h in cells pretreated with ASM inhibitors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, A). The compounds enhanced escape rates 3 h p.i. when compared to untreated controls. In contrast, 6 h p.i. escape rates were found decreased upon ASM inhibition.</p>
<p>Taken together, the efficiency of phagosomal escape of <italic>S. aureus</italic> is directly affected by the mode of cell entry, whereby the rapid SM/ASM-dependent pathway results in delayed phagosomal escape, while bacteria that entered host cells ASM-independently escape earlier during infection.</p>
<p>Since translocation to the host cytosol is a prerequisite for <italic>S. aureus</italic> replication in non-professional phagocytes, we recorded intracellular growth of <italic>S. aureus.</italic> In untreated controls replication started about 5 h p.i., and thus shortly after phagosomal escape (3-4 h p.i., <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, B). By contrast, we did not observe significant bacterial replication in cells treated with ASM inhibitors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, B).</p>
<p>We next treated HuLEC with β-toxin, stained the cells with BODIPY-FL-C12-SM and infected the cells with fluorescent <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Live cell imaging demonstrated that most untreated host cells died after 11 h p.i., whereas β-toxin-treated samples showed higher survival rates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, C). This was also observed by cell death assays measuring i) membrane integrity (7-AAD staining, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, D), ii) apoptosis (Annexin V staining, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, E), iii) number of host cells that remained attached to the substratum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supp. Figure 6</xref>, A) and iv) host cell lysis by LDH release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supp. Figure 6</xref>, B).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ASM previously has been implicated in the invasion of several viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). However, the dynamics of ASM-mediated host cell entry, the underlying receptors as well as effects on post-invasion events are only poorly understood.</p>
<p>We here show that ASM is involved within minutes after the pathogen contacts host cells and is concurrent with ASM-independent uptake pathways. We demonstrate that the infection outcome of bacteria that enter the host cells via this rapid pathway is distinct from other entry mechanisms.</p>
<p>We observed a reduction of bacterial invasiveness upon treatment with different ASM inhibitors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, C, D) or removal of the enzyme substrate SM from the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, E) confirming that ASM activity on the host cell surface is crucial for pathogen internalization.</p>
<p>Release of ASM is caused by lysosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Consequently, the inhibitor Vacuolin-1 as well as genetic ablation of Syt7, a key protein in lysosomal exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), resulted in drastically reduced internalization of bacteria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, A, B).</p>
<p>Elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels lead to recruitment of lysosomes to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Whereas most studies implicated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx from the extracellular milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), we here demonstrate that <italic>S. aureus</italic> mainly triggers lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization as was shown by treatment with the inhibitor <italic>trans</italic>-Ned19 as well as a genetic K.O. of the endo-lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel TPC1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, D and E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, G). TPCs have previously been associated with regulation of phagocytic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>) and host cell entry of several viruses such as Ebola virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>)] or SARS-CoV-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>
<p>TPC-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation was shown to induce exocytosis, for instance, during release of cytolytic granules from T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>) or in interplay with TRPM4 during secretion of insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Consistently, the TRPM4 channel blocker 9-Phenantrol reduced internalization of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by host cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, B). Interestingly, exogenous addition of a bacterial SMase immediately before infection rescued the invasion defect in TPC1 and Syt7 K.O. cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, F) indicating that reduced invasion results from a decreased delivery of ASM to the host cell surface. Thus, NAADP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation from lysosomal stores mediates Syt7-dependent fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane resulting in the release of ASM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, F).</p>
<p>Inhibition of CD38, a known NAADP producer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), did not influence uptake of staphylococci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Figure 1</xref>, L). By contrast, we detected a decreased invasion in cells deficient for the Toll-like receptor adaptor protein SARM1, an alternative NAADP producer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). However, the role of SARM1 in lysosomal exocytosis and ASM release requires further investigation. The impact of SARM1 on internalization of <italic>S. aureus</italic> was rather moderate, suggesting the existence of other NAADP-generating enzymes.</p>
<p>One important characteristic of the ASM-dependent internalization pathway is its velocity - taking place within the initial ten minutes of an infection with <italic>S. aureus</italic>, during which treatment with small molecules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, D), as well as genetic ablation of TPC1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, E) and Syt7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, B) resulted in reduction of intracellular bacteria. This was accompanied by the quick formation of <italic>S. aureus</italic>-containing phagosomes decorated with fluorescent SM analogs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Figure 3</xref>, Supp. Video 1, Supp. Video 2).</p>
<p>When we blocked the rapid internalization pathway by ASM inhibitors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, A, C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, B), Vacuolin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, F) or by removal of surface SM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, A, E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, B, H), we observed changes in both, maturation of bacteria-containing vesicles and phagosomal escape. A delayed maturation of phagosomes may affect acidification of the vesicles, a property that is sensed by <italic>S. aureus</italic> leading to expression of a different subset of virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) and hence may alter intracellular pathogenicity. Phagosomal escape of <italic>S. aureus</italic> only was dependent on SM on the plasma membrane during invasion but not on the presence of SM within the phago-endosome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, D-G; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, H, I). This not only corroborated that phagosomal escape of clinically relevant <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains is independent of the bacterial SMase β-toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), but also demonstrated that the outcome of phagosomal escape is influenced by processes at the plasma membrane during cell entry.</p>
<p>To exclude that inhibitor or bSMase treatments caused changes in phagosomal escape by affecting cellular processes other than bacterial uptake, we infected untreated WT cells with <italic>S. aureus</italic> for 10 or 30 min, respectively, and monitored phagosomal escape. Bacteria that invaded within the first 10 minutes after contacting host cells (“early invaders”) are predominantly ASM-dependent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) and demonstrated significantly less phagosomal escape (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, G, H). Consistently, blocking the ASM-dependent pathway led to increased proportions of ASM-independent invaders, which in turn resulted in higher escape rates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, C, E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Figure 4</xref>, F). Intracellular <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections thus are directly influenced by the mode of internalization. This ultimately resulted in lower host cytotoxicity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, C-E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supp. Figure 6</xref>) and bacterial replication (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, B) when we blocked the ASM-dependent invasion.</p>
<p>An uptake-related intracellular fate has been suggested for <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) or <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). However, in these studies the host cells were either depleted from cholesterol, which causes a variety of side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), or internalization was artificially induced by chemicals or ectopic expression of receptors, respectively.</p>
<p>Taken together, we here describe a rapid internalization pathway for <italic>S. aureus</italic> into human epithelial and endothelial cells. Bacteria that enter the host cells via this infection route face a distinct intracellular fate. Here we show, to our knowledge, for the first time that host cells within the same population can be invaded by a pathogen via distinct routes and that this results in a differential infection outcome. Rapid internalization may prove beneficial for pathogens in an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting since internalization by host cells shortens the exposure to the innate immune system within a host. Interestingly, the absence of ASM in <italic>Smpd1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice enhanced the potency of antibiotics to clear <italic>S. aureus</italic> sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that reduced host cell invasion in absence of ASM caused a prolonged exposure of the pathogen to antibiotics. Several FIASMAs are already approved drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>), and may have future use in infection treatment.</p>

<title>Generation of HeLa KO cell lines</title>
<p>Generation of K.O. cell lines is based on a previous protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). sgRNAs (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were designed with the CHOPCHOP online tool (chopchop.cbu.uib.no) and synthesized as primer pairs (Sigma Aldrich).

The number of bacteria per ml in the suspension was determined with a Thoma counting chamber and the MOI was determined. If not indicated otherwise, an MOI=10 was used for infections.</p>
<p>The infection was synchronized by centrifugation 800xg/8 min/RT (end of the centrifugation: t=0). To determine bacterial invasion, the infection was stopped after 30 min (unless indicated otherwise) by removing extracellular bacteria with 20 µg/ml Lysostaphin (AMBI, Cat.

Then, host cells were washed thrice with DPBS, lysed by addition of 1 ml/well (12 well plate) or 0.5 ml/well (24 well plate) Millipore water and the number of bacteria in lysates was determined by plating serial dilutions (10<sup>-1</sup>, 10<sup>-2</sup>, 10<sup>-3</sup>) on TSB agar plates. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and CFU were enumerated. To determine invasion efficiency, the number of bacteria determined in tested samples were normalized to untreated controls (set to 100%).</p>
<p>For measuring invasion dynamics, the number of bacteria was either normalized to the 30 min time point of untreated controls or to the corresponding time points of untreated controls.</p>
<p>If later time points in infection were investigated, infection medium containing 2 µg/ml Lysostaphin was added to the cells until the indicated time.</p>
<p>For testing bacterial susceptibility to inhibitors (“survival”) or adherence, Lysostaphin treatment was omitted, and host cells were immediately lysed by addition of Millipore water or washed five times with DPBS and subsequently lysed with Millipore water, respectively.

Subsequently, fluorescent intensity in every channel is measured to determine recruitment of fluorescence reporters to the bacteria. Results were exported as text files and proportion of bacteria that recruited individual reporters was determined with the Flowing 2 software (Turku Bioscience Center). Phagosomal escape rates were determined as the proportion of CWT-positive bacteria of the total number of intracellular bacteria. Similarly, the proportion of Lysenin<sup>W20A</sup>-positive escape events, the ratio of Lysenin<sup>W20A</sup>-/CWT-positive events and all CWT-positive events was calculated.</p>
<p>To measure the proportion of bacteria that were associated with Rab5 and/or Rab7, the proportion of Rab5- and/or Rab7-positive membranes around bacteria of all intracellular bacteria was determined. For experiments obtained with HeLa cells expressing YFP-Rab7 and RFP-CWT, bacteria that acquired RFP-CWT were removed from the dataset. Subsequently, the proportion of Rab7-positive bacteria in relation to all CWT-negative intracellular bacteria was determined.</p>

For the flow cytometry based read out, cells seeded in a density of 0.5x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in a 24 well plate either one day (HeLa, EA.hy 926, 16HBE14o<sup>-</sup>) or two days (HuLEC, HuVEC) prior to the experiment. Cells were treated with ARC39 and amitriptyline as described above. Then, cells were washed thrice with DPBS and incubated with 10 µM FRET probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) for 2h in presence of the inhibitors. Subsequently, cells were washed thrice, detached with TrypLE<sup>TM</sup> (Gibco<sup>TM</sup>, Cat. No. 12604013) and resuspended with 2% (v/v) FBS in DPBS. Samples were analyzed for FITC (Ex. 488 nm/Em. band pass 530/30 nm) and BODIPY-TR (Ex.: 561nm/ Em. band pass 695/40nm) fluorescence with Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher, Attune Cytometric Software v5.2.0). Cell populations were analyzed for FITC and BODIPY-TR mean fluorescence in Flowing 2 (Turku Bioscience Center) and FITC vs. BODIPY-TR ratios were calculated to determine arbitrary probe conversion.</p>

<title>Cytotoxicity Assays</title>
<p>For all cytotoxicity assays, HuLEC were seeded in 24 well plates with a density of 0.5x10<sup>5</sup> cells per well two days prior to the experiment. Then, cells were infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic> JE2 with the indicated MOI as described in “<italic>S. aureus</italic> infection” and cytotoxicity was determined 21 h p.i. For cytotoxicity measurements upon ionomycin treatment, cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of ionomycin in infection medium for 75 min and then, cytotoxicity assays were conducted.</p>
<p>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was performed with the Cytotoxicity Detection KitPLUS (LDH, Sigma Aldrich, Cat. No. 4744934001) according to manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>For annexin V and 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) assays, cells were washed thrice with DPBS, detached with 250 µL per well trypsin and resuspended in 250 µL per well staining buffer [1.7% (v/v) APC Annexin V (BD Pharmingen<sup>TM</sup>, Cat. No. 550475), 1.7% (v/v) 7-AAD (BD Pharmingen<sup>TM</sup>, Cat No. 559925), 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated (56°C/30 min) FBS (Sigma Aldrich, Cat. No. F7524), 4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Roth, Cat. No. 5239.1) in DPBS]. After incubation for 10 min/RT, cells were analyzed with a Attune NxT flow cytometer for 7-AAD (Ex. 488 nm/Em. band pass 695/40 nm) and APC (Ex. 637 nm/Em. band pass 670/14 nm). Cell populations were analyzed with Flowing2 (Turku Biosciences Center) and gates were adjusted according to untreated control cells. To determine the proportion of cells that remained attached to the substratum during the infection, number of cells was determined based on the number of detected single cells, flow rate and sample volume.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad prism (V10.1.2). One-sample t-test was used for analysis of normalized data sets. Otherwise, one- or two-way ANOVA, dependent on the number of variables, was used in combination with suitable multiple comparisons testing. Details about sample size and deployed statistical analysis can be found in respective figure legends. All data are shown as mean ± standard deviation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Rühling et al analyzes the mode of entry of S. aureus into mammalian cells in culture. The authors propose a novel mechanism of rapid entry that involves the release of calcium from lysosomes via NAADP-stimulated activation of TPC1, which in turn causes lysosomal exocytosis; exocytic release of lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is then envisaged to convert exofacial sphingomyelin to ceramide. These events not only induce the rapid entry of the bacteria into the host cells but are also described to alter the fate of the intracellular S. aureus, facilitating escape from the endocytic vacuole to the cytosol.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The proposed mechanism is novel and could have important biological consequences.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the evidence provided is unconvincing and insufficient to document the multiple, complex steps suggested. In fact, there appear to be numerous internal inconsistencies that detract from the validity of the conclusions, which were reached mostly based on the use of pharmacological agents of imperfect specificity.</p>
<p>Firstly, the release of calcium from lysosomes is not demonstrated. Localized changes in the immediate vicinity of lysosomes need to be measured to ascertain that these organelles are the source of cytosolic calcium changes. In fact, 9-phenantrol, which the authors find to be the most potent inhibitor of invasion and hence of the putative calcium changes, is not a blocker of lysosomal calcium release but instead blocks plasmalemmal TRPM4 channels. On the other hand, invasion is seemingly independent of external calcium. These findings are inconsistent with each other and point to non-specific effects of 9-phenantrol. The fact that ionomycin decreases invasion efficiency is taken as additional evidence of the importance of lysosomal calcium release. It is not clear how these observations support involvement of lysosomal calcium release and exocytosis; in fact treatment with the ionophore should itself have induced lysosomal exocytosis and stimulated, rather than inhibited invasion. Yet, manipulations that increase and others that decrease cytosolic calcium both inhibited invasion.</p>
<p>The proposed role of NAADP is based on the effects of &quot;knocking out&quot; TPC1 and on the pharmacological effects of Ned-19. It is noteworthy that TPC2, rather than TPC1, is generally believed to be the primary TPC isoform of lysosomes. Moreover, the gene ablation accomplished in the TPC1 &quot;knockouts&quot; is only partial and rather unsatisfactory. Definitive conclusions about the role of TPC1 can only be reached with proper, full knockouts. Even the pharmacological approach is unconvincing because the high doses of Ned-19 used should have blocked both TPC isoforms and presumably precluded invasion. Instead, invasion is reduced by only ≈50%. A much greater inhibition was reported using 9-phenantrol, the blocker of plasmalemmal calcium channels. How is the selective involvement of lysosomal TPC1 channels justified?</p>
<p>Invoking an elevation of NAADP as the mediator of calcium release requires measurements of the changes in NAADP concentration in response to the bacteria. This was not performed. Instead, the authors analyzed the possible contribution of putative NAADP-generating systems and reported that the most active of these, CD38, was without effect, while the elimination of SARM1, another potential source of NAADP, had a very modest (≈20%) inhibitory effect that may have been due to clonal variation, which was not ruled out. In view of these data, the conclusion that NAADP is involved in the invasion process seems unwarranted.</p>
<p>The involvement of lysosomal secretion is, again, predicated largely on the basis of pharmacological evidence. No direct evidence is provided for the insertion of lysosomal components into the plasma membrane, or for the release of lysosomal contents to the medium. Instead, inhibition of lysosomal exocytosis by vacuolin-1 is the sole source of evidence. However, vacuolin-1 is by no means a specific inhibitor of lysosomal secretion: it is now known to act primarily as a PIKfyve inhibitor and to cause massive distortion of the endocytic compartment, including gross swelling of endolysosomes. The modest (20-25%) inhibition observed when using synaptotagmin 7 knockout cells is similarly not convincing proof of the requirement for lysosomal secretion.</p>
<p>ASM is proposed to play a central role in the rapid invasion process. As above, most of the evidence offered in this regard is pharmacological and often inconsistent between inhibitors or among cell types. Some drugs affect some of the cells, but not others. It is difficult to reach general conclusions regarding the role of ASM. The argument is made even more complex by the authors' use of exogenous sphingomyelinase (beta-toxin). Pretreatment with the toxin decreased invasion efficiency, a seemingly paradoxical result. Incidentally, the effectiveness of the added toxin is never quantified/validated by directly measuring the generation of ceramide or the disappearance of SM.</p>
<p>The use of fluorescent analogs of sphingomyelin and ceramide is not well justified and it is unclear what conclusions can be derived from these observations. Despite the low resolution of the images provided, it appears as if the labeled lipids are largely in endomembrane compartments, where they would presumably be inaccessible to the secreted ASM. Moreover, considering the location of the BODIPY probe, the authors would be unable to distinguish intact sphingomyelin from its breakdown product, ceramide. What can be concluded from these experiments? Incidentally, the authors report only 10% of BODIPY-positive events after 10 min. What are the implications of this finding? That 90% of the invasion events are unrelated to sphingomyelin, ASM, and ceramide?</p>
<p>It is also unclear how the authors can distinguish lysenin entry into ruptured vacuoles from the entry of RFP-CWT, used as a criterion of bacterial escape. Surely the molecular weights of the probes are not sufficiently different to prevent the latter one from traversing the permeabilized membrane until such time that the bacteria escape from the vacuole.</p>
<p>Both SMase inhibitors (Figure 4C) and SMase pretreatment increased bacterial escape from the vacuole. The former should prevent SM hydrolysis and formation of ceramide, while the latter treatment should have the exact opposite effects, yet the end result is the same. What can one conclude regarding the need and role of the SMase products in the escape process?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Ruhling et al propose a rapid uptake pathway that is dependent on lysosomal exocytosis, lysosomal Ca2+ and acid sphingomyelinase, and further suggest that the intracellular trafficking and fate of the pathogen is dictated by the mode of entry.</p>
<p>The evidence provided is solid, methods used are appropriate and results largely support their conclusions, but can be substantiated further as detailed below. The weakness is a reliance on chemical inhibitors that can be non-specific to delineate critical steps.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>A large number of experiments rely on treatment with chemical inhibitors. While this approach is reasonable, many of the inhibitors employed such as amitriptyline and vacuolin1 have other or non-defined cellular targets and pleiotropic effects cannot be ruled out. Given the centrality of ASM for the manuscript, it will be important to replicate some key results with ASM KO cells.</p>
<p>Most experiments are done in HeLa cells. Given the pathway is projected as generic, it will be important to further characterize cell type specificity for the process. Some evidence for a similar mechanism in other cell types S. aureus infects, perhaps phagocytic cell type, might be good.</p>
<p>I'm a little confused about the role of ASM on the surface. Presumably, it converts SM to ceramide, as the final model suggests. Overexpression of b-toxin results in the near complete absence of SM on phagosomes (having representative images will help appreciate this), but why is phagosomal SM detected at high levels in untreated conditions? If bacteria are engulfed by SM-containing membrane compartments, what role does ASM play on the surface? If surface SM is necessary for phagosomal escape within the cell, do the authors imply that ASM is tuning the surface SM levels to a certain optimal range? Alternatively, can there be additional roles for ASM on the cell surface? Can surface SM levels be visualized (for example, in Figure 4 E, F)?</p>
<p>Related to that, why is ASM activity on the cell surface important? Its role in non-infectious or other contexts can be discussed.</p>
<p>If SM removal is so crucial for uptake, can exocytosis of lysosomes alone provide sufficient ASM for SM removal? How much or to what extent is lysosomal exocytosis enhanced by initial signaling events? Do the authors envisage the early events in their model happening in localized confines of the PM, this can be discussed.</p>
<p>How are inhibitor doses determined? How efficient is the removal of extracellular bacteria at 10 min? It will be good to substantiate the cfu experiments for infectivity with imaging-based methods. Are the roles of TPC1 and TPC2 redundant? If so, why does silencing TPC1 alone result in a decrease in infectivity? For these and other assays, it would be better to show raw values for infectivity. Please show alterations in lysosomal Ca2+ at the doses of inhibitors indicated. Is lysosomal Ca2+ released upon S. aureus binding to the cell surface? Will be good to directly visualize this.</p>
<p>The precise identification of cytosolic vs phagosomal bacteria is not very easy to appreciate. The methods section indicates how this distinction is made, but how do the authors deal with partial overlaps and ambiguities generally associated with such analyses? Please show respective images. The number of events (individual bacteria) for the live cell imaging data should be clearly mentioned.</p>
<p>In the phagosome maturation experiments, what is the proportion of bacteria in Rab5 or Rab7 compartments at each time point? Will the decreased Rab7 association be accompanied by increased Rab5? Showing raw values and images will help appreciate such differences. Given the expertise and tools available in live cell imaging, can the authors trace Rab5 and Rab7 positive compartment times for the same bacteria?</p>
<p>The results with longer-term infection are interesting. Live cell imaging suggests that ASM-inhibited cells show accelerated phagosomal escape that reduces by 6 hpi. Where are the bacteria at this time point ? Presumably, they should have reached lysosomes. The relationship between cytosolic escape, replication, and host cell death is interesting, but the evidence, as presented is correlative for the populations. Given the use of live cell imaging, can the authors show these events in the same cell?</p>
<p>Given the inherent heterogeneity in uptake processes and the use of inhibitors in most experiments, the distinction between ASM-dependent and independent pathways might not be as clear-cut as the authors suggest. Some caution here will be good. Can the authors estimate what fraction of intracellular bacteria are taken up ASM-dependent?</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Rühling et al analyzes the mode of entry of S. aureus into mammalian cells in culture. The authors propose a novel mechanism of rapid entry that involves the release of calcium from lysosomes via NAADP-stimulated activation of TPC1, which in turn causes lysosomal exocytosis; exocytic release of lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is then envisaged to convert exofacial sphingomyelin to ceramide. These events not only induce the rapid entry of the bacteria into the host cells but are also described to alter the fate of the intracellular S. aureus, facilitating escape from the endocytic vacuole to the cytosol.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The proposed mechanism is novel and could have important biological consequences.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the evidence provided is unconvincing and insufficient to document the multiple, complex steps suggested. In fact, there appear to be numerous internal inconsistencies that detract from the validity of the conclusions, which were reached mostly based on the use of pharmacological agents of imperfect specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the detailed evaluation of our manuscript. We will address the criticism below.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that many of the experiments presented in our study rely on the usage of inhibitors. However, we want to emphasize that the main conclusion (invasion pathway affects the intracellular fate/phagosomal escape) was demonstrated without the use of inhibitors or genetic ablation in two key experiments (Figure4 G/H). These experiments were in line with the results we obtained with inhibitors (amitriptyline [Supp. Figure 4E], ARC39, PCK310, [Figure 4c] and Vacuolin-1 [Supp. Figure4f]). Importantly, the hypothesis was also supported by another key experiment, in which we showed the intracellular fate of bacteria is affected by removal of SM from the plasma membrane before invasion, but not by removal of SM from phagosomal membranes after bacteria internalization (Figure4d-f). Taken together, we thus believe that the main hypothesis is strongly supported by our data.</p>
<p>Moreover, we either used different inhibitors for the same molecule (ASM was inhibited by ARC39, amitriptyline and PCK310 with similar outcome) or supported our hypothesis with gene-ablated cell pools (TPC1, Syt7, SARM1), as we will point out in more detail below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Firstly, the release of calcium from lysosomes is not demonstrated. Localized changes in the immediate vicinity of lysosomes need to be measured to ascertain that these organelles are the source of cytosolic calcium changes. In fact, 9-phenantrol, which the authors find to be the most potent inhibitor of invasion and hence of the putative calcium changes, is not a blocker of lysosomal calcium release but instead blocks plasmalemmal TRPM4 channels. On the other hand, invasion is seemingly independent of external calcium. These findings are inconsistent with each other and point to non-specific effects of 9-phenantrol. The fact that ionomycin decreases invasion efficiency is taken as additional evidence of the importance of lysosomal calcium release. It is not clear how these observations support involvement of lysosomal calcium release and exocytosis; in fact treatment with the ionophore should itself have induced lysosomal exocytosis and stimulated, rather than inhibited invasion. Yet, manipulations that increase and others that decrease cytosolic calcium both inhibited invasion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With respect to lysosomal Ca2+ release, we agree with the reviewer that direct visual demonstration of lysosomal Ca2+ release upon infection will improve the manuscript. We therefore will perform additional experimentation to show alterations of Ca2+ at the lysosomes during infection.</p>
<p>As to the TRPM4 involvement in <italic>S. aureus</italic> host cell internalization, it has been reported that TRPM4 is activated by cytosolic Ca2+. However, the channel conducts monovalent cations such as K+ or Na+ but is impermeable for Ca2+ 1, 2. The following of our observations are supporting this:</p>
<p>i) <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion is dependent on intracellular Ca2+, but is independent from extracellular Ca2+  (Figure 1c).</p>
<p>ii) 9-phenantrol treatment reduces <italic>S. aureus</italic> internalization by host cells, illustrating the dependence of this process on TRPM4 (Figure 1b). We therefore hypothesize that TRPM4 is activated by Ca2+ released from lysosomes (see above).</p>
<p>TRPM4 is localized to focal adhesions and is connected to actin cytoskeleton3, 4 – a requisite of host cell entry of <italic>S. aureus</italic>.5, 6 This speaks for an important function of TRPM4 in uptake of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in general, but does not necessarily have to be involved exclusively in the <italic>rapid uptake pathway</italic>.</p>
<p>TRPM4 itself is not permeable for Ca2+ but is activated by the cation.  Thus, it is unlikely to cause lysosomal exocytosis. The stronger bacterial uptake reduction by treatment with 9-phenantrol when compared to Ned19 thus may be caused by the involvement of TRPM4 in additional pathways of <italic>S. aureus</italic> host cell entry involving that association of TRPM4 with focal adhesions or, as pointed out by the reviewer, unspecific side effects of 9-phenantrol that we currently cannot exclude. We will include this information in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding the reduced <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion after ionomycin treatment, we agree with the reviewer that ionomycin is known to lead to lysosomal exocytosis as was previously shown by others7 as well as our laboratory8.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that pretreatment with ionomycin would trigger lysosomal exocytosis and thus would reduce the pool of lysosomes that can undergo exocytosis before host cells are contacted by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. As a result, we should observe a marked reduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> internalization in such “lysosome-depleted cells”, if the lysosomal exocytosis is coupled to bacterial uptake. Our observation of reduced bacterial internalization after ionomycin treatment supports this hypothesis.</p>
<p>However, ionomycin treatment and <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection of host cells are distinct processes.</p>
<p>While ionomycin results in strong global and non-directional lysosomal exocytosis of all “releasable” lysosomes (~5-10 % of all lysosomes according to previous observations)7, we hypothesize that lysosomal exocytosis upon contact with <italic>S. aureus</italic> only involves a very small proportion of lysosomes at host-bacteria contact sites.</p>
<p>Since ionomycin disturbs the overall cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, we agree with the reviewer that this does not directly show lysosomal Ca2+ liberation. We will discuss this in more detail in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The proposed role of NAADP is based on the effects of &quot;knocking out&quot; TPC1 and on the pharmacological effects of Ned-19. It is noteworthy that TPC2, rather than TPC1, is generally believed to be the primary TPC isoform of lysosomes. Moreover, the gene ablation accomplished in the TPC1 &quot;knockouts&quot; is only partial and rather unsatisfactory. Definitive conclusions about the role of TPC1 can only be reached with proper, full knockouts. Even the pharmacological approach is unconvincing because the high doses of Ned-19 used should have blocked both TPC isoforms and presumably precluded invasion. Instead, invasion is reduced by only ≈50%. A much greater inhibition was reported using 9-phenantrol, the blocker of plasmalemmal calcium channels. How is the selective involvement of lysosomal TPC1 channels justified?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As to partial gene ablation of TPC1: To avoid clonal variances, we usually perform pool sorting to obtain a cell population that predominantly contains cells -here- deficient in TPC1, but also a small proportion of wildtype cells as seen by the residual TPC1 protein on the Western blot. We observe a significant reduction of bacterial uptake in this cell pool suggesting that the uptake reduction in a pure K.O. population may be even larger.</p>
<p>As to the inhibition by Ned19: We agree with the reviewer that Ned19 inhibits TPC1 and TPC2. Since ablation of TPC1 reduced invasion of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we concluded that TPC1 is important for <italic>S. aureus</italic> host cell invasion. We thus agree with the reviewer that a role for TPC2 cannot be excluded. We will clarify this in the reviewed manuscript. It needs to be noted, however, that deficiency in either TPC1 or TPC2 alone was sufficient to prevent Ebola virus infection9, which is in line with our observations.</p>
<p>The 50% reduction of invasion upon Ned19 treatment (Figure 1d) is comparable with the reduction caused by other compounds that influence the ASM-dependent pathway (such as amitriptyline, ARC39 [Figure 2c], BAPTA-AM [Figure 1c], Vacuolin-1 [Figure 2a], β-toxin [Figure 2e] and ionomycin [Figure 1a]). Further, the partial reduction of invasion is most likely due to the concurrent activity of multiple internalization pathways which are not all targeted by the used compounds.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Invoking an elevation of NAADP as the mediator of calcium release requires measurements of the changes in NAADP concentration in response to the bacteria. This was not performed. Instead, the authors analyzed the possible contribution of putative NAADP-generating systems and reported that the most active of these, CD38, was without effect, while the elimination of SARM1, another potential source of NAADP, had a very modest (≈20%) inhibitory effect that may have been due to clonal variation, which was not ruled out. In view of these data, the conclusion that NAADP is involved in the invasion process seems unwarranted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our results from two independent experimental set-ups (Ned19 [Figure 1d] and TPC1 K.O. [Figure 1e &amp; Figure 2f]) indicate the involvement of NAADP in the process. However, the measurement of NAADP concentration is non-trivial. However, we can rule out clonal variation in the SARM1 mutant since experiments were conducted with a cell pool as described above in order to avoid clonal variation of single clones.</p>
<p>The mechanism behind biosynthesis of NAADP is still debated. CD38 was the first enzyme discovered to possess the ability of producing NAADP. However, it requires acidic pH to produce NAADP10 -which does not match the characteristics of a cytosolic NAADP producer. HeLa cells do not express CD38 and hence, it is not surprising that inhibition of CD38 had no effect on <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion in HeLa cells. However, NAADP production by HeLa cells was observed in absence of CD3811. Thus CD38-independent NAADP generation is likely. SARM1 can produce NAADP at neutral pH12 and is expressed in HeLa, thus providing a more promising candidate.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the reduction of <italic>S. aureus</italic> internalization after ablation of SARM1 is less pronounced than in other experiments of ours. This may be explained by NAADP originating from other enzymes, such as the recently discovered DUOX1, DUOX2, NOX1 and NOX213, which – with exception of DUOX2- possess a low expression even in HeLa cells. We will discuss this in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The involvement of lysosomal secretion is, again, predicated largely on the basis of pharmacological evidence. No direct evidence is provided for the insertion of lysosomal components into the plasma membrane, or for the release of lysosomal contents to the medium. Instead, inhibition of lysosomal exocytosis by vacuolin-1 is the sole source of evidence. However, vacuolin-1 is by no means a specific inhibitor of lysosomal secretion: it is now known to act primarily as a PIKfyve inhibitor and to cause massive distortion of the endocytic compartment, including gross swelling of endolysosomes. The modest (20-25%) inhibition observed when using synaptotagmin 7 knockout cells is similarly not convincing proof of the requirement for lysosomal secretion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the manuscript will strongly benefit from a functional analysis of lysosomal exocytosis. We therefore will conduct assays to investigate exocytosis in the revision. However, we previously showed i) by addition of specific antisera that LAMP1 transiently is exposed on the plasma membrane during ionomycin and pore-forming toxin challenge and ii) demonstrated the release of ASM activity into the culture medium under these conditions.8 Both measurements are not compatible with <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, since LAMP1 antibodies also are non-specifically bound by protein A and another IgG-binding protein on the <italic>S. aureus</italic> surface, which would bias the results. Since protein A also serves as an adhesin, we cannot simply delete the ORF without changing other aspects of staphylococcal virulence. Further, FBS contains a ASM background activity that impedes activity measurements of cell culture medium. We previously removed this background activity by a specific heat-inactivation protocol.8 However, <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion is strongly reduced in culture medium containing this heat-inactivated FBS.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that Vacuolin-1 has unspecific side effects. We will address this in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>As to the involvement of synaptotagmin 7:</p>
<p>Synaptotagmin 7 is not the only protein possibly involved in Ca-dependent exocytosis. For instance, SYT1 has been shown to possess an overlapping function.14 This may explain the discrepancy between our vacuolin-1 and SYT7 ablation experiments. We will add an according section to the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>ASM is proposed to play a central role in the rapid invasion process. As above, most of the evidence offered in this regard is pharmacological and often inconsistent between inhibitors or among cell types. Some drugs affect some of the cells, but not others. It is difficult to reach general conclusions regarding the role of ASM. The argument is made even more complex by the authors' use of exogenous sphingomyelinase (beta-toxin). Pretreatment with the toxin decreased invasion efficiency, a seemingly paradoxical result. Incidentally, the effectiveness of the added toxin is never quantified/validated by directly measuring the generation of ceramide or the disappearance of SM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although pharmacological inhibitors can have unspecific side effects, we want to emphasize that the inhibitors used in our study act on the enzyme ASM by completely different mechanisms. Amitriptyline is a so called functional inhibitor of ASM (FIASMA) which induces the detachment of ASM from lysosomal membranes resulting in degradation of the enzyme.15 By contrast, ARC39 is a competitive inhibitor.16, 17</p>
<p>We do not see inconsistencies in our data obtained with ASM inhibitors. Amitriptyline and ARC39 both reduce the invasion of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in HuLEC, HuVEC and HeLa cells (Figure 2c). ARC39 needs a longer pre-incubation, since its uptake by host cells is slower (data not shown). We observe a different outcome in 16HBE14o- and Ea.Hy 926 cells, with 16HBE14o- even demonstrating a slightly increased invasion of <italic>S. aureus</italic> upon ARC39 treatment. Amitriptyline had no effect (Figure 2c). Moreover, both inhibitors affected the invasion dynamics (Figure 3d), phagosomal escape (Figure 4c and Supp. Figure 4e) and Rab7 recruitment (Figure 4a and Supp. Figure 4b) in a similar fashion. Proper inhibition of ASM by both compounds in all cell lines used was validated by enzyme assays (Supp. Figure 2e), which suggests that the ASM-dependent pathway does only exist in specific cell lines. This also may serve as an argument that we here do not observe unspecific side effects of the compounds. We will clarify this in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>ASM is a key player for SM degradation and recycling. In clinical context, deficiency in ASM results in the so-called Niemann Pick disease type A/B. The lipid profile of ASM-deficient cells is massively altered18, which will result in severe side effects. Short-term inhibition by small molecules therefore poses a clear benefit when compared to the usage of ASM K.O. cells.</p>
<p>As to the treatment with a bacterial sphingomyelinase:</p>
<p>Treatment with the bacterial SMase (bSMase, here: β-toxin) was performed in two different ways:</p>
<p>i) Pretreatment of host cells with β-toxin to remove SM from the host cell surface before infection. This removes the substrate of ASM from the cell surface prior to addition of the bacteria (Figure 2e, Figure 4d-f). Since SM is not present on the extracellular plasma membrane leaflet after treatment, a release of ASM cannot cause localized ceramide formation at the sites of lysosomal exocytosis. Similar observations were made by others.19</p>
<p>ii) Addition of bSMase to host cells together with the bacteria to complement for the absence of ASM (Figure 2f).</p>
<p>Removal of the ASM substrate before infection (i) prevents localized ASM-mediated conversion of SM to Cer during infection and resulted in a decreased invasion, while addition of the SMase during infection resulted in an increased invasion in TPC1 and SYT7 ablated cells. Thus, both experiments are consistent with each other and in line with our other observations.</p>
<p>Removal of SM from the plasma membrane by β-toxin was indirectly demonstrated by the absence of Lysenin recruitment to phagosomes/escaped bacteria when host cells were pretreatment with the toxin before infection (Figure4F). In another publication, we recently quantified the effectiveness of β-toxin treatment, even though with slightly longer treatment times (75 min vs. 3h).20 We will repeat the measurements also for shorter treatment times.</p>
<p>To clarify our experimental approaches to the readership we will add an explanatory section to the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>As to the general conclusions regarding the role of ASM: ASM and lysosomal exocytosis has been shown to be involved in uptake of a variety of pathogens19, 21-25 supporting its role in the process.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The use of fluorescent analogs of sphingomyelin and ceramide is not well justified and it is unclear what conclusions can be derived from these observations. Despite the low resolution of the images provided, it appears as if the labeled lipids are largely in endomembrane compartments, where they would presumably be inaccessible to the secreted ASM. Moreover, considering the location of the BODIPY probe, the authors would be unable to distinguish intact sphingomyelin from its breakdown product, ceramide. What can be concluded from these experiments? Incidentally, the authors report only 10% of BODIPY-positive events after 10 min. What are the implications of this finding? That 90% of the invasion events are unrelated to sphingomyelin, ASM, and ceramide?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>During the experiments with fluorescent SM analogues (Figure 3a,b), <italic>S. aureus</italic> was added to the samples immediately before start of video recording. Hence, bacteria are slowly trickling onto the host cells and we thus can image the initial contact between them and the bacteria, for instance, the bacteria depicted in Figure 3a contact the host cell about 9 min before becoming BODIPY-FL-positive (see Supp. Video 1, 55 min). Hence, we think that in these cases we see the formation of phagosomes around bacteria rather than bacteria in endomembrane compartments. Since generation of phagosomes happens at the plasma membrane, SM is accessible to secreted ASM.</p>
<p>The “trickling” approach for infection is an experimental difference to our invasion measurements, in which we synchronized the infection by a very slow centrifugation. This ensures that all bacteria have contact to host cells and are not just floating in the culture medium. However, live cell imaging of initial bacterial-host contact and synchronization of infection is technically not combinable.</p>
<p>In our invasion measurements -with synchronization-, we typically see internalization of ~20% of all added bacteria after 30 min. Hence, most bacteria that are visible in our videos likely are still extracellular and only a small proportion was internalized. This explains why only 10% of total bacteria are positive for BODIPY-FL-SM after 10 min. The proportion of internalized bacteria that are positive for BODIPY-FL-SM should be way higher but cannot be determined with this method.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that we cannot observe conversion of BODIPY-FL-SM by ASM. In order to do that, we attempted to visualize the conversion of a visible-range SM FRET probe (Supp. Figure 3), but the structure of the probe is not compatible with measurement of conversion on the plasma membrane, since the FITC fluorophore released into the culture medium by the ASM activity thereby gets lost for imaging. In general, the visualization of SM conversion with subcellular resolution is challenging and even with novel tools developed in our lab26 visualization of SM on the plasma membrane is difficult.</p>
<p>The conclusion we draw from these experiments are that i.) <italic>S. aureus</italic> invasion is associated with SM and ii.) SM-associated invasion can be very fast, since bacteria are rapidly engulfed by BODIPY-FL-SM containing membranes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is also unclear how the authors can distinguish lysenin entry into ruptured vacuoles from the entry of RFP-CWT, used as a criterion of bacterial escape. Surely the molecular weights of the probes are not sufficiently different to prevent the latter one from traversing the permeabilized membrane until such time that the bacteria escape from the vacuole.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We here want to clarify that both, the Lysenin as well as the CWT reporter have access to rupture vacuoles (Figure 4b). We used the Lysenin reporter in these experiments for estimation of SM content of phagosomal membranes. If a vacuole is ruptured, both the bacteria and the luminal leaflet of the phagosomal membrane remnants get in contact with the cytosol and hence with the cytosolically expressed reporters YFP-Lysenin as well as RFP-CWT resulting in “Lysenin-positive escape” when phagosomes contained SM (see Figure 4f). By contrast, either β-toxin expression by S. aureus or pre-treatment with the bSMase resulted in absence of Lysenin recruitment suggesting that the phagosomal SM levels were decreased/undetectable (Figure 4f, Supp Figure 5f, g, i, j).</p>
<p>This approach does not enable a quantitative measurement of phagosomal SM and rather gives a “yes or no” answer. However, we think this method is sufficient to show that β-toxin expression and pretreatment markedly decreased phagosomal SM levels in the host cells.</p>
<p>The approach we used here to analyze “Lysenin-positive escape” can clearly be distinguished from Lysenin-based methods that were used by others.27 There Lysenin was used to show trans-bilayer movement of SM before rupture of bacteria-containing phagosomes.</p>
<p>To clarify the function of Lysenin in our approach we will add an additional figure to the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Both SMase inhibitors (Figure 4C) and SMase pretreatment increased bacterial escape from the vacuole. The former should prevent SM hydrolysis and formation of ceramide, while the latter treatment should have the exact opposite effects, yet the end result is the same. What can one conclude regarding the need and role of the SMase products in the escape process?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out above, pretreatment of host cells with SMase removes SM from the plasma membrane and hence, ASM does not have access to its substrate. Hence, both treatment with either ASM inhibitors or pretreatment with bacterial SMase prevent ASM from being active on the plasma membrane and hence block the ASM-dependent uptake (Figure 2 c, e). Although overall less bacteria were internalized by host cells under these conditions, the bacteria that invaded host cells did so in an ASM-independent manner.</p>
<p>Since blockage of the ASM-dependent internalization pathway (with ASM inhibitor [Figure 4c], SMase pretreatment [Figure 4e] and Vacuolin-1[Supp. Fig.4f]) always resulted in enhanced phagosomal escape, we conclude that bacteria that were internalized in an ASM-independent fashion cause enhanced escape. Vice versa, bacteria that enter host cells in an ASM-dependent manner demonstrate lower escape rates.</p>
<p>This is supported by comparing the escape rates of “early” and “late” invaders [Figure 4g/h], which in our opinion is a key experiment that supports this hypothesis. The “early” invaders are predominantly ASM-dependent (see e.g. Figure 3e) and thus, bacteria that entered host cell in the first 10 min of infection should have been internalized predominantly in an ASM-dependent fashion, while slower entry pathways are active later during infection. The early ASM dependent invaders possessed lower escape rates, which is in line with the data obtained with inhibitors (e.g. Figure 4c and Supp. Fig. 4f).</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the activity of ASM on the plasma membrane during invasion mediates the recruitment of a specific subset of receptors, which then influence downstream phagosomal maturation and escape. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the subset of receptors interacting with <italic>S. aureus</italic> is altered upon inhibition of the ASM-dependent uptake pathway. We describe this in another study that is currently under evaluation elsewhere.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Ruhling et al propose a rapid uptake pathway that is dependent on lysosomal exocytosis, lysosomal Ca2+ and acid sphingomyelinase, and further suggest that the intracellular trafficking and fate of the pathogen is dictated by the mode of entry.</p>
<p>The evidence provided is solid, methods used are appropriate and results largely support their conclusions, but can be substantiated further as detailed below. The weakness is a reliance on chemical inhibitors that can be non-specific to delineate critical steps.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>A large number of experiments rely on treatment with chemical inhibitors. While this approach is reasonable, many of the inhibitors employed such as amitriptyline and vacuolin1 have other or non-defined cellular targets and pleiotropic effects cannot be ruled out. Given the centrality of ASM for the manuscript, it will be important to replicate some key results with ASM KO cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the critical evaluation of our manuscript and plenty of constructive comments.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, that ASM inhibitors such as functional inhibitors of ASM (FIASMA) like amitriptyline used in our study have unspecific side effects given their mode-of-action. FIASMAs induce the detachment of ASM from lysosomal membranes resulting in degradation of the enzyme.15  However, we want to emphasize that we also used the competitive inhibitor ARC39 in our study16, 17 which acts on the enzyme by a completely different mechanism. All phenotypes (reduced invasion [Figure 2c, d], effect on invasion dynamics [Figure 3d], enhanced escape [Figure 4c and Supp Figure 4e] and differential recruitment of Rab7 [Supp. Figure 4b]) were observed with both inhibitors thereby supporting the role of ASM in the process.</p>
<p>We further agree that experiments with genetic evidence usually support and improve scientific findings. However, ASM is a cellular key player for SM degradation and recycling. In a clinical context, deficiency in ASM results in a so-called Niemann Pick disease type A/B. The lipid profile of ASM-deficient cells is massively altered18, which in itself will result in severe side effects. Thus, the usage of inhibitors provides a clear benefit when compared to ASM K.O. cells, since ASM activity can be targeted in a short-term fashion thereby preventing larger alterations in cellular lipid composition.</p>

<p>Most experiments are done in HeLa cells. Given the pathway is projected as generic, it will be important to further characterize cell type specificity for the process. Some evidence for a similar mechanism in other cell types S. aureus infects, perhaps phagocytic cell type, might be good.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Whenever possible we performed the experiments not only in HeLa but also in HuLECs. For example, we refer to experiments concerning the role of Ca2+ (Figure 1c/Supp.Figure1e), lysosomal Ca2+/Ned19 (Figure1d/Supp Figure 1g), lysosomal exocytosis/Vacuolin-1 (Figure 2a/Supp. Figure2a), ASM/ARC39 and amitriptyline (Figure 2c), surface SM/β-toxin (Figure 2e/Supp. Figure 2g), analysis of invasion dynamics (complete Figure 3) and measurement of cell death during infection (Figure 5c-e, Supp. Figure 6a+b).</p>
<p>HuLECs, however, are not really genetically amenable and hence we were not able to generate gene deletions in these cells and upon introduction of the fluorescence escape reporter the cells are not readily growing.</p>
<p>As to ASM involvement in phagocytic cells: a role for ASM during the uptake of <italic>S. aureus</italic> by macrophages was previously reported by others.23 However, in professional phagocytes <italic>S. aureus</italic> does not escape from the phagosome and replicates within the vacuole.28</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I'm a little confused about the role of ASM on the surface. Presumably, it converts SM to ceramide, as the final model suggests. Overexpression of b-toxin results in the near complete absence of SM on phagosomes (having representative images will help appreciate this), but why is phagosomal SM detected at high levels in untreated conditions? If bacteria are engulfed by SM-containing membrane compartments, what role does ASM play on the surface? If surface SM is necessary for phagosomal escape within the cell, do the authors imply that ASM is tuning the surface SM levels to a certain optimal range? Alternatively, can there be additional roles for ASM on the cell surface? Can surface SM levels be visualized (for example, in Figure 4 E, F)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We initially hypothesized that we would detect higher phagosomal SM levels upon inhibition of ASM, since our model suggests SM cleavage by ASM on the host cell surface during bacterial cell entry. However, we did not detect any changes in our experiments (Supp. Figure 4d). We currently favor the following explanation: SM is the most abundant sphingolipid in human cells.29 If peripheral lysosomes are exocytosed and thereby release ASM, only a localized and relative small proportion of SM may get converted to Cer, which most likely is below our detection limit. In addition, the detection of cytosolically exposed phagosomal SM by YFP-Lysenin is not quantitative and provides a “Yes or No” measurement. Hence, we think that the rather limited SM to Cer conversion in combination with the high abundance of SM in cellular membranes does not visibly affect the recruitment of the Lysenin reporter.</p>
<p>In our experiments that employ BODIPY-FL-SM (Figure 3a+b), we cannot distinguish between native SM and downstream metabolites such as Cer. Hence, again we cannot make any assumptions on the extent to which SM is converted on the surface during bacterial internalization. Although our laboratory recently used trifunctional sphingolipid analogs to analyze the SM to Cer conversion20, the visualization of this process on the plasma membrane is currently still challenging.</p>
<p>Overall, we hypothesize that the localized generation of Cer on the surface by released ASM leads to generation of Cer-enriched platforms. Subsequently, a certain subset of receptors may be recruited to these platforms and influence the uptake process. These platforms are supposed to be very small, which also would explain that we did not detect changes in Lysenin recruitment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to that, why is ASM activity on the cell surface important? Its role in non-infectious or other contexts can be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>ASM release by lysosomal exocytosis is implied in plasma membrane repair upon injury. We will this discuss this in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If SM removal is so crucial for uptake, can exocytosis of lysosomes alone provide sufficient ASM for SM removal? How much or to what extent is lysosomal exocytosis enhanced by initial signaling events? Do the authors envisage the early events in their model happening in localized confines of the PM, this can be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ionomycin treatment led to a release of ~10 % of all lysosomes and also increased extracellular ASM activity.7, 8 However, it is currently unclear– to our knowledge -to which extent the released ASM affects surface SM levels. Also, it is unknown which percentage of the lysosomes is released during infection with <italic>S. aureus</italic>. However, one has to speculate that this will be only a fraction of the “releasable lysosomes” as we assume that the effects (lysosomal Ca2+ liberation, lysosomal exocytosis and ASM activity) are very localized and take place only at host-pathogen contact sites (see also above). In initial experimentation we attempted to visualize the local ASM activity on the cell surface by using a visible range FRET probe (Supp. Fig. 3). Cleavage of the probe by ASM on the surface leads to release of FITC into the cell culture medium which does not contribute a measurable signal at the surface.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How are inhibitor doses determined? How efficient is the removal of extracellular bacteria at 10 min? It will be good to substantiate the cfu experiments for infectivity with imaging-based methods. Are the roles of TPC1 and TPC2 redundant? If so, why does silencing TPC1 alone result in a decrease in infectivity? For these and other assays, it would be better to show raw values for infectivity. Please show alterations in lysosomal Ca2+ at the doses of inhibitors indicated. Is lysosomal Ca2+ released upon S. aureus binding to the cell surface? Will be good to directly visualize this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Concerning the inhibitor concentrations, we either used values established in published studies or recommendations of the suppliers (e.g. 2-APB, Ned19, Vacuolin-1). For ASM inhibitors, we determined proper inhibition of ASM by activity assays. Concentrations of ionomycin resulting in Ca2+ influx and lysosomal exocytosis was determined in earlier studies of our lab.8, 30</p>
<p>As to the removal of bacteria at 10 min p.i.: Lysostaphin is very efficient for removal of extracellular <italic>S. aureus</italic> and sterilizes the tissue culture supernatant. It significantly lyses bacteria within a few minutes, as determined by turbidity assays.31</p>
<p>As to imaging-based infectivity assays: We will add an analysis of imaging-based invasion assays in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Regarding the roles of TPC1 and TPC2: from our data we cannot conclude whether the roles of TPC1 and TPC2 are redundant. One could speculate that since blockage of TPC1 alone is sufficient to reduce internalization of bacteria, that both channels may have distinct roles. On the other hand, there might be a Ca2+ threshold in order to initiate lysosomal exocytosis that can only be attained if TPC1 and TPC2 are activated in parallel. Thus, our observations are in line with another study that shows reduced Ebola virus infection in absence of either TPC1 or TPC2.32</p>
<p>As to raw CFU counts: whereas the observed effects upon blocking the invasion of <italic>S. aureus</italic> are stable, the number of internalized bacteria varies between individual biological replicates, for instance, by differences in host cell fitness or growth differences in bacterial cultures, which are prepared freshly for each experiment.</p>
<p>With respect to visualization of lysosomal Ca2+ release: we agree with the reviewer that direct visual demonstration of lysosomal Ca2+ release upon infection will improve the manuscript. We therefore will perform additional experimentation to show alterations of Ca2+ at the lysosomes during infection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The precise identification of cytosolic vs phagosomal bacteria is not very easy to appreciate. The methods section indicates how this distinction is made, but how do the authors deal with partial overlaps and ambiguities generally associated with such analyses? Please show respective images. The number of events (individual bacteria) for the live cell imaging data should be clearly mentioned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for not having sufficiently explained the technology to detect escaped <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The cytosolic location of <italic>S. aureus</italic> is indicated by recruitment of RFP-CWT.33 CWT is the cell wall targeting domain of lysostaphin, which efficiently binds to the pentaglycine cross bridge in the peptidoglycan of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This reporter is exclusively and homogenously expressed in the host cytosol. Only upon rupture of phagoendosomal membranes the reporter can be recruited to the cell wall of now cytosolically located bacteria. <italic>S. aureus</italic> mutants, for instance in the agr quorum sensing system, cannot break down the phagosomal membrane in non-professional phagocytes and thus stay unlabeled by the CWT-reporter.33 We will include respective images/movies of escape events and the bacteria numbers for live cell experiments in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the phagosome maturation experiments, what is the proportion of bacteria in Rab5 or Rab7 compartments at each time point? Will the decreased Rab7 association be accompanied by increased Rab5? Showing raw values and images will help appreciate such differences. Given the expertise and tools available in live cell imaging, can the authors trace Rab5 and Rab7 positive compartment times for the same bacteria?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will include the proportion of Rab7-associated bacteria in the revised manuscript. Usually, we observe that Rab5 is only transiently (for a few minutes) present on phagosomes and only afterwards the phagosomes become positive for Rab7. We do not think that a decrease in Rab7-positive phagosomes would increase the proportion of Rab5-positive phagosomes. However, we cannot exclude this hypothesis with our data.</p>
<p>We can achieve tracing of individual bacteria for recruitment of Rab5/Rab7 only manually, which impedes a quantitative evaluation. However, we will include information that illustrates the consecutive recruitment of the GTPases.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The results with longer-term infection are interesting. Live cell imaging suggests that ASM-inhibited cells show accelerated phagosomal escape that reduces by 6 hpi. Where are the bacteria at this time point ? Presumably, they should have reached lysosomes. The relationship between cytosolic escape, replication, and host cell death is interesting, but the evidence, as presented is correlative for the populations. Given the use of live cell imaging, can the authors show these events in the same cell?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We think that most bacteria-containing phagoendosomes should have fused with lysosomes 6 h p.i. as we have previously shown by acidification to pH of 5 and LAMP1 decoration.34</p>
<p>We will provide images/videos to show the correlation between escape and replication in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given the inherent heterogeneity in uptake processes and the use of inhibitors in most experiments, the distinction between ASM-dependent and independent pathways might not be as clear-cut as the authors suggest. Some caution here will be good. Can the authors estimate what fraction of intracellular bacteria are taken up ASM-dependent?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that an overlap between internalization pathways is likely. A clear distinction is therefore certainly non-trivial. Alternative to ASM-dependent and ASM-independent pathways, the ASM activity may also accelerate one or several internalization pathways. We will address this limitation in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Early in infection (~10 min after contact with the cells), the proportion of bacteria that enter host cells ASM-dependently is relatively high amounting to roughly 75% in HuLEC. After 30 min, this proportion is decreasing to about 50%. We will include this information in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
