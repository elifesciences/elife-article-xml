<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The role of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) in genome organization remains poorly characterized due to technical limitations in probing genome-wide protein-DNA interactions specific to the nuclear periphery. Here, we developed a new sensitive method, NPC-DamID, which combines <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of nuclear import and DamID technology. The fixation-free method identifies chromatin interactions at the NPCs in intact nuclei from cells and tissues. We found that NPCs are preferentially associated with common and hierarchically arranged super-enhancers (SEs) across multiple cell types. We also uncovered phase-separated condensates at NPCs that compartmentalize and concentrate transcriptional coactivators and structural proteins at SE-regulated genes. Our results support NPCs as anchoring sites for SE regulatory hubs and cell-type-specific transcriptional control.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spatial organization of the genome in a mammalian nucleus is critical for the transcriptional output of a cell which in turn is essential for cell fate determination and function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Nuclear landmarks such as the nuclear envelope (NE) play important roles in orchestrating genome architecture and transcription regulation. For example, the interaction between chromatin and the lamina at the NE forms hundreds of large Lamin-associated domains (LADs) of genomic DNA, which are primarily heterochromatin-containing genes with typically low expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. While the association between lamina and DNA is well understood, the specific chromatin interaction sites of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which collectively occupy approximately 20% of the area of NEs, have not been adequately mapped.</p>
<p>NPCs are megadalton protein complexes, composed of ∼30 different subunits called nucleoporins (Nups), that regulate the transport of cargo molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Recent findings have uncovered additional roles for NPCs and individual Nups in gene regulation and genome organization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, our functional understanding of NPC-genome interactions has been limited in terms of spatial and temporal resolution and restricted to few cell types due to technical challenges in probing the dynamic association of membrane-bound proteins with chromatin through antibody-based methods like ChIP-seq <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. For example, the efficiency of ChIP-seq is lower for membrane-embedded proteins like Nups due to the poor accessibility of epitopes of NPC proteins to the antibodies. Moreover, the dynamic interactions between Nups and chromatin are difficult to capture through ChIP-seq. As an alternative, <italic>in vivo</italic> DamID for Nups has been the method of choice to avoid using antibodies for studying NPC-chromatin interactions. The <italic>in vivo</italic> DamID-seq method is independent of antibody usage because transgenic cell lines are used in which Dam-fused proteins are expressed at typically very low levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Dam is an enzyme from <italic>E. coli</italic> that, when fused to a protein of interest, positions an orthogonal methylation modification to adenines at GATC of interacting genomic DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The methylated DNA is then sequenced to identify the genomic DNA associated with the protein of interest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In this way, DamID-seq has been successfully applied to many membrane-embedded proteins, including Nups <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, the expression of Dam fused Nups for DamID-seq experiments in cell lines poses difficulties such as over-expression artifacts, possible toxicity of Dam fused proteins, and loss of temporal resolution due to cumulative DNA methylation and the need for a long time of expression (24-36 h) of Dam fused proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, Nups like Nup153 or Nup98, which have been previously targeted to study NPC-chromatin associations, are mobile Nups (i.e., they also can bind chromatin at sites that are not associated with the NPCs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Hence, it is challenging to distinguish genomic DNA interactions at the nuclear periphery from those in the nucleoplasm in these studies.</p>
<p>To overcome some of these limitations of conventional DamID-seq experiments, we have developed a complementary method called NPC-DamID, explicitly designed to identify NPC-genome interactions at the nuclear periphery. Two different assays have been adapted to develop NPC-DamID. The well-established <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of nuclear transport assay (semi-permeabilized cell assay) is combined with DamID-seq to target the Dam fused nuclear transport receptor Importin beta (Impβ) to NPCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). This method bridges cell biological and genomic studies and remains independent of the use of an antibody or the over-expression artifacts of Dam fused protein. Since there is no requirement for the generation of transgenic cells, this method can be applied to multiple unfixed cells and tissue types from different species. Here, we demonstrate the use of NPC-DamID to understand the features and mechanisms behind NPCs as genome organizers.</p>

<p>We have recently identified an unexpected link between Nups and super-enhancers (SEs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. SEs are the cluster of enhancers in close genomic proximity with unusually high levels of transcription factors and activators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. SEs regulate the activity of genes important for cell-type specification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Research from other groups has also shown similar associations of Nups with SEs by targeting a specific Nup either through DamID-seq or ChIP-seq experiments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, since individual Nups are also present inside the nucleus and can interact with chromatin in the nucleoplasm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, no detailed maps exist that precisely and reliably identify NPC-genome interactions at the NE. This results in a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind these associations and their consequences on cell fate determination and genome organization.</p>
<p>In this study, we mapped NPC-SE interactions across multiple cell types. We uncovered unique features for SEs specifically located at the nuclear periphery, furthering our understanding of the importance and role of NPCs in the function and organization of NPC-SEs.</p>

<title>NPC-DamID combines <italic>in vitro</italic> nuclear import assay with DamID to probe NPC-genome interactions at the nuclear periphery</title>
<p>To overcome the challenges associated with <italic>in vivo</italic> DamID-seq and probe the specific chromatin association of NPCs at the nuclear periphery, we developed a method called NPC-DamID. NPC-DamID uses targeting of recombinantly expressed and purified Dam-fused nuclear transport receptor Importin beta (Impβ) to NPCs in a reconstituted nuclear import assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, b</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1 a-d</xref>). Since Impβ has a high affinity to NPCs, we predicted that Dam fused Impβ (Dam-Impβ) would stably bind to NPCs embedded in the NE when the plasma membrane of cells was permeabilized with low concentration digitonin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), resulting in specific methylation of DNA in the vicinity of NPCs.</p>
<p>Before reconstituting the nuclear import assay for NPC-DamID, we tested the <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation activity of recombinantly expressed and purified Dam and Dam-Impβ. We incubated unmethylated lambda DNA with these proteins at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. We then digested the DNA with DpnII, a restriction enzyme that can only cleave unmethylated GATC DNA sequences. We found that purified Dam and Dam-Impβ can efficiently methylate lambda DNA in 30 min, similar to commercially available Dam (NEB Dam) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1e</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we confirmed the proper localization of Dam-Impβ at the nuclear periphery by imaging the fluorescently labeled protein after performing the NPC-DamID assay. We observed a nuclear rim signal for Dam-Impβ labeled with Alexa 647 similar to recombinantly expressed purified and fluorescently labeled wt Impβ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). However, in the presence of wheat germ agglutin (WGA), a small molecule that blocks NPCs, Dam-Impβ was unable to bind to NPCs, thus serving as a negative control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). We also confirmed the active import activity of Dam-Impβ, which is dependent on RanGTP through the localization of nuclear localization signal (NLS) containing cargo inside the nucleus (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1f</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to test if Dam-Impβ can specifically label chromatin in the vicinity of NPCs and if this localized DNA methylation can be visualized microscopically. To this end, we exploited a known fragment of the Dpn1 enzyme, which binds to GA<sup>me</sup>TC residues without cleaving the DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Previously, a similar fragment had been used as a tracer for <italic>in vivo</italic> DamID experiments for imaging lamina-associated domains (LADs), which are large megabase pair long stretches of DNA sequences and thus relatively easy to visualize <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. We expressed and purified the recombinant fragment (Dpn8) fused with either flag or GFP tag (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1g-j</xref>). We added Flag-Dpn8 to the semi-permeabilized cells after washing off the reagents from the NPC-DamID assay. Subsequently, through confocal imaging, we observed that Flag-Dpn8 labels the entire nuclear volume when cells were incubated with Dam alone, indicating that Dam diffuses freely through NPCs during the assay and places methylation marks across the entire genome (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref>). When Flag-Dpn8 was used to label cells treated with Dam-Impβ, only a nuclear peripheral signal was observed, similar to a cell line expressing lamin B-receptor fused to Dam (Dam-LBR). This shows the selective methylation of genomic DNA associated with NPCs through Dam-Impβ. Further, this peripheral signal was lost in the presence of WGA, which prevents Dam-Impβ from binding NPCs, and in the presence of Impβ alone, which cannot methylate DNA (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref>). To determine the working distance range of the NPC-DamID assay, we performed dual-color super-resolution microscopy (dSTORM). We were able to visualize individual NPCs labeled with Nup153 antibody-Alexa 488 and associated genomic DNA labeled with Dpn8-Alexa647, which confirms the selective targeting of nuclear peripheral genomic DNA through the NPC-DamID method (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). We observed that most NPCs uniformly had a signal for associated genomic DNA, and methylation pattern ranges from 200-600 nm from the nuclear periphery. These results show that NPC-DamID provides a method for high-resolution imaging of NPC-associated genomic DNA at the nuclear periphery.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>NPC-DamID sequencing allows the identification of chromatin associated with NPCs and eliminates the nucleoplasmic signal from mobile Nups</title>
<p>To understand the NPC-mediated genome organization at the NE, we must determine the specific genomic regions associated with the NPCs. As in the <italic>in vivo</italic> DamID method, after performing the NPC-DamID assay, we enrich GA<sup>me</sup>TC methylated DNA fragments from the genomic DNA to prepare libraries for DNA sequencing (see Methods section). We used Dam alone for background correction of the sequencing data for Dam-Impβ. We determined the active enzymatic units for purified Dam and Dam-Impβ through an <italic>in vitro</italic> lambda DNA protection assay against the DpnII enzyme (see Methods). One enzyme unit is defined as the concentration of Dam or Dam-Impβ required to completely methylate 1 µg of lambda DNA at room temperature (RT) in 30 minutes, protecting the DNA from DpnII mediated cleavage (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2a-b</xref>). In the NPC-DamID assay, the same active enzyme units for Dam and Dam-Impβ were used to ensure unbiased normalization of the data between experiments. The kinetic assay for Dam and Dam-Impβ revealed that 5 units of enzyme protected 2 µg of lambda DNA in 20 min (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2c-d</xref>). Thus, we used 5 units of Dam or Dam-Impβ in the nuclear transport assay to target proteins in semi-permeabilized cells for 20 minutes at RT. Our results from sequencing experiments show clear peaks for Dam-Impβ, which are significantly enriched over Dam alone and wt Impβ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Dam-Impβ peaks are also significantly non-overlapping with the LADs, indicating the assay’s specificity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). To further assess the efficiency of the assay, we added the NPC-blocking small molecule WGA and found no detectable peaks above the background control of Dam alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). This shows that the semi-permeabilization left the NE intact; hence, the peaks for Dam-Impβ are selective for Dam-Impβ localized at NPCs.</p>

<p>Impβ is known to transiently move from NPCs at the nucleoplasmic side while releasing cargo, a step dependent on the RanGTP binding property of Impβ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This raises the possibility that Dam-Impβ might be released from the NPCs during the reaction, methylating chromatin regions in the nucleoplasm. To reduce the impact of such diffusive molecules of Dam-Impβ on the sequencing results, we expressed a dominant mutant of Impβ fused to Dam, Dam-ΔN44 Impβ. This mutant does not bind to RanGTP and therefore blocks nuclear import activity by stably binding to the nuclear face of NPCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. When sequencing data were compared for Dam-Impβ and Dam-ΔN44 Impβ, we found similar peaks (78% overlap) in both data sets, with the mutant Dam-ΔN44 Impβ showing lower background noise in the data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2f</xref>). We observed that the presence of RanGTP also did not significantly influence either Dam-ΔN44 Impβ or Dam-Impβ peaks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. For all the assays in this study, we have used Dam-ΔN44 Impβ for all the experiments due to the lower background, unless otherwise mentioned.</p>
<p>Next, we compared NPC-DamID with <italic>in vivo</italic> DamID-seq data previously obtained using Dam-Nup153 expressing IMR90 cell line (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>) or Dam-Nup98 expressing HeLa cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). While there is a significant overlap between the two Dam-Nup data sets and their respective NPC-DamID peaks, many additional peaks in Dam-Nup data do not overlap with NPC-DamID data. These additional peaks are likely the result of the mobile nucleoplasmic fraction of Nup153 or Nup98 binding to chromatin. To test this idea, we performed three-dimensional genome modeling using Chrom3D <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> to simulate either the position of NPC-DamID peaks or Dam-Nup153 peaks relative to known LADs sequences at the nuclear periphery (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2h-i</xref>). The results show that the distance distribution of Dam-Nup153 peaks from the nuclear periphery is bimodal. The fraction of peaks closer to the nuclear periphery overlaps with NPC-DamID peaks, while the other fraction is farther away from the NE, likely representing the nucleoplasmic interaction between Nup153 and chromatin. In line with this idea, we compared the overlap between NPC-DamID and cut&amp;run for Nup93, a nucleoporin that does not bind chromatin in the nucleoplasm. Despite the previously mentioned methodological issues of utilizing an antibody-based method to detect the interaction of Nup93 with chromatin, we still observed an increase in the overlap of NPC-DamID peaks with Nup93 versus Nup153 in IMR90 cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2g</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, we have used fluorescent in situ hybridization (DNA-FISH) to validate the peripheral localization of NPC-interacting loci. As observed for LADs, NPC-interacting loci are more frequently localized in the peripheral zone of the nucleus, adjacent to the nuclear pores embedded in the nuclear envelope (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2j</xref>). In all, NPC-DamID is a robust method that specifically methylates NPC-associated genomic regions.</p>

<title>NPC-associated genomic regions are enriched in enhancer regulatory elements and actively expressed genes</title>
<p>After having successfully established and characterized the NPC-DamID method, we were interested in understanding the chromatin regions associated with NPCs. To this end, we incubated Dam-Impβ with different semi-permeabilized (i.e. unfixed) cells, including HeLa, IMR90, and mouse C2C12 myoblasts. When we analyzed the distribution of varying histone modification ChIP-seq reads centered at NPC-DamID peaks, we found that the NPC-DamID peaks preferentially enrich at open chromatin marks like H3K27Ac and H3K4Me3 as opposed to a repressive mark like H3K9Me3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). We further tested functional features of these genomic regions by comparing them to the 18 chromatin states of the ChromHMM model for IMR90 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Consistent with the enrichment of enhancer and promoter histone marks, we observed the most significant overlap with active enhancers among the 18 different chromatin states for NPC-DamID peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). The next significant overlap was found with weak enhancers and weak transcription regions, followed by transcription start sites (TSS). To check the transcriptional output of NPC-DamID peaks in IMR90 cells, we compared the transcription of NPC-associated genes with a randomly chosen equal number of other genes. We have found that the average transcriptional output from NPC-interacting genes is higher than that of random genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, Table S1). This suggests that NPC-associated genomic regions are primarily actively transcribed chromatin regions. These features of NPC-interacting chromatin were found to be consistent in the human HeLa and mouse C2C12 cell lines (data not shown).</p>

<p>Since NPC-DamID does not require genetically modified cells, it also applies to tissue samples. Thus, we could map chromatin associations with NPCs in unfixed human pancreatic islet tissues (which would have been challenging with <italic>in vivo</italic> DamID or ChIP-seq). After dissociating islets into a single-cell suspension, we performed the assay using about 50,000 cells. Interestingly, even though this represents a pool of multiple cell types found within islets, we still observed that NPC-interacting chromatin was enriched in histone marks for enhancer (H3K27Ac) and promoter (H3K4Me3) regions (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), similar to other cell types tested. The easy applicability of this method to complex tissue samples highlights a significant advantage of NPC-DamID over other methods of NPC-chromatin interaction detection. This way, NPC-DamID allows us to expand our understanding of the genomic associations at the periphery from cells to tissues.</p>

<title>NPCs associate with super-enhancer regions in different cell types</title>
<p>While the association between Nups like Nup153, Nup93, Nup133, and Nup98 and super-enhancers (SEs) has been established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, we wanted to generate high-precision maps of these interactions in multiple cell types to identify SEs that are specifically associated with NPCs at the NE. To do this we performed NPC-DamID sequencing for HeLa, IMR90, and C2C12 myotubes. We found a consistent and significant overlap (40-65%) between SEs and NPC-DamID peaks for all cell types (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). To further understand the role and importance of these interactions, we investigated how NPC-associated SEs (NPC-SEs) differ from SEs that do not associate with NPCs (Table S2). Although SEs are highly specific to a cell type regulating genes crucial for cell-fate determination, recently, it has been shown that some SEs can be shared between two or more cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We wanted to investigate if NPC-SEs are specifically enriched in these common SEs compared to non-NPC-SEs. We generated a cell type consensus score for NPC-SEs, non-NPC-SEs, and all SEs identified in IMR90 and Hela cells across ten different cell types. Our results show that NPC-SEs have a slightly higher consensus score than non-NPC-SEs, indicating that NPC-SEs have higher enrichment for common super-enhancers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4a</xref>). These results suggest that SEs associated with NPCs are relatively more shared between different cell types, and the genes regulated by these SEs are responsible for essential cellular functions needed for cell differentiation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4b</xref>). Common SEs are strongly associated with fast recovering chromatin loops after sequential cohesin depletion and restoration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This leads us to speculate on the intriguing possibility that NPC-linked SEs could play a role in establishing chromatin organization by facilitating the formation of early higher-order chromatin loops that later become scaffolds for cell-type-specific loop formation.</p>

<p>A recent study revealed that a subset of SEs is hierarchically organized into hub and non-hub enhancers. The hub enhancers are enriched with CTCF and cohesin binding and play an important role in SE functional and structural organization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Based on this knowledge, we analyzed the structural organization of NPC-SEs in IMR90 cells. Intriguingly, a significant fraction of NPC-SEs (∼70.0%) have a hierarchical organization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). Within hierarchical NPC-SEs, we observe that NPCs preferentially bind to hub enhancers compared to non-hub enhancers (2.1-fold, <italic>P</italic> = 3.4E-21, Fisher’s exact test, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Interestingly, we further observe that the co-occupancy of NPC and structural proteins like CTCF, BRD4, P300, and PolII is markedly elevated at hub enhancers compared to non-hub enhancers (5.1-fold, 2.9-fold, 2.2-fold, and 2.2-fold; <italic>P = 3.4E-08, P = 3.8E-21, P = 4.8E-13, and P = 2.4E-11</italic>, Fisher’s exact test, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4c-f</xref>). This result suggests that NPCs might have functionally related roles on hub enhancer elements in mediating the structural and functional organization of SEs through the recruitment of structural protein complexes (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggest that NPC-SEs are important for genome organization and folding, possibly through interaction or regulation of chromatin architectural proteins.</p>

<title>NPCs are hubs for chromatin structural proteins</title>
<p>Next, we sought to understand the mechanism through which NPCs engage and regulate the activity of SEs. SEs have high occupancy of chromatin structural proteins like CTCF, mediator proteins, coactivators like P300, BRD4, cohesins, and PolII <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Our finding that NPCs are associated with hierarchical hub enhancers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c-d</xref>) encouraged us to propose a model where NPCs interact with chromatin structural proteins and participate in maintaining the structure of SE domains at the nuclear envelope (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>). To test this possibility, we used proximity ligation assays (PLA) to assess the interaction between the NPC component TPR and structural proteins. PLA allows the identification of in-situ protein interactions (at a distance &lt;40 nm) with high specificity and sensitivity. Several SE-associated proteins, including CTCF, PolII, Med1, BRD4, p300, and SMC3, show enriched PLA signals at the nuclear rim, indicating their interaction with TPR at NPCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary figure 5a</xref>). Moreover, using TPR depletion as a negative control in PLA experiments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), we show that PLA intensity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) and the number of PLA puncta (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>) significantly decrease in TPR knockdown cells, suggesting a true interaction between TPR and chromatin structural proteins.</p>

<p>Further, we confirmed the overlap of NPC-associated chromatin with the DNA occupied by the structural proteins. To do this, we analyzed the distribution of the ChIP-seq reads for the structural proteins CTCF, BRD4, P300, and PolII compared to our NPC-DamID reads. We see a good correlation in the distribution of most of these proteins across the entire genome (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). Further, looking at the distribution of the abovementioned structural proteins around the center of NPC-DamID peaks, we see specific enrichment for these proteins at NPC-linked chromatin regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>). Together, the data suggest that NPCs are structural hubs for SEs, which may be maintained through interaction with chromatin structural proteins.</p>

<title>Nups exhibit phase separation properties which aid their interaction with chromatin structural proteins</title>
<p>The observed association of SEs with NPCs raised the interesting question of how these interactions are established and maintained. Chromatin organization of SE regions is maintained through multivalent cooperative interactions between the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of the mediator and transcription coactivator proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The disordered domains of proteins Med1, BRD4, and PolII, when present in high concentrations at SEs, can form multimeric intermolecular interactions leading to the formation of phase-separated condensates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.

<p>These results encouraged us to test whether peripheral Nups in NPCs interact with chromatin structural proteins at SE condensate hubs through their IDRs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4g</xref>). The <italic>in vitro</italic> liquid droplet formation property of FG-containing Nups has been previously studied in the nuclear transport process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, its significance in chromatin organization has not been explored yet. We set out to compare the liquid droplet properties of Nup IDRs with Med1 IDR, which is involved in chromatin organization of SE regions through phase separation. We transfected the IDRs of Med1, Nup153 and Nup98 fused to GFP into cells and observed the formation of droplets. We saw that, similar to Med1, both Nup153 and Nup98 IDRs form droplets that disintegrated with hexanediol (HD), an alcohol commonly used to dissolve liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6b</xref>). The FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) recovery time (τ) for Nup153 and Nup98 IDRs in a region of 1.5 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> was about 19 s compared to 11 s for Med1 IDR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>). The diffusion coefficient for Med1 IDR was 0.13 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>/s, as also determined by a previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The diffusion coefficients for Nup153 and Nup98 FG were found to be 0.076 and 0.077 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>/s, roughly half of Med1 and similar to previously described components of liquid-like condensates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. From these results, we can conclude that Nups liquid-like droplets are sensitive to hexanediol disruption and are slightly less dynamic in diffusion than those of Med1.</p>
<p>To further test if the interaction between Nups and other SE proteins like BRD4 and PolII results in phase-separated condensates, we performed PLA experiments in the absence and presence of HD. We treated the cells with DMSO or HD for 20 min and probed for interactions through PLA. Upon quantifying the intensity of PLA spots and the number of PLA puncta, we found that TPR-PolII interaction decreased after HD treatment in a similar manner to the interaction between known co-phase separating condensate proteins BRD4 and PolII (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). However, PLA intensities and puncta number remained unchanged for TPR-Med1 and showed a slight increase for TPR-CTCF, indicating that not all interactions are phase separation dependent (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c-d</xref>). Altogether, our results suggest the involvement of Nups in the organization of SE through interactions with chromatin structural proteins in phase-separated liquid droplets.</p>

<title>Synthetic LacO arrays mediate the formation of Nup IDR interaction hubs that can recruit other chromatin structural proteins</title>
<p>Several studies have used <italic>in vitro</italic> purified IDR proteins at high concentrations to form hydrogel or liquid-liquid droplets to understand the biophysical and biochemical properties of interactions between IDRs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.

Hence, we decided to use <italic>in vivo</italic> lac operator (LacO) arrays to probe the interaction between IDRs of Nups and structural proteins of SE hubs. U2OS cells containing the LacO array (harboring ∼50,000 LacO repeats) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> were transfected with fluorescently tagged IDRs fused to an NLS and LacI (mCherry-IDR-NLS-LacI), which led to the recruitment of a large number of molecules of mCherry-IDR-NLS-LacI at LacO sites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a-b</xref>). We observed concentrated <italic>in vivo</italic> interaction hubs inside the nucleus. We used this system with Nup153 IDR by fusing Nup153 IDR with mCherry, NLS, and LacI. Upon transfection of mCherry-N153-NLS-LacI (N153-LacI) to cells with the LacO array, we could observe a bright fluorescent spot with more intensity and larger size than mCherry-NLS-LacI (LacI), suggesting that the copy number of N153-LacI at LacO associated hubs is higher than LacI alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). A similar trend was observed for Med1-IDR-LacI spots. Additionally, LacI fused to N153 and Med1 could form multiple fluorescent regions throughout the nucleus compared to LacI alone, which leads to a single fluorescent spot. These results indicate likely cooperative and multivalent intermolecular interactions for N153-LacI and Med1-LacI inside the nucleus, critical for forming phase-separated droplets.</p>

<p>Next, we performed FRAP experiments to confirm the multivalent and cooperative interaction between LacI-IDRs at LacO hubs. We found that the dynamics of LacI alone spots were different than LacI fused to the IDR of either Nup153 or Med1. Upon fitting the FRAP curves with a reaction-dominant model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, we found that Nup153 IDR and Med1 IDR fused to LacI had a reduction between 65-85% in the dissociation constant (k<sub>2</sub>) as compared to LacI alone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). This suggests that the locally high concentration of Nup153 or Med1 IDR hubs at the LacO site are driven by IDR-IDR interactions via multivalent contacts, which would stabilize the association with cognate genomic DNA and other partner proteins. This result is relevant in the context of SE hubs which are formed through multiple homotypic and heterotypic interactions between IDRs of transcription factors and chromatin structural proteins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>After confirming homotypic multivalent interactions for the IDRs of Nup153 and Med1 fused to LacI, we investigated the potential of Nup153 IDR to interact with the known SE resident IDRs PolII and Med1. We again took advantage of the LacO-LacI system to form a hub for Nup153’s IDR to observe the recruitment of PolII and Med1. We co-expressed the CTD52 repeats of PolII or Med1 IDR fused to GFP in cells with mCherry-Nup153-IDR-LacI. We observed a colocalized fluorescent signal of GFP and mCherry for both PolIICTD52 (in 67% of cells) and Med1 IDR (in 13% of cells), while LacI alone cells showed only mCherry signal (no cells exhibited colocalization with GFP) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c-d</xref>). Similar colocalization was also observed when cells expressing mCherry-Med1-IDR-LacI were transfected with GFP-tagged PolII CTD52 (in 53% of cells). These results suggest that the Nup153 IDR domain, when present in high concentrations at the LacO site, can recruit the other partner proteins of SE hubs, PolII and Med1. This indicates that Nup153 functions similarly to Med1, previously shown to form phase-separated droplets at SEs sites to bind other structural proteins of SE. Altogether, these results support a model that peripheral Nups like Nup153 form phase-separated condensates at NPCs that compartmentalize and concentrate transcriptional coactivators and structural proteins at SE-regulated genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study presents a new method, NPC-DamID, to study NPC-mediated genomic interactions. NPC-DamID has several advantages over existing approaches to probe genome-wide interactions at the nuclear periphery. First, NPC-DamID eliminates any contribution of genomic interactions with Nups that are not at the NPCs. Previously it had been challenging to discern the difference between genomic interactions of Nups in the nucleoplasm and at NPCs due to the mobile nature of Nups used in other methods. Since NPC-DamID uses recombinantly expressed and purified Importinβ fused to Dam, specifically targeting NPCs in semi-permeabilized cells, it reports interactions exclusively at the nuclear periphery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, d, e</xref>). We have shown through experimental and modeling data that NPC-DamID better reflects peripheral NPC-genome interactions than previously published datasets using Dam-Nup153 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2g-j</xref>). We have also demonstrated that the dominant mutant of Impβ (Dam-ΔN44 Impβ), which has a higher affinity to NPCs compared to wt Impβ <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, shows NPC-genome interactions similar to those of Dam-Impβ. In the future, NPC-DamID-seq can be expanded to map the NPC-associated proteome by fusing Impβ to APEX2 (a proximity labeling ascorbate peroxidase) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, which will help discover novel interacting partners of NPCs involved in genome regulation. Second, our method allows us to probe NPC-genome interactions in any cell or tissue type since the technique does not rely on transgenic cell lines. To this end, we have mapped the interactions of NPC with genomic DNA in three cell lines and live human pancreatic islet tissue samples (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). In the future, NPC-DamID will be a valuable tool to understand better the influence of disease conditions like diabetes or cancer on genome architecture at the nuclear periphery. This is also possible since NPC-DamID can be done using as few as 50,000-200,000 cells. Third, NPC-DamID is not only independent of antibody and fixation as conventional DamID but also free from over-expression artifacts of Dam fused proteins. The concentration of Dam-Importinβ and the timing of the assay can be precisely controlled to avoid any artifacts. Fourth, the temporal resolution of NPC-DamID is higher than conventional DamID since there is no requirement of waiting 2-3 days to get enough expression of Dam fused protein. Through NPC-DamID, it is possible to obtain a snapshot of NPC-genomic DNA interactions at any point in time, for example, during the time course of cell differentiation (data not shown). Fifth, NPC-DamID sequencing can be combined with super-resolution imaging which is difficult with conventional DamID <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In conventional DamID, Dpn7 (a DNA binding fragment of Dpn1) fused to a fluorescent protein is co-expressed with the Dam tagged protein of interest to allow imaging of the methylated DNA. This works well in cases like Dam-Lamin, when megabase pair long stretches of DNA methylation are expected. However, for sparse methylation patterns, as one would expect for NPC-associated DNA, the signal strength is too weak to perform high-resolution imaging, which requires high signal density. In NPC-DamID, we take advantage of the <italic>in vitro</italic> nature of the assay and use purified GFP or Flag-tagged Dpn8 labeled with a succinimide synthetic fluorescent dye, like Alexa 647 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, f). This results in an increased number of dye molecules per Dpn8 molecule and gives us the flexibility of using synthetic dyes, which perform better in super-resolution methods like dSTORM. Thus, we can probe NPC association with chromatin through imaging at a single NPC resolution. A previously described model suggested that the heterogeneous composition of NPCs in a single cell could lead to differences in its interactions with chromatin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Our method, combined with imaging, will be useful in future studies to explore such models and understand the role of heterogeneity in NPC structure in genome organization. Furthermore, the <italic>in vitro</italic> nature of this method can allow biochemical manipulations to study the more specific nature of NPC-chromatin interactions. For example, in the future, we could map the distance-dependent interaction of the genome with NPCs by using Dam-Impβ with increasing linker lengths.</p>
<p>The association of Nups with the genome has been previously shown to be important for gene regulation. Recent evidence has indicated that the NPCs also mediate the structural organization of the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. However, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism underpinning such roles of Nups or NPCs remains unclear. Previous studies used specific Nup-targeted ChIP-seq or DamID-seq, thus having difficulty assessing whether the genomic associations shown represented binding to a mobile nucleoplasmic pool of Nups or NPCs at the periphery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. These studies rely on DNA-FISH to test the localization of genomic interactions with Nups, which can only be tested for a few loci due to low throughput. With our new method NPC-DamID, we were able to probe genome-wide interactions of NPCs that happen specifically at the periphery in multiple cells and a tissue type to understand the common and unique nature of these interactions. We have found that the NPC-associated chromatin in various cell lines is primarily enriched in intergenic regions bound to H3K27Ac, followed by H3K4Me3 histone marks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This indicates that NPCs associate with regulatory enhancer and promoter regions, which falls in line with previous studies in human, metazoan, yeast, and mouse cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, 40–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in many recent studies in mice, drosophila, and yeast, Nup93 and Nup153 have also been shown to associate with repressed/facultative heterochromatin regions of genomic DNA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Our study found a higher association of actively expressed genes with NPCs, and only about 7% of NPC-DamID peaks overlap with Polycomb-associated repressed or quiescent genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). This result suggests that NPCs can associate with active and repressed regions, possibly through different Nups. It also incites the intriguing hypothesis that NPCs can vary in their composition and structure inside a nucleus, which leads to their association with different classes of genomic DNA and regulatory proteins. In the future, such models can be tested by combing NPC-DamID with super-resolution dual-color imaging to visualize the correlation between the structure and genomic associations of individual NPCs.</p>
<p>Another common genomic feature that associates with NPCs across multiple cells and tissue types is super-enhancers. This is consistent with previous work from our lab in which we have shown SE association with Nup153 and Nup93 through DamID-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In the present study, we further explored the nature of NPC-associated super-enhancers (NPC-SE) compared to other SE regions.</p>
<p>Although super-enhancers are usually DNA regulatory elements that confer cell-type specificity to gene expression, a subset known as common super-enhancers is also active across multiple cell types. These common SEs are overrepresented in the pool of NPC interacting SEs identified in this study (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), and they have been implicated in establishing the early loop contacts during genome refolding in cell division <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, we found that NPC-SEs have hierarchical structural organization and preferentially enrich for hub enhancers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c-d</xref>). Hub enhancers are part of SEs that have a hierarchical organization. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> This hierarchical structure is observed in about 25-60% of SEs in a cell. Hub enhancers are distinctly associated with CTCF, cohesin, and disease-associated genetic variants. Hub enhancers are also the primary elements responsible for SE functional and structural organization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In this way, they play an important role in dictating the chromatin landscape and regulating gene expression. These findings imply that the interaction of NPCs with SEs is important to the structural and functional organization of genomic DNA at the nuclear periphery through interactions with chromatin architectural proteins.</p>
<p>To explore the features and mechanisms for NPC-mediated genome organization, we tested the interaction of Nups to chromatin structural proteins, specifically those associated with SEs. We found through proximity ligation experiments that NPCs can interact with the SE proteins CTCF, Med1, Brd4, PolII, and cohesins. There is also significant enrichment of these proteins around the NPC-DamID peaks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Together, these results strengthen the possibility of NPCs mediating the organization of SEs at the periphery through interactions with chromatin structural proteins. These results also corroborate recent studies showing the interaction of Nups like Nup153 or Nup93 with CTCF and cohesin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We also explored how Nups at NPCs might interact with resident proteins of SE hubs. SEs are clusters of multiple enhancers which recruit transcription factors and coactivators containing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) in high concentration. The high concentration of IDRs allows multivalent interactions, leading to the formation of phase-separated condensates. This mechanism is important to ensure robust and high gene expression of cell identity genes. The peripheral Nups at NPCs, like Nup153, also have long IDRs, which we show in this study form phase-separated droplets <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-b</xref>). Nup153 is known to have at least 32 copies at individual NPCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, which likely facilitates high local concentration for phase separation. Since individual NPCs have been predicted to have different compositions within a single cell and are also known to vary in their composition from one cell type to another <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, SE-interacting NPCs may have even more than 32 copies to facilitate the interaction with SEs. In the future, high-resolution imaging could be done to test this hypothesis. We show that phase-separated Nup153 droplets can co-partition with IDRs of other SE resident proteins like Med1 and PolII (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This observation suggests that NPCs can be structurally and functionally part of SE hubs. At the same time, it raises multiple questions regarding the importance of NPCs in regulating this subset of SEs. Do NPCs act as a scaffold to organize SE hubs? How different are the organization and function of NPC-associated SEs compared to others? Why do certain SEs tend to associate with NPCs? In this regard, the gene-gating model, in which positioning a gene at NPCs facilitates the rapid transport of its mRNA to the cytoplasm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, is more probable. Recent evidence from a study of an NPC-associated oncogenic super-enhancer for the MYC gene showed that SE positioning at the periphery facilitated the export of mRNA transcripts in colon cancer cells in response to WNT signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. It will be interesting to determine if gene-gating holds for all NPC-associated SEs and non-cancer cells.</p>
<p>Interestingly, nuclear basket protein TPR is known to interact with the kinases ERK2 and CDK1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, and Nup-SEs were shown to enrich for the motif for AP1-like transcription factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. It will be interesting to study if kinase interactions with TPR mediate the phosphorylation of AP1 transcription factors to facilitate gene expression of NPC-SEs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, NPC-DamID has allowed us better to understand the NPC’s role as a gene regulator. We have learned the common and unique features of NPC-interacting genomic regions across multiple cell types. Further, we have shown the role of disordered domains in Nups in the structural organization of SE hubs through phase separation. Moreover, further studies will be needed to better understand other interaction partners (protein or RNA) of NPCs that mediate the association of NPCs with the genome.</p>

<p>We performed PLA experiments using Duolink PLA kit from Sigma-Aldrich. We followed the protocol from the manufacturer for the experiments. For imaging we used Leica SP8 confocal microscope. For quantitation, DAPI signal from maximum projected images were used to create nuclear masks in Fiji (ImageJ). PLA signal (Integrated density) was measured within the nuclear mask for individual nuclei. To calculate normalized PLA intensity, all values for a given pair of PLA interactors were normalized to average PLA intensity of control group (siLuc or DMSO). For counting number of PLA Puncta, we used the ‘Find Maxima’ function on Alexa565 channel of maximum projected images and adjusted threshold to restrict maxima identification within nuclear masks.

<p>As nucleoporins can function at intact nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) or outside of NPCs as individual proteins or subcomplexes, it remains challenging to molecularly define the pool of molecules that exert a specific function. To address this challenge, here the authors develop a new method for specifically mapping NPC-associated loci by DamID with a recombinant fusion protein of the Dam methylase and the nuclear transport receptor, importin b (Dam-Impb), in permeabilized cells. The authors demonstrate that Dam-Impb is active, accumulates at the NPC and, using super-resolution microscopy, methylates NPC-adjacent regions; other observations further support the assertion that the approach is specific for NPC-associate chromatin regions. Furthermore, NPC-DamID does not require genetic manipulation and they show that it can be applied to both diverse cell lines as well as tissues. The authors confirm the association of nucleoporins with super-enhancers (SEs) in line with their prior work, now confirmed to occur at NPCs based on this study. Among SEs categorized as hierarchical enhancers (Nat Commun 9, 943 (2018)), hub enhancers are over-represented for methylation by Dam-Impb. The association of such enhancers with cohesin and CTCF suggests these regions could have a critical role in chromatin folding; enhancer-associated factors and marks such as H3K27 acetylation, RNA polymerase II, P300, CTCF and BRD4 also enrich at Dam-Impb methylation peaks. Using proximity ligation, the authors provide further evidence that Tpr, which interacts with the NPC basket, colocalizes with CTCF, BRD4 and P300. Based on these observations, the authors hypothesized that nucleoporin phase separation at SEs might potentiate phase separation of other factors at these elements. Consistent with previous work, over-expression of the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of Nup153, a component of the NPC basket, forms nuclear droplets that are largely dispersed by 1,6-hexanediol. In this same condition, colocalization RNAPII and both Tpr and BRD4 is reduced, although some interactions between IDRs were not sensitive to this treatment. Last, using a lac operator array as a tethering site, the authors show that tethered Nup153 IDR recruits the carboxy terminal domain of RNAPII and Med1. However, whether the biology of how nucleoporins at NPCs influence SEs depends on biomolecular condensation will require future study.</p>
<p>Overall, the reviewers agree that this is an excellent manuscript that will impact our understanding of nuclear pore complex-genome interactions and how nucleoporins impact super enhancer function. The data are generally of high quality and are reasonably interpreted. There are, however, several important controls or analyses that would strengthen the conclusions of the paper, as outlined below.</p>
<p>1. NPC vs nucleoplasmic interactions: One of the main claims of the paper is that it provides a way to study specifically the NPC-associated loci and contrast them to the nucleoplasmic Nup-associated loci. Unfortunately, the authors do not devote much space to this comparison and many of the manipulations involve proteins that are in both locations (see below). This seems like an important, missed opportunity. The choices of Tpr or Nup153 should be more clearly justified. The Dpn8 staining appeared in regions outside of the nuclear envelope, which is inconsistent with the text. This should be addressed.</p>
<p>2. The PLA experiments: Although Tpr exists both at the NPC and in the nucleoplasm, the authors interpret these experiments as if they are exclusively reporting on proximity of enhancer proteins to the NPC. The images (e.g. Figure 5a, supplementary Figure 5) make it clear that the foci are throughout the nucleus. Where are the antigens recognized by the antibodies to Tpr and what this may mean for the findings? Further, PLA experiments are prone to artefacts and, while the authors have included a knockdown of Tpr as a negative control, additional controls would strengthen their conclusions. For example, what is the result when Tpr colocalization with NPC-specific proteins is assessed? How is that affected by hexanediol? A better PLA experiment might be to assess colocalization of Dam-ImpB or Dpn8 (bound to Dam-ImpB methylated sites) with super enhancer proteins such as Med1, CTCF, Brd4, etc. With regards to the PLA with</p>
<p>3. Analysis of genomic data: The normalization of the DNA sequencing tracks is not sufficiently explained. Moreover, some of the correlations using meta-site plots are not convincing. For example, the peaks of Nup153 or Nup98 methylation over Imp-B peaks are apparently weak. Although the authors report local maxima, these may not be strong associations. This raises the possibility that the stronger Nup153 or Nup98 peaks are not ImpB peaks. A better way to test for this would be to correlate the ImpB peak intensity to the Nup153 or Nup98 peak intensity globally. The expectation is that there will be both correlated peaks that show strong methylation by Nup153/Nup98 and ImpB, as well as peaks that do not (i.e. those in the nucleoplasm). Along these lines, the Dam alone control can be used for comparison. Peaks identified by Dam alone should not be correlated with ImpB, Nup153, Nup98, CTCF, RNAPII, Cohesin, H3K27Ac, Brd4, Mediator, super enhancers, hubs, etc. Also, what is the source of the Nup93 CUT&amp;RUN data? It was unclear if it was from this study or a prior publication.</p>
<p>4. FISH experiments: these should be in the main figures of the paper and better described. How many loci were assessed in each category? Are the differences between the three classes significant? Also, the order of the legend is the opposite of the order of the bar segments, which is confusing to the reader. Related to Figure 2j: What are the FISH probes used here? How many cells were quantified?</p>
<p>5. The focus on IDRs as the primary functional mechanism for the NPC-SE connection was felt to be the least well-justified of the authors' conclusions. In particular, the quantitative effects in Fig. 6 are over-stated while caveats including possible over-expression artifacts and changes in the nuclear concentration of the IDRs due to efflux out of the nucleus in response to 1,6 hexanediol treatment as a consequence of the effect on the barrier of NPCs are not addressed. Additional experimental follow-up - for example does critical depletion of Nup153 (now possible with auxin degrons) disrupt the NPC-DamID profile? - would strengthen the support for the model.</p>
<p>6. Recent evidence points to the fact that 1,6-HD treatment probes the presence of hydrophobic interactions, rather than distinguishing between LLPS and interactions with spatially clustered binding sites (ICBS). These possibilities should be taken into account when interpreting the data, and should be discussed more thoroughly.</p>
