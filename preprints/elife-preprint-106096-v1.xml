<title>Abstract</title><p>ATP-gated purinergic P2X7 receptors are crucial ion channels involved in inflammation. They sense abnormal ATP release during stress or injury and are considered promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention. However, despite their predominant expression in immune cells such as microglia, there is limited information on P2X7 membrane expression and regulation during inflammation at the single-molecule level, necessitating new labeling approaches to visualize P2X7 in native cells. Here, we present <bold>X7-uP</bold>, an unbiased, affinity-guided P2X7 chemical labeling reagent that selectively biotinylates endogenous P2X7 in BV2 cells, a murine microglia model, allowing subsequent labeling with streptavidin-Alexa 647 tailored for super-resolution imaging. We uncovered a nanoscale microglial P2X7 redistribution mechanism where evenly spaced individual receptors in quiescent cells undergo upregulation and clustering in response to the pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide and ATP, leading to synergistic interleukin-1β release. Our method thus offers a new approach to revealing endogenous P2X7 expression at the single-molecule level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>ATP serves as the primary energy carrier in cells and also functions as an extracellular signaling molecule. Normally, extracellular ATP levels are typically low in healthy interstitial fluid, but they rise at sites of stress or cellular injury, acting as a danger signal recognized as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Extracellular ATP is detected by two families of purinergic receptors, metabotropic P2Y receptors and ionotropic P2X receptors (P2X1 to P2X7), with P2X7 specifically sensing abnormal ATP release in the mid-micromolar to low millimolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). P2X7 is a transmembrane, non-selective cation channel (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) predominantly expressed in immune cells, such as macrophages and microglia (the resident macrophages of the central nervous system), where it plays a crucial role in inflammation and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Upon ATP binding, P2X7 activation triggers K<sup>+</sup> efflux, promoting the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and leading to the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). P2X7 activation can cause cell death and is linked to the pathogenesis of several major disorders, including inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), psychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), making P2X7 a clinically relevant target.</p>
<p>At the cellular level, P2X7 is expressed at the plasma membrane and associates with lipid rafts, which are membrane microdomains known to play a key role in the onset of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). However, it is unknown how P2X7 is strictly distributed on the plasma membrane of cells and how its spatial and functional features intertwine in inflammatory conditions. Given the crucial role of P2X7 in inflammation and the growing interest in developing P2X7-targeted therapeutics, new approaches are needed to visualize P2X7 expression in immune cells at the single molecule level.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have investigated P2X7 expression in microglia using various experimental approaches, including functional assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), radiolabeled ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), and genetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Although these studies confirmed the dominant expression of P2X7 in microglia, they provided only low-resolution cell imaging of P2X7, primarily due to the limitations of conventional light microscopy, which imposes a resolution restricted by the diffraction of light. Consequently, the detailed organization of P2X7 below ∼250 nm remains unknown. This is a vital point, as recent data suggest that the spatial organization of cell membrane receptors may be a common regulatory mechanism for cellular signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether such membrane organization similarly affects P2X7 signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Super-resolution microscopy techniques overcome this diffraction limit, enabling the visualization of fluorescently labeled membrane receptors at nanometric resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have reported super-resolved images of P2X7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The first study found P2X7 in lipid microdomains of an osteoblastic cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), but the use of polyclonal antibodies to stain P2X7 raised questions about their selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). The second study involved fusing P2X7 to the photo-convertible fluorescent Dendra2 protein to track its dynamic organization in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). While this study provided valuable insights into the nanometer-scale distribution of P2X7, it had three experimental biases. First, heterologous overexpression of P2X7-Dendra2 might not reflect native expression levels. Second, the C-terminal fusion of Dendra2 to P2X7 after the “ballast”, a region that is critically involved in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), could affect P2X7’s pathogenicity. Third, there is growing evidence suggesting that neurons do not (or scarcely) express P2X7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), questioning the physiological relevance of investigating P2X7 nanoscale organization in hippocampal neurons. Therefore, these issues prompted us to develop a new, genetic-free strategy able to decorate endogenous P2X7 in native cells with fluorophores suitable for super-resolution imaging.</p>
<p>Among existing methods for labeling endogenous proteins in living cells, the affinity-driven reaction strategy involving protein-ligand interaction is of particular interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). It relies on the formation of a covalent bond on the protein that is guided by the affinity of a ligand bearing a reactive moiety. The efficiency of the labeling reaction depends on the chemical function of the reactive species. The recently developed <italic>N</italic>-acyl-<italic>N</italic>-alkyl sulfonamide (NASA) chemistry offers a suitable platform that enables the covalent transfer, under native cell conditions, of functional ligands to nucleophilic amino acid residues (typically lysine residues) located in close proximity to the ligand-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, NASA electrophilicity can be finely tuned by introducing of an electron-withdrawing moiety to the <italic>N</italic>-alky group, such as cyanomethyl, so that kinetic labeling can be considerably enhanced and carried out within minutes under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>

Using streptavidin-Alexa Fluor® 647 (Strept-A 647), we reveal the nanoscale distribution of P2X7 in BV2 cells at the single molecule level by direct stochastic optical-reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). We show that P2X7 is homogenously dispersed on the plasma membrane as single receptors in quiescent (non-inflammatory condition) microglia. However, upon exposure to the pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) from Gram-negative bacteria, combined with ATP or its potent synthetic analog BzATP, P2X7 undergoes significant upregulation and clustering, resulting in the synergistic release of IL-1β. Our findings suggest that the dynamic clustering of P2X7 on the plasma membrane is a crucial mechanism underlying IL-1β secretion.</p>

<title>Design and synthesis of X7-uP</title>
<p><bold>X7-uP</bold> was rationally designed by leveraging available X-ray structures of the panda P2X7 receptor (pdP2X7) bound to non-competitive P2X7 antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). These antagonists bind to an interfacial allosteric binding pocket in pdP2X7, distinct from ATP-binding sites, and accessible from the upper side of the trimeric receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Due to the trimeric assembly of P2X subunits, three allosteric binding sites are present in P2X7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We focused on AZ10606120, a selective antagonist with high-affinity for human (hP2X7) and rat P2X7 (rP2X7), with no effect on other P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). The X-ray structure revealed several lysine residues localized in proximity to AZ10606120 (&lt; 15 Å, measured from α-carbon of K72, K81, K82, K110 and K300, and the solvent-exposed hydroxyl of AZ10606120) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> inset). Since most of these lysine residues are unique to P2X7 (Figure 1 — figure supplement 1A), we hypothesized that NASA chemistry could selectively label P2X7. We modified AZ10606120 by replacing its solvent-exposed hydroxyethyl group with the reactive <italic>N</italic>-cyanomethyl NASA derivative, allowing a labeling reaction with the ε-amino group of nearby P2X7 lysine residues, forming a stable amide bond (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We used molecular docking to identify molecule <bold>1</bold> as a promising molecular scaffold built from AZ10606120 (Figure 1 — figure supplement 1B). The distance separating the NASA electrophilic carbon of <bold>1</bold> and each α-carbon of nearby P2X7 residues was compatible with a proximity-driven reaction with rP2X7 (≤ 16.1 Å, Figure 1 — figure supplement 1C), the receptor species used to experimentally validate the approach (see below). Thus, we designed and synthesized <bold>X7-uP</bold>, an extended version of <bold>1</bold>, containing an OEG (olygoethylene glycol) biotin tag (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). <bold>X7-uP</bold> is expected to covalently transfer the biotin tag to P2X7, which, in turn, can serve as a versatile platform for subsequent cell surface labeling with commercially available, cell-impermeable biotin-binding protein-conjugated molecular probes, including Alexa 647, suitable for super-resolution microscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). <bold>X7-uP</bold> was synthesized as described in Methods (Figure 1 — figure supplement 2).</p>

<title>X7-uP inhibits and biotinylates heterologously expressed rP2X7 in HEK293T cell</title>
<p>To address possible loss of affinity due to chemical modifications of the pharmacophore, we first assessed the ability of <bold>X7-uP</bold> to bind to P2X7 by measuring agonist-evoked current inhibition using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. In HEK293T cells transiently transfected with rP2X7, we recorded inward currents induced by eight successive applications of 10 μM 2’(3’)-<italic>O</italic>-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)ATP (BzATP), a potent P2X7 agonist (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, currents facilitated upon successive BzATP applications, a hallmark feature of P2X7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Application of 1 μM of <bold>X7-uP</bold> for 10 s after washout of the fourth BzATP application did not induce inward currents but strongly inhibited currents induced by co-application for 2 s with BzATP (79.3 ± 5.6%, mean ± standard error of the mean (s.e.m.), n = 4; control without inhibitors: −15.2 ± 4.4%, n = 4), as expected for a potent antagonist. Inhibition was reversible, as BzATP-evoked currents fully restored upon <bold>X7-uP</bold> washout (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Compared to the parental AZ10606120 compound, for which full inhibition was observed (99.7 ± 0.1%, n = 4) at 1 μM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A and B</xref>), these data suggest that the chemical modification of AZ10606120 has a minimal impact on the inhibition of P2X7 by <bold>X7-uP</bold>.</p>

A strong and unique band was detected in the Western blot at the expected apparent molecular mass of monomeric P2X7c-myc (∼75-80 kDa) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). However, this band disappeared upon co-incubation with AZ10606120 (10 μM), or in the absence of <bold>X7-uP</bold> (lane 1), while robust signals corresponding to P2X7c-myc and β-actin expression were still detected in the corresponding input controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, no signal was detected in non-transfected cells treated with <bold>X7-uP</bold> (Figure 2 — figure supplement 1A). To further demonstrate the pharmacological specificity of P2X7 labeling by <bold>X7-uP</bold>, we used another non-competitive P2X7 antagonist, A740003 (10 μM), which targets the same allosteric binding cavity as AZ10606120 in pdP2X7 but is chemically different from AZ10606120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). As expected, no labeling was detected when A740003 was co-incubated with <bold>X7-uP</bold> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that <bold>X7-uP</bold> biotinylates P2X7 residues by targeting the unique P2X7 allosteric binding site.</p>
<p>We next conducted a kinetic analysis of P2X7 labeling by incubating cells with <bold>X7-uP</bold> at different concentrations and monitoring labeling through quantitative Western blotting analysis. The time course of P2X7 labeling at 1 μM of <bold>X7-uP</bold> is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D, with labeled bands detected as early as 5 min of incubation time. The data were fitted to Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), derived according to a kinetic model in which an irreversible chemical reaction follows a reversible ligand binding reaction in a large excess of ligand (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), providing the pseudo-first-order reaction rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>app</sub>) of the labeling reaction. Kinetics of labeling carried out at different <bold>X7-uP</bold> concentrations allowed us to plot <italic>k</italic><sub>app</sub> values against <bold>X7-uP</bold> concentrations (Figure 2 — figure supplement 1B-D). The data were fitted to Eq. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), providing the labeling rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>L</sub> (0.011 ± 0.003 s<sup>-1</sup>, mean of triplicate ± standard deviation (s.d.)), the dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (7.3 ± 2.7 μM, mean ± s.d.), and the second-order rate constant (<italic>k</italic><sub>L</sub>/ <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 1.5 × 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). The second-order rate constant value was in the same order of magnitude as those of previously described labeling reagents based on NASA chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we determined <bold>X7-uP</bold> labeling yield by quantifying the amount of P2X7c-myc in the supernatant after pulling down biotinylated P2X7c-myc (Figure 2 — figure supplement 2A). This amount, corresponding to unbiotinylated P2X7c-myc, was then compared to the maximal amount of unbiotinylated P2X7c-myc carried out in the absence of <bold>X7-uP</bold>, thus providing labeling yield. Quantitative Western blotting analysis revealed that 65 ± 3% (mean of triplicate ± s.e.m.) of P2X7c-myc were labeled by 1 μM of <bold>X7-uP</bold> for 60 min in HEK293T cells (Figure 2 — figure supplement 2B).</p>

<title>X7-uP labeling is selective for P2X7</title>
<p>Having established the efficacy of P2X7 labeling by Western blot, we next assessed the selectivity of <bold>X7-uP</bold> towards the P2X family. We performed <bold>X7-uP</bold> labeling in HEK293T cells transiently transfected with various fluorescently tagged rat P2X subunits (P2X1 to P2X6).

<p>As expected, confocal microscopy revealed a strong Alexa 647 fluorescence signal in the periphery of cells expressing only P2X7 tagged with the monomeric Scarlet (mScarlet) fluorescent protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, no Alexa 647 signal was detected in cells transiently transfected with other P2X subunits tagged with GFP, although a strong GFP signal was observed for all constructs, confirming correct expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Furthermore, co-incubation with AZ10606120 (10 μM) or A740003 (10 μM) during <bold>X7-uP</bold> labeling abolished the Alexa 647 signal, but did not affect mScarlet signal, further confirming the specificity of P2X7 labeling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and C</xref>).

<title>X7-uP labels K82 and K117 in rP2X7</title>
<p>We next identified the labeling site of <bold>X7-uP</bold>. Since it has been shown that the NASA reagent preferentially reacts with the ε-amino group of lysine side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), we individually mutated K82, K110, K117, and K300 into alanine, an amino acid residue that cannot react with NASA, in the P2X7-mScarlet background.

Alexa 647 fluorescence reduction at K82A was significantly different from that at K117A (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>t</italic>-test), suggesting a larger contribution of K82 to <bold>X7-uP</bold> labeling.

<title>X7-uP reveals uniform membrane distribution of P2X7 in quiescent BV2 cells</title>
<p>Our data demonstrate the high selectivity of <bold>X7-uP</bold> for P2X7 in HEK293T cells. We next investigated whether its application extends to native P2X7-expressing microglia to reveal endogenous P2X7 expression. We chose BV2 cells, a cultured murine microglia model where the functional expression of P2X7 has been previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). In addition, the activation of microglia to mimic inflammation can be effectively stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> using both LPS and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Although K117 is not conserved in mouse P2X7, the highly conserved K82 should ensure the successful labeling of mouse P2X7 with <bold>X7-uP</bold> (Figure 1 — figure supplement 1A).</p>
<p>We first confirmed by ELISA assay that, under untreated conditions, BV2 cells are quiescent as they do not release IL-1β (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, B). We also confirmed P2X7 expression by Western blot and confocal microscopy following 1 μM <bold>X7-uP</bold> labeling for 10 min in FBS-free DMEM (Figure 5 — figure supplement 1). As observed for HEK293T cells, a strong and unique band was detected using a P2X7 antibody only in the presence of <bold>X7-uP</bold> in the pulldown Western blot, at the excepted apparent molecular mass of monomeric mouse P2X7 (∼68 kDa, unglycosylated form; see lanes 3 and 4 in Figure 5 — figure supplement 1A). This band disappeared upon co-incubation with AZ10606120 or A740003, while controls in the supernatant consistently showed endogenous P2X7 expression in all lanes, though non-specific bands were also observed, presumably due to the limited specificity of commercially available P2X7 antibodies (Figure 5 — figure supplement 1B). Quantitative Western blotting analysis revealed that 80 ± 1% (mean of triplicate ± s.e.m.) of total P2X7 were labeled in BV2 cells (Figure 2 — figure supplement 2A and B). Confocal microscopy revealed a strong Alexa 647 fluorescence signal in the periphery of BV2 cells that was reduced upon co-incubation with AZ10606120 or A740003 (Figure 5 — figure supplement 1C and D). Control with Strept-A 647 alone showed an extremely low fluorescence background level (Figure 5 — figure supplement 1C and D), demonstrating high <bold>X7-uP</bold> labeling specificity in BV2 cells.</p>

<p>To assess how BV2 activation affects P2X7 molecular organization, we employed dSTORM to track single fluorophores tagged to endogenous receptors. In this super-resolution technique, each fluorophore blinks several times before becoming silent due to bleaching or reaching a stable dark state. As a result, clusters of detections could result either from multiple blinks of a single receptor or represent the sum of multiple fluorophore emissions from clustered receptors. To quantify nanoscale object properties, we used Metamorph to obtain pixelized global images for global quantification (Figure 5 — figure supplement 2D), and SR-Tesseler, an open-source segmentation framework based on Voronoï tessellation from localized molecule coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), to analyze cluster properties (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H and I</xref>).</p>
<p>In control untreated condition (quiescent cells), dSTORM revealed punctated images, while no detections occurred without <bold>X7-uP</bold>, further confirming high labeling specificity in BV2 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, and Figure 5 — figure supplement 2A and B). Detections are organized into clusters of 44 nm in size (median, 25% percentile 18 nm, 75% percentile 80 nm), with on average 70 ± 15 (mean ± s.e.m.) detections per cluster (n = 4 cells, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Distribution analysis suggests that detections of fluorescent streptavidin conjugates are originating from one single receptor. On average, every P2X7 receptor is separated from its neighbor by a mean inter-cluster distance of 292 ± 5 nm (Figure 5 — figure supplement 2G). These data suggest that P2X7 is homogenously dispersed on the cell surface of quiescent BV2 cells.</p>
    <p>Since P2X7 has been suggested to be associated with lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), we pre-incubated cells with 15 mM methyl-<italic>β</italic>-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a lipid-raft disrupting agent, for 15 min, and labeled P2X7 with <bold>X7-uP</bold> after extensive washout to remove remaining MβCD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). MβCD treatment had no effect on IL-1β release, the number of detections per cluster, cluster size, or inter-cluster distance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, F and G</xref>, Figure 5 — figure supplement 2C and G). We interpret these results to suggest that disrupting lipid rafts does not alter P2X7 distribution in quiescent BV2 cells.</p>

<title>X7-uP reveals P2X7 clustering and upregulation in activated BV2 cells</title>
<p>We analyzed changes in cluster properties following BV2 activation by LPS and P2X agonists. To reliably correlate P2X7 spatial distribution with the inflammatory response, we labeled the same BV2 cells used for IL-1β release assays with <bold>X7-uP</bold> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Previous studies have proposed a two-signal, synergistic model for IL-1β release in microglia and other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), where the first signal involves LPS priming, leading to the intracellular accumulation of pro-IL-1β, while the second involves ATP-dependent P2X7 stimulation, promoting caspase-1 activation and the release of mature IL-1β. We confirmed this model by observing robust IL-1β release when BV2 cells were exposed to 1 mg/mL LPS for 24 hours, followed by 1 mM ATP (or 300 mM BzATP) for 30 minutes (LPS+ATP or LPS+BzATP) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). No IL-1β release was detected when ATP or BzATP was applied alone, while LPS alone induced significant release. However, this release was significantly less than that induced by co-treatments, representing only 35% of the release observed with LPS+ATP and 21% with LPS+BzATP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), confirming the synergistic effect. Co-incubation with AZ10606120 or A740003 during agonist exposure reduced IL-1β release to levels observed with LPS alone, demonstrating the role of P2X7 in IL-1β release (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A and C</xref>).</p>
<p>dSTORM images following treatments are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>. Global single-molecule labeling on the cell surface was significantly more pronounced in cells treated with LPS+ATP or LPS+BzATP, and to a lesser extent, though not significantly, in those treated with LPS alone compared to untreated control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Similar results were obtained using confocal microscopy, although the effect of LPS alone was significant (Figure 5 — figure supplement 3). Neither ATP nor BzATP application alone affected the number of detections per cluster, cluster size, or inter-cluster distance. At the cluster level, both LPS and LPS+ATP or LPS+BzATP treatments increased the number of detections per cluster (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E and G</xref> and Figure 5 — figure supplement 2D and E), with no change in inter-cluster distance or average intensity per sub-pixel (Figure 5 — figure supplement 2F and G), indicating no increase in detection density per pixel. On pixelized images, larger clusters (area greater than 0.025 mm<sup>2</sup>, insert <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>) emerged following LPS treatment, with or without agonists. Tessellation analysis revealed that the number of fluorophores within clusters significantly increased from ∼1.5 in untreated cells to 4.1 ± 0.4 for LPS, 4.9 ± 0.5 for LPS+ATP, and 5.2 ± 0.5 for LPS+BzATP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H and I</xref>). These data demonstrate that pro-inflammatory conditions induce P2X7 clustering by upregulating the average number of P2X7 receptors within clusters, increasing it from one to three, and favoring the formation of larger clusters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The strong P2X7 clustering induced by the combination of LPS and P2X7 agonists mirrors IL-1β secretion.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We present a rapid and efficient method for the selective labeling of P2X7 in native cells. This approach allowed us to uncover a nanoscale redistribution mechanism of individual endogenous P2X7 receptors on the plasma membrane of activated BV2 microglial cells, leading to the synergistic release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β.</p>
<p>Our strategy employs an affinity-guided approach, through which we developed <bold>X7-uP</bold>, a selective P2X7 biotinylating reagent that covalently attaches a biotin tag to lysine residues on native P2X7. In rat P2X7 (rP2X7), we identified two lysine residues as labeling sites: K82, a highly conserved residue unique to P2X7, and K117, a residue present only in rP2X7. We found that K82 is the primary labeling site in rP2X7, and given that K117 is absent in mouse P2X7, it is likely that K82 is the only labeled site in BV2-expressing P2X7.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the effectiveness of <bold>X7-uP</bold> in both heterologous and native expression systems. Compared to existing methods, <bold>X7-uP</bold> offers several advantages. First, it combines <italic>N</italic>-cyanomethyl NASA chemistry with the high-affinity AZ10606120 ligand, enabling rapid labeling in microglia (within 10 min) at a low <bold>X7-uP</bold> concentration (1 μM) in physiological-like buffer (e.g., FBS-free DMEM). Second, because AZ10606120 binds to a unique P2X7 allosteric site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), <bold>X7-uP</bold> is highly selective for P2X7, with no labeling observed in cells expressing other P2X or when specific P2X7 antagonists are present. This selectivity makes <bold>X7-uP</bold> particularly suitable for detecting P2X7 in native tissues, addressing the specificity issues seen with available antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Third, <bold>X7-uP</bold> provides a versatile platform to deliver various probes to P2X7, including those for pulldown assays and super-resolution imaging. The strong biotin-streptavidin (or neutravidin) interaction ensures specificity and stability, two crucial criteria for biochemical assays and cell imaging.</p>
<p>Our results not only confirm P2X7 expression in microglia, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), but also reveal its nanoscale localization at the cell surface using dSTORM. In quiescent cells, P2X7 is evenly distributed across the plasma membrane, likely as individual receptors with an average nearest-neighbor distance of ∼300 nm, indicating the absence of clustering. To test whether P2X7 associates with cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts, we pre-treated cells with MβCD, a cholesterol-depleting agent that perturbs lipid rafts. This treatment did not affect P2X7 distribution, although we have previously shown in HEK293T cells that MβCD increases P2X7 single-channel mean open time without altering unitary conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). These findings suggest that in quiescent BV2 microglial cells, perturbating lipid rafts does not alter the uniform distribution of individual P2X7 receptors, which likely reside within cholesterol-enriched nanodomains.</p>
<p>Under inflammatory conditions, we observed significant nanoscale reorganization of P2X7. Both LPS and ATP (orBzATP) trigger P2X7 upregulation and clustering, increasing the overall number of surface receptors and the number of receptors per cluster, from one to three (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). By labeling BV2 cells with <bold>X7-uP</bold> shortly after IL-1β release, we were able to correlate the nanoscale distribution of P2X7 with the functional state of BV2 cells, consistent with the two-signal, synergistic model for IL-1β secretion observed in microglia and other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). In this model, LPS priming leads to intracellular accumulation of pro-IL-1β, while ATP stimulation activates P2X7, triggering NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the subsequent release of mature IL-1β. Although the mechanism behind the overall increase in surface receptors remains unclear, a recent study suggests that the a1 subunit of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKAα1) forms a complex with P2X7 in microglia, including BV2 cells, and that LPS+ATP induces NKAα1 internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This internalization appears to release P2X7 from NKAα1, allowing P2X7 to exist in its free form. We speculate that the internalization of NKAα1 induced by both LPS and ATP exposes previously masked P2X7 sites, including the allosteric AZ10606120 sites, thus making them accessible for <bold>X7-uP</bold> labeling.</p>
<p>In sequence, the first priming step induced by LPS triggers P2X7 clustering and tends to increase the number of cell-surface receptors. This modest increase in P2X7 density may explain the lack of functional upregulation in the amplitude of the P2X7 current component observed in BV2 cells following LPS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The second step, triggered by ATP exposure, further elevates surface receptor levels and activates the P2X7-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome, which cleaves pro-IL-1β into its mature form and facilitates its release. Previous evidence suggests that P2X7 and NLRP3 co-localize in mouse microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), indicating that NLRP3 may reside beneath P2X7 clusters. We propose that the spatial reorganization and clustering of P2X7 during the LPS-induced priming phase at sites of active inflammation is an efficient mechanism to ensure synergistic IL-1β secretion in response to ATP. This clustering mechanism represents a finely tuned regulatory process that effectively links PAMP-induced signaling to DAMP-evoked responses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <bold>X7-uP</bold> is a powerful tool for visualizing P2X7 localization at the nanoscale on the cell surface of BV2 cells. We anticipate that <bold>X7-uP</bold> will become a valuable molecular probe for investigating P2X7 organization in other native cell types, such as macrophages, and for resolving the ongoing debate about P2X7 expression in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>

<title>dSTORM imaging and reconstruction</title>
<p>dSTORM acquisitions in HEK293T cells were conducted on a homemade system built on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope, equipped with a 100x oil immersion objective (N.A. 1.49) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). A 642 nm laser line was used to excite the Alexa Fluor-647 fluorophore, set to a power of 134 mW (resulting in an intensity of 2.7 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>). Samples were imaged with an EM-CCD camera (Hamamatsu, ImagEM) maintained at −60°C. Z-stabilization was ensured by the Nikon Perfect Focus System integrated into the microscope. Acquisition was performed in TIRF mode controlled using Micro-Manager 1.4.23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Single-molecule localization was achieved by analysis a stack of 15,000 images with the ThunderSTORM ImageJ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). The following parameters were used: image filtering – Difference-of-Gaussians filter (sigma 1 = 1.2 px, sigma 2 = 1.9 px), approximate localization of molecules: centroid of connected components (peak intensity threshold std (Wave.F1), sub-pixel localization of molecules: PSF: Integrated Gaussian (fitting radius: 6 px, fitting method: Weighted Least squares, initial sigma: 1.6 px)). Results were filtered by sigma, localization precision, and intensities values: 110 nm &lt; sigma &gt; 220 nm, precision &lt; 25 nm and intensity &lt; 2000.</p>
<p>dSTORM acquisitions in BV2 cells were performed on a commercial LEICA DMi8 (Leica, Germany) inverted microscope equipped with anti-vibrational table (TMC, USA) to minimize drift, along with a Leica HC PL APO 100X oil immersion TIRF objective (NA 1.47). For sample excitation, the microscope was equipped with a fiber-coupled laser launch composed of the following wavelengths: 405, 488, 532, 561, and 642 nm (Roper Scientific, Evry, France). Samples were imaged with an EMCCD camera (Teledyne Photometrics). Z stabilization was guaranteed by the Leica auto focus system integrated into the microscope. The 642 nm laser was used at a constant power to excite the Alexa Fluor-647 fluorophore, and the 405 nm laser was adjusted throughout the acquisition to control the level of single molecules per frame. Image acquisition was performed in TIRF mode controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices), with a 30 ms frame duration and a stack of 20,000 frames per acquisition on a 512 x 512-pixel ROI (pixel size = 160 nm).</p>
<p>Super-resolved images were reconstructed using the PALMTracer plugin for MetaMorph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). The localizations were first extracted using a consistent intensity threshold across the entire dataset.

<p>For confocal data shown in Figure 5 — figure supplement 3, membrane intensities were automatically selected. A threshold was first applied to distinguish particles from the background, after which all particles &gt;20 pixels in size were automatically selected and combined for each cell. After manually adjusting the selections, the integrated density (mean gray value x pixel number) was determined using ImageJ’s Measure function. Data were then analyzed with GraphPad.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors developed a chemical labeling reagent for P2X7 receptors, called X7-uP. This labeling reagent selectively labels endogenous P2X7 receptors with biotin based on ligand-directed NASA chemistry (Ref. 41). After labeling the endogenous P2X7 receptor with biotin, the receptor can be fluorescently labeled with streptavidin-AlexaFluor647. The authors carefully examined the binding properties and labeling selectivity of X7-uP to P2X7, characterized the labeling site of P2X7 receptors, and demonstrated fluorescence imaging of P2X7 receptors. The data obtained by SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and fluorescence microscopy clearly show that X7-uP labels the P2X7 receptor. Finally, the authors fluorescently labeled the endogenous P2X7 in BV2 cells, which are a murine microglia model, and used dSTORM to reveal a nanoscale P2X7 redistribution mechanism under inflammatory conditions at high resolution.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>X7-uP selectively labels endogenous P2X7 receptors with biotin. Streptavidin-AlexaFluor647 binds to the biotin labeled to the P2X7 receptor, allowing visualization of endogenous P2X7 receptors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Weaknesses &amp; Comments</p>
<p>
(1) The P2X7 receptor exists in a trimeric form. If it is not a monomer under the conditions of the pull-down assay in Figure 2C, the quantitative values may not be accurate.</p>
<p>
(2) In Figure 3, GFP fluorescence was observed in the cell. Are all types of P2X receptors really expressed on the cell surface ?</p>
<p>
(3) The reviewer was not convinced of the advantages of the approach taken in this paper, because the endogenous receptor labeling in this study could also be done using conventional antibody-based labeling methods.</p>
<p>
(4) Although P2X7 was successfully labeled in this paper, it is not new as a chemistry. There is a need for more attractive functional evaluation such as live trafficking analysis of endogenous P2X7.</p>
<p>
(5) The reviewer has concerns that the use of the large-size streptavidin to label the P2X7 receptor may perturbate the dynamics of the receptor.</p>
<p>
(6) It is better to directly label Alexa647 to the P2X7 receptor to avoid functional perturbation of P2X7.</p>
<p>
(7) In all imaging experiments, the addition of streptavidin, which acts as a cross-linking agent, may induce P2X7 receptor clustering. This concern would be dispelled if the receptors were labeled with a fluorescent dye instead of biotin and observed.</p>
<p>
(8) There are several mentions of microglia in this paper, even though they are not used. This can lead to misunderstanding for the reader. The author conducted functional analysis of the P2X7 receptor in BV-2 cells, which are a model cell line but not microglia themselves. The text should be reviewed again and corrected to remove the misleading parts that could lead to misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
e.g. P8. lines 361-364. First, it combines N-cyanomethyl NASA chemistry with the high-affinity AZ10606120 ligand, enabling rapid labeling in microglia (within 10 min)</p>
<p>
P8. lines 372-373. Our results not only confirm P2X7 expression in microglia, as previously reported (6, 26-33), but also reveal its nanoscale localization at the cell surface using dSTORM.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Arnould et. al. develop an unbiased, affinity-guided reagent to label P2X7 receptor and use super-resolution imaging to monitor P2X7 redistribution in response to inflammatory signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I think the X7-uP probe that they developed is very useful for visualizing localization of P2X7 receptor. They convincingly show that under inflammatory conditions, there is a reorganization of P2X7 localization into receptor clusters. Moreover, I think they have shown a very clever way to specifically label any receptor of interest. This has broad appeal</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is novel and interesting. However, I do have some suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>(1) While the authors state that chemical modification of AZ10606120 to produce the X7-UP reagent has &quot;minimal impact&quot; on the inhibition of P2X7, we can see from Figure 2A and 2B that it does not antagonize P2X7 as effectively as the original antagonist. For the sake of completeness and quantitation, I think it would be great if the authors could determine the IC50 for X7-uP and compare it to the IC50 of AZ10606120.</p>
<p>(2) Do the authors know whether modification of the lysines with biotin affects the receptor's affinity for ATP (or ability to be activated by ATP)? What about P2X7 that has been modified with biotin and then labeled with Alexa 647? For the sake of completeness and quantitation, I think it would be great if the authors could determine the EC50 of biotinylated P2X7 for ATP as well as biotinylated and then Alexa 647 labeled P2X7 for ATP and compare these values to the affinity of unmodified WT P2X7 for ATP.</p>
<p>(3) It is a little misleading to color the fluorescence signal from mScarlet green (for example, in Figure 3 and Figure 4). The fluorescence is not at the same wavelength as GFP. In fact, the wavelength (570 nm - 610 nm) for emission is closer to orange/red than to green. I think this color should be changed to differentiate the signal of mScarlet from the GFP signal used for each of the other P2X receptor subtypes.</p>
<p>(4) It is my understanding that P2X6 does not form homotrimers. Thus, I was a little surprised to see that the density and distribution of P2X6-GFP in Figure 3 looks very similar to the density and distribution of the other P2X subtypes. Do the authors have an explanation for this? Are they looking at P2X6 protomers inserted into the plasma membrane? Does the cell line have endogenous P2X receptor subtypes? Is Figure 3 showing heterotrimers with P2X6 receptor? A little explanation might be helpful.</p>
<p>(5) It is easy to overlook the fact that the antagonist leaves the binding pocket once the biotin has been attached to the lysines. It might be helpful if the authors made this a little more apparent in Figure 1 or in the text describing the NASA chemistry reaction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes the development of a covalent labeling probe (X7-uP) that selectively targets and tags native P2X7 receptors at the plasma membrane of BV2 microglial cells. Using super-resolution imaging (dSTORM), the authors demonstrate that P2X7 receptors form nanoscale clusters upon microglial activation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP, correlating with synergistic IL-1β release. These findings advance understanding of P2X7 reorganization during inflammation and provide a generalizable labeling strategy for monitoring endogenous P2X7 in immune cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors designed X7-uP by coupling a high-affinity, P2X7-specific antagonist (AZ10606120) with N-cyanomethyl NASA chemistry to achieve site-directed biotinylation. This approach offers high specificity, minimal off-target reactivity, and a straightforward pull-down/imaging readout.</p>
<p>
(2) The results connect P2X7's nanoscale clustering directly with IL-1β secretion in microglia, reinforcing the role of P2X7 in inflammation. By localizing endogenous P2X7 at single-molecule resolution, the authors reveal how LPS priming and ATP stimulation synergistically reorganize the receptor.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors systematically validate their method in recombinant systems (HEK293 cells) and in BV2 cells, showing selective inhibition, mutational confirmation of the binding site, and Western blot pulldown experiments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the data strongly indicate that P2X7 clustering contributes to IL-1β release, the manuscript would benefit from additional experiments (if feasible) or discussion on how receptor clustering interfaces with downstream inflammasome assembly. Clarification of whether the P2X7 clusters physically colocalize with known inflammasome proteins would solidify the mechanism.</p>
<p>
(2) The authors might expand on the scope of X7-uP in other native cells that endogenously express P2X7 (e.g., macrophages, dendritic cells). Although they mention the possibility, demonstrating the probe's applicability in at least one other primary immune cell type would strengthen its general utility.</p>
<p>
(3) The authors do include appropriate negative controls, yet providing additional details (e.g., average single-molecule on-time or blinking characteristics) in supplementary materials could help readers assess cluster calculations.</p>
