<title>Abstract</title><p>During prometaphase in mitosis, chromosomes are pushed toward the spindle equator. The chromokinesin Kid, also known as KIF22, moves chromosomes along spindle microtubules during prometaphase. Kid has long been considered as a monomeric and non-processive motor, different from typical kinesins. In this study, we demonstrate that the full-length Kid forms a homodimer and moves processively along microtubules. A conserved coiled-coil domain within the stalk region of Kid is not only capable of homodimer formation, but is also required for the processivity of Kid. Furthermore, the neck linker and coiled-coil domains of Kid could add processive activity to the motor domain of KIF1A, suggesting that Kid contains a functional neck linker and dimerization capability, a prerequisite for the processivity of kinesin motor domains. The full-length Kid, containing a helix-hairpin-helix domain, can transport double-strand DNA along microtubules in vitro. These findings collectively suggest the reclassification of Kid as a processive motor that transports DNA along microtubules.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microtubules are reorganized to form a bipolar spindle as cells enter mitosis. In the prometaphase of mitosis, chromosomes are transported along the microtubules toward the spindle equator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rieder et al., 1986</xref>). This process, known as chromosome congression, requires kinesin-4, kinesin-10 and kinesin-12 class of motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iemura and Tanaka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wordeman, 2010</xref>). The mechanical forces that move chromosomes toward the spindle equator is called polar ejection forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brouhard and Hunt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Levesque and Compton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rieder et al., 1986</xref>). The Kinesin-like DNA-binding protein (Kid), belonging to the kinesin-10 family and also known as KIF22, serves as a main molecular motor that transports chromosomes and generates polar ejection forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brouhard and Hunt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Levesque and Compton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ohsugi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thompson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tokai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wandke et al., 2012</xref>). Structurally, Kid contains a kinesin motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yajima et al., 2003</xref>), a coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>), and a DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tokai et al., 1996</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In mitosis, the DNA binding domain of Kid binds along chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Antonio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Funabiki and Murray, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Levesque and Compton, 2001</xref>). Using the motor domain, Kid transports chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brouhard and Hunt, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>A single kinesin molecule can move for hundreds of steps along a microtubule without dissociating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hackney, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hancock and Howard, 1998</xref>). This property, called processivity, requires dimerization of kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hancock and Howard, 1998</xref>). However, Kid has long been regarded as a monomeric and non-processive motor, which can move along microtubules in only a single step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yajima et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with these findings, Kid is unique within kinesin superfamily due to lack of the conventional neck coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>), an element that determines the length of the neck linker essential for the coordinated movement of the two motor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Case et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Isojima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>). While a study has indicated the possibility that the full-length human Kid protein can move processively along microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Stumpff et al., 2012</xref>), this study did not investigate the oligomeric state of Kid, nor did it provide detailed information on the Kidâs motility characteristics and parameters. A Drosophila kinesin-10 motor NOD, an orthologue of Kid, is also characterized as a monomeric and non-processive motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Matthies et al., 2001</xref>). Similar to Kid, NOD has a DNA binding domain at the tail domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afshar et al., 1995</xref>). NOD shows a processive movement only when the protein is forcedly dimerized by the addition of an artificial coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, Kid acts as an active motor in microtubule gliding assays and cargo transport assays, both of which detect movement generated by multiple Kid motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Takagi et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, it has been widely assumed that Kid, unlike other kinesins, transports chromosomes by their cooperative action of many non-processive monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brouhard and Hunt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iemura and Tanaka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Takagi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thompson et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, we and others have analyzed properties of full-length kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chiba et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chiba et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, these studied have found that monomeric kinesins, including KIF1A, UNC-104 and KIF13B are converted to a dimer when activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiba et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kita et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). For instance, in the autoinhibited and inactive state, KIF1A and UNC-104 are monomeric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kita et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). The monomeric motor domain of UNC-104 and KIF1A has a plus-end directed motor activity but exhibits one-dimensional diffusion, meaning that the efficiency is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Okada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). Upon the release of autoinhibition, KIF1A and UNC-104 form dimers, which exhibit efficient directional movement on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kita et al., 2024</xref>). These studies prompted us to reanalyze the oligomeric state and the motile properties of Kid, mainly in the full length. In this study, we show that the full-length Kid protein moves processively along microtubules. Kid proteins can form dimers but Kid proteins are dissociated to monomers at low concentrations. In the reconstitution assays in vitro, full-length Kid transport double-strand DNA along microtubules.</p>

<title>Kid exhibits processive movement along microtubules</title>
<p>To study biochemical and biophysical properties of full-length Kid, we firstly purified the full-length human Kid (hKid) and Xenopus Kid (XKid) using the baculovirus system and Sf9 cells because a previous study has succeeded in purifying functional XKid from Sf9 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Funabiki and Murray, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Takagi et al., 2013</xref>). hKid as well as XKid possesses an N-terminal motor domain, a short coiled-coil domain and a DNA binding tail domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous studies have shown that hKid and XKid, that are fused with fluorescent proteins at the C-terminal, can complement the function of hKid-depleted cells and XKid-depleted Xenopus egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Soeda et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we fused a fluorescent protein at the C-terminal of XKid and hKid. Notably, while EGFP-fused and sfGFP-fused hKid were insoluble, mNeonGreen-fused hKid was recovered from soluble fractions. As a result, we succeeded in purifying both XKid-mScarlet and hKid-mNeonGreen proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, and supplemental Figure S1). Next, the motility of purified proteins were analyzed by single molecule motility assays using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy (TIRF). We found that both XKid and hKid moved on microtubules processively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>, Movie 1 and 2). The motility of single molecules along microtubules could be observed at 20 pM of Xkid and hKid, respectively. The average velocity of XKid and hKid were approximately 70 nm/sec (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), within the same range as the movement of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brouhard and Hunt, 2005</xref>). The run length of XKid and hKid were 4.11 Â± 2.27 and 3.67 Â± 2.16 Âµm, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). These data collectively suggest that full-length Kid is a processive motor protein.</p>

<title>Full-length Kid form dimers</title>
<p>It has been proposed that Kid is a monomeric protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yajima et al., 2003</xref>). Even full-length human Kid protein obtained from 293T cells are indicated to be a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>). However, typical kinesins show processive movement along microtubules only when they form dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hancock and Howard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kita et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). As both hKid and XKid showed processive movement on microtubules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), we next analyzed the oligomeric state of these motors using size exclusion chromatography (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We utilized the previously well-characterized kinesin UNC-104(1-653)-sfGFP as a size marker. UNC-104(1-653)-sfGFP exhibits a dimer peak at 200 kDa and a monomer peak at 100 kDa in size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kita et al., 2024</xref>). This characteristic makes it a suitable marker for determining the oligomeric state of hKid and XKid, given that the predicted molecular weights of hKid-mNeonGreen and XKid-mScarlet monomers are approximately 100 kDa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). As a result, we found that the peak fraction of full-length hKid and XKid are almost equivalent to that of UNC-104(1-653)-sfGFP dimer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, and supplemental Figure S2). Notably, unlike UNC-104(1-653)-sfGFP, we did not detect any monomer peaks for hKid and XKid under these conditions. We next analyzed purified proteins recovered from the peak fractions using mass photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sonn-Segev et al., 2020</xref>). Mass photometry is generally performed at the nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sonn-Segev et al., 2020</xref>). Peak fractions obtained from size exclusion chromatography were diluted 100-fold and analyzed by mass photometry. The mass photometry analysis indicated the presence of significant amount of monomers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). The property is similar to the behavior of UNC-104(1-653)-sfGFP, which shows dimer peaks in the size exclusion chromatography at micromolar concentrations but dissociates into monomers at the nanomolar concentrations used for mass photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kita et al., 2024</xref>). These findings indicate that full-length hKid and XKid are capable of forming dimers, but the dimer formation is dependent on the protein concentration.</p>

<title>A conserved coiled-coil domain is essential for the processivity</title>
<p>To determine the domain essential for the processive movement of Kid, we generated a series of deletion mutants. Unfortunately, we failed to purify adequate quantities and qualities of hKid deletion mutants. Thus, following experiments were performed using XKid. We purified XKid(1-495), which lacks the DNA-binding tail domain, and XKid(1-437), which lacks the DNA-binding domain and the coiled-coil domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, and supplemental Figure S1). Using these purified proteins, we performed single molecule motility assays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-F</xref>). We found XKid(1-495) could move processively on microtubules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The velocity of XKid(1-495) was approximately 70 nm/sec and the run length was 4.18 Â± 1.56 Âµm, which are comparable to those of full-length XKid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-F</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus, DNA binding domain of Kid is not required for processive runs. In contrast, XKid(1-437), which lacks the coiled-coil domain, did not show any processive runs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This would be because XKid(1-437) did not form a homodimer, considering that coiled-coil domains are generally required for the dimerization of kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hancock and Howard, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kita et al., 2024</xref>). To confirm that the coiled-coil domain of XKid induces dimerization, the domain was fused with mScarlet and analyzed by the size exclusion chromatography (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). As a result, the peak of XKidCC-mScarlet shifted to the larger size compared with that of mScarlet. The calculated molecular weight of XKidCC-mScarlet was 42 kDa, which is almost equivalent to the size of dimerized mScarlet. These data suggest that the coiled-coiled domain of Kid can induce dimer formation.</p>

<title>The stalk domain of XKid adds processivity to the motor domain of KIF1A</title>
<p>In the processive movement along the microtubules, the coordination between two motor domains is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hancock and Howard, 1998</xref>). The neck linker domain, immediately following the kinesin motor domain, regulates the ATPase activity within the motor domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Case et al., 2000</xref>). It has been shown that optimal length of the neck linker domain is crucial for achieving coordination of the two motor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Isojima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yildiz et al., 2008</xref>). The length of the neck linker domain is typically determined by the presence of the neck coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Case et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shastry and Hancock, 2010</xref>). However, Kid is an exception, as it does not have the conventional neck coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tokai et al., 1996</xref>). This unique feature of Kid supports the idea that Kid functions as a non-processive monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yajima et al., 2003</xref>), which does not require the coordination between two motor domains. However, coiled-coil prediction tools might not identify hidden coiled-coil domains or Kid could have a motif that induces dimerization. In the case of kinesin-1, Alphafold2, but not coiled-coil prediction tools, can more accurately find the location of coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Tan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Weijman et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we used Alphafold2 to analyze the neck-linker and the first coiled-coil domain of hKid and XKid. The result suggested that the region does not have hidden coiled-coil domains nor a motif that induces dimerization, and the region is flexible (Supplementary Figure S3). If the entire flexible region functions as a neck linker, its length is 4 times longer than that of kinesin-1 (Supplementary Figure S3). To investigate if this extended neck linker of Kid can support the coordination of two motor domains, we fused the stalk domain of XKid to the motor domain of KIF1A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We included the possible neck linker domain of XKid in this chimera protein to test whether the neck linker of XKid is functional or not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We could purify the chimeric protein, named KIF1AMD-XKidSt (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and supplementary Figure S1). We found that KIF1AMD-XKidSt exhibited processive movement along microtubules in the single molecule motility assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and movie S3), as is the case of KIF1A(1-393)LZ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and movie S4). The velocity of KIF1AMD-XKidSt was much faster than original XKid but slightly slower than KIF1A(1-393)LZ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The run length of KIF1AMD-XKidSt was shorter than KIF1A(1-393)LZ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the motor domain of KIF1A does not exhibit processive motion when it is monomeric, but exhibits processive motion when an artificial dimer is generated using a stalk domain of kinesin-1 or a leucine zipper domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Soppina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tomishige et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that the coiled-coil domain of XKid can induce dimerization of KIF1A motor domains on microtubules and the longer neck linker domain of XKid can support the processive movement of the kinesin motor domain.</p>

<title>Reconstitution of DNA transport in vitro</title>
<p>Kid was originally identified as a DNA binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Tokai et al., 1996</xref>). The tail domain of Kid has two helix-hairpin-helix motif which is supposed to be a DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Doherty et al., 1996</xref>). To test that Kid has an activity to transport DNA along microtubules, we mixed fluorescently-labelled DNA in TIRF assays and directly observed the motility (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs 5A-D</xref>). To study the domains essential for the transport of DNA, we used full-length XKid and a deletion mutant of Xkid for these assays. We found that full-length XKid can drive the movement of double-strand DNA along microtubules (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Double-strand DNA signals that co-migrated with XKid were 93.4 Â± 10.5 % (n = 31 microtubules). The velocity of double-strand DNA moving along microtubules was approximately 70 nm/sec, which is similar to the velocity of XKid alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, single-strand DNA movement was not driven by XKid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Deletion of the tail domain of XKid, containing helix-hairpin-helix motif, abolished the DNA transport activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Finally, we confirmed that full-length hKid can induce the movement of double-strand DNA along microtubules (Supplemental Figure S4 an supplemental movie S5).</p>

<title>Kid is a processive motor protein on microtubules</title>
<p>Prometaphase chromosomes are transported along microtubules by the activity of kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iemura and Tanaka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Wordeman, 2010</xref>). Kid is the primary kinesin that transports chromosomes along spindle microtubules in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brouhard and Hunt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iemura and Tanaka, 2015</xref>). Our data show that full-length Kid is capable to form a dimer and exhibits a processive motion along microtubules, suggesting that Kid uses two motor domains and transports chromosomes along spindle microtubules as is the case in other kinesins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). A notable difference between this study and prior studies is the protein concentration used. Previous analysis of full-length human Kid via density gradient and size exclusion chromatography identified peak fractions through western blot, due to the low concentration of recombinant Kid expressed in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Shiroguchi et al., 2003</xref>). We show that most hKid and XKid exist as dimers in size exclusion chromatography performed at micromolar concentrations, yet dissociate into monomers in mass photometry, which is performed at nanomolar concentrations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the inability to detect Kid dimers in earlier studies may be attributed to the low concentration. Another difference is the methods to detect the processivity of motors. We observed the processivity of Kid by TIRF whereas previous studies observed the motility by optical trap. In optical trapping assays, Kid is diluted prior to being adsorbed onto beads. This dilution process results in the dissociation of dimerized Kid, thereby predominantly observing the motility of monomeric Kid in the assay. Conversely, in TIRF-based motility assays, although Kid predominantly dissociates into monomers in solution, its direct interaction with microtubules leads to an increased local concentration of Kid on the microtubule surface. As a result, this would facilitate the formation of Kid dimers on the microtubules, leading to processive motility. These properties, such as âthe equilibrium between monomers and dimersâ and âthe capability to exhibit processive movement on microtubules, even when characterized as monomers through mass photometryâ have been observed in kinesin-3 motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chiba et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kita et al., 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>Reconstitution of chromosome congression</title>
<p>A previous in vitro study, using an elegant assay termed chromatin gliding assay, has shown that XKid and XKLP1/KIF4A can crosslink between DNA and microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>). However, it remains to be elusive whether the chromosome transport is mediated by direct binding between genomic DNA and motor proteins. In the case of organelle transport, cargo adaptor proteins are generally required for efficient transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chiba and Niwa, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chiba et al., 2022</xref>). Our in vitro reconstitution suggests that no cargo adaptor proteins are required for Kid-dependent chromosome transport. It has been shown that Kid is regulated by phosphorylation by CDK1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ohsugi et al., 2003</xref>). It would be interesting to study the effects of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation on the Kid-dependent DNA transport using this reconstitution system. Moreover, by extending this system, it may be possible to fully reconstitute the chromosome congression in vitro by including other kinesins and microtubule-associated proteins, such as XKLP1/KIF4A, CENP-E and NuSAP1, that are required for proper chromosome congression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bieling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iemura and Tanaka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study clarifies the mechanism by which the kinesin-10 motor protein, chromosome-associated kinesin, Kid (KIF22), enables chromosome movement during mitosis, demonstrating that human and Xenopus Kid proteins function as processive, homodimeric kinesins capable of processive microtubule plus-end motility. The <bold>convincing</bold> work highlights that Kid can recruit and transport duplex DNA along microtubules via its conserved C-terminal DNA binding domain, revising our understanding of chromokinesins' role in chromosome motility during mitosis. Although the data are robust, the manuscript would benefit from some editing for clarity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mitotic kinesins carry out crucial roles in intracellular motility and mitotic spindle organization. Although many mitotic kinesins have been extensively studied, a few conserved mitotic motors remain poorly explored, including chromosome-associated kinesins. Here, Furusaki et al reconstitute recombinant chromosome-associated kinesin or chromokinesin (Kid) and reveal processive plus-end motility along microtubules. The authors purify multiple versions of Kid, revealing dimeric organization and their processive microtubule plus-ended motility which depends on their conserved motor domains, neck linkers, and coiled-coil regions. The study reveals for the first time that KID can recruit and transport duplex DNA along microtubules using its conserved C-terminal DNA binding domain. The work provides crucial revised thinking about the mechanisms of Chromokinesins mitosis as physical processive motors that mobilize chromosomes towards the microtubule plus ends in early metaphase.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors reconstitute multiple chromosome-associated kinesin (KID) orthologs from Xenopus and humans with microtubules and determine their oligomerization. The study shows how coiled-coil and neck linker regions of KID are essential for its function as its deletion leads to non-processive motility. CHimeras placing the KID coiled-coil and neck linker on the KIF1A motor domain led to the production of a processive recombinant motor supporting the compatibility of their motility mechanisms. The KID c-terminal tail binds and transports only double-stranded DNA and its deletion or single-stranded DNA leads to defects in this activity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A minor weakness in the studies is that they do not resolve the mechanisms of KID in binding large duplex DNA molecules or condensed chromatin. The authors suggest a model in which KID forms multimers along large chromosomes that lead to their transport, but this model was not directly tested.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Previous work in the field highlighted the role of the kinesin-10 motor protein Kid (KIF22) in the polar ejection force during prometaphase. However, the biochemical and biophysical properties of Kid that enabled it to serve in this role were unclear. The authors demonstrate that human and xenopus Kid proteins are processive kinesins that function as homodimeric molecules. The data are solid and support the findings although the text could use some editing to improve clarity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A highlight of the work is the reconstitution of DNA transport in vitro.</p>
<p>A second highlight is the demonstration that the monomer vs dimer state is dependent on protein concentration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors make several assumptions of the monomer vs dimer state of various Kid constructs without verifying the protein state using e.g. size exclusion chromatography and/or nanophotometry. They also make statements about monomer-to-dimer transitions on the microtubule without showing or quantifying the data.</p>
<p>The discussion needs to better put the work into context regarding the ability of non-processive motors to work in teams (formerly thought to be the case for Kid) and how their findings on Kid change this prevailing view in the case of polar ejection force.</p>
<p>The authors also do not mention previous work on kinesins with non-conventional neck linker/neck coil regions that have been shown to move processively. Their work on Kid needs to be put into this context.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your suggestion.</p>
<p>We will attempt to observe the movement of longer dsDNA and/or DNA-bead complexes and compare their motility with that of a single KID motor to elucidate the cooperativity of the motor protein.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Previous work in the field highlighted the role of the kinesin-10 motor protein Kid (KIF22) in the polar ejection force during prometaphase. However, the biochemical and biophysical properties of Kid that enabled it to serve in this role were unclear. The authors demonstrate that human and xenopus Kid proteins are processive kinesins that function as homodimeric molecules. The data are solid and support the findings although the text could use some editing to improve clarity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A highlight of the work is the reconstitution of DNA transport in vitro.</p>
<p>A second highlight is the demonstration that the monomer vs dimer state is dependent on protein concentration.</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors make several assumptions of the monomer vs dimer state of various Kid constructs without verifying the protein state using e.g. size exclusion chromatography and/or nanophotometry. They also make statements about monomer-to-dimer transitions on the microtubule without showing or quantifying the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As reviewer suggests, the monomer-to-dimer transitions on the microtubule is a speculation. What we can measure in our hands are (1) monomer and dimer ratio in the solution and (2) particle movement on microtubules. At the pmol/L condition, Kid is monomeric in solution but exhibits processive movement on microtubules. Dimerization is generally required for the processivity. Therefore, we suggest Kid forms a dimer on microtubules.</p>
<p>To show that Kid forms a dimer on microtubules, we will perform photobleaching assays and measure the fluorescent intensities of each particle on microtubules to determine their oligomeric state.</p>

<p>The discussion needs to better put the work into context regarding the ability of non-processive motors to work in teams (formerly thought to be the case for Kid) and how their findings on Kid change this prevailing view in the case of polar ejection force.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will look for the example of non-processive motors and include them in the Discussion and Citation. As described by this reviewer, Kid was originally thought to be a non-processive motor. We hope that our current work would change that view.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors also do not mention previous work on kinesins with non-conventional neck linker/neck coil regions that have been shown to move processively. Their work on Kid needs to be put into this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have thought that most kinesins, belonging to the cargo-transport classes, have conserved neck linker domain and neck coil domains, with Kid being exception. We will search for more citations, including non-transport classes of kinesins, and re-write the Discussion.</p>
