<title>Abstract</title><p>Pancreatic cancer has the worst prognosis of all common tumors. Earlier cancer diagnosis could increase survival rates and better assessment of metastatic disease could improve patient care. As such, there is an urgent need to develop biomarkers to diagnose this deadly malignancy earlier. Analyzing circulating extracellular vesicles (cEVs) using ‘liquid biopsies’ offers an attractive approach to diagnose and monitor disease status. However, it is important to differentiate EV-associated proteins enriched in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from those with benign pancreatic diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). To meet this need, we combined the novel EVtrap method for highly efficient isolation of EVs from plasma and conducted proteomics analysis of samples from 124 individuals, including patients with PDAC, benign pancreatic diseases and controls. On average, 912 EV proteins were identified per 100µL of plasma. EVs containing high levels of PDCD6IP, SERPINA12 and RUVBL2 were associated with PDAC compared to the benign diseases in both discovery and validation cohorts. EVs with PSMB4, RUVBL2 and ANKAR were associated with metastasis, and those with CRP, RALB and CD55 correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Finally, we validated a 7-EV protein PDAC signature against a background of benign pancreatic diseases that yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for the diagnosis of PDAC. To our knowledge, our study represents the largest proteomics profiling of circulating EVs ever conducted in pancreatic cancer and provides a valuable open-source atlas to the scientific community with a comprehensive catalogue of novel cEVs that may assist in the development of biomarkers and improve the outcomes of patients with PDAC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis of all common tumors, with a 5-year survival of 12%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. With rising incidence, it is expected that PDAC will become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. A critical factor for this dismal development is the late diagnosis, with less than 20% of patients presenting with a potentially resectable and curable tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Earlier cancer diagnosis could increase the survival rates by an estimated 5-fold, and more reliable and real-time assessment of treatment effects in patients with cancer could improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, there are no credentialed serologic biomarkers with high enough performance to assist in the early detection of PDAC. The best-established biomarker for PDAC, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), is fraught with poor sensitivity and specificity and is only used for monitoring disease on treatment or after surgical resection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are nanosized particles released by most cell types and can be detected in the circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. EVs play important roles in the transmission of oncogenic and inflammatory signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, communications between cells and their microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In addition, exoDNA, exoRNA and protein profiles highly reflect parental cells, therefore offering an attractive strategy for diagnosing cancers non-invasively by analyzing EVs in the circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Previous studies employed EVs to discover biomarkers for PDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, however those discovery proteomics experiments were carried out using cell lines or tumor tissue, which are not representative of the heterogeneity of human PDAC and are unable to recapitulate the systemic responses to cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, the EV biomarkers discovered in those studies have been compared only against healthy controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. It is unclear how they would perform in subjects with underlying benign diseases of the pancreas, which is highly desirable from the clinical standpoint as many patients with PDAC have underlying chronic pancreatitis and cysts.</p>
<p>To meet this need, we conducted a large EV proteomics study from peripheral blood across a range of patients with pancreatic cancer, benign pancreatic diseases such as chronic pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), and healthy controls. Circulating EV (cEV) proteins detected included those involved in metabolism and immune regulation, in addition to proteins involved in protein binding, exocytosis, endocytosis and regulation of cellular protein localization that have been identified in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Our study represents the largest EV proteomics profiling dataset of pancreatic cancer, therefore providing a resource to the research community to further the understanding of EV roles in pancreatic cancer biology and biomarker discovery. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we identified multiple candidate biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and validated several in an independent cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer. In addition, we identified a set of cEV proteins associated with metastasis and prognosis which could provide a valuable resource for future biomarker studies as well as understanding of systemic changes during pancreatic tumor progression.</p>

<title>Proteomics Characterization of Circulating EVs</title>
<p>In this study, we sought to identify proteins in extracellular vesicles in the blood that may be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer. With the approval of our institutional review board, we enrolled a total of 124 patients to the discovery cohort of this biomarker study (<bold>Methods and Supplementary Table 1</bold>). Subjects in the pancreatic cancer group (N=93) had a mean age of 66.5 years (range, 37-91), and 48.4% were female. All subjects had biopsy-proven disease. Thirty subjects had early-stage disease (stages I-II) and 63 had advanced disease (stages III-IV). Patients with benign pancreatic diseases included chronic pancreatitis (N=12) with a mean age of 57.5 years (range 37-78) and with 50% females, whereas IPMN included individuals with main duct and side branch IPMNs (N=8) with a mean age of 68.2 years (range 50-89) and with 87.5% being females. Subjects in the healthy control group (N=11) had a mean age of 53.4 years (range, 31-83) with 54.5% females (<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>).</p>
<p>We employed the novel EVtrap method (Extracellular Vesicles Total Recovery And Purification) to capture EVs from plasma samples and overcome the traditional laborious techniques for EV isolation, which are not scalable for large clinical studies. As described in recent reports, EVtrap is a magnetic bead-based isolation method that enables highly efficient capture of EVs from biofluids, confirmed by multiple common EV markers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Over 95% recovery yield can be achieved by EVTRAP with less contamination from soluble proteins, a significant improvement over current commercially available methods as well as ultracentrifugation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Following EV isolation, samples were digested in-solution and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) on a high-resolution mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive HF-X). The workflow for cEVs isolation and enrichment and subsequent cEV mass spectrometry analysis is illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>.</p>

<caption><p>Study Design The discovery cohort was comprised of 124 individuals, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, N=93), chronic pancreatitis (CP, N=12), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN, N=8) and healthy controls (N=11). Plasma samples were processed for EV isolation using EVtrap and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>First, to confirm that EVtrap can efficiently isolate extracellular vesicles from plasma, a test plasma sample was processed to remove platelets and other large particles and enriched for EVs using EVtrap beads (see <bold>methods</bold> for details). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the EV pellet showed cup-shaped extracellular vesicles (exosomes and microvesicles) (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1A</bold>), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) using ZetaView instrument (Particle Metrix) demonstrated that the isolated EVs were in the 100−200 nm diameter range, with a mean diameter of 152 nm (<bold>Supplementary Figure 1B</bold>). Second, to assess the technical reproducibility of the EV proteomics approach, the test plasma sample was processed in six replicates and Pearson correlation analysis revealed a very high correlation (r2 &gt; 0.97) between replicates (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2A, Supplementary Table 2</bold>). These results provided the confidence to proceed with the analysis of our discovery set of plasma from 124 subjects. In this cohort, we identified 1,708 unique proteins (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>). The number of unique EV proteins detected per 100µL of plasma sample varied from 817 to 1,128, with an average of 912 unique proteins per sample (<bold>Supplementary Figure 2B</bold>). We did not observe differences between non-tumor and tumor samples regarding the overall number of EV proteins identified. Within the PDAC group, we did not observe significant differences in the average number of EV proteins detected for different disease stages. Collectively, these data demonstrate high reproducibility of EV isolation and robust label-free MS quantification of cEVs.</p>

<title>Diseases of the Pancreas Express Distinct Circulating EV Proteome Compared to Controls</title>
<p>Next, we aimed at identifying specific cEV proteins associated with clinical parameters with the potential to serve as diagnostic biomarkers. We first compared the proteomics profile of individuals with underlying pancreatic diseases (PDAC, chronic pancreatitis and IPMN) against healthy controls. We selected EV proteins expressed in at least 50% of subjects in the disease group with a fold change of expression ≥2 or ≤2 compared to controls and p-value ≤0.01 after adjusting for multiple testing. A total of 207 proteins were identified that met the criteria, with the largest number of differentially expressed markers in PDAC (176), followed by chronic pancreatitis (55) and IPMN (3) (<bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>). Principal component analysis (PCA) of these markers showed control samples as a tight cluster segregated away from PDAC samples but closer to IPMN and chronic pancreatitis patients (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>To further assess the potential of cEV proteins for cancer detection, we compared proteomic profiles of cEVs between patients with PDAC with those with underlying benign diseases of the pancreas (chronic pancreatitis and IPMN). We identified 182 differentially expressed proteins in malignant cases (92 over-expressed and 90 with reduced expression) (<bold>Supplementary Table 5)</bold>. Several of those markers had remarkable overexpression in PDAC (greater than 10-fold), including PDCD6IP, SERPINA12, RUVBL2, among others, as shown in the volcano plot (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Unsupervised clustering showed a clear separation between PDAC and benign pancreatic diseases. Individuals with IPMN were more closely related to controls, whereas chronic pancreatitis cases were more related to PDAC (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). In addition, the PDAC cohort was separated into two subgroups: the first, enriched for early-stage tumors and more closely related to the other pancreatic diseases (chronic pancreatitis and IPMN); the second, enriched for advanced and metastatic cases with expression profiles further apart from early-stage cancer and pancreatic diseases (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). We further noticed that some proteins such as PDCD6IP, SERPINA12, KRT20 showed statistically significant population-wise enrichment in pancreatic cancer compared to benign pancreatic diseases (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Together, these data indicate the existence of a set of EV markers that can separate controls, benign and malignant pancreatic diseases, as well as proteins that separate early versus late-stage PDAC, suggesting their potential to serve as diagnostic biomarkers.</p>

<title>Functional and Systems Biology of cEV Proteome</title>
<p>To gain molecular insight into the functions of the previously identified 182 proteins differentially expressed in pancreatic cancer as compared to benign pancreatic diseases, we conducted pathway analysis using the Gene Ontology (GO) and REACTOME databases (<bold>Supplementary Table 5</bold>). We identified protein modules in protein localization, biomolecule binding/docking, peptidase activities among changes enriched in PDAC compared to benign diseases (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref></bold>). Interestingly, KRT20 (keratin 20), a gastrointestinal epithelia-associated keratin, was increased in PDAC patient EVs, while keratins associated basal cells, KRT4, KRT15, and KRT3, were reduced. KRT20 overexpression is frequently found in pancreatic tumor tissues and correlates with poor prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, suggesting a biological basis for their high levels in the cEVs of PDAC patients.</p>
<p>Interestingly, proteins associated with immunological functions showed complex regulation with increased representation of leukocyte mediated immunity (GO:0002443), leukocyte degranulation (GO:0043299), myeloid leukocyte activation (GO:0002274), and decrease in Fc receptor signaling (GO: 0038093), regulation of complement activation (GO:0030449), and immune effector process (GO:0002252) (<bold>Supplementary Table 5</bold>). These data suggest that direct profiling of cEVs from patient plasma provided unique insights into systemic changes in immune biology during pancreatic cancer development, which is lacked in analysis restricted to tissue or cell models.</p>

<title>Circulating EV Proteomics Reveal Markers Associated with Metastasis and Worse Prognosis</title>
<p>We then investigated whether cEV proteins can assist in the distinction of early versus late-stage pancreatic cancer. We compared the cEV proteome profiles of individuals with metastatic cancer to those without metastasis and identified 85 proteins differentially expressed between the two groups (<bold>Supplementary Table 6)</bold>. Supervised clustering between metastatic and non-metastatic diseases showed a clear separation with two distinct expression patterns (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). The majority of non-metastatic cases represented stages 1 and 2 diseases, with a minority representing locally advanced stage 3 disease. In particular, PSMB4, RUVBL2 and ANKAR (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>) EV protein levels were increased, whereas RAP2B, SERPINA12 and IGLV4-69 abundance levels were decreased in the cEVs of patients with metastatic disease (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). Together, these findings suggest the presence of a core set of cEV proteins with the potential to distinguish early versus metastatic pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>We further analyzed whether the expression of certain cEV proteins had prognostic relevance in our cohort. We first classified individuals with PDAC as having low or high expression of any given markers based on each marker’s first and third quartile. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan Meier method. We identified that the cEV expression of RALB, CRP, and CD55 had a significant correlation with worse survival, while PDCD6IP expression had a trend for improved outcomes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Validation of cEV Markers Using Parallel Reaction Monitoring and Identification an EV Protein Signature for Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis</title>
<p>Because pancreatic cancer is extremely heterogeneous, the chance of identifying a single biomarker with sufficient diagnostic performance is likely low. Instead, the identification of a panel of candidate markers may have enhanced diagnostic performance.</p>
<p>To identify a signature that shows the most discriminatory power between ‘benign diseases’ and ‘PDAC,’ we employed a binary classification approach using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Classification models, built based on a large number of proteins, contain irrelevant markers that can reduce the predictive accuracy. Hence, we implemented a consensus feature selection method based on two algorithms: one using recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm (SVM-RFE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and second, RFE combined with a non-parametric Wilcox rank test (sigFeature)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The top 16 markers were selected whose classification performance can be tested in the independent validation cohort (<bold>Supplementary Table 7</bold>). A summary of selection process is shown in <bold>Supplementary Figure 4</bold>. The classification performance of these 16 markers, individual and in all combinations, were tested using 80% training data and evaluated in the remaining 20% test data. The quality of training was assessed using five repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. The optimal kernel parameters were estimated by tuning over a wide range of values. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used as the metric to assess the performance of the classifier model. We found a set of 7-EV protein signature comprised of RUVBL2, PDCD6IP, ATP5F1, DLD, KRT20, CCT4, and SERPINAI2, that gave 100% accuracy when tested in the discovery cohort (<bold>Supplementary Table 7</bold>). Recurrence of these putative markers in our dataset varied from 55% to 97%.</p>
<p>The model was further validated on an independent validation cohort whose proteome was obtained using an alternate technology, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry. The markers chosen for validation included 16 markers selected for SVM classification model and an additional 9 markers to result in top 25 markers that are significantly differentially expressed in the discovery cohort with a fold change increase in PDAC ≥ 5.5 and p-value ≤0.01 (<bold>Methods</bold>, <bold>Supplementary Table 8</bold>). The independent validation cohort consisted of 36 new subjects (24 with PDAC, 6 with chronic pancreatitis, and 6 with IPMN) (<bold>Supplementary Table 9</bold>). A total of 10 proteins, including all 7 signature proteins, showed a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in patients with PDAC as compared to benign pancreatic diseases (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). The performance of individual validated markers according to the specific underlying disease in the validation cohort is presented in <bold>Supplementary Figure 5</bold>. The performance of 7-EV protein signature was further tested using SVM model, in our independent validation cohort, yielding an 89% prediction accuracy (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). As expected, we observed that no single marker achieved sufficiently high sensitivity and specificity as the combined model for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Extracellular vesicles hold a great promise as a source of potential biomarkers, making them attractive candidates for liquid biopsy tests. Previously, we reported that organoid cultures of pancreatic cancer could serve as models to discover tissue-derived EV proteins with high specificity for PDAC, as opposed to chronic pancreatitis and other benign gastrointestinal diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. A shortcoming of these tissue-based studies is the inability to discover markers associated to the systemic responses to cancer. Here, we performed a large-scale, comprehensive analysis of circulating EV proteomes directly from plasma samples of 124 patients, with subsequent validation in a separate cohort of 36 patients. To our knowledge, this represents the largest proteomics profiling dataset of circulating EVs conducted in pancreatic cancer to date. Using this dataset, we identified and validated new EV markers from plasma that distinguish patients with pancreatic cancer from subjects with benign pancreatic diseases. Furthermore, we discovered several cEV proteins associated with metastatic disease and poor prognosis. In contrast to the prior studies of experimental cell models or tissues extracts that were examined only against healthy subjects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, we report the identification of EV proteins in plasma of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with underlying pancreatic diseases, which is clinically relevant as many patients with pancreatic cancer have underlying chronic inflammation and premalignant cystic lesions.</p>
<p>In addition, our study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing the EVtrap method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> to process patient samples in large scale within a reasonable time frame, allowing the discovery of hundreds of EV proteins directly from a small volume (100uL) of plasma samples. This methodological advance can be adopted for biomarker discovery in other cancer types. Other workflows traditionally employed for EV isolation from blood samples require laborious techniques including lengthy ultracentrifugation steps which are unsuitable for large scale studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this dataset, we identified several EV proteins as significantly associated with metastasis or survival. For instance, PSMB4 and RUVBL2 levels were increased in cEVs of patients with metastatic PDAC. Notably, PSMB4 (proteasome subunit beta type-4), a protein of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, has been identified as the first proteasomal subunit with oncogenic properties and associated to poor prognosis in several tumors including melanoma, breast and ovarian cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We also discovered RALB, CRP and CD55 expression on EVs to have a significant correlation with poor survival, while PDCD6IP expression was associated with improved outcomes. Interestingly, PDCD6IP (programmed cell death 6-interacting protein), was also identified as a PDAC-enriched protein in the tissue-based proteomics studies from Le Large <italic>et.al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and Hoshino <italic>et.al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In line with our findings, tissue expression of PDCD6IP in liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer has been found to also correlate with improved prognosis in patients with PDAC in the study of Law <italic>et.al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Collectively, these data suggest that some tissue-specific proteins can be detected in circulating EVs and their quantifiable levels in the blood may have the potential to serve as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers in pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>In our validation studies, all seven putative markers identified from the model were significantly enriched in the plasma of PDAC patients. Based on the top seven markers, we derived a 7-EV protein panel that yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. A recent modeling study showed that a new diagnostic assay for PDAC would have to perform with a minimum sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 85% to reduce healthcare expenditure and prolong survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Serum CA19-9, the best-established blood test for PDAC, has a pooled sensitivity of 75.4% and a specificity of 77.6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. It commonly rises late in the disease and may be elevated in nonmalignant conditions such as biliary obstruction and pancreatitis, making it unsuitable as a diagnostic biomarker for PDAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. As such, our 7-EV protein signature with 89% prediction accuracy serves as a proof-of-concept and has the potential to facilitate the further development of biomarker tests for pancreatic cancer. We anticipate that for clinical use application, an even higher diagnostic performance is needed. Future studies are warranted to investigate if combining our validated cEV proteins with other biomarkers such as cell free DNA, serum proteins or metabolites, as a multi-analyte biomarker assay, would yield higher accuracy in diagnosing pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>While our work involved a large cohort with 160 patients, the single-center nature is an inherent limitation of our study. Also, it would be ideal to perform validation with a larger cohort of controls to achieve greater statistical power. To balance this limitation, we increased the rigor of our validation by selecting controls with underlying benign diseases of pancreas as opposed to healthy volunteers. Thus, the performance of our 7-EV protein PDAC panel should be cross validated in larger and multicenter populations.</p>
<p>With no major treatment breakthrough for pancreatic cancer in the last decade, every effort should be made to diagnose this deadly cancer at earlier stages and to discover new proteins involved in tumorigenesis. Our study provides a valuable open resource to the scientific community with a comprehensive catalog of novel proteins packaged inside circulating EVs that may assist in the development of novel biomarkers and improve the outcomes of patients with pancreatic cancer.</p>

<title>Study Design and Patient Demographics</title>
<p>We conducted this study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center with the approval of the Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board. All subjects provided written informed consent. Clinical data and blood samples were prospectively collected from 2017 to 2019 from patients with pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), and age-matched controls. A total of 124 patients, including PDAC (N=93), chronic pancreatitis of different etiologies (N=12), IPMN (N=8), and controls (N=11), were included in the discovery cohort. PDAC diagnosis was established by histology or cytology, and staging was performed according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer guidelines (8th Edition 2016)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>(<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>).

<title>Extracellular Vesicle Isolation from Plasma</title>
<p>We employed EVtrap for EV isolation from plasma samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.

Briefly, 100 μL plasma samples were diluted 20 times in the diluent buffer, the EVtrap beads were added to the samples in a 1:2 v/v ratio, and the samples were incubated by end-over-end rotation for 30 min according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After supernatant removal using a magnetic separator rack, the beads were washed with PBS, and the EVs were eluted by a 10 min incubation with 200 mM triethylamine (TEA, Millipore-Sigma). The samples were fully dried in a vacuum centrifuge.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Preparation of EV samples</title>
<p>The isolated and dried EV samples were lysed to extract proteins using the phase-transfer surfactant (PTS) aided procedure. The proteins were reduced and alkylated by incubation in 10 mM TCEP and 40 mM CAA for 10 min at 95°C. The samples were diluted fivefold with 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate and digested with Lys-C (Wako) at 1:100 (wt/wt) enzyme-to-protein ratio for 3 h at 37°C. Trypsin was added to a final 1:50 (wt/wt) enzyme-to-protein ratio for overnight digestion at 37°C. To remove the PTS surfactants from the samples, the samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 1% TFA, and ethyl acetate solution was added at a 1:1 ratio. The mixture was vortexed for 2 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min to obtain aqueous and organic phases. The organic phase (top layer) was removed, and the aqueous phase was collected. This step was repeated once more. The samples were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and desalted using Top-Tip C18 tips (Glygen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

<title>LC−MS Analysis of Plasma EV Proteome</title>
<p>Approximate 1 μg of each dried peptide sample was dissolved in 10.5 μL of 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid with 3% (vol/vol) acetonitrile containing spiked-in indexed Retention Time Standard containing 11 artificially synthetic peptides (Biognosys). The spiked-in 11-peptides standard mixture was used to account for any variation in retention times and to normalize abundance levels among samples. 10 μL of each sample was injected into an Ultimate 3000 nano UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were captured on a 2-cm Acclaim PepMap trap column and separated on a heated 50-cm Acclaim PepMap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing C18 resin. The mobile phase buffer consisted of 0.1% formic acid in ultrapure water (buffer A) with an eluting buffer of 0.1% formic acid in 80% (vol/vol) acetonitrile (buffer B) run with a linear 60-min gradient of 6–30% buffer B at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The UHPLC was coupled online with a Q-Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode, in which a full-scan MS (from m/z 375 to 1,500 with the resolution of 60,000) was followed by MS/MS of the 15 most intense ions (30,000 resolution; normalized collision energy − 28%; automatic gain control target (AGC) - 2E4, maximum injection time - 200 ms; 60sec exclusion).</p>

<title>EV Proteome Data Processing</title>
<p>The raw files were searched directly against the human Swiss-Prot database with no redundant entries using Byonic (Protein Metrics) and Sequest search engines loaded into Proteome Discoverer 2.3 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). MS1 precursor mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and MS2 tolerance was set at 20ppm. Search criteria included a static carbamidomethylation of cysteines (+57.0214 Da) and variable modifications of oxidation (+15.9949 Da) on methionine residues and acetylation (+42.011 Da) at the N terminus of proteins. The search was performed with full trypsin/P digestion and allowed a maximum of two missed cleavages on the peptides analyzed from the sequence database. The false-discovery rates of proteins and peptides were set at 0.01. All protein and peptide identifications were grouped, and any redundant entries were removed. Only unique peptides and unique master proteins were reported.</p>
<p>All data were quantified using the label-free quantitation node of Precursor Ions Quantifier through the Proteome Discoverer v2.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the quantification of proteomic data, the intensities of peptides were extracted with initial precursor mass tolerance set at 10 ppm, a minimum number of isotope peaks as 2, maximum ΔRT of isotope pattern multiplets – 0.2 min, PSM confidence FDR of 0.01, with hypothesis test of ANOVA, maximum RT shift of 5 min, pairwise ratio-based ratio calculation, and 100 as the maximum allowed fold change. The abundance levels of all peptides and proteins were normalized to the spiked-in internal iRT standard. For calculations of fold-change between the groups of proteins, total protein abundance values were added together, and the ratios of these sums were used to compare proteins within different samples.</p>
<p>The abundances of EV proteins were normalized using indexed retention time (iRT) in Proteome Discoverer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Abundances were categorized into four different categories: Control, Chronic Pancreatitis, IPMN, and PDAC.

<p>A non-parametric Wilcox Rank Sum test was performed to test the null hypothesis that the distributions of two groups of the patient population are the same, and the fold change and p-values for each protein were estimated for the following comparisons: IPMN vs. Control, CP vs. Control, PDAC vs. Control, Benign Pancreatic Diseases (CP, IPMN) vs. PDAC. Multiple testing correction was done using Benjamini-Hochberg method to control for the false discovery rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Volcano plots were created using those p values and fold change. Heatmaps visualization and clustering of statistically significant proteins, with adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and absolute fold change ≥ 2, were created in R using the pheatmap package.

<p>The authors analyze a comprehensive cohort of human plasma samples to identify an extracellular vesicles protein signature for earlier diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Application of liquid biopsies is <bold>valuable</bold>, and it addresses a significant clinical problem as pancreas cancer is often diagnosed in late stage with standard biopsies often nondiagnostic. The strength of evidence is largely <bold>solid</bold>; however, certain aspects of the data were deemed <bold>incomplete</bold>, given the broad manuscript claims. This work supports the use of extracellular vesicles in clinical settings, with potential interest to scientists and clinicians.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Bockorny, Muthuswamy, and Huang et al. performed proteomics analysis of plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients and patients with benign pancreatic diseases (chronic pancreatitis and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, IPMN) to develop a 7-EV protein signature that predicts PDAC. Moveover, the authors identified PSMB4, RUVBL2, and ANKAR as being associated with metastasis. These studies provide important insight into alterations of EVs during PDAC progression and the data supporting predict PDAC with EV protein signatures are solid. However, there are certain concerns regarding the rigor and novelty of the data analysis and interpretation, as well as the clinical implications, as detailed below.</p>
<p>1. Plasma EVs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis to confirm their morphology and size. The authors should also include an analysis of putative EV markers (e.g., tetraspanins, syntenin, ALIX, etc.) to confirm that the analyzed particles are EVs.</p>
<p>2. The authors identified multiple over-expressed proteins in PDAC based on their fold change and p-value; however, due to the heterogeneity of PDAC, it is necessary to show a heatmap displaying their abundance in all samples. High fold change does not necessarily indicate consistently high abundance in all PDAC samples.</p>
<p>3. PSMB4, RUVBL2, and ANKAR were identified as being associated with metastasis. The authors state that they intended to distinguish early and late-stage cancer samples, but it is unclear why they chose to compare metastatic and non-metastatic samples, as the non-metastatic group also includes late-stage cancer samples. This sentence should be rephrased to more accurately reflect the sample types profiled.</p>
<p>4. Non-metastatic and metastatic patients were separated based on global protein abundance. The samples within each group display significant heterogeneity with, some samples displaying similar patterns although they were classified into different groups (Figure 3A), and the samples within the same group, particularly the metastasis group, did not consistently exhibit similar patterns of protein abundance. The authors should clarify this point.</p>
<p>5. The authors performed the survival analysis on a set of EV proteins but did not specify the origin of these markers or how many markers were examined. The authors should show their abundances across different groups, such as different stages and metastasis status.</p>
<p>6. The classification model yielded a 100% accuracy, which may refer to AUC, in their discovery cohort, but it decreased to 89% in the independent cohort. This suggests that the authors have encountered overfitting issues with their model, where it performed well on the discovery cohort but did not generalize well to the independent cohort. The authors should clarify this point. The AUC score of the 7-EV signature is 0.89 and is not equivalent to prediction accuracy. In order to demonstrate prediction accuracy, the authors should show the confusion matrix of training and testing data as well as other evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.</p>
<p>7. The authors should include more details of their model and the process of selection of signatures to enhance the reproducibility and transparency of their methods.</p>

<p>The authors intended to identify a protein signature in extracellular vesicles of serum to distinguish pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from benign pancreatic diseases.</p>
<p>A major strength of the work presented is the valuable profiling of a significant number of patient samples, with a rich cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer, benign pancreatic diseases, and healthy controls. However, despite the strong cohorts presented, the numbers of patient samples for benign pancreatic diseases as well as controls were very limited.</p>
<p>Also, the method used to isolate vesicles, EVTrap, recognizes double bilayers, which means that it can detect cellular debris and apoptotic bodies, which are very common in the circulation of patients that are undergoing chemotherapy. It would be important to identify the patients that are therapy naïve and the ones that are not because of this possible bias. Additionally, the transmission electron microscopy data reflect this heterogeneity of the samples, also with little identification of double bilayered vesicles. It would be important to identify some extracellular vesicles markers in those preparations to strengthen the quality of the samples analysed. What is more, previously published work with this same methodology identifies around 2000 proteins per sample. It would be important to explain why in this study there seems to be a reduction in more than 50% of the amount of proteins identified in the vesicles.</p>
<p>One of the proteins that constantly surges on the analysis is KRT20. It would be important to proceed with the analysis by first filtering out possible contaminants of the proteomics, of which keratins are the most common ones. Finally, none of the 7-extracellular vesicle protein signatures has been validated by other techniques, such as western blot, in extracellular vesicles isolated by other, standard, methods, such as size exclusion chromatography.</p>
<p>A distinct technique for protein analysis was done but not a different method of isolation of these vesicles. This would strengthen the results and the origin of the proteins.</p>
<p>The conclusions that are reached do not fully meet the proposed aims of the identification of a protein signature in circulating extracellular vesicles that could improve early detection of the disease. The authors did not demonstrate the superiority of detection of these proteins in extracellular vesicles versus simply performing an ELISA, nor their superiority with respect to the current standard procedure for diagnosis.</p>
<p>The authors also suggest that profiling of circulating extracellular vesicles provides unique insights into systemic immune changes during pancreatic cancer development. How is this better than a regular hemogram is not clear.</p>
<p>Finally, it would be important to determine how this signature compares with many others described in the literature that have the exact same aim. Why and how would this one be better?</p>

<p>This work investigates the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in blood as a noninvasive 'liquid biopsy' to aid in the differentiation of patients with pancreatic cancer (PDAC) from those with benign pancreatic disease and healthy controls, an important clinical question where biopsies are frequently non-diagnostic. The use of extracellular vesicles as biomarkers of disease has been gaining interest in recent history, with a variety of published methods and techniques, looking at a variety of different compositions ('the molecular cargo') of EVs particularly in cancer diagnosis (Shah R, et al, N Engl J Med 2018; 379:958-966).</p>
<p>This study adds to the growing body of evidence in using EVs for earlier detection of pancreatic cancer, identifying both new and known proteins of interest. Limitations in studying EVs, in general, include dealing with low concentrations in circulation and identifying the most relevant molecular cargo. This study provides validation of assaying EVs using the novel EVtrap method (Extracellular Vesicles Total Recovery And Purification), which the authors show to be more efficient than current standard techniques and potentially more scalable for larger clinical studies.</p>
<p>The strength of this study is in its numbers - the authors worked with a cohort of 124 cases, 93 of them which were PDAC samples, which are considered large for an EV study (Jia, E et al. BMC Cancer 22, 573 (2022)). The benign disease group (n=20, between chronic pancreatitis and IPMNs) and healthy control groups (n=11) were relatively small, but the authors were not only able to identify candidate biomarkers for diagnosis that clearly stood out in the PDAC cohort, but also validate it in an independent cohort of 36 new subjects.</p>
<p>Proteins they have identified as associated with pancreatic cancer over benign disease included PDCD6IP, SERPINA12, and RUVBL2. They were even able to identify a set of EV proteins associated with metastasis and poorer prognosis, which include the proteins PSMB4, RUVBL2 and ANKAR and CRP, RALB and CD55. Their 7-EV protein signature yielded an 89% prediction accuracy for the diagnosis of PDAC against a background of benign pancreatic diseases that is compelling and comparable to other studies in the literature (Jia, E. et al. BMC Cancer 22, 573 (2022)).</p>
<p>The limitations of this study are its containment within a single institution - further studies are warranted to apply the authors' 7-EV protein PRAC panel to multiple other cases at other institutions in a larger cohort.</p>
