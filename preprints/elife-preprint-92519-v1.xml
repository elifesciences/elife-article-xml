<title>Abstract</title><p>Bone regeneration is mediated by skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs) that are mainly recruited from the periosteum after bone injury. The composition of the periosteum and the steps of SSPCs activation and differentiation remain poorly understood. Here, we generated a single-nuclei atlas of the periosteum at steady-state and of the fracture site during early stages of bone repair. We identified periosteal SSPCs expressing stemness markers (Pi16 and Ly6a/Sca1) and responding to fracture by adopting an injury-induced fibrogenic cell (IIFC) fate, prior to undergoing osteogenesis or chondrogenesis. We identified distinct gene cores associated with IIFCs and their engagement into osteogenesis and chondrogenesis involving Notch, Wnt and the circadian clock signaling respectively. Finally, we show that IIFCs are the main source of paracrine signals in the fracture environment, revealing a crucial paracrine role of this transient IIFC population during fracture healing. Overall, our study provides a complete temporal topography of the fracture healing stages and the dynamic response of periosteal SSPCs to injury, redefining our knowledge of bone regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The skeleton provides structural support and protection for internal organs in the vertebrate body. Bones can fracture, but regenerate themselves efficiently without scarring. Bone regeneration is mediated by the action of resident skeletal stem/progenitor cells (SSPCs) from periosteum and bone marrow, and SSPCs from skeletal muscle adjacent to the fracture site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. SSPCs are activated during the inflammatory phase of healing and differentiate into osteoblasts and/or chondrocytes to repair bone via a combination of intramembranous and endochondral ossification. During intramembranous ossification SSPCs differentiate directly into osteoblasts, while during endochondral ossification SSPCs first differentiate into chondrocytes to form an intermediate cartilage template subsequently replaced by bone.</p>
<p>The periosteum, an heterogenous tissue located on the outer surface of bones, is a crucial source of SSPCs during bone healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Periosteal SSPCs exhibit a high regenerative potential. They also display a unique osteochondrogenic potential after injury compared to bone marrow SSPCs that are mostly osteogenic and skeletal muscle SSPCs that are mostly chondrogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Periosteal SSPCs (pSSPCs) are still poorly characterized and the origin of their bipotentiality and response to bone injury remain elusive. Recent advances in single cell/nuclei transcriptomic analyses provided new insights in stem cell population heterogeneity and regeneration processes in many organs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, few studies have investigated bone fracture healing at the single cell level and these studies have focused on cultured cells or late stages of bone repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, a complete dataset of periosteum and bone regeneration is lacking and is essential to decipher the mechanisms of pSSPC activation and regulation. Here, we created a single-nuclei atlas of the uninjured periosteum and its response to bone fracture. We generated single-nuclei RNAseq (snRNAseq) datasets from the uninjured periosteum and from the periosteum and hematoma/callus at days 3, 5 and 7 post-tibial fracture. Our analyses thoroughly describe the heterogeneity of the periosteum at steady state and the steps of pSSPC activation and differentiation after injury. We show that pSSPC represent a single population that can provide osteoblasts and chondrocytes for bone repair by first generating a common injury-induced fibrogenic cell (IIFC) population that can then engage into osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. We identified the gene networks regulating pSSPC fate after injury and IIFCs as the main population producing paracrine factors mediating the initiation of bone healing.</p>

<title>Heterogeneity of the periosteum at steady state</title>
<p>To investigate the heterogeneity of the periosteum at steady-state, we performed snRNAseq of the periosteum of wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). After filtering, we obtained 1189 nuclei, corresponding to 8 cell populations: SSPC (expressing <italic>Pi16</italic>), fibroblasts (expressing <italic>Pdgfra</italic>), osteogenic cells (expressing <italic>Runx2</italic>), Schwann cells (expressing <italic>Mpz</italic>), pericytes/SMC (expressing <italic>Tagln</italic>), immune cells (expressing <italic>Ptprc</italic>), adipocytes (expressing <italic>Lpl</italic>), and endothelial cells (ECs, expressing <italic>Pecam1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>, Fig. S1). We performed in depth analyses of the SSPC, fibroblast and osteogenic cell populations.

<title>The fracture repair atlas</title>
<p>To investigate the periosteal response to bone fracture, we collected injured periosteum with hematoma or callus at days 3, 5 and 7 post-fracture, extracted the nuclei and processed them for snRNAseq (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We combined the datasets with the uninjured periosteum from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and obtained a total of 6213 nuclei after filtering. The combined dataset was composed of 25 clusters corresponding to 11 cell populations: SSPCs (expressing <italic>Pi16</italic>), injury-induced fibrogenic cells (IIFC, expressing <italic>Postn</italic>), osteoblasts (expressing <italic>Ibsp</italic>), chondrocytes (expressing <italic>Col2a1</italic>), osteoclasts (expressing <italic>Ctsk</italic>), immune cells (expressing <italic>Ptprc</italic>), Schwann cells (expressing <italic>Mpz</italic>), endothelial cells (expressing <italic>Pecam1</italic>), pericytes (expressing <italic>Rgs5</italic>), SMCs (expressing <italic>Tagln</italic>) and adipocytes (expressing <italic>Lpl</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>, Fig. S3A). Next, we observed the dynamics of the cell populations in response to bone fracture (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, Fig. S3B). After injury, the percentage of SSPCs was strongly decreased and the percentage of IIFCs progressively increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). The percentage of chondrocytes and osteoblasts increased from day 3 post-fracture. Immune cells were drastically increased at day 3 after injury, before progressively decreasing at days 5 and 7 post-fracture (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Spatial organization of the fracture callus</title>
<p>To evaluate the spatial distribution of the main cell populations identified in the snRNAseq data, we performed in situ immunofluorescence on day 3, 5 and 7 post-fracture hematoma/callus tissues. At day 3 post-fracture, we observed periosteal thickening and the formation of a fibrous hematoma (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We did not detect SPPCs at both sites, consistent with their absence in day 3 snRNAseq dataset compared to uninjured periosteum. POSTN+ IIFCs and immune cells were the main populations present in hematoma and activated periosteum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Few IIFCs in the activated periosteum expressed SOX9 and OSX and only the periosteum was vascularized. At days 5 and 7 post-fracture, the callus was formed mainly of fibrotic tissue, bone formed on the periosteal surface at the periphery of the callus and small cartilage islets were detected in the center of the callus near the periosteal surface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-F</xref>). The fibrotic tissue contained mostly IIFCs, as well as immune and endothelial cells. We also observed SOX9+ and OSX+ cells in the fibrotic tissue, while the cartilage was solely composed of SOX9+ chondrocytes. OSX+ osteoblasts were the main cell population detected in the new bone at the periosteal surface. We also observed a progressive reduction of POSTN+ cells and immune cells from day 5 to 7 and increased vascularization in the newly formed bone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-F</xref>).</p>

<title>Periosteal SSPCs differentiate via an injury-induced fibrogenic stage</title>
<p>To understand the differentiation and fate of pSSPCs after fracture, we analyzed the subset of SSPC, IIFC, chondrocyte and osteoblast clusters from the combined fracture dataset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We performed pseudotime analyses to determine the differentiation trajectories, defining the starting point in the pSSPC population, where the uninjured and undifferentiated cells cluster. We identified that pSSPC differentiate in 3 stages starting from the pSSPC population (expressing <italic>Ly6a</italic>, <italic>Pi16</italic> and <italic>Cd34</italic>), predominant in uninjured dataset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-C</xref>). Periosteal SSPCs then transition through an injury-induced fibrogenic stage predominant at days 3 and 5 post-injury. In this intermediate fibrogenic stage, pSSPC-derived cells express high levels of extracellular matrix genes, such as <italic>Postn</italic>, <italic>Aspn</italic> and <italic>Tnc</italic>. Later, injury-induced fibrogenic cells (IIFCs) differentiate into chondrocytes (expressing <italic>Acan</italic>, <italic>Col2a1</italic> and <italic>Sox9</italic>) or osteoblasts (expressing <italic>Sp7</italic>, <italic>Alpl</italic> and <italic>Ibsp</italic>), both predominant at days 5 and 7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-C</xref>, Table S1). These results show that pSSPCs respond to fracture via an injury-induced fibrogenic stage common to chondrogenesis and osteogenesis and independent of their final fate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). To visualize the transition of IIFCs towards chondrocytes and osteoblasts in the fracture callus, we performed co-immunofluorescence on day 5 post-fracture hematoma/callus. We observed a progressive increase in SOX9 and OSX signals in IIFCs at the fibrosis-to-cartilage and fibrosis-to-bone transition zones respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). To functionally validate the steps of pSSPC activation, we isolated SCA1+ GFP+ pSSPCs from <italic>Prx1<sup>Cre</sup>; R26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> mice and grafted them at the fracture site of wild type hosts. We observed that grafted GFP+ pSSPCs formed POSTN+ IIFCs at day 5 post-fracture (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Then, we isolated GFP+ IIFCs from the fracture callus of <italic>Prx1<sup>Cre</sup>; R26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> mice at day 3 post fracture and grafted the GFP+ IIFCs at the fracture site of wild type hosts. We showed that grafted cells formed bone and cartilage at day 14 post-fracture. These results confirmed that pSSPCs first become IIFCs that differentiate into osteoblasts and chondrocytes.</p>

<title>Characterization of injury-activated fibrogenic cells</title>
<p>We performed in depth analyses of the newly identified IIFC population. Gene ontology (GO) analyses of upregulated genes in IIFCs (clusters 2 to 6) showed enrichment in GOs related to tissue development, extracellular matrix (ECM), and ossification (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).

We also identified GO terms related to cell signaling, migration, differentiation, and proliferation, indicating that this step corresponds to an injury-induced activation. To further understand the mechanisms regulating SSPC activation and fate after injury, we performed gene regulatory network (GRN) analyses on the subset of SSPCs, IIFCs, osteoblasts and chondrocytes using SCENIC package (Single Cell rEgulatory Network Inference and Clustering)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We identified 280 activated regulons (transcription factor/TF and their target genes) in the subset dataset. We performed GRN-based tSNE clustering and identified SSPC, IIFC, chondrocyte and osteoblast populations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>, Fig. S4A). Fibroblasts from uninjured periosteum (<italic>Hsd11b1<sup>+</sup>, Cldn1<sup>+</sup></italic>and <italic>Luzp2<sup>+</sup></italic> cells) clustered separately from the other population, indicating the absence of their contribution to bone healing. Analysis of the number of activated regulons per cell indicated that SSPCs are the most stable cell population (higher number of activated regulons), while IIFCs are the less stable population, confirming their transient state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). We then investigated cell population specific regulons. SSPCs showed activated regulons linked to stemness, including Hoxa10 (16g), Klf4 (346g), Pitx1 (10g), and Mta3 (228g) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and immune response, including Stat6 (30g), Fiz1 (72g) and Stat5b (18g)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Osteoblasts and chondrocytes display cell specific activated regulons including Sp7 (18g) and Sox9 (77g) respectively. We identified 21 regulons that we named fibro-core and that were upregulated specifically in the IIFC population (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F-I</xref>, Table S2). Several fibro-core regulons, such as Meis1 (1556g), Pbx1 (11g), Six1 (20g), and Pbx3 (188g) are known to be involved in cell differentiation during tissue development and repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.

<title>Distinct gene cores regulate the engagement of IIFCs into chondrogenesis and osteogenesis</title>
<p>We sought to identify the drivers of the transition of IIFCs to chondrocytes or osteoblasts. We identified 2 cores of regulons involved in chondrogenic differentiation. Chondro-core 1 is composed of 9 regulons specific to the transition of IIFC to chondrocytes, including Maf (17g), Arntl (1198g), and Nfatc2 (37g) and chondro-core 2, composed of 14 regulons specific to differentiated chondrocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>, Fig. S4B). Chondro-core 1 regulons are known to be regulators of the circadian clock (Npas2, Arntl) or of the T/B-cell receptor cellular response (Bach2, Nfact2, Nfkb1). STRING network analysis showed that TFs from the chondro-core 1 are interacting between each other and are at the center of the interactions between the chondro-core 2 TFs, including Sox9, Trp53 and Mef2c (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>, Fig S4C). We observed that chondro-core 1 is only transiently activated when IIFCs are engaging into chondrogenesis and precedes the activation of chondro-core 2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C-D</xref>). Chondro-core 1 activity was high in early differentiated chondrocytes (low <italic>Acan</italic> expression) and progressively reduced as chondrocytes undergo differentiation, while chondro-core 2 activity was gradually increased as chondrocytes differentiate (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). This suggests that transient activation of the chondro-core 1 allows the transition of IIFCs into chondrocytes. Then, we investigated the osteogenic commitment of IIFCs. We identified 8 regulons forming the osteo-core and activated in IIFCs transitioning to osteoblasts, such as Tcf7 (23g), Bcl11b (14g), and Tbx2 (36g) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>, Fig. S4D). STRING network analysis showed that the genes with the strongest interaction with the osteo-core TFs are mostly related to Wnt signaling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). This reveals the role of Wnt signaling in this transition from early fibrogenic activation of pSSPCs to osteogenic differentiation during bone repair. We calculated the osteo-core activity, and observed that it is gradually increased and maintained in osteogenic cells, showing that the osteo-core is required for the transition and maturation of IIFC into osteoblasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G-H</xref>). Overall, we identified distinct cores of regulons with distinct dynamics driving the transition of IIFCs into chondrocytes and osteoblasts.</p>

<title>IIFCs mediate paracrine interactions during bone repair</title>
<p>Paracrine cell interactions are crucial drivers of tissue regeneration and stem cell activation. To identify key cell interactions during bone repair, we performed cell interaction analyses using CellChat package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. We observed that IIFCs are the predominant source of outgoing signals during bone repair, and are also important receivers of signals, highlighting their central role in mediating cell interactions after fracture (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A-B</xref>). Endothelial cells were mostly receiving signaling, while chondrocytes, osteoblasts and most immune cells exhibited reduced interactions with the other cell types in the fracture environment. IIFCs interact with all cell populations in the fracture environment, but the strongest interactions were with SSPCs and IIFCs (Fig. S5A). CellChat analyses of the subset of SSPCs, IIFCs, osteoblasts and chondrocytes confirmed that IIFCs are the major source and receiver population of paracrine signalings after fracture (Fig. S5B). We then analyzed the main secreted factors from IIFCs. IIFCs secreted periostin (<italic>Postn</italic>), BMPs (<italic>Bmp5</italic>), pleiotropin/PTN (<italic>Ptn</italic>), TGFβs (<italic>Tgfb2</italic>, <italic>Tgfb3</italic>), PDGFs (<italic>Pdgfc</italic>, <italic>Pdgfd</italic>) and angiopoietin-likes/ANGPTLs (<italic>Angplt2, Angplt4</italic>) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C-D</xref>, Fig. S5C). We observed differences in the dynamics of these factors, as some of them peak at day 3 post-fracture such as TGFβ, while others peak at day 5 such as BMP, POSTN, PTN and ANGPLT (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). We assessed the dynamics of ligand and receptor expression and observed that ligand expression was specific of the IIFC phase and of the fracture response (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F</xref>). Receptor expression was high in both SSPCs and IIFCs, and receptors were expressed from steady state, suggesting that SSPCs can receive signals from IIFCs. Analysis of SSPC incoming signals confirmed that IIFCs are the major source of paracrine factors for SSPCs (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>), indicating that they contribute to SSPC recruitment after fracture.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The periosteum is the main driver of bone regeneration. Yet the periosteum composition and its response to bone fracture are poorly described. Here, we used single-nuclei transcriptomics to understand the heterogeneity of the periosteum at steady state and the changes occurring within periosteum after bone fracture. We developed a protocol to extract nuclei from freshly dissected periosteum, allowing to capture their intact transcriptomic profile without enzymatic digestion-induced stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, we performed snRNAseq without sorting specific populations, allowing the identification of all cell types located in the periosteum and the fracture environment from the early stages of repair. Our study provides the first complete fracture repair atlas, a key tool to understand bone regeneration.</p>
<p>First, we described the heterogeneity of the periosteum at steady state. While previous studies performed scRNAseq on sorted periosteal cell populations, our dataset uncovers the diversity of cell populations within the periosteum. We describe fibroblast populations, as well as tissue resident immune cells, adipocytes, and blood vessel/nerve-related cells. We identified one SSPC population of undifferentiated cells expressing markers such as Sca1, <italic>Dpp4</italic> and <italic>Pi16,</italic> known to mark fibroblasts with stemness potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. No markers previously described such as <italic>Ctsk</italic>, or <italic>Gli1</italic> were fully specific of one cell cluster and of the undifferentiated SSPC population, suggesting that these markers may label heterogenous cell populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>After fracture, the composition of the periosteum changes drastically, with the appearance of IIFC and immune cells from day 3 post-fracture, and of chondrocytes and osteoblasts from day 5 post-fracture. Previous studies based on in vitro analyses and in vivo lineage tracing demonstrated that the periosteum displays the unique potential to form both bone and cartilage after fracture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Yet, it was still unknown if the periosteum contains a bipotent SSPC population or several SSPC populations with distinct potentials after injury. Here, we show that pSSPCs activate and form bone and cartilage via a single trajectory emerging from Sca1+ SSPCs. Periosteal Sca1+ SSPCs become IIFCs, a state marked by a decreased expression of stemness markers and a strong expression of extracellular matrix genes, such as <italic>Postn</italic> and <italic>Aspn</italic> and activation of Notch-related TFs. Thus, bone injury does not induce an expansion of Sca1+ SSPCs, rather a transition toward IIFCs that progressively expand and represent the main cell population within the fracture callus until day 7 post-fracture. Following this unique fibrogenic step, IIFCs undergo either osteogenesis or chondrogenesis. This newly identified transient IIFC state represents the crossroad of bone regeneration and SSPC differentiation.</p>
<p>GRN analyses identified TFs regulating SSPC response to fracture. We found that Notch signaling was specific to the injury-induced fibrogenic phase. Previous studies reported the role of Notch and Wnt in osteogenesis, and their temporal separation during intramembranous ossification <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Our results show that Notch/Wnt activation after fracture correlates with the successive stages of pSSPC fibrogenic and osteogenic differentiation. However, we discover that Wnt is only upregulated in IIFCs engaging into osteogenesis, while Notch is activated early in IIFCs prior to their commitment to osteogenesis or chondrogenesis. In addition, we identified a chondro-core of 9 regulons transiently activated when IIFCs engage into chondrogenesis. Among these regulons, several are involved in the autonomous circadian clock, including <italic>Npas2</italic> and <italic>Arntl</italic> (Bmal1). Bmal1 was previously shown to be a regulator of cartilage differentiation in bone development and homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Bmal1 inactivation leads to chondrocyte apoptosis and disruption of signaling involved in cartilage formation, including TGFβ, Ihh, HIF1α and NFAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. This suggests a role of the circadian clock genes as key regulators of chondrogenesis during bone repair. IIFCs are also crucial regulators of the fracture paracrine environment. IIFCs secrete factors including BMPs, PDGFs, TGFβs, and POSTN, known to be required for successful bone healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. These signals allow IIFCs to interact with all cell types in the fracture environment, but primarily with SSPCs and others IIFCs. Thus, IIFCs are contributing to the recruitment of SSPCs and promoting their own maturation and differentiation.</p>
<p>Overall, our study provides a complete dataset of the early steps of bone regeneration. The newly identified SSPC activation pattern shows the importance of the temporal dynamic of cell phenotypes and signaling pathways after injury. IIFCs appear as a transient cell population that plays essential roles in the initial steps of bone repair. Deeper understanding of IIFC regulation will be crucial as they represent the ideal target to enhance bone healing and potentially treat bone repair defects.</p>

<p>Mouse samples were processed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Tibias were collected and fixed in 4% PFA (sc-281692, CliniSciences) for 4 hours at 4°C. Then, samples were decalcified in 19% EDTA for 10 days (EU00084, Euromedex), cryoprotected in 30% sucrose (200-301-B, Euromedex) for 24h and embedded in OCT. Samples were sectioned in 10µm thick sections. Cryosections were defrosted and rehydrated in PBS. For Safranin-O staining, sections were stained with Weigert’s solution for 5 min, rinsed in running tap water for 3 min and stained with 0.02% Fast Green for 30 seconds (F7252, Merck), followed by 1% acetic acid for 30 seconds and Safranin’O solution for 45 min (S2255, Merck). For immunofluorescence, sections were incubated 1 hour at room temperature in 5% serum, 0.25% Triton PBS before incubation overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: Rat monoclonal to mouse Sca1 (740450, BD Biosciences), Rabbit monoclonal to mouse SOX9 (ab185230, Abcam), Rabbit polyclonal to mouse Osterix/Sp7 (ab22552, Abcam), Goat polyclonal to mouse Periostin (AF2955, R&amp;D Systems), Goat polyclonal to mouse PECAM1 (AF3628, Biotechne), Rat monoclonal to mouse CD45 (552848, BD Bioscience). Secondary antibody incubation was performed at room temperature for 1 hour. Slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G mounting medium with DAPI (00-4959-52, Life Technologies).</p>

<title>Periosteal SSPC isolation</title>
<p>To isolate periosteal cells, uninjured tibias from <italic>Prx1<sup>Cre</sup>; R26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> mice were collected and all surrounding soft tissues were carefully removed. Epiphyses were embedded in low melting agarose and tibias were placed for 30 min at 37°C in digestion medium composed of PBS with 3mg/ml of Collagenase B (C6885, Merck), 4mg/ml of Dispase (D4693, Merck) and 100U/mL of DNAse I (WOLS02007, Serlabo, France). After digestion, tibias were removed and the suspension was filtered, centrifuged and resuspend.</p>

<title>Injury-induced fibrogenic cell isolation</title>
<p>The fracture hematoma and the activated periosteum were collected from <italic>Prx1<sup>Cre</sup>; R26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic> mice 3 days post-fracture. Tissues were minced and digested at 37°C for 2 hours in DMEM (21063029, Life Technologies) with 1% Trypsin (15090046, Life Technologies) and 1% collagenase D (11088866001, Roche). Cells in suspension were removed every 20 min and digestion medium was replaced. After 2 hours, the cell suspension was filtered, centrifuged and resuspended.</p>

<title>Cell sorting and transplantation</title>
<p>Digested cells were incubated 30 minutes with anti-Sca1-BV650 (BD Biosciences, 740450) or anti-CD146-BV605 (BD Biosciences, 740636). Cells were sorted using Influx Cell Sorter. Prior sorting, Sytox Blue (S34857, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to stain dead cells. For pSSPCs, living single GFP+ Sca1+ cells were sorted. For IIFCs, living single GFP+ CD146-cells were sorted. Cell transplantation was performed as described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. 30000 to 45000 sorted GFP+ cells were embedded in Tisseel Prima fibrin gel, composed of fibrinogen and thrombin (3400894252443, Baxter S.A.S, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the cells were resuspended in 15 μL of fibrin (diluted at 1/4), before adding 15 μL of thrombin (diluted at 1/4) and mixing. The pellet was then placed on ice at least 15 min for polymerization. The cell pellet was transplanted at the fracture site of wild type mice at the time of fracture.</p>

<p>This study delineates an important set of uninjured and injured periosteal snRNAseq data that provides an overview of periosteal cell responses to fracture healing. The authors also took additional steps to validate some of the findings using immunohistochemistry and transplantation assays. This study will provide a valuable publicly accessible dataset to reexamine the expression of the reported periosteal stem and progenitor cell markers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. This is the first single-nuclei atlas of periosteal cells that are obtained without enzymatic cell dissociation or targeted cell purification by FACS. This integrated snRNAseq dataset will provide additional opportunities for the community to revisit the expression of many periosteal cell markers that have been reported to date.</p>
<p>2. The authors delved further into the dataset using cutting-edge algorithms, including CytoTrace, SCENIC, Monocle, STRING, and CellChat, to define the potential roles of identified cell populations in the context of fracture healing. These additional computation analyses generate many new hypotheses regarding periosteal cell reactions.</p>
<p>3. The authors also sought to validate some of the computational findings using immunohistochemistry and transplantation assays to support the conclusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. The current snRNAseq datasets contain only a small number of nuclei (1,189 nuclei at day 0, 6,213 nuclei on day 0-7 combined). It is unclear if the number is sufficient to discern subtle biological processes such as stem cell differentiation.</p>
<p>2. The authors' designation of Sca1+CD34+ cells as SSPCs is not sufficiently supported by experimental evidence. It will be essential to demonstrate stem/progenitor properties of Sca1+CD34+ cells using independent biological approaches such as CFU-F assays. In addition, the putative lineage trajectory of SSPCs toward IIFCs, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes remains highly speculative without concrete supporting data.</p>
<p>3. The designation of POSTN+ clusters as injury-induced fibrogenic cells (IIFCs) is not fully supported by the presented data. The authors' snRNAseq datasets (Figure 1d) demonstrate that there are many POSTN+ cells prior to injury, indicating that POSTN+ cells are not specifically induced in response to injury. It has been widely recognized that POSTN is expressed in the periosteum without fracture. This raises a possibility that the main responder of fracture healing is POSTN+ cells, not SSPCs as they postulate. The authors cannot exclude the possibility that Sca1+CD34+ cells are mere bystanders and do not participate in fracture healing.</p>
<p>4. Detailed spatial organization of Sca1+CD34+ cells and POSTN+ cells in the uninjured periosteum with respect to the cambium layer and the fibrous layer is not demonstrated.</p>
<p>5. Interpretation of transplantation experiments in Figure 5 is not straightforward, as the authors did not demonstrate the purity of Prx1Cre-GFP+SCA1+ cells and Prx1Cre-GFP+CD146- cells to pSSPCs and IIFCs, respectively. It is possible that these populations contain much broader cell types beyond SSPCs or IIFCs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors described cell type mapping was conducted for both WT and fracture types. Through this, unique cell populations specific to fracture conditions were identified. To determine these, the most undifferentiated cells were initially targeted using stemness-related markers and CytoTrace scoring. This led to the identification of SSPC differentiating into fibroblasts. It was observed that the fibroblast cell type significantly increased under fracture conditions, followed by subsequent increases in chondrocytes and osteoblasts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study presented the injury-induced fibrogenic cell (IIFC) as a characteristic cell type appearing in the bone regeneration process and proposed that the IIFC is a progenitor undergoing osteochondrogenic differentiation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
This study endeavored to elucidate the role of IIFC through snRNAseq analysis and in vivo observation. However, such validation alone is insufficient to confirm that IIFC is an osteochondrogenic progenitor, and additional data presentation is required.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors explored the transcriptional heterogeneity of the periosteum with single nuclei RNA sequencing. Without prior enrichment of specific populations, this dataset serves as an unbiased representation of the cellular components potentially relevant to bone regeneration. By describing single-cell cluster profiles, the authors characterized over 10 different populations in combined steady state and post-fracture periosteum, including stem cells (SSPC), fibroblast, osteoblast, chondrocyte, immune cells, and so on. Specifically, a developmental trajectory was computationally inferred using the continuum of gene expression to connect SSPC, injury-induced fibrogenic cells (IIFC), chondrocyte, and osteoblast, showcasing the bipotentials of periosteal SSPCs during injury repair. Additional computational pipelines were performed to describe the possible gene regulatory network and the expected pathways involved in bone regeneration. Overall, the authors provided valuable insights into the cell state transitions during bone repair and proposed sets of genes with possible involvements in injury response.</p>
<p>While the highlights of the manuscript are the unbiased characterization of periosteal composition, and the trajectory of SSPC response in bone fracture response, many of the conclusions can be more strongly supported with additional clarifications or extensions of the analysis.</p>
<p>1. As described in the method section, both the steady-state data and full dataset underwent integration before dimensional reduction and clustering. It would be appreciated if the authors could compare the post-integration landscapes of uninjured cells between steady state and full dataset analysis. Specifically, fibroblasts were shown in Figure 1C and 1E, and such annotations did not exist in Figure 2B. Will it be possible that the original 'fibroblasts' were part of the IIFC population?</p>
<p>2. According to Figure 2, immune cells were taking a significant abundance within the dataset, specifically during days 3 &amp; 5 post-fracture. It will be interesting to see the potential roles that immune cells play during bone repair. For example, what are the biological annotations of the immune clusters (B, T, NK, myeloid cells)? Are there any inflammatory genes or related signals unregulated in these immune cells? Do they interact with SSPC or IIFC during the transition?</p>
<p>3. The conclusion of Notch and Wnt signaling in IIFC transition was not sufficiently supported by the analysis presented in the manuscript, which was based on computational inferences. It will be great to add in references supporting these claims or provide experimental validations examining selected members of these pathways.</p>
