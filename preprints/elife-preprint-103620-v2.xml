<title>Abstract</title><p>Genetic variants in <italic>TRIO</italic> are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. TRIO uses its two guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains to activate GTPases (GEF1: Rac1 and RhoG; GEF2: RhoA) that control neuronal development and connectivity. It remains unclear how discrete <italic>TRIO</italic> variants differentially impact these neurodevelopmental events. Here, we investigate how heterozygosity for NDD-associated <italic>Trio</italic> variants â <italic>+/K1431M</italic> (ASD), <italic>+/K1918X</italic> (SCZ), and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> (bipolar disorder, BPD) â impact mouse behavior, brain development, and synapse structure and function. Heterozygosity for different <italic>Trio</italic> variants impacts motor, social, and cognitive behaviors in distinct ways that model clinical phenotypes in humans. <italic>Trio</italic> variants differentially impact head and brain size, with corresponding changes in dendritic arbors of motor cortex layer 5 pyramidal neurons (M1 L5 PNs). Although neuronal structure was only modestly altered in the <italic>Trio</italic> variant heterozygotes, we observe significant changes in synaptic function and plasticity. We also identified distinct changes in glutamate synaptic release in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> cortico-cortical synapses. The TRIO K1431M GEF1 domain has impaired ability to promote GTP exchange on Rac1, but <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice exhibit increased Rac1 activity, associated with increased levels of the Rac1 GEF Tiam1. Acute Rac1 inhibition with NSC23766 rescued glutamate release deficits in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> variant cortex. Our work reveals that discrete NDD-associated <italic>Trio</italic> variants yield overlapping but distinct phenotypes in mice, demonstrates an essential role for Trio in presynaptic glutamate release, and underscores the importance of studying the impact of variant heterozygosity in vivo.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>This version addresses the eLife Assessment by Reviewers and Editors:
We thank the editors and revivers for highlighting the significance of our findings regarding the effects of Trio variant heterozygosity in mice. We acknowledge the feedback concerning the experimental flow and agree that clarity is paramount. To address these concerns:
1.Connections between variables: The word limit of the initial submission constrained our ability to provide adequate details and connections between variables. We have revised the manuscript to explicitly outline and extend explanations and the relationships between sex, age, behavior, brain regions, and synaptic measures, ensuring that the rationale for each experiment and its relevance to the overall conclusions are improved.
2.Methodological details: The Methods section of our initial submission was condensed, with key details provided in the Supplemental Methods section. We have merged all into an extended section to improve clarity. We have expanded our description of breeding strategies, test timelines, electrophysiological protocols, and data analysis methods in the revised Methods section. We believe the additions have enhanced the transparency and reproducibility of our study and ensured full support of our conclusions.
3.Experimental flow: We have revised and extended our results, methods, and discussion sections to clarify the rationale and experimental design to guide readers through the experimental sequence and rationale.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental delay (DD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BPD), disrupt brain development and function. NDDs share considerable comorbidities and present with overlapping symptoms, including impairments in cognition, behavior, language, social and motor skills, emotions, and learning ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In addition, NDDs share many risk genes, further suggesting shared mechanistic underpinnings and pathology for these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). A major challenge remains in understanding how diverse risk-conferring variants contribute to the pathophysiology of various NDDs.</p>
<p><italic>TRIO</italic> encodes a large cytoskeletal regulatory protein with two guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains for Rho family GTPases - GEF1 activates Rac1 and RhoG, while GEF2 activates RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). TRIO relays signals from cell surface receptors, acting on GTPases to coordinate cytoskeletal rearrangements critical for proper neurodevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). <italic>Trio</italic> knockout mice exhibit decreased survival, skeletal muscle defects, and severe defects in brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Selective ablation of <italic>Trio</italic> in either excitatory or inhibitory neurons alters their morphology, impairs synaptic signaling, and yields NDD-related behavioral defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Trio deficiency also leads to aberrations in long-term potentiation (LTP), as Trio-Rac1 signaling promotes AMPA receptor trafficking to increase synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>
<p>Damaging <italic>de novo</italic> mutations and ultra-rare variants in <italic>TRIO</italic> are enriched in individuals with NDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Interestingly, nonsense variants spread throughout <italic>TRIO</italic> are enriched in individuals with SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), whereas pathogenic missense <italic>TRIO</italic> variants in or surrounding the GEF1 domain are associated with ASD/ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Variants in the TRIO GEF1 domain that decrease Rac1 activity are associated with milder ID and microcephaly, whereas variants in the adjacent spectrin repeat 8 domain that increase Rac1 activity are associated with more severe ID and macrocephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Rare missense variants in <italic>TRIO</italic> have also been observed in BPD, epilepsy, and other disorders, but studies to date are underpowered to establish a causal link with these disorders. Given the wide spectrum of <italic>TRIO</italic> variants associated with different pathological conditions, a fundamental and unresolved question is the mechanisms by which distinct <italic>TRIO</italic> variants differentially impact normal mammalian brain development and function. NDD-associated <italic>TRIO</italic> variants affect in vitro GEF1 and GEF2 activities, cell morphology, inhibitory neuron maturation, axon guidance, and synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>); however, the impact of heterozygosity for distinct <italic>TRIO</italic> variants in vivo, as found in individuals with NDDs, has been unexplored.</p>
<p>We report here the comprehensive analysis of mice heterozygous for discrete <italic>Trio</italic> variants impacting Trio functional domains and associated with different NDDs: <italic>+/K1431M</italic> in the Trio GEF1 domain associated with ASD, <italic>+/K1918X</italic> leading to nonsense decay associated with SCZ, and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> in the Trio GEF2 domain, a de novo mutation found in an individual with BPD that impacts GEF2 activity. We show that these distinct <italic>Trio</italic> NDD-associated variants differentially impair mouse behavior, brain development, and inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission. We show, for the first time, that <italic>Trio</italic> variants that impact GEF1 and GEF2 activity differentially impact presynaptic neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle replenishment. In addition, we found that while the K1431M mutation impairs Trio GEF1 activation of Rac1 in vitro, <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice exhibit increased levels of active Rac1. This was associated with increased levels of the Rac1 GEF Tiam1, and acute Rac1 inhibition with NSC23766 rescued glutamate release deficits in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> variant cortex. Together, our data show how discrete heterozygous <italic>TRIO</italic> variants that differentially impact Trio biochemical activities yield divergent effects on behavior, neurodevelopment, and synaptic transmission.</p>

<title>Animal work</title>
<p>All animal work was performed in compliance with federal guidelines and approved by the Yale Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All mice were maintained on a C57Bl/6 background and housed on a standard 12-hour light/dark cycle. Mice heterozygous for <italic>Trio</italic> variants <italic>K1431M</italic> (<italic>Trio<sup>+/K1431M</sup></italic>), <italic>K1918X</italic> (<italic>Trio<sup>+/K1918X</sup></italic>), or <italic>M2145T</italic> (<italic>Trio<sup>+/M2145T</sup></italic>) were crossed with WT (<italic>Trio<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) mice to produce heterozygous <italic>Trio</italic> variant and WT littermates used in all experiments. As the mice were maintained on the same genetic background, analyses of WT mice were pooled and considered one genotype, irrespective of parental <italic>Trio</italic> variant genotype. Age-matched mice of both sexes were used for behavioral experiments and for brain and body weight measurements. Only male mice were used for electrophysiological and neuroanatomical analyses to reduce potential variation in dendritic spines and activity due to estrus cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Trio</italic> mutant mice</title>
<p>Mice heterozygous for <italic>Trio</italic> variants <italic>K1431M</italic>, <italic>K1918X</italic>, or <italic>M2145T</italic> were generated via CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Potential Cas9 target guide (protospacer) sequences in the vicinity of the <italic>Trio K1431</italic>, <italic>K1918</italic>, and <italic>M2145</italic> codons were screened using the online tool CRISPOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) and candidates were selected. Templates for sgRNA synthesis were generated by PCR from a pX330 template (Addgene), sgRNAs were transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> and purified (Megashortscript, MegaClear; ThermoFisher). sgRNA/Cas9 RNPs were complexed and tested for activity by zygote electroporation, incubation of embryos to blastocyst stage, and genotype scoring of indel creation at the target sites. sgRNAs that demonstrated the highest activity were selected for creating the knock-in alleles. Guide primers for generating the template for transcription included a 5â T7 promoter and a 3â sgRNA scaffold sequence and were as follows (protospacer sequence capitalized):</p>

<p>Recombination template oligos (Integrated DNA Technologies, San Diego CA) were designed to create the desired codon changes, with incorporation of silent mutations to destroy the PAM and prevent sgRNA recognition of the newly created alleles as well as create a new restriction site for genotyping. sgRNA/Cas9 RNP and the template oligo were electroporated into C57Bl/6J (JAX) zygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Embryos were transferred to the oviducts of pseudopregnant CD-1 foster females using standard techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Genotype screening of tissue biopsies from founder pups was performed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing to identify the desired base changes, followed by backcrossing to C57Bl/6 mice and sequence confirmation to establish germline transmission of the correctly targeted alleles. Recombination template oligos were as follows (silent mutations bolded and italicized; new restriction digest site underlined):</p>

Slices were recovered in ACSF (in mM): 120 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 1.3 MgSO4, 1.6 CaCl2, 11 glucose, 2 ascorbic acid, 4 Na-lactic acid, 2 Na-pyruvate saturated with 95% O2-5% O2 at 300-320 mOsmol/L, pH 7.4, at 32Â°C for 20 min followed by 1 h recovery and recordings at RT. Recorded signals were acquired at 100 kHz sampling rate and low pass filtered at 6 kHz. Cells were excluded from analysis if series resistance changed &gt;20%.</p>
<p>Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked (e) by a tungsten bipolar stimulating electrode placed in M1 L2/3 with stimulus intensities that yielded 40%-50% of the maximal response. AMPAR-eEPSC amplitudes were measured at the peak of the EPSC recorded at -70 mV holding potential. NMDAR-eEPSC amplitudes were recorded from the same neurons at +40 mV and measured at 40 ms after the stimulus artifact when AMPAR-eEPSCs have decayed.</p>
<p>Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were recorded in whole-cell patch mode with 1 Î¼M tetrodotoxin, 5 Î¼M strychnine and 20 Î¼M bicuculline methiodide (BMI) in the external solution. AMPAR-mEPSCs were recorded at -70 mV with 50 Î¼M D-2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-AP5) to block NMDAR. NMDAR-mEPSCs were recorded at +45 mV with 5 Î¼M Cyanquixaline (CNQX) to block AMPAR. Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor and glycine receptor inhibitory postsynaptic currents (GABAR/GlyR-mIPSCs) were recorded at +15 mV with D-AP5 and CNQX. Amplitude and frequency of miniature events were detected using Mini-Analysis software (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA) and inspected visually.</p>
<p>Paired-pulse stimulation was applied with interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 35, 60, 100, 200 or 300 ms. The amplitude of the second eEPSC (EPSC<sub>2</sub>), evoked by the second of the paired-pulse stimulations, was divided by eEPSC<sub>1</sub> amplitude to obtain a paired-pulse ratio (PPR). Long-term potentiation (LTP) of evoked EPSCs (recorded at -70 mV) was induced by theta-burst stimulation (TBS, five trains of four pulses at 100 Hz in 200 ms intervals, repeated four times with an interval of 10 s) in the presence of 5 Î¼M strychnine and 20 Î¼M BMI.</p>
<p>Estimations of the readily releasable pool (RRP) size and synaptic vesicles (SVs) depletion rate were made from recordings of AMPAR-eEPSCs using high-frequency stimulation (HFS, 40Hz) trains of 15 pulses to deplete the RRP. Trains were analyzed to estimate glutamate probability of release (Pr) and RRP for each neuron using the decay method as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) using OriginLab 10 software. RRP recovery was approximated as fractional recovery using initial train stimulation with interstimulus intervals of 0.1, 2, 5, and 10 s, followed by a single stimulus. Fractional recovery for each ISI was calculated as (eEPSCs2-eEPSCt1ss)/(eEPSCt1-eEPSCt1ss), where eEPSCs2-amplitude of the stimulus applied after the train, eEPSCt1-first amplitude of the train, eEPSCt1ss-steady state amplitude of the train (last 5 responses). 1 mM kynurenic acid was added to prevent AMPA receptor saturation; 50 Î¼M vD-AP5 added to block NMDA receptors, 5 Î¼M strychnine and 20 Î¼M BMI to block GABA and glycine receptors.</p>
<p>PPR and train recordings for the rescue experiments were performed as described above with addition of 100Î¼M NSC23766 into the recording solution with 5 min incubation period to allow for efficient slice penetration.</p>

These <italic>Trio</italic> variant alleles are found heterozygous in individuals with NDDs: <italic>+/K1431M</italic> is associated with ASD, <italic>+/K1918X</italic> is associated with SCZ, and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> is a <italic>de novo</italic> mutation found in an individual with BPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>).</p>

<p>Because <italic>Trio</italic> knockout mice exhibit decreased survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), we first verified the viability of mice bearing these CRISPR/Cas9-generated <italic>Trio</italic> alleles. Mice heterozygous for any one of these three <italic>Trio</italic> alleles survived to adulthood. Mice homozygous for <italic>Trio K1431M</italic> and <italic>M2145T</italic> survived to adulthood, with genotypes from offspring of <italic>+/K1431M</italic> intercrosses observed in Mendelian ratios, but fewer than expected <italic>M2145T</italic> homozygotes obtained from <italic>+/M2145T</italic> intercrosses (Supp. Fig. 1C). <italic>K1918X</italic> homozygote pups were not observed (Supp. Fig. 1C), as expected for a <italic>Trio</italic> null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). We focused on heterozygotes, as most rare damaging <italic>Trio</italic> variants are heterozygous in humans.</p>
<p>Alternative splicing of the full-length <italic>TRIO</italic> transcript generates multiple brain-specific isoforms of various sizes, whose expression level varies by brain region and developmental age: cortex-predominant Trio9S (263 kDa) and Trio9L (277 kDa), brain-wide Duet (145 kDa), and cerebellum-specific Trio8 (217 kDa) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Heterozygosity for the <italic>K1431M</italic> and <italic>M2145T</italic> alleles did not alter the levels of the predominant Trio isoforms in the brain at postnatal day 0 (P0, neonate) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>) or at P42 (young adult) (Supp. Fig. 1D-L). Trio9 protein levels were reduced by â¼50% in the brains of <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice at P0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>) and P42 (Supp. Fig. 1D-L), and we did not detect the presence of residual truncated protein (expected at 217 kDa), suggesting this <italic>K1918X</italic> mutation indeed leads to nonsense-mediated decay as predicted. Meanwhile, as the <italic>K1918</italic> site is not contained in these isoforms, the levels of Trio8 and Duet were unaffected (Supp. Fig. 1D-L).</p>

<title><italic>Trio</italic> variant alleles differentially impact active Rho family GTPase levels</title>
<p>Having demonstrated that heterozygosity for the K1431M and M2145T alleles does not alter Trio protein levels in the brain, we can attribute any observed differences to the effects of these missense mutations on Trio GEF domain function rather than changes in Trio protein expression. Given the effects of these variants on TRIO GEF1/2 activities in vitro, we measured levels of active GTP-bound Rac1 and RhoA in brains of neonatal (P0) and young adult (P42) <italic>Trio</italic> variant-bearing mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-H</xref>).</p>
<p>In concordance with the â¼50% reduction in Trio levels in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> brains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,D</xref>), Rac1 activity was decreased in P0 <italic>+/K1918X</italic> brains (91% of WT activity, p&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), with a trend toward decreased active RhoA levels (84% of WT, p=0.0865) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). However, by P42, <italic>+/K1918X</italic> brains did not differ from WT in Rac1 or RhoA activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G,H</xref>), despite the persistent â¼50% reduction in Trio9 protein level at this age (Supp. Fig. 1D-F,H-J).</p>
<p>As K1431M decreases TRIO GEF1 catalytic activity in vitro (Supp. Fig. 1A,B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), we anticipated Rac1 activity would also be reduced in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice. Instead, active Rac1 levels were significantly elevated in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> whole brain lysates compared to WT controls, showing a 111% increase at P0 (p&lt;0.01) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and an even greater increase of 150% at P42 (p&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Despite evidence of M2145T impacting TRIO GEF2 catalytic activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), we did not detect changes in active RhoA levels at the whole brain lysate level in <italic>+/M2145T</italic> mice at either age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F,H</xref>).</p>
<p>Because Trio, Rac1, and RhoA are enriched at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), we also measured GTPase activities in synaptosomes (Supp. Fig. 1M-P), within the same age range as the electrophysiological recordings performed on these mice.

We also measured decreased levels of active RhoA in P42 <italic>+/M2145T</italic> cortical synaptosomes compared to WT (73% of WT, p&lt;0.01) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>), consistent with its reduced GEF2 activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F,H</xref>).</p>

<p>We measured motor coordination and learning using an accelerating rotarod test. <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice of both sexes fell from an accelerating rotarod with reduced latency relative to WT littermates, while <italic>+/M2145T</italic> mice performed similarly to WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).

No deficits in muscle strength were noted in any genotype using the Kondziela inverted screen test prior to rotarod testing.</p>
<p>We used an open field test (OFT) and the elevated plus maze (EPM) to assess general locomotor activity and exploratory behavior. In the OFT (Supp. Fig. 2A-D), <italic>Trio</italic> variant mice did not differ significantly from WT in total distance traveled or mean speed; however, <italic>+/K1431M</italic> females spent a greater amount of time in the outer and corner zones of the OFT compared to WT (Supp. Fig. 2D, <italic>right</italic><bold>)</bold>, suggesting increased anxiety-like behavior in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> female mice. WT mice prefer the protected closed arms over the open arms in the EPM (Supp. Fig. 2E,F), whereas <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice of both sexes and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> females did not exhibit this preference (Supp. Fig. 2F).</p>
<p>Deficits in social communication and social interaction are defining features of individuals diagnosed with NDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In a three-chamber social interaction test, <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice of both sexes and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> females showed no preference for the stranger mouse over the object (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), while <italic>+/M2145T</italic> mice of both sexes and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> males exhibited preference for the stranger mouse, similar to WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In a novel object recognition test, <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice of both sexes and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> females failed to discriminate between the novel and familiar objects, while <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> males exhibited normal discrimination between novel and familiar objects similar to WT <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref><bold><underline>)</underline></bold>.</p>
<p>Repetitive behaviors and stereotypies are often identified in individuals with NDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>).

<p>Behavioral phenotypes mostly overlapped between <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice, with differences in social interaction and memory tests. <italic>+/M2145T</italic> mice exhibited the fewest phenotypes in measured tasks.

Significant decreases in cortical layer 2/3 and layer 5 thickness were observed in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> brains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H-J</xref>), and were in proportion to the relative decrease in cortical thickness relative to WT (Supp. Fig. 3F).

<p>Deletion of <italic>Trio</italic> has been shown to impair the migration of forebrain interneuron progenitors, resulting in fewer neurons entering the cerebral cortex and altered distribution of cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). However, we observed no change in total cortical cell density or in layer-specific cell density in heterozygous <italic>Trio</italic> variant male mice, nor were numbers of cortical NeuN+ neuronal cells or PV+ inhibitory neurons altered relative to WT, although there were trends toward increased DAPI+ cell density in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> and increased NeuN+ cell density in <italic>+/M2145T</italic> motor cortex (Supp. Fig. 3H-N). These data suggest that the reduced brain size of <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice results from a loss of neuropil rather than reductions in cortical neuron number.</p>

<p>We used SynGo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) to investigate whether the <italic>Trio</italic> variants impacted synaptic functions. 1,067 of the 7,362 total quantified proteins were synaptic proteins listed in the SynGO geneset (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, Figure 7 - Source data 2).

<title>Rho GEFs and synaptic regulatory proteins are altered in <italic>Trio +/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> heterozygotes</title>
<p>Given our findings from proteomic analysis and electrophysiology, we measured levels of key presynaptic regulators, including synaptophysin (Syp), syntaxin binding protein1 (Stxbp1, also known as Munc18-1), syntaxin1a (Stx1a) and synaptotagmin3 (Syt3), which are crucial for synaptic vesicle (SV) tethering, docking, replenishment, and calcium-dependent replenishment, respectively. We also measured levels of presynaptic proteins in P42 cortical synaptosomes, where these proteins are enriched. Munc18-1, Syt3, and Syp levels were increased in <italic>+/M2145T</italic> synaptosomes relative to WT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-H</xref>).

<p>The elevated Rac1 activity in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> brain lysates and synaptosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) seemed at odds with previous reports that K1431M reduces TRIO GEF1 activity (Supp. Fig. 1A,B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). We hypothesized that homeostatic compensation in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice may alter expression of other RhoGEFs and GAPs. Indeed, levels of the Rac1 GEF Tiam1 were increased in both <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> P42 cortical lysates, while VAV2 levels were increased in <italic>+/M2145T</italic> P42 lysates (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I-L</xref>).

<title>NSC23766, a Rac1-specific inhibitor, rescues neurotransmitter release in <italic>Trio +/K1431M</italic> heterozygotes</title>
<p>Rac1 negatively regulates synaptic vesicle replenishment and synaptic strength in excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>).

However, how variants in a single gene contribute to different NDDs remains a major unresolved question. Our study reveals that mice heterozygous for NDD-associated <italic>Trio</italic> variants differentially affecting Trio protein levels or GEF activity yield overlapping but distinct behavioral, neuroanatomical, and synaptic phenotypes. Our findings extend prior work demonstrating that Trio is critical for postsynaptic signaling and synaptic plasticity.

<title>Heterozygosity for <italic>Trio</italic> variants in mice yields phenotypes similar to those observed in NDDs</title>

Patients with missense or truncating variants in <italic>TRIO</italic> that reduce GEF1 activity have mild developmental delay and microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Similarly, we found that heterozygosity for the GEF1-deficient <italic>K1431M</italic> missense or the <italic>K1918X</italic> nonsense variants significantly reduced brain weight and/or head size compared to WT mice, along with multiple behavioral impairments. Notably, while both showed impaired motor coordination and learning, only mice bearing the ASD-associated <italic>K1431M</italic> allele exhibited social interaction deficits. In addition, we observed behavioral differences in male versus female <italic>Trio</italic> variant mice, possibly similar to human sex differences in the susceptibility to and clinical presentation of NDDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>).</p>
<p>Both <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> adult mice of both sexes had reduced brain-to-body weight ratios compared to WT, but these were driven by different factors. The smaller brain size in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> male mice was associated with a reduction in neuropil and reduced cortical thickness, similar to mice bearing excitatory neuron-specific ablation of one <italic>Trio</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) and paralleling the reduced gray matter volume and cortical thickness in SCZ patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>). Meanwhile, <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice of both sexes exhibited an overall increase in body weight leading to relatively decreased head width- and brain-to-body weight ratios in these mice. Adult <italic>+/K1431M</italic> male mice had no change in neuropil or cross-sectional brain area, consistent with a prior study describing normal brain size in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Rac1 mediates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from pancreatic islet beta-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>), which may explain how chronic alterations in Rac1 activity contribute to weight changes in <italic>Trio +/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice. Most studies of <italic>Trio</italic> variants have focused on neuronal effects, but expression of <italic>Trio</italic> in other tissues could explain the increased body weight in these mice, as well as the musculoskeletal abnormalities associated with <italic>TRIO</italic> variation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Trio</italic> variants differentially impact dendritic arbor structure</title>

We found relatively subtle effects of Rac1/RhoA-altering <italic>Trio</italic> variants on cortical L5 PN dendrites. <italic>+/K1918X</italic> L5 pyramidal neurons are smaller and less complex than WT neurons, especially in the basal compartment corresponding to L5 where EM images were obtained, consistent with the smaller brain size and reduced cortical thickness of <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice. We posit that due to their smaller dendritic field size, L5 neurons pack more densely, contributing to the mildly increased synapse density observed in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> M1 L5 cortex. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a trend toward increased DAPI+ cell density in M1 L5 of <italic>+/K1918X</italic> neurons.</p>
<p>The reductions in dendritic arborization and length in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> neurons are consistent with reports of reduced gray matter volume and dendrite alterations in individuals with schizophrenia versus controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>), but were modest compared to <italic>NEX-Trio<sup>+/fl</sup></italic> mice lacking one copy of Trio in excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Reduced Trio function in other cell types, such as in inhibitory neurons or glia, or in neurons from other brain regions that project to cortical M1 L5 PNs, may ameliorate the phenotypes in excitatory neurons of <italic>+/K1918X</italic> relative to <italic>NEX-Trio<sup>+/fl</sup></italic> mice. In addition, changes to L5 PN dendrites in <italic>Trio</italic> variant mice appeared to be regionally selective within the arbor: <italic>+/K1431M</italic> neurons had increased arborization only in proximal basal dendrites, while <italic>+/M2145T</italic> neurons had decreased arborization only in the most distal apical dendrites. These differences may reflect the differential spatiotemporal influence of Trio in regulating Rac1 versus RhoA activity. Alternatively, given our finding for presynaptic roles for Trio, these differences may reflect differential effects of the <italic>Trio</italic> variants on both excitatory and inhibitory afferent synaptic inputs which play critical roles in shaping the apical and basal dendrites of L5 PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Trio</italic> variants impact brain Rho GTPase signaling</title>
<p>We show here that the <italic>K1431M</italic> variant significantly reduces TRIO GEF1 nucleotide exchange on Rac1 in vitro, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Decreased Rac1 activity was observed in +/<italic>K1431M</italic> mice at embryonic day 14.5 in the ganglionic eminence, which is enriched for pre-migratory GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In contrast, we show an increase in active Rac1 levels in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> postnatal brains (at P0, P21, P42) and synaptosomes (at P42) from cortex, primarily composed of differentiated excitatory neurons. This increase aligns with observed phenotypes (e.g. reduced Pr) and reveals why reductions in brain volume, dendrites and spines, or AMPAR signaling anticipated from reduced Rac1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>) were not observed in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice. We propose that the increased Rac1 activity we observed reflects homeostatic compensation in Rac1 regulation occurring between birth to adult ages, and identify changes in Rac1-specific GEFs, e.g. Tiam1 and Vav2, that may contribute to this compensation. Importantly, we did not find changes in Kalirin levels in the adult brain of these Trio mutant mice, suggesting that Kalirin does not compensate for loss of Trio GEF1 activity at this age.</p>
<p>We observed a significant reduction in active RhoA only in purified synaptosomes of <italic>+/M2145T</italic> brains, reflecting the synaptic compartment as a key locus of Trio function. In addition, despite <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice having half the WT levels of Trio protein, we measured little to no change in active Rac1 and RhoA levels in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> brains. These findings are consistent with recent evidence that the spatiotemporally precise balance of Rac/Rho activity rather than absolute activity levels can mediate cytoskeletal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>). Alterations in the activity of additional potential TRIO substrates, such as RhoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>), Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), and the neurodevelopmentally critical Rac3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>) could also contribute phenotypes in these mice.</p>
<p>Our results strongly complement a growing body of evidence showing that altered activation of Rho GTPases is an important mechanism affecting synaptic function in ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref>).

<title>The NDD-associated <italic>Trio</italic> variants cause synaptic transmission, plasticity and excitatory/inhibitory imbalance</title>
<p>Overexpression of a TRIO <italic>K1431M</italic> variant with reduced GEF1 activity decreased AMPAR-mediated mESPC amplitudes in rat organotypic slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), while Rac1 activation increased AMPAR amplitudes by promoting synaptic AMPAR clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>). In +<italic>/K1431M</italic> mice, we observed a decrease in the NMDA/AMPA ratio and NMDA mEPSCs frequency, with increased AMPAR mEPSCs amplitudes, with no changes in dendritic spines suggesting a possible reduction in silent synapses due to increased AMPAR incorporation. This increase in AMPAR was associated with increased active Rac1 levels measured in synaptosomes in adult <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice. AMPAR mEPSC amplitudes were also increased in L5 PNs of <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice, corresponding with a decrease in the NMDA/AMPAR ratio, but no changes in mEPSCs frequencies, also suggesting an increased number of synaptic AMPARs. In <italic>+/K1918X</italic> cortex, Rac1 activity is reduced at P0 but increases by P21 and P42 to WT levels, suggesting that a <italic>relative</italic> increase in Rac1 during development may enhance AMPAR tone and affect LTP, especially given the precise spatiotemporal requirements of Rac/Rho activity and their effectors for LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>). The <italic>+/M2145T</italic> variant showed no changes in AMPAR or NMDAR amplitudes but had increased mEPSC frequencies in both, without changes in spine or synapse density, consistent with enhanced spontaneous neurotransmitter release.</p>
<p>mIPSC frequencies were decreased in +<italic>/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/M2145T</italic> L5 PNs, while mIPSC amplitude was increased in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> slices. Sun et al. noted a similar deficit in inhibitory function in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> prefrontal cortex correlated with reduced interneuron migration to this region, including parvalbumin positive (PV+) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In contrast, we did not observe reduced PV+ interneuron numbers in the motor cortex in any <italic>Trio</italic> variant mice, suggesting that <italic>Trio</italic> variants may also impact the number of inhibitory synapses or transmission. However, we cannot fully exclude potential defects in migration of other interneuron populations as contributors to these phenotypes.</p>
<p>Overall, heterozygosity for <italic>Trio</italic> variants dysregulates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in different patterns, resulting in E/I imbalance, a known driver of NDD phenotypes.</p>
<p><italic>Trio</italic>-deficient excitatory neurons are unable to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) in mouse brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), which is crucial for working memory in mammals.

Both <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> L5 PNs exhibited reduced LTP induction and maintenance. The increased AMPAR resulting from elevated Rac1 activity (<italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice) or the inability of reduced levels of Trio to activate Rac1 (<italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice) may preclude LTP in these mice.</p>
<p><italic>+/M2145T</italic> mice showed a striking increase in the induction and maintenance of LTP, correlating with an increased glutamate Pr and SV pool size. The function of RhoA in plasticity is unknown, but the decrease in RhoA activity and increased levels in presynaptic machinery proteins measured in cortical synaptosomes may underlie the increase in LTP in these mice.</p>

Using the Rac1 inhibitor NSC, we demonstrate that elevated Rac1 activity, potentially driven by Tiam1 upregulation, drives the reduction in synchronous glutamate Pr and SV replenishment without affecting RRP in +<italic>/K1431M</italic> mice. NSC application rescues Pr and enhances SV replenishment in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> slices while also increasing both processes in WT. Decreased Stx1 levels in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> synapses, a key component of the priming machinery, may still be a limiting factor in effective priming, thus preventing full rescue of the SV recovery by NSC. Overall, NSC had a significant yet weaker effect in WT than in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> slices, likely due to the overall increased Rac1 activity in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> slices providing more of a target for NSC.</p>
<p>Conditional knock out of Rac1 in the Calyx of Held increased spontaneous (action potential-independent) glutamate Pr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>), aligning with the hypothesis that Rac1 activity negatively regulates neurotransmitter release by increasing the assembly of actin filaments at the AZ that impede SV fusion. <italic>+/K1431M</italic> cortical slices showed significant increases in AMPAR amplitudes, and our data are consistent with fewer silent synapses. Yet, we observed no change in AMPA mESPC frequency. We hypothesize that the Rac1-dependent decrease in Pr identified in these slices decreased AMPAR mEPSCs frequency; hence, the opposing changes from these pre- and post-synaptic effects mask the expected change in AMPAR mEPSC frequency.</p>
<p>RhoA activity is significantly reduced in cortical synaptosomes of +<italic>/M2145T</italic> mice, and this is associated with increased RRP size. While a specific function for RhoA in regulating presynaptic release is currently unclear, levels of Munc18, Syp, and Syt3, are all increased in +<italic>/M2145T</italic> mice at P42 and can contribute to the enhanced Pr and altered SV cycling. The unusual PPR in the <italic>+/M2145T</italic> variant may result, at least in part, from altered Syt3 levels, crucial for calcium-dependent SV replenishment, as its deficiency causes similar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings show that Trio GEF1 and GEF2-mediated Rho GTPase signaling pathways play critical and distinct roles in regulating Pr, RRP size and SV recycling.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p><italic>TRIO</italic> is a risk gene for several NDDs with different patterns of variants observed in different disorders. We show here that variants in <italic>Trio</italic> that lead to impaired Trio levels or GEF function cause both shared and distinct defects in behavior, neuroanatomy, and prominent synaptic dysfunction that may reflect variant-specific NDD clinical phenotypes. Our data also demonstrate, for the first time, the differential impact of distinct <italic>Trio</italic> lesions on glutamate Pr, RRP size, and SVs replenishment, along with alterations in presynaptic release machinery that contribute to these deficits. We demonstrate that the <italic>+/K1431M</italic> lesion in TRIO GEF1 leads to presynaptic deficits due to Rac1 dysregulation, which can be rescued by pharmacological normalization. We propose that <italic>Trio</italic> variants disrupt brain function by impairing Rho GTPase signaling, causing diverse synaptic dysfunction through combined effects on pre-and/or post-synaptic functions. Our findings support growing evidence linking synaptic dysfunction in several NDD models to Rho GTPase signaling dysregulation, identifying it as a commonly affected pathway and a potential therapeutic target.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores how heterozygosity for specific neurodevelopmental disorder-associated Trio variants affects mouse behavior, brain structure, and synaptic function, revealing distinct impacts on motor, social, and cognitive behaviors linked to clinical phenotypes. Findings demonstrate that Trio variants yield unique changes in synaptic plasticity and glutamate release, highlighting Trio's critical role in presynaptic function and the importance of examining variant heterozygosity in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study generated multiple mouse lines to model each Trio variant, reflecting point mutations observed in human patients with developmental disorders. The authors employed various approaches to evaluate the resulting behavioral, neuronal morphology, synaptic function, and proteomic phenotypes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors generated three mouse lines harboring ASD, Schizophrenia, and Bi-polar-associated variants in the TRIO gene. Anatomical, behavioral, physiological, and biochemical assays were deployed to compare and contrast the impact of these mutations in these animals. In this undertaking the authors sought to identify and characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for ASD, Schizophrenia, and Bi-polar disorder development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The establishment of TRIO dysfunction in the development of ASD, Schizophrenia, and Bi-polar disorder is very recent and of great interest. Disorder-specific variants have been identified in the TRIO gene, and this study is the first to compare and contrast the impact of these variants in vivo in preclinical models. The impact of these mutations was carefully examined using an impressive host of methods. The authors achieved their goal of identifying behavioral, physiological, and molecular alterations that are disorder/variant specific. The impact of this work is extremely high given the growing appreciation of TRIO dysfunction in a large number of brain-related disorders. This work is very interesting in that it begins to identify the unique and subtle ways brain function is altered in ASD, Schizophrenia, and Bi-polar disorder.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Most assays were performed in older animals and perhaps only capture alterations that result from homeostatic changes resulting from prodromal pathology that may look very different.</p>
<p>(2) Identification of upregulated (potentially compensating) genes in response to these disorder specific Trio variants is extremely interesting. However, a functional demonstration of compensation is not provided.</p>
<p>(3) There are instances where data is not shown in the manuscript. See &quot;data not shown&quot;. All data collected should be provided even if significant differences are not observed.</p>
<p>I consider weaknesses 1 and 2 minor. While they would very interesting to explore, these experiments might be more appropriate for a follow up study. The missing data in 3 should be provided in the supplemental material.</p>
<p>Revised Manuscript:</p>
<p>All of my above concerns were well addressed by the authors in the revised submission.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife Assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study provides useful findings about the effects of heterozygosity for Trio variants linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in mice. However, the strength of the evidence is limited and incomplete mainly because the experimental flow is difficult to follow, raising concerns about the conclusions' robustness. Clearer connections between variables, such as sex, age, behavior, brain regions, and synaptic measures, and more methodological detail on breeding strategies, test timelines, electrophysiology, and analysis, are needed to support their claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to address the constructive feedback provided by eLife and the reviewers. Below, we respond to the overall assessment and individual reviewers' comments, clarifying our experimental approach, addressing concerns, and providing additional details where necessary.</p>
<p>We thank the editors for highlighting the significance of our findings regarding the effects of Trio variant heterozygosity in mice. We acknowledge the feedback concerning the experimental flow and agree that clarity is paramount. To address these concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Connections between variables: The word limit of the initial submission constrained our ability to provide adequate details and connections between variables. We have revised the manuscript to explicitly outline and extend explanations and the relationships between sex, age, behavior, brain regions, and synaptic measures, ensuring that the rationale for each experiment and its relevance to the overall conclusions are improved.</p>
<p>(2) Methodological details: The Methods section of our initial submission was condensed, with key details provided in the Supplemental Methods section. We have merged all into an extended section to improve clarity. We have expanded our description of breeding strategies, test timelines, electrophysiological protocols, and data analysis methods in the revised Methods section. We believe the additions have enhanced the transparency and reproducibility of our study and ensured full support of our conclusions.</p>
<p>(3) Experimental flow: We have revised and extended our results, methods, and discussion sections to clarify the rationale and experimental design to guide readers through the experimental sequence and rationale.</p>
<p>We are confident these revisions address the concerns raised and enhance the robustness and coherence of our findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores how heterozygosity for specific neurodevelopmental disorder-associated Trio variants affects mouse behavior, brain structure, and synaptic function, revealing distinct impacts on motor, social, and cognitive behaviors linked to clinical phenotypes. Findings demonstrate that Trio variants yield unique changes in synaptic plasticity and glutamate release, highlighting Trio's critical role in presynaptic function and the importance of examining variant heterozygosity in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study generated multiple mouse lines to model each Trio variant, reflecting point mutations observed in human patients with developmental disorders. The authors employed various approaches to evaluate the resulting behavioral, neuronal morphology, synaptic function, and proteomic phenotypes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors present extensive results, the flow of experiments is challenging to follow, raising concerns about the strength of the experimental conclusions. Additionally, the connection between sex, age, behavioral data, brain regions, synaptic transmission, and plasticity lacks clarity, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind each experiment. Clearer explanations of the purpose and connections between experiments are recommended. Furthermore, the methodology requires more detail, particularly regarding mouse breeding strategies, timelines for behavioral tests, electrophysiology conditions, and data analysis procedures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs recognition of the novelty and comprehensiveness of our approach, particularly the generation of multiple mouse lines and our efforts to model Trio variant effects in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) Experimental flow and rationale and connection between variables: We have expanded on the connections between behavioral data, neuronal morphology, synaptic function, and proteomics in the Results and Discussion sections to clarify how each experiment informs the reasoning and the conclusions and to highlight the relationships between sex, age, behavior, and synaptic measures.</p>
<p>(2) Methodological details: Our initial Methods section was formatted to be short to fulfill word limits on the submitted version, with additional details provided in the Supplemental Methods section.

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors generated three mouse lines harboring ASD, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar-associated variants in the TRIO gene. Anatomical, behavioral, physiological, and biochemical assays were deployed to compare and contrast the impact of these mutations in these animals. In this undertaking, the authors sought to identify and characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for ASD, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar disorder development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The establishment of TRIO dysfunction in the development of ASD, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar disorder is very recent and of great interest. Disorder-specific variants have been identified in the TRIO gene, and this study is the first to compare and contrast the impact of these variants in vivo in preclinical models. The impact of these mutations was carefully examined using an impressive host of methods. The authors achieved their goal of identifying behavioral, physiological, and molecular alterations that are disorder/variant specific. The impact of this work is extremely high given the growing appreciation of TRIO dysfunction in a large number of brain-related disorders. This work is very interesting in that it begins to identify the unique and subtle ways brain function is altered in ASD, Schizophrenia, and Bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Most assays were performed in older animals and perhaps only capture alterations that result from homeostatic changes resulting from prodromal pathology that may look very different.</p>
<p>(2) Identification of upregulated (potentially compensating) genes in response to these disorder-specific Trio variants is extremely interesting. However, a functional demonstration of compensation is not provided.</p>
<p>(3) There are instances where data is not shown in the manuscript. See &quot;data not shown&quot;. All data collected should be provided even if significant differences are not observed.</p>
<p>I consider weaknesses 1 and 2 minor. While they would be very interesting to explore, these experiments might be more appropriate for a follow-up study. I would recommend that the missing data in 3 should be provided in the supplemental material.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewerâs recognition of our studyâs significance and methodological rigor. The acknowledgment of Trio dysfunction as a novel and impactful area of research is deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>We agree that focusing on older animals limits insights into early-stage pathophysiology. However, our goal in this study was to examine the functional impacts of <italic>Trio</italic> heterozygosity at an adolescent stage and to reveal the ultimate impact of these alleles on synaptic function. Our choice of age aligns with our objectives. Future studies of earlier developmental stages will be beneficial and complement these findings.</p>
<p>Functional compensation:</p>
<p>We tested functional compensation through rescue experiments in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> brain slices using a Rac1-specific inhibitor, NSC23766, which prevents Rac1 activation by Trio or Tiam1. Our finding that direct Rac1 inhibition normalizes deficient neurotransmitter release in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice strongly suggests that increased Rac1 activity drives this phenotype.</p>
<p>Data not shown:</p>
<p>We will incorporate all previously shown data into the Supplemental Materials, even when results are nonsignificant. We agree that this ensures full transparency and facilitates a more comprehensive evaluation of our findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1K-N, the lack of observed differences in +/M2145T mice across all tests raises questions about its validity as a BPD model. Furthermore, the differences in female behavior data compared to males, as shown in the Supplemental section, lack clarification-specifically, whether these variations are due to sex differences or sample size disparities, which is not discussed. Additionally, it's unclear if the same mice were used in tests K through L-N, as the reported numbers differ without explanation; if relevant, any mortality should be reported. Given the observed body weight differences, it is important to display locomotor data, despite the mention of no change in open field results. Lastly, a detailed breeding strategy and timeline for behavioral testing would enhance clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 1 for recognizing these confusing points in our behavioral data and seek to add clarification in our Revision as below:</p>
<p>(a) We have revised the text to emphasize our goal to evaluate the impact of NDD-related <italic>Trio</italic> alleles that have discrete and measurable effects on brain development and function, and not to model specific NDDs (e.g. ASD, SCZ, or BPD). The three specific <italic>Trio</italic> mutations were chosen based on strong evidence of these mutations impairing the biochemical functions of Trio. We reasoned our approach would reveal how impairing Trio in different ways â i.e. altering protein level or GEF1/GEF2 function â and under genetic conditions (heterozygosity) that mimic those found in individuals with Trio-related disorders impacts brain development and function. The lack of behavioral phenotypes in <italic>+/M2145T</italic> mice is indeed intriguing, especially given the alterations in electrophysiology and biochemistry experiments. It remains possible that further behavioral analyses of these mice will reveal behavioral phenotypes.</p>
<p>(b) Given that the prevalence and clinical presentation of individuals with various NDDs are influenced by sex, it is possible that the behavioral differences we see in male versus female <italic>Trio</italic> variant mice reflect human sex difference phenotypes. We have reorganized the Figure panels to clarify these sex differences in behaviors (new Fig. 2, Supp. Fig. 2). We focused on the most significant behavioral phenotypes shared by both sexes in the main text, or in males alone, as our anatomical and electrophysiological experiments were restricted to males to reduce variation due to estrus. The observed behavioral sex differences are not likely due to sample size disparities as power analyses were performed for all experimental results to ensure adequate sample size. A comprehensive study of the mechanisms underlying these behavioral findings merits examination but is outside the scope of this study.</p>
<p>(c) All mice were subjected to all behavioral tests described. No sudden mortality was observed during the behavioral experiments. Outliers in post-hoc statistical analyses were removed, which explains the apparent sample size differences between behavioral tests. We have revised the Data analysis section in our Methods to include these details (Lines 216-289, 450-457).</p>
<p>(d) Results of the open field test have been added to the Supplemental Data (new Supp. Fig. 2) and Results (Lines 532-537)</p>
<p>(e) The Methods section was expanded to include more detail on the breeding strategy (Lines 98-106). A timeline for behavioral testing has also been included in the Figures to enhance clarity (new Fig. 2A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 2A-E, head width and brain weight showed significant differences, but not body weight, how come the ratio does not change? Comparing with female results in Supplementary Figure 2A-E, it does show a difference between males and females. It is essential to clarify which sex authors use in all follow-up experiments, including synapse, transmission, and plasticity. Since the males and females have different phenotypes, why do the authors focus on males only? The E plot has no data points on the bar graph. In Figure 2I, it lacks example images for all four conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate this Reviewerâs attention to details in our brain and body weight data and revised the manuscript to address these concerns.</p>
<p>(a) The ratios of head width/body weight were calculated for each individual mouse. Hence the distribution of the ratio data (old Fig. 2D; new Fig. 3D) differs from the distribution of head width or body weight data alone (old Fig. 2A, 2C, resp.; now Fig. 3A, 3C), and therefore can affect the p-value for statistical significance. The body weight of <italic>+/M2145T</italic> males is 21.217 Â±0.327 g, while for WT males is 21.745 Â±0.224 g, a non-significant decrease of 0.528 g (adjusted p=0.3806). These values have been added to the Fig 3. figure legend (Lines 1020-1034) for clarity.</p>
<p>(b) Similar to the behavioral experiments in comment (1), we observed sex differences in head width, brain weight, and body weight in <italic>Trio</italic> heterozygous variant mice compared to WT counterparts. The differences in the ratios of head width/body weight or brain weight/body weight were the same for both males and females (i.e. head width/body weight ratio is decreased in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice compared to WT regardless of sex, and brain weight/body weight ratio is decreased in both <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice compared to WT regardless of sex). These findings affirm the impact of <italic>Trio</italic> mutations on these phenotypes across both sexes. We have modified the text to draw more attention to this key point (Lines 554-566 and 777-801).</p>
<p>(c) All experiments (excluding behavior and weight data) were performed in males only to minimize the variation in spine and synapse morphology and physiological activity that can occur due to estrus. We have clarified this in the âAnimal Workâ section of the Methods (Lines 103-106) as well as in the Figure Legends.</p>
<p>(d) We thank the Reviewer for pointing out Fig. 3E lacks individual data points on the bar graph. Fig. 3E has been modified to now include the brain weight/body weight ratio for each individual mouse rather than across the population, to be consistent with the calculation of head width/body weight ratio (see point 2a).</p>
<p>On original submission, only a representative WT image was selected due to space constraints. The figure (new Fig. 3H and 3K) and figure legend have been revised to include representative traces for all genotypes examined.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In lines 315-320, &quot;None of the Trio variant heterozygotes exhibited altered dendritic spine density on M1 L5 pyramidal neurons compared to WT mice on either apical or basal arbors (Supplementary Figure 3L, M). Electron microscopy of cortical area M1 L5 revealed that synapse density was significantly increased in +/K1918X mice compared to WT (Figure 3A, B), possibly due to a net reduction in neuropil resulting from smaller dendritic arbors.&quot; The proposed explanation does not adequately address the observed discrepancy between spine density and synapse density reported in these two experiments. A more thorough analysis is needed to reconcile these conflicting findings and clarify how these distinct measurements may relate to each other in the context of the study's conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the apparent discrepancy between our dendritic spine density data, which is unchanged from WT for all three <italic>Trio</italic> variant heterozygotes, and our synapse density data, which showed an increase in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> M1 L5 compared to WT. We have expanded the explanation for this discrepancy below and added this to the Discussion (Lines 802-811):</p>
<p>a) Because spine density can vary by dendritic branch order and distance from the soma, only protrusions from secondary dendritic arbors of M1 L5 pyramidal neurons were quantified for consistency in analyses. However, all synapses meeting criteria were quantified in EM images, regardless of where they were located along an individual neuronâs arbors. It is possible that the density and distribution of spines along other arbors are different between genotypes but was not captured in our current data.</p>
<p>b) <italic>+/K1918X</italic> L5 pyramidal neurons are smaller and less complex than WT neurons, especially in the basal compartment corresponding to L5 where EM images were obtained, consistent with the smaller brain size and reduced cortical thickness of <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice. We posit that due to their smaller dendritic field size, L5 neurons pack more densely contributing to the increased synapse density observed in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> M1 L5 cortex. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a trend toward increased DAPI+ cell density in M1 L5 of <italic>+/K1918X</italic> neurons (Supp. Fig. 3N).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 4, one potential rationale for measuring AMPAR mEPSC frequency is to infer synapse density changes. However, the findings show no frequency change in +/K1431M and +/K1918X, with an increase only in +/M2145T, which contradicts Figure 3 results indicating a trend toward increased density across variants.</p>
<p>This inconsistency is confusing, especially since the authors claim to follow the methodology from the study &quot;Trio Haploinsufficiency Causes Neurodevelopmental Disease-Associated Deficits&quot;; yet, the observed mEPSC amplitude differs significantly from that study, while the frequency remains unaffected. Additionally, the NMDAR mEPSCs reflect combined AMPAR and NMDAR responses at positive holding potentials, with peak amplitude dominated by AMPAR. This inconsistency between holding potential results is unclear, as frequency should theoretically align across negative and positive potentials. For accurate NMDAR mEPSC measurement, it would be optimal to assess amplitude 50 ms post-initial peak and, if possible, increase the holding potential to enhance the driving force given the typically low signal of NMDAR response.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting these important points.</p>
<p>a) Previous work from our lab and others demonstrate that Trio regulates synaptic AMPA receptor levels, which is why we chose to focus on AMPAR-mediated evoked and miniature EPSC frequencies and amplitudes in the current study. We acknowledge Reviewer 1âs comment on seemingly contradictory results regarding AMPAR mEPSC frequency and synapse density; however, the unchanged AMPAR mEPSC frequency in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> mice is consistent with our finding of unaltered dendritic spine density in these mice compared to WT (Supp. Fig. 4L,M). The differences between dendritic spine counts and synapse density is addressed in Response (3) above.</p>
<p>b) While synapse density changes can be inferred from AMPAR mEPSC frequency, mEPSCs are also measures of spontaneous neurotransmitter release changes especially in the absence of changes in synaptic numbers. Notably, the increased mEPSC frequency in the <italic>+/M2145T</italic> variant is linked to enhanced spontaneous release, not to spine or synapse density changes. These findings are reinforced by increase in counts of synaptic vesicles, calculated PPR changes, and estimates of the Pr and RRP from HFS train analysis. We have included these points in the Discussion (Lines 861-863).</p>
<p>c) While it is tempting to compare the current study to our previously published conditional Trio haploinsufficiency model, we highlight key distinctions that may underlie phenotypic differences between these two mouse models. First, our prior model used a <italic>NEX-Cre</italic> transgene to ablate one <italic>Trio</italic> allele from excitatory neurons only beginning at embryonic day 11. In contrast, our <italic>Trio</italic> variants are expressed in all cell types throughout development, akin to the genetic variants found in individuals with <italic>TRIO</italic>-related disorders. Second, the <italic>Trio</italic> variant mice in this study are on a C57BL/6 background, while the <italic>Trio</italic> haploinsufficient mice were on a mixed 129Sv/J X C57BL/6 background. These differences in the current study may explain why some measures, such as mEPSC amplitude, may not align with those from the <italic>Trio</italic> conditional haploinsufficiency model.</p>
<p>d) Recordings were performed using specific inhibitors to isolate AMPA and NMDA mEPSCs; these missing methodological details have now been clarified in the updated Methods section (Lines 353-360).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Supplementary Figure 4, the sample traces indicate a higher NMDA/AMPA ratio, raising the question of whether the AMPA EPSC amplitude changes, as this could reflect PSD length. In Figure 4B, the increased AMPAR mEPSC amplitude in the +/K1918X condition compared to WT suggests an enhanced postsynaptic response, yet the PSD length is reduced in Figure 3C. Can the authors provide a potential hypothesis to explain this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewerâs feedback. Yes, both evoked and miniature recordings indicate increased AMPAR amplitudes in the <italic>+/K1918X</italic> variants compared to WT. While PSD length is often linked to synaptic strength, the observed reduction in PSD length in EM PSD length reduction in <italic>+/K1918X</italic> synapses is small (~6% of WT) and clearly does not correlate with significant changes in synaptic strength. We also note that the whole cell recordings of mEPSCs represent input from all active synapses on the neuron, while PSD length is measured only in synapses of the L5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In Figure 4, synaptic plasticity appears to decrease to around 50% of baseline; could this reduction be attributed to LTD, or might it result from changes in pipette resistance? Additionally, is the observed potentiation due to changes in presynaptic release probability? Measuring paired-pulse ratio (PPR) before and after induction would clarify this aspect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for highlighting these important points.</p>
<p>a) We used a well-established theta burst stimulation method for LTP induction in M1 L5 pyramidal neurons. This protocol reliably evokes LTP in WT neurons, as shown in Fig. 5J and K. Both <italic>+/K1431M</italic> and <italic>+/K1918X</italic> variants exhibit a slight but discernible increase in evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs), indicative of the initiation of LTP. Although this increase is smaller compared to WT, the presence of potentiation indicates that long-term depression (LTD) is an unlikely explanation for the observed reduction.</p>
<p>b) To rule out the influence of technical artifacts, pipette resistance was carefully monitored before and after LTP induction. Any cells exhibiting resistance changes exceeding 20% during electrophysiological recordings were excluded from the analysis, ensuring that fluctuations in pipette resistance did not confound LTP measurements. These technical details are denoted in the Methods (Lines 344-346 and 364-366).</p>
<p>c) The potentiation in the <italic>+/M2145T</italic> variant may stem from increased release probability (Pr) and greater synaptic vesicle availability, but is beyond the scope of this work. We agree this is an intriguing question, not only for <italic>+/M2145T</italic> but also for <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice. Future studies should address this, ideally using models where the <italic>Trio</italic> variant is selectively introduced into the presynaptic neuron.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In lines 377-380, &quot;The +/M2145T PPR curve was unusual, with significantly reduced PPF at short ISIs, yet clearly increased PPF at longer ISI (Figure 5A, B) compared to WT.&quot; The unusual PPR observed at the 100 ms ISI appears unexpected. Can the authors provide an explanation for this anomaly? This finding could suggest atypical presynaptic dynamics or modulation at this specific interval, which may differ from typical synaptic behavior. Further insights into possible mechanisms or experimental conditions affecting this result would be valuable.</p>
<p>&quot;The decreased PPF at initial ISI in +/M2145T mice correlated with increased mEPSC frequency (Fig. 4A-C), suggestive of a possible increase in spontaneous glutamate Pr.&quot; If this is the case, it raises the question of why the increased PPR at the initial ISI in +/K1431M does not correspond to the result shown in Figure 4C. This discrepancy suggests that factors beyond initial presynaptic release probability might be influencing the observed synaptic response, or that compensatory mechanisms could be affecting PPR and mEPSC frequency differently in this variant. Further clarification on the interplay between these measurements would help resolve this inconsistency.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewerâs critical reading and genuine interest on this phenotype in <italic>+/M2145T</italic> mice.</p>
<p>a) The unusual shift of the PPR in <italic>+/M2145T</italic> at ISI 100ms is fascinating and will require significant additional experimentation that lies beyond the scope of this report to address. We propose it results from altered presynaptic regulators, including increased Syt3 and reduced RhoA activity. Notably, Syt3 influences calcium-dependent SV replenishment, which can cause similar PPR defects (Weingarten DJ et al., 2022); this is now included in the Discussion. (Lines 915-918).</p>

<p>b) Thank you for raising the concern in clarity of this statement &quot;The decreased PPF at initial ISI in +/M2145T mice correlated with increased mEPSC frequency (Fig. 4A-C), suggestive of a possible increase in spontaneous glutamate Pr.&quot; We have edited the sentence to be more clear (Lines 701-703). First, the K1431M and M2145T variants impact different TRIO catalytic activities disrupting distinct GTPase pathways and differentially affecting presynaptic regulators, which can lead to non-overlapping phenotypes. Also, we expand our discussion that <italic>+/K1431M</italic> variant data suggest increased AMPAR numbers and fewer silent synapses (Lines 850-855), potentially increasing AMPAR mEPSC frequency and masking the expected decrease in spontaneous release (Lines 905-910). Further experiments are needed, ideally using mixed cultures with TRIO variants in presynaptic neurons with synapses on WT neurons, as minimal stimulation variance analysis in slices would be inconclusive due to its reflection of both Pr and silent synapse changes, similar to mEPSC frequency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In Figure 5, there is no evidence demonstrating that the NSC inhibitor functions specifically in the +/K1431M condition without affecting other conditions. To verify its specificity, the authors should test the NSC inhibitor's effects across other conditions in parallel, including a control group. Additionally, cumulative RRP measurements should be provided for a more comprehensive assessment of the inhibitor's impact on synaptic function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the Reviewerâs feedback.</p>
<p>a) Previous studies have shown that Rac1 activity can bidirectionally regulate synchronous release probability (Pr). We used the Rac1-specific inhibitor NSC23766 (NSC) to test how Rac1 inhibition impacted the neurotransmitter release deficits observed in <italic>+/K1431M</italic> mice. We also added control experiments testing the impact of NSC on WT slices. These new experiments are now presented in new Fig. 8 of the revised manuscript, with expanded details in the Results (Lines 737-750) and Discussion (Lines 892-900).</p>
<p>b) To estimate Pr and the RRP, we employed the Decay method as described by (Ruiz et al., 2011), which does not rely on cumulative EPSC plots for RRP estimation. This approach was chosen to account for the initial facilitation in these synapses and fits are done using EPSCs plotted against stimulus number. Additional details have been provided in the Methods section  (Lines 367-373).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Given the relevance to NDD, specifying the age window of the mice used is crucial. It is confusing that the synaptic function studies were conducted at P42, while the proteomic analysis was performed at P21. Could the authors clarify the rationale behind using different age points for these analyses? Consistency in age selection, or an explanation for this variation, would help in interpreting the developmental relevance of the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>P42 was chosen as the age as it represents young adulthood, by which time clinical features will have already presented in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Our prior studies of <italic>NEX-Cre Trio<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice found significant measurable differences from WT at this age, after neuronal migration, differentiation, synaptogenesis and pruning have occurred. An earlier developmental timepoint, P21, which coincides with juvenile age in mice, was chosen for proteomics studies to identify earlier changes and potentially targetable and modifiable mechanisms that could influence the phenotypes we observed in older mice. The experiments in P42 versus P21 mice were originally two independent lines of investigation that converged in the current study.</p>
