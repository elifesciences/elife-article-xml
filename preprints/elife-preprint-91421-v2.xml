<abstract>
<p>The dominant models of learning and memory, such as Hebbian plasticity, propose that experiences are transformed into memories through input-specific synaptic plasticity at the time of learning. However, synaptic plasticity is neither strictly input specific nor restricted to the time of its induction. The impact of such forms of non-Hebbian plasticity on memory has been difficult to test, hence poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that synaptic manipulations can deviate from the Hebbian model of learning, yet produce a lasting memory. First, we established a weak associative conditioning protocol, where optogenetic stimulation of sensory thalamic input to the amygdala was paired with a footshock, but no detectable memory was formed. However, when the same input was potentiated minutes before or after, or even 24 hours later, the associative experience was converted to a lasting memory. Importantly, potentiating an independent input to the amygdala minutes but not 24 hours after the pairing produced a lasting memory. Thus, our findings suggest that the process of transformation of a transient experience into a memory is neither restricted to the time of the experience nor to the synapses triggered by it; instead, it can be influenced by past and future events.</p>

<p>Experience-dependent synaptic plasticity is widely regarded as the substrate of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kandel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mayford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Squire and Kandel, 2009</xref>), but see,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gallistel and King, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gershman, 2023</xref>). The dominant cellular model of learning, Hebbian plasticity, requires temporal and spatial specificity: the strength of a memory can be modified temporally only at the time of learning and spatially only at the encoding synapse and no other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Malenka and Bear, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Maxwell Cowan et al., 2003</xref>). The most studied form of such plasticity is homo-synaptic long-term potentiation (homoLTP) of synaptic transmission or, as commonly known, LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Malenka and Bear, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Maxwell Cowan et al., 2003</xref>). However, synaptic plasticity is neither temporally restricted to the time of the induction of the potentiation nor it is spatially confined to a single synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Koch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Stuart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yuste, 2010</xref>). Conceivably, therefore, the strength of a memory outside the time of learning can be modified by synaptic potentiation at the encoding synaptic input (homoLTP) or even in an independent input (heterosynaptic LTP, heteroLTP).</p>
<p>HeteroLTP has been identified in various synaptic pathways where a transient LTP can be stabilized by the induction of a more stable form of LTP on other synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fonseca, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Frey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Frey and Morris, 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shires et al., 2012</xref>). Heter-oLTP is not limited to the synapses that are already potentiated. In fact, heteroLTP can be induced in non-potentiated synapses as long as they receive subthreshold stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hedrick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Murakoshi et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequent studies established a temporal window, ranging from minutes to tens of minutes, within which heteroLTP can be induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bear, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Clopath et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Govindarajan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kastellakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kastellakis and Poirazi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">O’Donnell and Sejnowski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Redondo and Morris, 2011</xref>). Thus, an LTP protocol can produce synaptic potentiation at the stimulated synapses (Hebbian homoLTP), but it also modulates plasticity at other synapses that converge onto the same neuron (non-Hebbian heteroLTP). Consequently, the phenomenon of heteroLTP may accompany a homoLTP but remain undetected.</p>
<p>This has motivated us to examine the impact of LTP stimuli delivered to one set of synapses on memories formed by inputs to the same or a convergent set of synapses. Specifically, we asked if the two forms of plasticity (Hebbian homoLTP and non-Hebbian heteroLTP) differ in their efficacy in converting a transient experience to a lasting memory; and if the time window between the experience and the induction of plasticity influences the stabilization of the memory. In this work, we performed a side-by-side comparison between the Hebbian and non-Hebbian forms of LTP to answer these questions. We observed that the non-Hebbian form of plasticity which deviates from Hebbian rules is effective in stabilizing an otherwise transient aversive experience.</p>

<title>Rationale for the approaches taken in this study</title>
<p>In general, to establish a causal link between changes in synaptic weight to the memory strength, we must fulfill a set of criteria. First, one must know which synapses encode the memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stevens, 1998</xref>). For this, it is necessary to probe the synaptic inputs whose strength can be measured and modified. One must further show that modifying these inputs produces a quantifiable behavioral readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jeong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kim and Cho, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Klavir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, to test the effect of heteroLTP, one must induce plasticity on an independent synaptic input that modifies the strength of the memory. This independent activation requires a means to selectively and independently activate the two synaptic inputs-a nontrivial task in an <italic>in vivo</italic> preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the temporal and spatial properties of non-Heb-bian plasticity in relation to memory and behavior, we chose the defensive circuit in the lateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fanselow and Poulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Herry and Johansen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Maren and Quirk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pape and Pare, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sah et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stevens, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). First, most of its excitatory neurons receive inputs from two sources, thalamus and auditory/associative cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Humeau et al., 2005</xref>). Second, when these neurons receive a neutral conditioned stimulus (tone, CS) followed by an aversive unconditioned stimulus (shock, US), their synapses are potentiated to encode a memory of the aversive experience (conditioned response, CR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fanselow and Poulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Herry and Johansen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Janak and Tye, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Maren and Quirk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pape and Pare, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sah et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>). To gain synapse-specific access to the CS input, we replaced a tone with optogenetic stimulation of the thalamic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jeong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kim and Cho, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>). This allowed precise control and monitoring of the strength of the synaptic inputs encoding the memory(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jeong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kim and Cho, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Weak associative conditioning does not produce a lasting memory</title>
<p>The main objective of this work is to examine the efficacy of different forms of LTP in producing a lasting memory of an otherwise transient experience. Therefore, the memory under investigation must, by its nature, not be a lasting one. We have previously shown that an enduring CR can be produced by multiple pairs of optical co-activation of thalamic and auditory/associative cortical inputs with a footshock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>). We reasoned that reducing the number of pairings as well as the duration of the footshock should result in a less robust CR. As will become clear later, here we must be able to produce a CR by using only one input. Therefore, we asked whether pairing optical activation of thalamic inputs alone with footshock can produce a lasting CR, and whether we can reduce the CR by using fewer pairings of CS and US, and with shorter US duration.</p>
<p>We injected an AAV virus expressing a fast, blue-shifted variant of channelrhodopsin, oChIEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lin et al., 2013</xref>), in the lateral thalamus. To optically activate the thalamic inputs to the LA, we implanted a fiber optic above the dorsal tip of the LA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="figED1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). An optical CS alone did not produce a CR (<xref rid="figED1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>), whereas temporal (but not non-temporal) multiple pairings of the optical CS with a footshock produced a freezing response (CR) measured 24hrs later (60%±7), indicating the formation of a long-term associative memory (<xref rid="figED1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>). Importantly, reducing the number of pairings with shorter US duration resulted in a significant reduction in the CR 24hrs following the conditioning (7%±2) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>, <xref rid="figED1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>

<title>HomoLTP stimulus produces a lasting memory in weak associative conditioning</title>
<p>We next examined the efficacy of the LTP protocol in producing a long-term memory at different time points from the weak conditioning protocol. Delivering an optical LTP stimulus immediately before or after such a conditioning protocol on the same inputs (homoLTP) produced a lasting CR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Remarkably, a homoLTP stimulus, even when delivered 24hrs after the conditioning, could produce a rapid CR comparable in magnitude to that obtained with immediate homoLTP. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). HomoLTP was as effective in mice that were tested prior to the induction protocol as those that were not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1d,e</xref>). It is notable that a homoLTP stimulus in naïve animals failed to produce a CR (<xref rid="figED1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1b</xref>); whereas it did produce a CR as long as the animals received the conditioning protocol (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). To confirm that optical homoLTP protocol was producing the expected effect on synaptic strength, we performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> recording from the LA in anesthetized mice expressing oChIEF in the thalamic inputs. Brief light pulses at the recording site produced <italic>in vivo</italic> field potentials which were potentiated by optical homoLTP stimulus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Toward independent optical activation of thalamic and cortical inputs: Rendering a red-shifted channelrhodopsin insensitive to blue light</title>
<p>In addition to the thalamic inputs, most neurons within the LA receive direct projections from the cortical regions (auditory/associative) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Humeau et al., 2005</xref>). We, therefore, asked whether synaptic potentiation on the cortical inputs (heteroLTP) following the weak conditioning of thalamic inputs is effective in producing a long-term CR, as predicted by computational models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">O’Donnell and Sejnowski, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Conceptually, the converging cortical and thalamic inputs to the LA can be activated independently using two opsins of distinct excitation spectra. The main obstacle is that all opsins, regardless of their preferred excitation spectrum, are activated by blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). Recent attempts addressed this problem by pairing blue-light sensitive anion channels with red-shifted ChR2, where red light derives action potentials, while blue light, through shunting inhibition, nullifies the effect of the red-shifted ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mermet-Joret et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Vierock et al., 2021</xref>). However, this approach, which is based on chloride influx, is not suitable for axonal terminal activation, where the chloride concentration is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mahn et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2016</xref>).</p>
<p>A previous study demonstrated that prolonged illumination of axons expressing a red-shifted ChR2 reversibly renders the axons insensitive to further light excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hooks et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore tested whether thalamic axons expressing Chrim-sonR can become transiently non-responsive to blue light by the co-illumination with a yellow light. It must be noted that yellow light minimally activates the blue shifted ChR2, oChIEF, (data not shown) the opsin that was later combined with ChrimsonR for independent optical activation of the thalamic and cortical axons. While activation of the thalamic axons expressing ChrimsonR by short pulses of blue light (10-15mW) was effective in evoking a field potential, the light failed to produce a discernible response when the illumination coincided with a 500ms yellow light of submilliwatt intensity. This was evident in whole cell recording from slices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a-c</xref>) as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> with single-pulse or high frequency stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-h</xref>). With the co-illumination, fiber volley and excitatory postsynaptic potential (the pre- and postsynaptic components, respectively) largely disappeared (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). The responses gradually recovered to their original values within hundreds of milliseconds (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). These data indicate that the observed insensitivity of ChrimsonR to blue light is more likely caused by the transient inactivation of the opsin rather than by the transmitter depletion or subthreshold depolarization of the axons. With an effective dual-color optical activation system at our disposal, we proceeded to investigate the effect of heteroLTP on the memory strength.</p>

<p>As shown in the previous section, the delivery of an LTP protocol on the conditioned input (homoLTP) strengthens the memory even if delivered with a 24hrs delay. We then investigated whether heteroLTP protocol similarly maintains its efficacy when a long period has elapsed since conditioning.

<title>Homo- and heteroLTP stimuli produce a lasting memory in unpaired conditioning</title>
<p>It has been shown that the thalamic→LA pathway, in addition to its role in the auditory-cued fear learning, is required for the formation of contextual fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>). This can be explained by the fact that the lateral thalamus, the thalamic gateway to the LA, collects signals from different brain regions of diverse modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Khalil et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ledoux et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Linke et al., 1999</xref>). We, therefore, asked if, in addition to cued associative conditioning, an LTP protocol can produce CR in an unpaired form of conditioning on the thalamic→LA pathway. First, we tested whether the thalamic inputs convey a footshock signal to the LA, which is a prerequisite for this paradigm. For this purpose, we took advantage of fiber photometry in freely moving mice. AAV virus expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP7s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dana et al., 2019</xref>) was expressed in the thalamic inputs. GCaMP signal was collected through a fiber optic implanted above the tip of the LA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, <xref rid="figED3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3a,b</xref>). The time-locked GCaMP activity of the thalamic projections to the onset of the footshock was evident, demon-strating that the thalamic inputs convey the footshock signal to the LA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), confirming previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barsy et al., 2020</xref>). To further confirm this, we recorded the activity of the LA during footshock in mice with ablated lateral thalamus. This was done by the co-injection of AAV vectors expressing DIO-ta-Capsase3 and Cre recombinase in the lateral medial thalamus and GCaMP8m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) postsynaptically in the basolateral amygdala (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref rid="figED3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3c,d</xref>). The control group underwent the same procedure, but the thalamus was spared (no Cre-recombinase was injected). In the thalamic-lesioned mice, the footshock-evoked response in the LA was significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). This further demonstrates that the aversive signal to the LA is conveyed largely through the thalamic inputs.</p>

<p>Next, we asked whether the induction of synaptic potentiation in this pathway following an unpaired conditioning, where footshock is not paired with the CS, would produce a long-term CR. It must be noted that previously we have shown that this protocol does not produce a detectable post-conditioning synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>). Mice expressing AAV-oChIEF in the thalamic inputs received optical homoLTP stimulus on these inputs either immediately or 24hrs after the unpaired conditioning (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Immediate homoLTP stimulus, indeed, proved to be effective in producing a lasting CR even for the unpaired conditioning (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>); it is noteworthy that neither unpaired conditioning alone, nor optical homoLTP stimulus in naïve animals produced a CR (<xref rid="figED4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). HomoLTP protocol when delivered 24hrs later, produced an increase in freezing; however, the value was not statistically significant (<xref rid="figED4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4b</xref>). This observation is consistent with a previous report using only the unconditioned stimulus footshock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al., 2020</xref>). This phenomenon is distinct from the paired form of conditioning which is receptive to ho-moLTP manipulation irrespective of the time of the delivery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the behavioral consequence of heter-oLTP stimulus on the unpaired conditioning. Mice expressing AAV-ChrimsonR in the thalamic and AAV-oChIEF in the cortical inputs received optical LTP stimulus on the cortical inputs immediately after footshocks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>, <xref rid="figED4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>). In this group, heteroLTP protocol produced a CR, which was comparable in magnitude to the paired conditioned animals (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref> with <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on this observation, we asked whether heteroLTP stimulus can induce potentiation in the thalamic synaptic inputs which were activated merely by footshock. Indeed, we observed that following footshocks, optical LTP delivery on the cortical inputs induced lasting potentiation on the thalamic pathway despite the fact that footshock on its own did not produce any detectable form of postsynaptic potentiation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i,j</xref>). With-out a footshock, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the cortical inputs did not induce synaptic potentiation on the thalamic pathway (<xref rid="figED4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>). Therefore, although footshock on its own does not produce a detectable synaptic potentiation in thalamic inputs, it is required for heterosynaptic potentiation of this pathway.</p>

<p>The baseline for the evoked field potential and the input-output curve of both pathways were recorded prior to the conditioning (<xref rid="figED5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>). Blue light pulses produced smaller evoked responses when coincided with submilliwatt long pulses of yellow light (data not shown). This further supports the efficacy of the dual optical activation approach that we adopted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), which permits independent activation of the converging thalamic and cortical inputs in behaving mice. To induce a weak conditioning protocol on the thalamic inputs, mice received red light stimulation co-terminated with a footshock (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>).

<p>Up to this point, we have shown that a memory and the underlying synaptic weight can be strengthened by the induction of LTP on an independent pathway. However, the notion of change in synaptic strength using an independent pathway was originally observed in slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fonseca, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Frey and Morris, 1997b</xref>). We therefore tested if the two pathways which we used for our behavioral manipulations can undergo similar changes in synaptic weight in a slice preparation where we have a more precise control on the activation and monitoring of synaptic plasticity. Stimulation of the thalamic inputs with a weak induction protocol (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>) resulted in a transient form of potentiation that regressed to the baseline within 90 minutes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). However, when the weak conditioning protocol was followed by a strong conditioning protocol on the converging cortical inputs, it produced a stable form of potentiation that lasted for the entire duration of the recording (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e,f</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Numerous forms of synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) have been described but their relation to long-term memory is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the temporal and input specificity learning rules by which Hebbian and non-Hebbian forms of synaptic potentiation modify the strength of a memory. We found that the strength of a memory can be enhanced by potentiating the synaptic inputs encoding that memory (homoLTP) prior to or after an aversive conditioning. Importantly, we show that potentiation of an independent synaptic input (heteroLTP) minutes after the conditioning is as effective in strengthening the memory.</p>
<p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology recordings from freely moving animals showed a strong correlation between synaptic potentiation and the successful recall of the aversive memory, as late as 24hrs after the induction of heteroLTP; all the mice with the successful recall had a successful potentiation of the synaptic input (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b,c</xref>). This was accompanied by a lasting potentiation of the cortical input-the input that was used to induce heteroLTP in the thalamic inputs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). Such a lasting behavioral and electrophysiological consequence of heteroLTP has not been reported before.</p>
<p>The efficacy of heteroLTP stimulus when delivered 24hrs after the conditioning drops considerably, whereas homoLTP retains its capacity to strengthen the memory. These data are consistent with the Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC) model, which predicts that a heteroLTP protocol can stabilize a transient synaptic potentiation when induced minutes, but not hours prior to or after a weak LTP protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Redondo and Morris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rogerson et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising finding in this work is that ho-moLTP as well as heteroLTP effectively uncover an aversive memory in an unpaired conditioning paradigm; this form of conditioning on its own does not produce a detectable memory (<xref rid="figED4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a</xref>). It is important to note that previously we have shown that unpaired conditioning not only fails to produce a CR, but also does not induce synaptic potentiation, as predicted by Hebbian models of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, in our <italic>in vivo</italic> recording, where anesthetized mice received multiple footshocks, no synaptic potentiation of thalamic inputs was detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4j</xref>). The same protocol, however, when followed by heteroLTP stimulus, resulted in a synaptic potentiation that lasted for the entire duration of the recording (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref>). This is not predicted by the STC model in which heteroLTP works only on the already potentiated synaptic inputs. In this respect, this phenomenon is more in line with the Cross Talk model, which predicts heteroLTP can result in potentiation of synapses that have undergone subthreshold stimulation but no potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Harvey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</xref>). In the present context, the subthreshold activation could be the result of stimulation, and hence priming of the thalamic inputs by footshock. This is supported by the fact that in the absence of a footshock, LTP stimulus produces neither a CR nor a heterosynaptic potentiation (<xref rid="figED4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a,d</xref>). As such, it appears that the mere potentiation of thalamic inputs is not sufficient to produce a memory, and some form of priming through associative or unpaired conditioning is essential.</p>
<p>Since we show that the thalamic inputs convey the footshock signal, the recovery of the CR following the LTP protocol on the same inputs (homoLTP) could be considered as a form of reinstatement, a well-known phenomenon where the mere presentation of a footshock after an extinguished CR reinstates the CR (Bouton, 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bouton and Bolles, 1979</xref>). We think this is unlikely. First, we show that homoLTP is equally effective before the formation of the association. Additionally, we have shown previously that an LTP protocol is ineffective in restoring an extinguished CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>It must be noted that computational models simulating a circuit with comparable pre- and postsynaptic layouts to ours yield similar results; that is heteroLTP stabilizes a weak memory. However, according to these models, heteroLTP in brain circuits with different pre- and postsynaptic arrangements, may produce different physiological and behavioral outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">O’Donnell and Sejnowski, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>What cellular mechanisms could underlie the electrophysiological and behavioral phenomena we observed here? We consider some forms of postsynaptic intracellular diffusion from strongly stimulated cortical inputs to weakly stimulated neighboring thalamic inputs, as proposed by the Cross Talk and STC models. On the other hand, we consider the possibility of extra-cellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1997</xref>) such as glutamate spillover to be unlikely. Extracellular communication is mainly reported in the circuits at early developmental stages which lack a tight extracellular matrix sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Asztely et al., 1997</xref>). Additionally, as we have shown here (<xref rid="figED4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref>) and reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Doyère et al., 2003</xref>), LTP induction on the cortical input produces no heterosynaptic effect on the naïve thalamic inputs. Taken together, our data point to an intracellular mechanism, which requires a prior priming but not necessarily a prior synaptic potentiation.</p>
<p>Consistent with this notion and complementary to our work, several studies have investigated the molecular and neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying endurance of memories. For example, it has been shown that exposure to a novel experience strengthens memory encoding in appetitive and aversive learning paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ballarini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, activation of dopaminergic inputs to the hippocampus after memory encoding enhances memory persistence, mimicking the effect of environmental novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rossato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> protein synthesis dependence and/or neuromodulator-signaling were suggested to be essential for this phenomenon. At this stage, we have no ground to speculate about the molecular mechanisms underlying our observations. Further studies are needed to reveal the molecular machinery that enables non-Hebbian forms of plasticity that modify a memory and its synaptic strength across time and synapses.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>Mice were 7-9 weeks at the time of stereotaxic surgery. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and maintained at 1% throughout the surgery in the stereotaxic setup (Kopf 940) and a heating pad maintained body temperature at 37 degrees Celsi-us. Viruses were injected with a volume of 500-700 nL over 3-4 minutes. Auditory/associative cortex coordinates (all in mm and from Bregma) are (−2.85 AP, -4.4 ML and +1.6 DV (from the skull surface)). Lateral thalamus coordinates are (−3.15 AP, -1.85 ML and +3.5 DV (from the skull surface)). LA coordinates are (−1.65 AP, -3.45 ML and +3.45 DV (from the skull surface)). Optic fiber cannulas were cemented with dental cement, Super-bond (SUN MEDICAL, Japan). All the injections and optic fibers implantations were performed in the right hemisphere.</p>

<title>Optogenetics</title>
<p>ChR expressing AAVs were injected into the thalamic and the cortical regions projecting to the LA, and a 6-8 week expression time was given to allow for a high and stable expression in the axons. In freely moving mice, a 200 micrometer (Thorlabs 200 EMT, NA 0.39) optic fibers cannulae were implanted in the same surgery to target LA. The optic fiber cannulae were fabricated manually. The optic fiber was scored with an optic fiber scribe (Thorlabs s90 carbide scribe) and then pulled to break. Next, the optic fiber was inserted into the ferrule, and the output was measured with a power meter (Coherent Laser Check); 10 percent loss was the maximum allowed loss after coupling to the patch cord (Thorlabs 200 um NA 0.39). After-ward, the length was adjusted to 4mm (the exposed optic fiber) and glued with a UV curable glue. After gluing, the opposite end was scored and cut, and the output was measured again. The light output was confirmed to have a concentric-circle pattern.</p>
<p>In experiments with oChIEF, a 450 nm laser diode (Doric) was used with a light intensity of 10-15 mW. In the experiments with ChRimsonR, a 638 nm laser diode (Doric) was used with a light intensity of 10-15 mW, and a 561 nm laser diode (Vortran Laser Technology, USA) at the intensity of 1 mW for co-illumination when performing independent optical activation. All the freely moving experiments were done with a rotary joint (Doric Lenses, Canada). After each experiment, the verification of the brain stimulation location was performed after PFA fixation and slicing. For optimal optic fiber tract marking, the whole head of the mouse was left in 10% formalin for a week with agitation. Mice were excluded if the viral expression and/or the optic fiber locations were off target.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with Ure-thane, Ethyl-Carbamate 2 mg/kg and placed in the stereotaxic setup, and a heating pad maintained the body temperature at 37 degrees Celsius. Multichannel system ME2100 was used for signal acquisition, and a Neuronexus opto-silicone probe with 32 channels was used to record the signal. Raw data were filtered (0.1–3000 Hz), amplified (100×), digitized, and stored (10 kHz sampling rate) for offline analysis with a tethered recording system (Multichannel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany). Analysis was performed using custom routines. The initial slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials was measured as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>.</p>
<p>The light-evoked signal was recorded from the LA in the right hemisphere. For LTP experiments, a baseline of the light-evoked fEPSP was measured for at least 20 minutes or until it was stable at 0.033 Hz, 1-2 ms pulses. At the of the baseline recording, 3 mild foot shocks were delivered to the mouse at the same intervals and intensity as the behavioral protocol. Only mice in <xref rid="figED4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d</xref> did not receive foot shocks. After the foot shock delivery, an HFS stimulation protocol was applied. The protocol consisted of 20 trains of 200 pulses of 2 ms, 450 nm light at 85 Hz with a 40-second inter-train interval. Immediately after the HFS, the light-evoked fEPSP was measured for at least 45 minutes to ensure the stability of the outcome of the LTP. This HFS protocol was used for all the experiments with HFS stimulation.</p>
<p>In the experiment that involved drug application, approximately 1μL of the drug (TTX: 10 ng or NBQX: 1 μg) was applied onto the shank of the silicone probe and was inserted again. After each experiment, the brain recording location was verified through a stereoscope after PFA fixation and slicing.</p>
<p>For <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings from freely moving mice, a customized microdrive was designed to enable concurrent optical stimulation and recording of neuronal activity (modified from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</xref>)). The microdrive was loaded with a single shuttle driving a bundle of 3 tetrodes (Sandvik) and one 200 μm-diameter optical fiber (Doric lenses). Three weeks after virus injection, microdrive was implanted. For this, mice were anesthetized with 0.5 mg/kg FMM composed of the following mixture: 0.05 mg/ml of fentanyl ([Hameln, 007007] 0.05 mg/ kg), 5 mg/mL of midazolam ([Hameln, 002124] 5 mg/kg), and 1 mg/mL of medetomidine (VM Pharma, 087896). To target the LA in the right hemisphere, a ∼1mm diameter hole was drilled through the skull at the coordinates AP, −1.8 mm; ML, +3.4 mm. The microdrive was positioned with the help of a stereotaxic arm (Kopf Instruments) above the hole with protruding tetrodes. The optical fiber and tetrodes were gradually lowered to a depth of 500 μm from the brain surface. A screw electrode was placed above the cerebellum to serve as the reference and ground electrode. The microdrive was secured to the skull with ultraviolet light curable dental cement (Vitrebond Plus) followed by a layer of Superbond (SUN MEDICAL). Tetrodes and the optical fiber were lowered by a further 2500 μm before mice recovered from anesthesia. The post-operative analgesia Buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg, S.C.) was administered 30 min before the end of surgery. Mice were allowed to recover for at least a week after the implantation.</p>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings were performed using a Neuralynx Cheetah 32 system. The electrical signal was sampled at 32 kHz and band-pass filtered between 0.1–8000 Hz.</p>

<p>Experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Buenos Aires (CICUAL). Briefly, 4-week old C57 mice (n = 4) were injected with 250nl of AAV-1/2-hSyn1-chI-ChrimsonR_tdTomato-WPRE-SV40p at the MGN. After 3 weeks of expression, the animals were sacrificed and the brain removed and cut in 300 µm coronal slices in a solution composed of (in mM): 92 N-Methyl-D-glucamine, 25 glucose, 30 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 20 HEPES, 2 Thiourea, 5 Na-ascobate, 3 Na-pyruvate, 10 MgCl2, and 0.5 CaCl2 (equilibrated to pH 7.4 with 95% O2–5% CO2); chilled at 4°C. Slices containing the BLA were transferred to a 37 °C warmed chamber filled with the same solution and incubated for 10 minutes. After this period slices were transferred to a standard ACSF solution of composition (in mM): 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2 and 10 Glucose (pH 7.4), at room temperature. Recordings started 1 hour later and were performed in this same ACSF solution. Patch-clamp recordings were done under a microscope (Nikon) connected to a Mightex Illumination system for 470 nm, and 532 nm light delivery. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were done using a K-gluconate based intracellular solution of the following composition (in mM): 130 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.6 EGTA, 2.5 MgCl2.6H2O, 10 Phosphocreatine, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.4 GTP-Na3. Glutamatergic AMPA mediated synaptic responses were recorded at -60 mV holding potential under blockage of GABAa and NMDA receptors (Picrotoxin 100 µM and APV 100 µM). Light stimulation consisted in 2 ms pulses of 470 nm light at 10 mW, co-illumination consisted in 450 ms of 532 nm light at 1 mW that co-terminated with stimulation light.</p>

<p>A total of 15 slices prepared from 10 Black6/J mice (3-5 week old) were used for electrophysiological recordings. All procedures were approved by the Portuguese Veterinary Office (Direcção Geral de Veterinária e Alimentação - DGAV). Coronal brain slices (300 µm) containing the lateral amygdala were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fonseca, 2013</xref>). Whole-cell current-clamp synaptic responses were recorded using glass electrodes (7-10MΩ; Harvard apparatus, UK), filled with internal solution containing (in mM): K-gluconate 120, KCl 10, Hepes 15, Mg-ATP 3, Tris-GTP 0.3 Na-phosphocreatine 15, Creatine-Kinase 20U/ ml (adjusted to 7.25 pH with KOH, 290mOsm). Putative pyramidal cells were selected by assessing their firing properties in response to steps of current. Only cells that had a resting potential of less than -60mV without holding current were taken further into the recordings. Neurons were kept at -70mV with a holding current below -0.25nA. In current clamp recordings, the series resistance was monitored throughout the experiment and ranged from 30MΩ-40MΩ. Electrophysiological data were collected using an RK-400 amplifier (Bio-Logic, France) filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 10kHz using a Lab-PCI-6014 data acquisition board (National Instruments, Austin, TX) and stored on a PC. Offline data analysis was performed using a customized LabView-program (National Instruments, Austin, TX). To evoke synaptic EPSP, tungsten stimulating electrodes (Science Products, GmbH, Germany) were placed on afferent fibers from the internal capsule (thalamic input) and from the external capsule. Pathway independence was checked by applying two pulses with a 30ms interval to either thalamic or cortical inputs and confirming the absence of crossed pair-pulse facilitation. EPSPs were recorded with a test pulse frequency for each individual pathway of 0.033 Hz. After 15 min of baseline, transient LTP was induced with a weak tetanic stimulation (25 pulses at a frequency of 100 Hz, repeated three times with an interval of 3 sec) whereas long-lasting LTP was induced with a strong tetanic stimulation (25 pulses at a frequency of 100 Hz, repeated five times, with an interval of 3 sec).</p>
<p>As a measure of synaptic strength, the initial slope of the evoked EPSPs was calculated and expressed as percent changes from the baseline mean. Error bars denote SEM values. For the statistical analysis, LTP values were averaged over 5 min data bins immediately after LTP induction (T Initial) and at the end of the recording (T Final 95-100 minutes). LTP decay was calculated by [(T Initial –T Final)/T Final*100].</p>

<title>Fiber Photometry</title>
<p>GCaMP fluorescent signal was acquired by Doric fiber photometry system and through an optic fiber that is identical to the optogenetics ones described above. A pigtailed rotary joint (Doric) was used for all fiber photometry experiments in freely moving mice. Doric Lenses single site Fiber Photometry Systems with a standard 405/465 nm system fluorescent minicube ilFMC4-G2_E(460-490)_F(500-540)_O(580-680)_S. The 405 nm was modulated at 208.616 Hz, and 465 nm was modulated at 572.205 Hz through the LED module driver. When the fiber photometry experiments were combined with optogenetics and/or electrophysiology recordings, the 638 nm laser diode was used to deliver the red light. A TTL generator device (Master 9) was used to time stamp the signals. The data was acquired through Doric Studio and analyzed in Doric studio and by a custom MatLab script. The code used for the analysis is freely available at the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/NabaviLab-Git/Photometry-Signal-Analysis">https://github.com/NabaviLab-Git/Photometry-Signal-Analysis</ext-link>. Briefly, the signals were downsampled to 120 Hz using local averaging. A first order polynomial was fitted onto the data, using the least squares method. To calculate the relative change in fluorescence, the raw GCaMP signal was normalized using the fitted signal, according to the following equation: \ deltaF/F = (GCaMP signal - fitted signal)/(fitted signal). Behavioural events of interest were extracted and standardized using the mean and standard deviation of the baseline period.</p>

<title>Behavior</title>
<p>Eight weeks after the AAV injection, around 2 p.m., the mice were single-housed 20 minutes before the conditioning in identical cages to the home cages. Ugo Basile Aversive conditioning setup was used for all the experiments. The conditioning protocol was preceded by a pre-test, optical stimulation at 10 Hz for 30 seconds testing optical CS, identical to the one used in the 24-hours test. This step ensures that optical stimulation before conditioning and HFS does not cause any freezing or seizures. The strong conditioning protocol consisted of 5 pairings of a 2-seconds long optical CS at 10 hz, 20 pulses, co-terminated (last 15 pulses) with a 1.5-second foot shock 1 mA. The weak conditioning protocol was composed of 3 pairings of a 1.5-seconds long optical CS at 10 hz, 15 pulses, co-terminated (last 10 pulses) with a 1-second foot shock 1 mA. Twenty four hours later, the mice were tested in a modified context with bedding on the context floor, and chamber lights switched off. The mice were given a 2-minute baseline period or until they maintained a stable movement index and did not freeze at least 1 minute before the delivery of the testing optical CS. The testing optical CS was delivered twice, 2 minutes apart. Freezing was automatically measured through Anymaze (Stoelting, Ireland; version 5.3). Freezing percentages indicated the time the mouse spent freezing (in the 2 CSs) divided by 60 and multiplied by 100. The unpaired conditioning had the same number of pairings and parameters of the optical CS and the foot shock, as the weak conditiong protocol, with the difference that they were never paired, separated by 1 to 3 minutes.</p>
<p>Depending on the experiment, the HFS protocols (described above) were either delivered in the conditioning chamber with-in 5 minutes from the beginning or at the end of the conditioning session, or in testing chamber within 5 minutes from the end of the 24 hours recall. The control groups remained in the same context for the same amount of time as the mice that received the HFS protocol.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors goal here was to explore how a non hebbian form of plasticity, heterosynaptic LTP, could shape neuronal responses and learning. They used several conceptually and technically innovative approaches to answer this. First, they identified a behavioral paradigm that was a subthreshold training paradigm (stimulation of thalamic inputs with a footshock), which could be 'converted' to a memory via homosynaptic LTP (HFS of thalamic inputs). They then find that stimulation of 'cortical' inputs could also convert the subthreshold stimulation to a lasting memory, and that this was associated with a change in neuronal response, akin to LTP. Finally, they provide some slice work which demonstrated that stimulation of cortical inputs could stabilize LTP at thalamic inputs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The approach was innovative and asked an important question in the field.</p>
<p>(2) The studies are, for the most part, quite rigorous, using a novel dual opsin approach to probe multiple inputs in vivo.</p>
<p>(3) The authors explore neural responses both in vivo and ex vivo, as well as leveraging a 'simple' behavior output of freezing.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Faress et al. address how synaptic plasticity (i.e. potentiation induced by high frequency stimulation, HFS) induced at different time points and pathways relative to those active during initial learning can transform memories. They adopt an experimental design developed by Nabavi et al, 2014 to optogenetically induce a weak fear memory by pairing an optical conditioned stimulus (CS) at thalamo-LA synapses with a footshock unconditioned stimulus (US) in male mice. Homosynaptic HFS delivered in the same pathway before or after conditioning transforms the weak memory into a stronger one. Leveraging a new dual wavelength optogenetic approach in vivo, they also show that heterosynaptic (cortico-LA) HFS directly following the opto-conditioning can transform the thalamo-LA induced fear memory, or create a memory when directly delivered after unpaired conditioning. Lastly, they demonstrate that heterosynaptic potentiation of the thalamo-LA pathway accompanies the strengthening of fear memory in freely moving mice. The authors conclude that a transient experience (i.e. weak memory) can be transformed into a stable one by non-Hebbian forms of plasticity.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>This study uses well-defined and elegant optogenetic manipulations of distinct neural pathways in awake behaving mice combined with in vivo recordings, which allows to directly manipulate and monitor synaptic strength and memory. It addresses an interesting, timely, and important question.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>A key experiment with in vivo monitoring of LFPs and behavior (Fig. 5a-c) seems a bit underpowered and input-output curves (extended data 5c) not entirely convincing.</p>
<p>
Ex vivo slice experiments (Fig. 5d-f) are not well aligned with in vivo experimental conditions. While they provide proof of principle, this is not entirely novel (see Fonseca et al, 2013).</p>
<p>Significance and impact</p>
<p>The conclusions are well supported by the data. The significance of the study lies in showing in vivo, that plasticity induced at different times or synaptic pathways than those engaged during learning can modify a memory and the synaptic strength in the neural pathway related to that memory. While heterosynaptic and timing-dependent effects in synaptic plasticity have been described largely ex vivo on shorter time scales, the discovery of lasting behavioral effects on memory is novel. The study was enabled by a combination of clever approaches: creation of a &quot;synthetic&quot; pathway-specific association and a novel dual opsin approach in vivo to probe the role of plasticity in a converging second pathway at the same time.</p>
<p>
This work broadens our understanding of how Hebbian and non-Hebbian forms of plasticity shape neural activity and associative memory and is of broad interest to the neuroscience community.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) There appears to be a flaw in the exploration of cortical inputs. the authors never show that HFS of cortical inputs has no effect in the absence of thalamic stimulation. It appears that there is a citation showing this, but I think it would be important to show this in this study as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand that the reviewer would like us to induce an HFS protocol on cortical input and then test if there is any change in synaptic strength in thalamic input. We have done this experiment which shows that without a footshock, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the cortical inputs did not induce synaptic potentiation on the thalamic pathway (Extended Data Fig. 4d).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) t is somewhat confusing that the authors refer to the cortical input as driving heterosynaptic LTP, but this is not shown until Figure 4J, that after non-associative conditioning (unpaired shock and tone) HFS of the cortex can drive freezing and heterosynaptic LTP of thalamic inputs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that it is in figure 4j and figure 5,b,c which we show electrophysiological evidence for cortical input driving heterosynaptic LTP. It is only to be consistent with our terminology that initially we used behavioral evidence as the proxy for heteroLTP (figure 3c).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>…, the authors are 'surprised' by this outcome, which appears to be what they predict.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed the phrase “To our surprise”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) 'Cortex' as a stimulation site is vague. The authors have coordinates they used, it is unclear why they are not using standard anatomical nomenclature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We replaced “cortex” with “auditory/associative cortex”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors' repeated use of homoLTP and heteroLTP to define the input that is being stimulated makes it challenging to understand the experimental detail. While I appreciate this is part of the goal, more descriptive words such as 'thalamic' and 'cortical' would make this much easier to understand.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that a phrase such as “an LTP protocol on thalamic and cortical inputs” would be more descriptive. We chose the words “homoLTP” and “heteroLTP” only to clarify (for the readers) the physiological relevance of these protocols. We thought by using “thalamic” and “cortical” readers may miss this point. However, when for the first time we introduce the words “homoLTP” and “heteroLTP”, we describe which stimulated pathway each refers to.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) …The experimental schemes in Figs. 1 and 3 (and Fig. 4e and extended data 4a,b) show that one group of animals was subjected to retrieval in the test context at 24 h, then received HFS, which was then followed by a second retrieval session. With this design, it remains unclear what the HFS impacts when it is delivered between these two 24 h memory retrieval sessions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand that the reviewer has raised the concern that the increase in freezing we observed after the HFS protocol (ex. Fig. 1b, the bar labeled as Wth+24hHFSth) could be caused or modulated by the recall prior to the HFS (Fig. 1a, top branch). To address this concern, in a new group of mice, 24 hours after weak conditioning, we induced the HFS protocol, followed by testing (that is, no testing prior to the HFS protocol). We observed that homoLTP was as effective in mice that were tested prior to the induction protocol as those that were not (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1d,e).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be nice to see these data parsed out in a clean experimental design for all experiments (in Figs 1, 3, and 4), that means 4 groups with different treatments that are all tested only once at 24 h, and the appropriate statistical tests (ANOVA). This would also avoid repeating data in different panels for different pairwise comparisons (Fig 1, Fig 3, Fig 4, and extended Fig 4).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we understand the benefit of the reviewer’s suggestion, the current presentation of the data was done to match the flow of the text and the delivery of the information throughout the manuscript. We think it is unlikely that the retrieval test prior to the HFS impacts its effectiveness, as confirmed by homosynaptic HFS data (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). It is beyond the scope of current manuscript to investigate the mechanisms and manipulations related to reconsolidation and retrieval effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) … It would be critical to know if LFPs change over 24 h in animals in which memory is not altered by HFS, and to see correlations between memory performance and LFP changes, as two animals displayed low freezing levels. … They would suggest that thalamo-LA potentiation occurs directly after learning+HFS (which could be tested) and is maintained over 24 h.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed the experiment where we recorded the evoked LFP 2hrs and 24hrs following the weak conditioning protocol. We observed that a weak conditioning protocol that was not followed by an optical LTP protocol on the cortical inputs failed to produce synaptic potentiation of the thalamic inputs (tested 2hrs and 24hrs after the LTP protocol; Extended Data Fig. 5d,e).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The statistical analyses need to be clarified. All statements should be supported with statistical testing (e.g. extended data 5c, pg 7 stats are missing). The specific tests should be clearly stated throughout. For ANOVAs, the post-hoc tests and their outcomes should be stated. In some cases, 2-way ANOVAs were performed, but it seems there is only one independent variable, calling for one-way ANOVA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All the statistical analyses have been revised and the post-hoc tests performed after the ANOVAs are mentioned in the relevant figure legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The wording &quot;transient&quot; and &quot;persistent&quot; used here in the context of memory seems a bit misleading, as only one timepoint was assessed for memory recall (24 h), at which the memory strength (freezing levels) seem to change.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer mentioned, we have tested memory recall only at one time point. For this reason, throughout the text we used “transient” exclusively to refer to the experience (receiving footshock) and not to the memory. We replaced “persistence” with “stabilization” where it refers to a memory (“the induction of plasticity influences the stabilization of the memory”).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the procedures in which the CS and US were not paired, the term &quot;unpairing&quot; is used (which is probably the more adequate one), but the term &quot;non-associative conditioning&quot; appears in the text, which seems a bit misleading, as this term may have another connotation. There is also literature that an unpairing of CS and US could lead to the formation of a safety memory to the CS, that may be disrupted by HFS stimulation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We replaced &quot;non-associative&quot; with “unpaired”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Validation of viral injection sites for all experiments: Only representative examples are shown, it would be nice to see all viral expression sites.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For this manuscript, we have used 155 mice. For this reason, including the injection sites for all the animals in the manuscript is not feasible. Except for the mice that have been excluded, (please see exclusion criteria added in the methods), the expression pattern we observed was consistent across animals and therefore the images shown are true representatives.</p>

<p>It would be nice to scrutinize the results in extended data 4b. The freezing levels with U+24h HFS show a strong trend towards an increase, the effect size may be similar to immediate HFS Fig 4f and extended data 4a) if n was increased.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. To address this point, we added “HomoLTP protocol when delivered 24hrs later, produced an increase in freezing; however, the value was not statistically significant.” To show this point, we used the same scale for freezing in Extended Data Fig. 4a and b.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors did not determine how WTh affects Th-LA synapses, as field EPSPs were recorded only after HFS. WTh was required for the effects of HFS, as HFS alone did not produce CR in naïve and/or unpaired controls. As such the effects of the WTh protocol on synaptic strength must be investigated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed the experiment where we recorded the evoked LFP 2hrs and 24hrs following the weak conditioning protocol. We observed that a weak conditioning protocol that was not followed by an optical LTP protocol on the cortical inputs failed to produce synaptic potentiation of the thalamic inputs (tested 2hrs and 24hrs after the LTP protocol; Extended Data Fig. 5d,e).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors provide some evidence that their dual opsin approach is feasible, particularly the use of sustained yellow light to block the effects of blue light on ChrimsonR. However, this validation was done using single pulses making it difficult to assess the effect of this protocol on Th input when HFS was used. Without strong evidence that the optogenetic methods used here are fault-proof, the main conclusions of this study are compromised. Why did the authors not use a protocol in which fibers were placed directly in the Ctx and Th while using soma-restricted opsins to avoid cross-contamination?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand that the reviewer raises the possibility that our dual-opsin approach, although effective with single pulses, may fail in higher frequency stimulation protocols (10Hz and 85Hz). To address this concern, in a new group of mice we applied our approach to 10Hz and 85Hz stimulation protocols. We show that our approach is effective in single-pulse as well as in 10Hz and 85Hz stimulation protocols (Fig. 2d-h).</p>
