<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Extant ecdysozoans (moulting animals) are represented by a great variety of soft-bodied or articulated organisms that may or may not have appendages. However, controversies remain about the vermiform nature (i.e., elongated and tubular) of their ancestral body plan. We describe here <italic>Beretella spinosa</italic> gen et sp. nov. a tiny (maximal length 3 mm) ecdysozoan from the lowermost Cambrian, Yanjiahe Formation, South China, characterized by an unusual sack-like appearance, single opening, and spiny ornament. <italic>Beretella</italic> has no equivalent among animals, except <italic>Saccorhytus</italic>, also from the basal Cambrian. Phylogenetic analyses resolve both fossil species as a sister group (Saccorhytida) to all known Ecdysozoa, thus suggesting that ancestral ecdysozoans may have been non-vermiform animals. Saccorhytids are likely to represent an early off-shot along the stem-line Ecdysozoa. Although it became extinct during the Cambrian, this animal lineage provides precious insight into the early evolution of Ecdysozoa and the nature of the earliest representatives of the group.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Ediacaran‒Cambrian transition is marked by the appearance in the fossil record of a variety of new body plans that prefigure the majority of present-day animal lineages, including the ecdysozoans, a huge clade that encompasses all invertebrate animals growing through successive moulting stages, such as panarthropods (Arthropoda, Onychophora, Tardigrada), scalidophoran (incl. Priapulida) and nematoid worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Erwin, 2020</xref>). Altogether ecdysozoans represent a very high percentage of animal biodiversity and disparity, inhabiting almost all possible ecological niches on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brusca et al., 2016</xref>). The nature of the last common ancestor of Ecdysozoa (LCAE) remains largely unresolved, even though worms are prevalent before the rise of panarthropods as trace and body fossils in basal Cambrian and late Ediacaran rocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Buatois et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vannier et al., 2010</xref>). Some recent molecular phylogenies also predict that the most basal ecdysozoans were worm-like, elongated organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Laumer et al., 2019</xref>) that possibly diverged in the Ediacaran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rota-Stabelli et al., 2013</xref>). Current reconstruction based on fossil and developmental evidence features the ancestral ecdysozoan as a millimeter-sized worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Budd, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Valentine and Collins, 2000</xref>) with a terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ortega-Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>) or ventral mouth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Martín-Durán and Hejnol, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nielsen, 2019</xref>). Clearly, the discovery of <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shu and Han, 2020b</xref>) in the basal Cambrian of China (Kuanchuanpu Formation; ca. 535 Ma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sawaki et al., 2008</xref>)) that is anything but a worm sowed doubt among scientists. <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> is a sac-like secondarily phosphatized microscopic animal spiked with conical sclerites and a single opening that was first seen as the earliest known deuterostome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han et al., 2017</xref>) but is now considered as an ecdysozoan on more solid grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shu and Han, 2020b</xref>), thus broadening the anatomical spectrum of the group and its disparity in the Cambrian and reopening the debate on the nature of LCAE.</p>
<p>We describe here <italic>Beretella spinosa</italic> gen. et sp. nov. from Member 5 of the Yanjiahe Formation (basal Cambrian Stage 2, ca. 529 Ma, Hubei Province, China) that shares morphological traits with <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> such as an ellipsoidal body, a pronounced bilaterality, a spiny ornament made of broad-based sclerites, and a single opening. Cladistic analyses are made to resolve the position of both <italic>Beretella</italic> and <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> that provide key information on the early evolution of the group.</p>

<title>Remarks</title>
<p>Saccorhytida first appeared in the literature as a new stem-group Deuterostomia that accommodated a single species, <italic>Saccorhytus coronarius</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Since <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> is no longer considered a primitive deuterostome and, instead, more likely belongs to ecdysozoans, Saccorhytida became an extinct Order of Ecdysozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shu and Han, 2020b</xref>). Because both <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> and <italic>Beretella</italic> display major morphological differences with all other known ecdysozoan phyla (Nematoida, Scalidophora, and Panarthropoda), Saccorhytida is tentatively elevated here to the rank of phylum within Ecdysozoa.</p>

<title>Description and comparisons</title>
<p>The body of <italic>Beretella spinosa</italic> is secondarily phosphatized and has a consistent beret-like three-dimensional shape in the lateral view. Its length, width, and height range from 1000 to 2900 μm, 975 to 2450 μm, and 500 to 1000 μm, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, Supplementary Tables 1‒3). The ratio of the maximal length to width is 1.6:1 (Supplementary Fig. 3). As seen in top view, <italic>B. spinosa</italic> shows a small lateral constriction at approximately mid-length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, c</xref>).</p>

<p>The body has a convex, assumedly dorsal side with one, presumably posterior end more elevated than the other (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b, e, i, k</xref>). This elevation is gradual along the sagittal plane and then becomes more abrupt near the low elevated, presumably anterior end. The opposite, assumedly ventral side is less well preserved and seems to have been originally flattened.</p>
<p>The convex side bears a complex ornamented pattern made of five sets (S1‒S5) of spiny sclerites directed towards the more elevated end (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1a, b, d, e, h‒k</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b, d</xref>). These sclerites were originally pointed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1a, d, e, 2b, k, l</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 4a, b, g), but most of them were broken thus revealing an internal cavity and an ellipsoidal transverse section (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1a, b, h‒k</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2a‒e, g</xref>). The broken sclerites show an inner and outer phosphatic layer (thickness ca. 20 to 50 μm) often separated by a thin empty space (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g‒l</xref>).</p>

<p>The convex side bears six prominent conical sclerites (S3) all with a rounded to elliptical well-delimited broad base, distributed in two longitudinal symmetrical pairs with two additional sclerites at both ends of the sagittal plane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, Supplementary Figs. 3e‒h, 4e‒i). A low-relief stripe runs in a sagittal position and vanishes towards the elevated end. It is topped by a row of aligned spines (S1, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>); the one closer to the more elevated end being more tubular and longer. This row is flanked on both sides by smaller aligned spines (S2, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1a, d, h</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2a‒c</xref>). Two relatively sinuous rows of six tiny spines are present parallel to the lateral margins (S4 and S5, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1b, e, h‒j, 2d, e</xref>). The convex side bears a polygonal micro-ornament (mesh size ca. 5 μm wide, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>, Supplementary Tables 1‒3). However, its exact extension is uncertain due to coarse secondary phosphatization. Clusters of spherical phosphatized grains (diameter ca. 20 μm) occur near the sclerite base (Supplementary Fig. 4b).</p>
<p>In most specimens, the flattened side is occupied by a relatively large opening (1200 and 600μm in maximal length and width, respectively) with irregularly defined margins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, f, see also supplementary information movies 1, 2). The flattened side is often largely missing and opens into a spacious internal cavity with no signs of internal organs (e.g. gut and pharynx) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, f</xref>). One specimen shows a tiny spine on the margin of the flattened side (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, g), which differs from other spiny sclerites (S1-S5).</p>
<p>The length of studied specimens ranges from 1.0 to 2.9 mm (Supplementary Fig. 3e‒h). Whether growth was continuous or instead took place via successive moulting stages and cuticular renewal (ecdysis) could not be tested due to the small number of specimens (N=17) available for measurements. No major morphological variations (e.g., a sclerite pattern) can be seen between the smallest and largest specimens of <italic>B. spinosa</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 3e‒h).</p>

<title>Body polarities in <italic>Beretella</italic></title>
<p>The anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) polarities of <italic>Beretella</italic> are uneasy to define because of the lack of modern equivalent among extant animals. In the vast majority of extinct and extant invertebrates for which antero-posterior polarity is defined on the basis of independent criteria (e.g. position of the mouth), sclerites point backwards (e.g. Cambrian scalidophoran worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Han et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Huang et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>Wiwaxia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhang et al., 2015b</xref>)). This is most probably also the case with <italic>Beretella</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, d, j</xref>). The dorsoventral polarity of <italic>Beretella</italic> is supported by the fact that protective sclerites such as spines most commonly occur on the dorsal side of bilaterians (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a, d, j</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s12b">
<title>Comparison with <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> and other ecdysozoans</title>
<p><italic>Beretella spinosa</italic> has no exact equivalent in any Cambrian animals except <italic>Saccorhytus coronarius</italic>, an enigmatic, sac-like ecdysozoan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shu and Han, 2020b</xref>). Both forms share a tiny, poorly differentiated ellipsoidal body, and a set of prominent bilaterally arranged spiny sclerites. Indeed, the broad-based conical sclerites (S3) of <italic>Beretella</italic> are almost identical to those of <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 4d) and have counterparts among scalidophoran worms (Supplementary Fig. 4c). However, they differ in number, ornamented structures, shape, and spatial arrangement. <italic>Beretella</italic> has a much more pronounced dorsoventral differentiation than <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> and its cuticle seems to have been harder and less flexible (see details in Supplementary Tables 1‒3), which altogether the hypothesis of <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> being the larval stage of <italic>Beretella</italic> unlikely. Both <italic>Beretella</italic> and <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> differ from other known ecdysozoans in the lack of an elongated body, introvert, annulations, and through gut (Supplementary Tables 1‒3).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s13a">
<title>Ventral mouth</title>
<p>All bilaterian animals have a digestive system with at least one opening that corresponds to the mouth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brusca et al., 2016</xref>). Although the presumed oral area of <italic>Beretella</italic> is poorly preserved (ventral side often pushed in and largely destroyed), its mouth is likely to be found ventrally (see description), since no other opening occurs on its dorsal side, except those created by broken sclerites. The well-defined dorsoventral polarity of <italic>Beretella</italic> would suggest that the animal was resting on its ventral (flattened) side, the spiny dorsal side playing a protective role.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13b">
<title>Phylogenetic position of <italic>Beretella</italic></title>
<p><italic>Beretella</italic>’s phylogenetic affinities remain elusive due to the lack of information concerning its internal anatomy and ventral side. Its scleritome consists of isolated conical sclerites that were the cuticular outgrowths of a seemingly rigid integument that covered both sides of the animal. Such conical sclerites have close counterparts in Cambrian ecdysozoans such as scalidophoran worms (e. g. <italic>Eokinorhynchus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Zhang et al., 2015a</xref>)), lobopodians (e.g. <italic>Onychodictyon ferox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hou et al., 1991</xref>)) and even more clearly <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> that recent cladistic analyses resolved as a branch of the total-group Ecdysozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). These sclerites, unknown in other animal groups, suggest that both <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> and <italic>Beretella</italic> belongs to Ecdysozoa (moulting animals) although more direct fossil evidence such as exuviae or features suggesting cuticular moulting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Daley and Drage, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) are missing.</p>
<p>Cladistic analyses were performed to test the relation of <italic>Beretella</italic> and <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> to other ecdysozoan groups and, more generally, their phylogenetic relationships with other bilaterian groups (see details in Supplementary Figures 6-9). Both taxa join in a clade (Saccorhytida, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>‒c) and are resolved as members of total-group Ecdysozoa. This clade is the sister group of Cycloneuralia plus Panarthropoda (crown-group Ecdysozoa, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3d</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, Supplementary Figs. 6-9). These results are consistent with the body plan of Saccorhytida being markedly different from that of crown-group ecdysozoans that all have an elongated body and differentiated structures, such as, in Cycloneuralia, the introvert and pharyngeal complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s13c">
<title>The ancestral ecdysozoan body plan</title>
<p>Molecular clock analyses often place the divergence of Ecdysozoa relatively deep into the Ediacaran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Rota-Stabelli et al., 2013</xref>), thus highlighting major discrepancy with the known fossil record of the group. Potential ecdysozoans occur in the late Precambrian as suggested by (i) sclerites resembling those of extant priapulids, found in Ediacaran Small Carbonaceous Fossils assemblages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Moczydłowska et al., 2015</xref>) and (ii) locomotion traces presumably made by scalidophoran worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Buatois et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vannier et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of fossil data for other groups such as nematoids, scalidophorans are potentially the oldest known representatives of Ecdysozoa. Recent Bayesian analyses based on a large molecular data set obtained from the 8 extant ecdysozoan phyla recover Scalidophora as the sister-group to Nematoida + Panarthropoda and suggest that ecdysozoans probably diverged in the Ediacaran, possibly some 23 million years before the oldest fossil occurrence (trace fossils) of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Howard et al., 2022</xref>). Although this study does not speculate on the nature of the last common ancestor of Ecdysozoa, it is consistent with the view that the earliest representatives of the group were probably worm-like, relatively elongated animals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Howard et al., 2020</xref>) drew comparable conclusions based on <italic>Acosmia</italic>, an assumed stem-ecdysozoan worm from early Cambrian Chengjiang Lagerstätte. However, the re-evaluation of the morphological characteristics of this worm rather suggests a less basal position either within the total-group Cycloneuralia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, Supplementary Figs. 6, 7) or among crown-group Ecdysozoa (Supplementary Figs. 8, 9). The ellipsoidal (non-vermiform) shape of saccorhytids and their position as the sister group of the crown-group Ecdysozoa clearly reopens the debate on the nature of the ancestral ecdysozoan (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) and has led to explore alternative evolutionary hypotheses, in particular: (i) does the enigmatic saccorhytid body plan results from anatomical simplification? (ii) to what extent may these animals shed light on the nature of the earliest ecdysozoans?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13d">
<title>Do saccorhytids result from simplification?</title>
<p>A relatively simple body plan and tiny size is often seen as resulting from anatomical simplification (e.g. reduction of digestive system) and miniaturization (micrometric size) in possible relation with the adaptation to specialized ecological niches or parasitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hanken and Wake, 1993</xref>). For example, some extant scalidophoran worms living in interstitial (meiobenthic) habitats such as loriciferans have a miniaturized body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kirstensen, 1983</xref>) compared with their macroscopic counterparts (e.g. <italic>Priapulus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schmidt-Rhaesa, 2013b</xref>)). However, they retain a through gut and a functional introvert and show no sign of drastic internal simplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schmidt-Rhaesa, 2013a</xref>). Anatomical reduction is a typical feature of parasitism(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hanken and Wake, 1993</xref>) that is well-represented among extant ecdysozoans such as nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schmidt-Rhaesa, 2014</xref>). Although relatively small (ca. 0.1-2.5 mm long), nematodes underwent no simplification of their digestive system. Saccorhytids have no specialized features (e.g. anchoring or piercing structures) that would point to any adaptation to ecto- or endo-parasitic lifestyles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cong et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> has been interpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han et al. 2017</xref>) as a possible interstitial animal based on its micrometric size which corresponds to that of the extant meiofauna. If we accept the hypothesis that saccorhytids result from simplification, then we need to determine its origin. Simplification of saccorhytids from an elongated animal (e.g. cycloneuralian worm with a through gut and terminal mouth) is difficult to conceive because it would involve considerable anatomical transformations such as the loss of tubular organization, introvert and pharynx in addition to that of the digestive system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s13e">
<title>Early evolution of ecdysozoans: a new scenario</title>
<p>We propose here an alternative evolutionary hypothesis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) in which saccorhytids are replaced within the broader framework of the origin and early diversification of moulting animals. Saccorhytids are seen as an early off-shot from the stem-line Ecdysozoa (see cladistic analysis above) that possibly retained important features of the body plan of ancestral ecdysozoans. This scenario must be considered as a working hypothesis whose aim is to stimulate research in this key area of animal evolution.</p>
<p>The cuticular secretion and the loss of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Valentine and Collins, 2000</xref>) would be the first of a series of evolutionary events (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) that led to the rise of Ecdysozoa. Moulting (shedding of the old cuticle via apolysis and its renewal) reconciled body growth and cuticular protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schmidt-Rhaesa, 2007</xref>). Cuticle secretion and moulting may have been quasi-simultaneous innovations that took place over a relatively short time interval. The nature of the very first ecdysozoans is hypothetical and lacks fossil evidence. However, they are tentatively represented here as small epibenthic or interstitial slow-moving non-elongated animals from which saccorhytids may have evolved.</p>
<p>In our scenario, this ancestral ecdysozoan stock would have also given rise to elongated and tubular ecdysozoans through stepwise anatomical transformations such as the body elongation, the differentiation of key morpho-functional structures such as the pharynx and the introvert and the shift of the ventral mouth to a terminal position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Martín-Durán and Hejnol, 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). This mouth shift from ventral to terminal arising in crown ecdysozoans is consistent with the chronology of divergence of animal lineages and the fact that the mouth of most spiralians is ventral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Martín-Durán and Hejnol, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nielsen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ortega-Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>). Developmental studies show that embryos of extant cycloneuralians have a ventral mouth that moves to a terminal position towards the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Martín-Durán and Hejnol, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nielsen, 2019</xref>). These assumed major anatomical changes (e.g., functional introvert) must be placed in the ecological context of Cambrian animal radiation. Important changes in the functioning of marine ecosystems occurred in the early Cambrian such as interactive relationships between animal species, exemplified by predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Vannier and Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Vermeij, 1977</xref>) and may have acted as drivers in the evolution of early ecdysozoans, in promoting burrowing into sediment and the colonization of endobenthic habitats for the first time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vannier et al., 2010</xref>). Burrowing into the sediment could be seen as the evolutionary response of epibenthic animals such as ancestral ecdysozoans to escape visual predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Daley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Vannier and Chen, 2005</xref>). We hypothesize that this migration to endobenthic shelters was made possible by the development of a resistant cuticular layer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) that strongly reduced physical damage caused by friction with the sediment and provided anchoring points (e.g. scalids and sclerites). Whereas saccorhytids became rapidly extinct during the Cambrian, worms massively colonized endobenthic habitats, resulting in bioturbation and ecological turnover.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>We built our matrix with 55 taxa coded using 193 morphological characteristics (Supplementary Texts 1, 2). It is largely based on the data published by Howard et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Howard et al., 2020</xref>), Vinther and Parry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Vinther and Parry, 2019</xref>) and Ou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ou et al., 2017</xref>), although emended and supplemented by recent updates and new observations (Supplementary Text 1). Three characters (37. Through gut, 38. U-shaped gut, and 40. Ventral mouth) in matrix were coded as “? (uncertain)”, “?”, and “?”, respectively. Because although we can infer a ventral mouth and no anus of <italic>Beretella</italic>, these anatomic structures are invisible in fossils. We analyzed the data matrix using maximum parsimony (Tree analysis using New Technology, TNT), maximum likelihood (Important quartet tree, IQTREE) and Bayesian inference (MrBayes). Parsimony analysis was implemented in TNT under equal and implied (k=3) weight. Parameters are default (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Goloboff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Goloboff and Catalano, 2016</xref>). The maximum-likelihood tree search was conducted in IQ-TREE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>), and support was assessed using the ultrafast phylogenetic bootstrap replication method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hoang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Minh et al., 2013</xref>) to run 50,000 replicates. Bayesian inference was conducted in with MrBayes v3.2.6a with default priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ronquist et al., 2012</xref>). Two independent runs of 7,000,000 Markov chain Monte Carlo generations were performed, each containing four Markov chains under the Mkv + Γ model for the discrete morphological character data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lewis, 2001</xref>). In each run (N=2), trees were collected at a sampling frequency of every 5,000 generations and with the first 25% samples discarded as burn-in. The convergence of chains was checked by effective sample size (ESS) values over 1,000 in Tracer v.1.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rambaut et al., 2018</xref>), 1.0 for the potential scale reduction factor (PSRF)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gelman and Rubin, 1992</xref>), and by an average standard deviation of split frequencies below 0.007.</p>

<title>Ancestral character state reconstructions</title>
<p>Ancestral character state reconstructions for four morphological characters were performed on the ecdysozoan total group node, the ecdysozoan crown group node and saccorhytid node. Cycloneuralia was treated as (i) a monophyletic (Supplementary Table 4) and (ii) paraphyletic group (Supplementary Table 5). Characters selected for ancestral state reconstruction represent traits inferred as ecdysozoan plesiomorphies (ancestral characters) from studies of crown group taxa. These characters included the presence or absence of: (1) through gut; (2) ventral mouth; (3) introvert (see Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).</p>
<p>This was carried out individually for the selected character in MrBayes.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Wang and co-workers characterise the fossil of Beretella spinosa from the early Cambrian, Yanjiahe Formation, South China. Combining morphological analyses with phylogenetic reconstructions, the authors conclude that B. spinosa is closely related to Saccorhytus, an enigmatic fossil recently ascribed to Ecdysozoa, or moulting animals, as an extinct &quot;basal&quot; lineage. Finding additional representatives of the clade Saccorhytida strengthens the idea that there existed a diversity of body plans previously underappreciated in Ecdysozoa, which may have implications for our understanding of the earliest steps in the evolution of this major animal group.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I'm not a paleobiologist; therefore, I cannot give an expert opinion on the descriptions of the fossils. However, the similarities with Saccorhytus seem evident, and the phylogenetic reconstructions are adequate. Evolutionary interpretations are generally justified, and the consolidation of Saccorhytida as the extinct sister lineage to extant Ecdysozoans will have significant implications for our understanding of this major animal clade.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While I generally agree with the author's interpretations, the idea of Saccorhytida as a divergent, simplified off-shot is slightly contradictory with a probably non-vermiform ecdysozoan ancestor. The author's analyses do not discard the possibility of a vermiform ecdysozoan ancestor (importantly, Supp Table 4 does not reconstruct that character), and outgroup comparison with Spiralia (and even Deuterostomia for Protostomia as a whole) indicates that a more or less anteroposteriorly elongated (i.e., vermiform) body is likely common and ancestral to all major bilaterian groups, including Ecdysozoa. Indeed, Figure 4 b depicts the potential ancestor as a &quot;worm&quot;. The authors argue that the simplification of Saccorhytida from a vermiform ancestor is unlikely &quot;because it would involve considerable anatomical transformations such as the loss of vermiform organization, introvert and pharynx in addition to that of the digestive system&quot;. However, their data support the introvert as a specialisation of Scalidophora (Fig. 4a and Supp Table 4), and a pharyngeal structure cannot be ruled out in Saccorhytida. Likewise, loss of an anus is not uncommon in Bilateria. Moreover, this can easily become a semantics discussion (to what extent can an animal be defined as &quot;vermiform&quot;? Where is the limit?). Therefore, I suggest to leave the evolutionary scenario more open. Supporting Saccorhytida as a true group at the early steps of Ecdysozoa evolution is important and demonstrates that animal body plans are more plastic than previously appreciated. However, with the current data, it is unlikely that Saccorhytida represents the ancestral state for Ecdysozoa (as the authors admit), and a vermiform nature is not ruled out (and even likely) in this animal group. Suggesting that the ancestral Ecdysozoan might have been small and meiobenthic is perhaps more interesting and supported by the current data (phylogeny and outgroup comparison with Spiralia).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work provides important anatomical features of a new species from the Lower Cambrian, which helps advance our understanding of the evolutionary origins of animal body plans. The authors interpreted that the new species possessed a bilateral body covered with cuticular polygonal reticulation and a ventral mouth. Based on cladistic analyses using maximum likelihood, Bayesian, and parsimony, the new species was placed, along with Saccorhytus, in a sister-group (&quot;Saccorhytida&quot;) of the Ecdysozoa. The phylogenetic position of Saccorhytida suggests a new scenario of the evolutionary origin of the crown ecdysozoan body plan.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although the new species reported in this paper show strange morphologies, the interpretation of anatomical features was based on detailed observations of multiple fossil specimens, thereby convincing at the moment. Morphological data about fossil taxa in the Ediacaran and Early Cambrian are quite important for our understanding of the evolution of body plans (and origins of phyla) in paleontology and evolutionary developmental biology, and this paper represents a valuable contribution to such research fields.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The preservations of the specimens, in particular on the putative ventral side, are not good, and the interpretation of the anatomical features need to be tested with additional specimens in future. The monophyly of Cycloneuralia (Nematoida + Scalidophora) was not necessarily well-supported by cladistic analyses (Supplementary Figures 7-9), and the evolutionary scenario (Fig. 4) also need to be tested in future works. On the other hand, the revised version provides important contributions from currently available data, and the above-mentioned problems should be studied in a separate paper in future.</p>

<p>Saccorhytids are only known from the early Cambrian and their unique morphology has no equivalent among any extinct or extant ecdysozoan groups. This prompted us to consider them as a possible dead-end evolutionary off-shot. The nature of the last common ancestor of ecdysozoan (i.e. an elongated worm-like or non-vermiform animal with capacities to renew its cuticle by molting) remains hypothetical. At present, palaeontological data do not allow us to resolve this question. The animal in Fig. 4b at the base of the tree is supposed to represent an ancestral soft-bodied form with no cuticle from which ecdysozoan evolved via major innovations (cuticular secretion and ecdysis). Its shape is hypothetical as indicated by a question mark. Our evolutionary model is clearly intended to be tested by further studies and hopefully new fossil discoveries.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that “worm” and “vermiform” are ill-defined terms. They are widely used in various palaeontological and biological papers to describe elongated tubular animals such as edydsozoans and annelids (see Giribet and Edgecombe 2017; popular textbook written by Nielsen 2012; Schmit-Rhaesa 2013; Brusca et al. 2023; Giribet and Edgecombe 2020). Very few other animals are termed “worms”. Changes have been made in the text to solve this semantic problem, for example in the abstract where we added (i.e elongated and tubular) to better define what we mean by “vermiform”.</p>
<p>Priapulid worms or annelids are examples of extremely elongated, tubular animals. In saccorhytids, the antero-posterior elongation is present (as it is in the vast majority of bilaterians) but extremely reduced, <italic>Saccorhytus</italic> and <italic>Beretella</italic> having a sac-like or beret-shape, respectively. That such forms may have derived from elongated, tubular ancestors (e.g. comparable with present-day priapulid worms) would require major anatomical transformations that have no equivalent among modern animals. We agree that further speculation about the nature of these transformations is unnecessary and should be deleted simply because the nature of these ancestors is purely hypothetical. We also agree that the loss of anus and the extreme simplification of the digestive system is common among extant bilaterians. In Figure 4b, the hypothetical pre-ecdysozoan animal is slightly elongated (along its antero-posterior axis) but in no way comparable with a very elongated and cylindrical ecdysozoan worm (e.g. extant or extinct priapulid).</p>

<p>We agree to leave the evolutionary scenario more open, especially the evolutionary process that gave rise to Saccorhytida. Again, we know nothing about the morphology of the ancestral ecdysozoan (typically the degree of body elongation, whether it had a differentiated introvert or not, whether it had a through gut or not). In Fig.4, the ancestral ecdysozoan is supposed to have evolved from a soft-bodied epibenthic animal through key innovations such as the secretion of a cuticle and ecdysis. It is a hypothesis that needs to be tested by further studies and fossil discoveries. Speculations concerning the process through which saccorhytids may have arisen have been deleted.</p>

<p>The preservations of the specimens, in particular on the putative ventral side, are not good, and the interpretation of the anatomical features needs to be tested with additional specimens in the future. The monophyly of Cycloneuralia (Nematoida + Scalidophora) was not necessarily well-supported by cladistic analyses, and the evolutionary scenario (Figure 4) also needs to be tested in future works.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree that the animal described in our manuscrip remains enigmatic (e.g. the natures of its internal organs, its lifestyle, etc..). Whereas the dorsal side of the animal is well documented (consistent pattern of pointed sclerites), uncertainties remain concerning its ventral anatomy (typically the mouth location and shape). Additional better-preserved specimens will hopefully provide the missing information. Concerning Cycloneuralia, their monophyly is generally better supported by analyses based on morphological characters than in molecular phylogenies.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I, as a paleontology non-expert, experienced several difficulties in reading the manuscript. This should be taken into consideration when assuming a wide range of readers including non-experts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have ensured that the text is comprehensible to biologists. The main results are summarized in relatively simple diagrams (e.g. Fig. 4) that can be understood by non-specialized readers. We are aware that technical descriptive terms may appear obscure to non-specialists. We can hardly avoid them in the descriptive parts. However, our figures (e.g. SEM images and 3D-reconstruction) are clear enough to give the reader a clear idea of the morphology of <italic>Beretella</italic>.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All three reviewers appreciate the discovery and found the merit of publishing this manuscript. They also raised some concerns about the data presentation. The authors are requested to perform no additional analysis but to go through all the reviewer comments and rebut or intake them in revising the manuscript.</p>

<p>- Line 157: could the &quot;relatively large opening&quot; in the flattened ventral side of a mouth (even when altered by the fossilisation process)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Most bilaterians have a mouth. There is no opening on the relatively well-preserved dorsal side of <italic>Beretella</italic>, that could be interpreted as a mouth. In contrast the flattened ventral side often show a depressed area that could potentially bear a mouth. This ventral area is often pushed in and poorly preserved. The cuticle of this ventral side might have been relatively thinner, perhaps more flexible than that of the dorsal one (with strong sclerites). These differences might explain why the possible oral area is poorly preserved.</p>
