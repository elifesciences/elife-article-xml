<title>Abstract</title><p>Synthetic genetic oscillators can serve as internal clocks within engineered cells to program periodic expression. However, cell-to-cell variability introduces a dispersion in the characteristics of these clocks that drives the population to complete desynchronization. Here we introduce the optorepressilator, an optically controllable genetic clock that combines the repressilator, a three-node synthetic network in <italic>E. coli</italic>, with an optogenetic module enabling to reset, delay, or advance its phase using optical inputs. We demonstrate that a population of optorepressilators can be synchronized by transient green light exposure or entrained to oscillate indefinitely by a train of short pulses, through a mechanism reminiscent of natural circadian clocks. Furthermore, we investigate the system’s response to detuned external stimuli observing multiple regimes of global synchronization. Integrating experiments and mathematical modeling, we show that the entrainment mechanism is robust and can be understood quantitatively from single cell to population level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetic clocks keep time within living organisms in order to program periodic behaviors like circadian oscillations. An intensive genetic analysis of the complex landscape of these biological rhythms has revealed that, from bacteria and fungi to plants and animals, these clocks share similar motifs in the underlying gene regulatory networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. From a reverse perspective, synthetic biologists have tackled the problem of designing from scratch minimal gene networks that can produce periodic patterns of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Very early numerical simulations had shown that networks with an odd number of cyclically connected genes exhibit robust oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The repressilator was the first experimental realization of a synthetic genetic clock based on this principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. As shown schematically in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the repressilator is a minimal network consisting of three transcription factors mutually repressing on a loop. The original design, using the repressors LacI, TetR and cI in <italic>E. coli</italic>, displayed marked oscillations in single cells, although with large fluctuations in both amplitude and period. This noise has been recently significantly reduced by genetic optimization, resulting in much more robust albeit slower oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. This refactored repressilator is usually referred to as repressilator 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In this system, the decrease in protein concentration is driven only by growth-related dilution, not by active protein degradation. As discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], a symmetric, protein only model already predicts limit cycle oscillations provided repression is steep enough:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="563722v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where x, y, z are the three repressors concentrations in units of the dissociation constant K, the concentration of proteins required to repress a promoter to half maximum, α is a common decay rate set by dilution and β is the normalized maximum production rate. In the digital approximation (n), when β/α 1 the resulting dynamics look like relaxation oscillations with amplitude β/α and a full cycle period given by T = 3 log(β/α)/α (see Supplemental Information and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). As a result, although individual cells oscillate indefinitely, the natural dispersion of growth rates α results in a dispersion of periods leading to progressive dephasing of individual oscillators as shown by the simulations in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. In the same figure we report an experimental observation of this damping that we obtained using <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria carrying the repressilator 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. This system contains three fluorescent reporters whose expression is regulated by the same three transcription factors of the repressilator, so that the reporters’ concentration follows that of the repressor transcribed by the same promoter (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The cultures were initially synchronized chemically with IPTG, which deactivates the LacI repressor eliminating the edge between x and y from the network in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. This new topology admits a stable fixed point where the concentrations of x and y are maximal while z goes to zero. Next, the cultures were maintained in exponential growth phase by periodic dilutions in a multiwell plate while the population-averaged fluorescence signal was monitored using a plate reader (see Materials and Methods). For clarity reasons, we will only report the fluorescence signal from the CFP reporter that indirectly quantifies the concentration of the TetR repressor or y in our simple model. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> shows that when starting from the synchronized state, the population signal from the CFP reporter displays high contrast oscillations with a period of 16 hours and an amplitude that is reduced to a half after about 2.5 periods. Phase drifts are very common in natural biological oscillators. Small couplings within a population of oscillators can give rise to a globally synchronized state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], as in the case of cardiac pacemaker cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] or quorum sensing coupled genetic oscillators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Other genetic oscillators, like circadian clocks, rely instead on a periodic external cue (zeitgeber) to constantly adjust their phase to that of a common environmental cycle. Sunlight is the predominant zeitgeber of natural circadian clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In the context of synthetic biology, light is a particularly versatile input for controlling the state of genetic circuits and programming gene expression in space and time with much greater precision than chemical signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Optical signals can also be multiplexed through spectral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] or amplitude modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. A growing number of optogenetics tools have been recently applied in prokaryotes to control different aspects of bacterial physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], such as growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. A widely used optogenetic system is the light-switchable two-component system, CcaS-CcaR from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC 6803 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. CcaS senses green light and phosphorilates the actuator CcaR. Phosphorylated CcaR binds to the promoter P<italic><sub>cpcG</sub></italic><sub>2</sub><italic><sub>−</sub></italic><sub>172</sub>, activating gene expression. Red light reverts CcaS to the inactive state and shuts down transcription from P<italic><sub>cpcG</sub></italic><sub>2</sub><italic><sub>−</sub></italic><sub>172</sub>. This system was optimized for controllable gene expression with a high dynamic range in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>

<p>Here we show that integrating an optogenetic module in the repressilator circuit enables the use of light to synchronize, entrain, and detune oscillations in gene expression within single cells or entire populations. We employ the CcaS-CcaR light-inducible system to express one of the repressilator proteins, resulting in a novel 4-node optogenetic network named the ’optorepressilator’. With this modification, light acts as a zeitgeber, enabling precise phase adjustments among synthetic genetic clocks within individual cells, leading to persistent population-wide oscillations. We show that a population of these synthetic oscillators can be synchronized through transient green light exposure or be entrained via a sequence of short pulses, sustaining indefinite oscillations. Additionally, we explore the system’s response to detuned external stimuli, revealing multiple synchronization regimes.</p>

<title>Fine-tuning optogenetic expression</title>
<p>Estimates for the LacI dissociation constant K vary between 0.01 0.1 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Even taking into account the fact that the repressor plasmid is present in more than one copy ( 5 copies), this suggests that a small number of LacI proteins may already disrupt the limit cycle. Therefore, controlling the leakage of the promoter under the red light is crucial. The optogenetic module consists of two components, named as sensor and actuator in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>. In order to finetune the expression of LacI, we created four different versions of the actuator in which both transcription and translation were modulated on two levels. Translation was controlled by substituting the ribosome binding site (RBS) (BBa B0034) in the original plasmid with a weaker RBS (BBa B0033) from the same IGEM Community collection. Transcription was modulated through gene copy number by moving the light-driven gene expression cassettes from the plasmids to the genome. Combined with the sensor and actuator plasmids, these constructs resulted in four versions of the optogenetic module (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) with different expression ranges. We characterized these expression ranges as a function of incident light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) using sfGFP as fluorescent reporter and a custom-made light-addressable multiwell plate (see Supplemental information). By comparing expression at maximum green level, we can estimate that RBS substitution leads to a 27-fold decrease in reporter production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), while relocation of the light-driven cassette to the genome reduces expression by 57-fold. The combination of weak RBS and genome insertion results in a gene expression range below our instrument sensitivity (estimated combined fold reduction of 1500). We then replaced the sfGFP gene with LacI in all four versions of the optogenetic module and transformed the repressilator plasmid (pLPT234) in each of the four strains. As a first step, we verified that the oscillations of the limit cycle were preserved under red light. To this end, we first chemically synchronized the oscillations with IPTG and then monitored the concentration of TetR (y) reported by CFP. Cultures were maintained in exponential phase by periodic dilutions in multiwells under constant red light. We found that only the strain with the lowest expression level (represented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<bold>c</bold></xref>) oscillated with the same amplitude and period as the control strain containing only the repressilator plasmids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). In contrast, no clear oscillations were observed in the other three strains, where LacI leaking from the red-repressed promoter destroys the limit cycle and collapses all cells in a fixed point where the repressilator protein cI is high and TetR is low.</p>

<title>Optogenetic synchronization</title>
<p>Having verified that the system oscillates under red light, we then checked whether green light can synchronize a population of optorepressilators. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<bold>a</bold></xref> shows the population signal of CFP fluorescence reporting the concentration of TetR (y) in multiwell cultures. The cultures were constantly kept under red light for the first 40 hours. Although individual cells oscillated, their phases were randomly distributed so that the average population signal was constant. At t = 40 h we switched from red to green for 12 hours, and CFP fluorescence decayed to zero. This is expected when extra LacI is produced by the optogenetic module, repressing both TetR and CFP. When the population signal decayed completely, all the cells were stuck in the same fixed point (x<sub>0</sub> = 0, y<sub>0</sub> = 0, z<sub>0</sub> = β/α in the model), so that when switching back to red, they started oscillating in synchrony. This was also confirmed by single-cell data from a mother-machine microfluidic chip (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<bold>b</bold></xref>). Under the same light protocol as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<bold>a</bold></xref>, most of the channels blinked in unison after exposure and removal of synchronizing green light (Supplemental Video 1).</p>

<title>Optogenetic entrainment</title>
<p>Both plate reader and mother-machine experiments showed that cells carrying the optorepressilator system could be synchronized by transient light exposure. Oscillations in the population signal, however, were progressively dampened again by the dispersion of growth rates and thus of individual clocks’ periods. This was particularly evident in the mother-machine experiment, where the growth rate variability was larger. Natural genetic clocks are able to counteract period dispersion by exploiting an external periodic stimulus to advance or delay their phases. For example, a one-hour exposure to light at bedtime can delay the human circadian rhythm by about two hours, while exposure to light after waking up can advance our schedule by a little less than half an hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, the optorepressilator model in <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (2)</xref>, despite its simplicity displays a very similar behavior. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> we report the phase shift produced by a single pulse as a function of the pulse arrival time t<sub>0</sub>. This type of curve is often referred to as a phase response curve and was obtained here by numerical integration of (2) for a single optorepressilator. Both the pulse arrival time and the phase shift are measured in units of the free running optorepressilator period T<sub>0</sub>. A positive pulse arrival time t<sub>0</sub> &gt; 0 results in a positive phase shift Δ &gt; 0 that delays subsequent oscillations, while a negative t<sub>0</sub> results in a phase advance (Δ &lt; 0).</p>

</fig>
<p>This behavior can be understood at least qualitatively by simple considerations. When a pulse arrives before y reaches the maximum (t<sub>0</sub> &lt; 0), a burst of x<italic>′</italic> is produced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) that may trigger an earlier decay of y if β<italic><sub>G</sub></italic>/α &gt; 1 and the pulse duration τ is long enough (β<italic><sub>G</sub></italic>τ ≳ 1). This results in a negative phase shift for the subsequent peaks, which is greater the earlier the light pulse arrives. Conversely when the pulse arrives while y is decaying the x<italic>′</italic> burst will prolong the decay of y until the moment when x<italic>′</italic> falls below 1. This results in a positive phase shift that increases as t<sub>0</sub> increases. Let us now consider an ensemble of optorepressilators with distributed natural frequencies ν<sub>0</sub> = 1/T<sub>0</sub>, subjected to a train of light pulses with repetition frequency f. Each repressilator could be entrained by the external signal if their period could be stretched or compressed such that (1 + Δ)T<sub>0</sub> = 1/f. In other words, entrainment requires that each oscillator in the population receives the external pulses at its own time t<sub>0</sub> such that Δ(t<sub>0</sub>) = 1/f T<sub>0</sub> 1. A monotonically increasing phase response curve also guarantees that this entrained steady state is stable against fluctuations. For instance, suppose a fast oscillator is entrained by a slower train of light pulses (t<sub>0</sub> &gt; 0). If a fluctuation in growth rate leads to an increase of the natural oscillation period T<sub>0</sub>, then the next pulse would arrive with a negative t<sub>0</sub> resulting in a negative delay Δ, restoring entrainment. From this simplified theoretical discussion, we deduce that if real optorepressilators had the predicted phase response curve, then it should be possible to use a train of light pulses as a zeitgeber capable of producing long-term oscillations in gene expression at the population level. We first demonstrate this by monitoring the population signal from CFP (reporting TetR or y in the model) in multiwell cultures under constant red illumination interrupted by 2 h pulses of green light with period T = 18 h. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> shows high contrast and undamped oscillations to be contrasted to the damped ones in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>. The bottom panel in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> shows the result of a numerical simulation with the same parameters as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b and the</xref> addition of a periodic light stimulation. Simulation panel also displays in gray the signals from individual optorepressilators before performing the average (in blue). These results are also confirmed by mother machine observations reported in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> (Supplemental Video 2). For the simulations in the lower panel of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, all parameters remained the same as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> with the exception of the standard deviation of the natural periods which was increased from 0.04 to 0.95 to better reproduce the experimental observations in the mother machine. A narrower distribution of growth rates in multiwell cultures could be due to the fact that faster-growing bacteria outperform slower-growing cells in a competing environment, unlike in the mother machine where there is no competition between cells in different channels. The theoretical discussion above predicts that the individual oscillators will each find their own stable phase with respect to external pulses. The slower ones will arrange themselves to receive the pulse on the rising edge of the peak to reduce their period, while the faster ones will have the pulse arriving after the peak to increase their period. We confirm this in both experiments and simulations in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, where the individual traces of a slow (higher amplitude) and a fast (lower amplitude) oscillator have been highlighted with dotted and dashed lines respectively.</p>

<title>Detuning</title>
<p>In an entrained population, most oscillators are detuned from their natural frequency to that of the external signal. In this section we will explore detuning by starting with numerical simulations of our simple model in <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq. 2</xref> and then comparing them with long-term observations of detuned optorepressilators in a plate reader experiment. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> shows a 3D surface representing the ratio of the actual optorepressilator frequency ν over external frequency f as a function of frequency and amplitude of the external signal β<italic>′</italic>. The plateaus in this graph are the so-called Arnold’s tongues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], <italic>i.e.</italic> regions of synchronization in the frequency/amplitude plane. On the cyan plateau, the system oscillates with the same frequency as the external signal, while there are also higher-order plateaus with a fractional value of the ratio f/ν<sub>0</sub>. On the cyan tongue, when the system is detuned to higher frequencies, its phase will be such that it receives the light pulse on the rising edge of the y protein. When detuned to lower frequencies, however, it shifts to receive pulses on the falling edge of y. The width of this tongue is about 0.8 to 1.5 of ν<sub>0</sub>. When trying to detune to even lower frequencies, the system goes to an higher order synchronization tongue where it oscillates at twice the frequency of the external signal. Similarly, forcing to higher frequencies moves the system to fractional order tongues, such as the green one in the plot, in which the system oscillates at half the external frequency. All these regimes are found in experiments in which we maintain cultures of optorepressilators in exponential phase within multiwell plates that are independently addressed with light signals of different frequencies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). It is also remarkable to observe how the relative phase between the system and the external signal evolves within the cyan tongue, as predicted by the model. A discrepancy is apparently found in the green tongue, where we experimentally observe oscillations at the same frequency as the external signal. This is not unexpected, however, when one realizes that although the individual optorepressilators may oscillate at half the external frequency f, they can peak at either the even or odd peaks of the external signal. When we average these alternating peaks over the population we get a small amplitude oscillation at the frequency of the external signal. This is also confirmed by a mother machine experiment where we tried to detune to about twice the natural frequency and observed different channels oscillating at half the signal frequency and with alternating peaks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Inspired by the light entrainment of natural circadian rhythms, we designed the optorepressilator, a four-node synthetic oscillatory network that can lock its phase to that of a periodic light signal. By integrating an optogenetic module into a repressilator circuit, we demonstrate, theoretically and with experiments, that light can synchronize, entrain, and detune oscillations within single cells or an entire population. We find that this four-node network shows a phase-sensitive response to light pulses. Depending on the arrival time, a pulse can either delay or advance the clock as in many natural circadian clocks. As a result, our system can be entrained by periodic light pulses, even when the forcing period deviates from the natural frequency. Using a combination of optogenetic experiments ranging from the macroscopic population scale to the microscopic scale of single cells, we show that the entrainment mechanism is robust and can be understood quantitatively by a simple protein-only model.</p>
<p>The optorepressilator enriches the toolbox of genetic modules by adding a light-synchronizable clock that could be used to program precise oscillatory patterns of gene expression. When compared to chemical signaling, the use of light to control and coordinate the functioning of synthetic networks offers clear advantages in terms of spatial and temporal modulation. Light cues can be applied and removed on the spot, without waiting for media substitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. In addition, using spatial light modulators it could be possible to address spatially separated subpopulations within a common environment to oscillate with distinct periods and phases. Optical synchronization of genetic oscillators can be easily implemented in a wide range of experimental settings like liquid cultures, agar plates or microfluidics. Light, for example, can penetrate bioreactors and orchestrate gene expression in a population of uncoupled oscillators. Moving to red inducible optogenetic systems, optical signals could also penetrate biological tissues for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Finally, at the fundamental level, the optorepressilator enables the quantitative investigation of response in genetic clocks to find, in a synthetic biology context, a universal phenomenology in the physics of nonlinear phenomena, such as the presence of multiple synchronization states separated by Arnold tongues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>].</p>

<title>Plate reader experiments to follow circuit oscillations</title>
<p>Bacterial strains were grown from glycerol stock for 16 hours in LB with appropriate antibiotics (see Supplumentary <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for antibiotic working concentration), in a falcon tube exposed to saturating 660 nm red light in a shaker incubator (200 rpm) at 37 <italic>°</italic>C. Cultures were diluted 1 : 10<sup>6</sup> approximately 8 hours before the beginning of the experiment in imaging medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] with antibiotics under red light, and 1 mM IPTG was added in this interval if samples had to be chemically synchronized. Samples were transferred in duplicates to a 96-well plate (Greiner GR655096), and we measured OD600 and fluorescence for sCFP, mVenus and mKate2. When OD600 reached approximately 0.8 for the first time, the samples were diluted 1:4 in new wells with imaging medium plus antibiotics. Every two hours, we measured OD600 and fluorescence and diluted about 1:4 in fresh culture medium plus antibiotics to bring the cultures back to an OD of 0.2 and keep the bacteria under exponential growth conditions. OD600 and fluorescence were measured with a TECAN Infinite M Nano+ plate reader warmed to 37 <italic>°</italic>C. The parameters to detect fluorescence were: mSCFP3 excitation 433 ( 9) nm emission 474 ( 20) nm; mVenus excitation 500 ( 9) nm emission 540 ( 20) nm; mKate2 excitation 588 ( 9) nm emission 633 ( 20) nm.

<title>Mother machine fabrication</title>
<p>Master molds with mother machine features were fabricated using a hybrid technique involving standard soft-lithography and two-photon polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Firstly, the feeding channel (50 µm-width, 15 µm-height) was fabricated using standard protocols of soft-lithography. Precisely, a SU-8 layer of 15 µm was fabricated by spinning SU-8 2015 onto a soda-lime coverglass (3000 rpm -30 s, Laurell WS-650Mz-23NPPB). Strong adhesion of the SU8 to the carrier cover-glass was ensured by three layers of OmniCoat adhesion promoter (MicroChem Corp). The coverglass was soft-baked, and a microfluidic mask with a pattern of 50 µm-wide channels was projected onto the photoresist (UV KUB 2, 400 mJ - 40 s at 25% of maximum power). The coverglass was soft-baked, post-baked, and developed according to the protocol provided by MicroChem Corp. In addition, the sample was hard-baked for 30 min at 170 <italic>°</italic>C. A second layer of 20 µm was fabricated on top of the feeding channel by spinning SU-8 2015 at 2000 rpm, followed by a soft-baking of 2 hours at 95 <italic>°</italic>C. Then, the microfabrication of the micron-size channels was carried out by a custom-built two-photon polymerization setup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. The refractive index contrast between cured and uncured SU-8 was used to identify the edge of the largest channel, where a comb of micrometer-sized channels was made by direct laser writing. The whole coverglass was again baked at 95 <italic>°</italic>C and rinsed with PGMEA and IPA. Finally, the master mold was silanized to prevent the PDMS from adhering to the master. PDMS was prepared from a Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer kit: polymer base and curing agent were mixed in a 10:1 ratio, and air bubbles were removed from the mixture by centrifugation. The degassed mixture was then poured over the master, and the devices were cured for about 1.5 hours at 90 <italic>°</italic>C. PDMS chips were peeled from the master mold and bonded to glass by oxygen plasma treatment (15 seconds at 100 watts) and then baked for 10 minutes at 120 <italic>°</italic>C.</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>Phase contrast and epi-fluorescence imaging were performed using a custom-built optical microscope equipped with a 100 magnification objective (Nikon MRH11902; NA=1.3) and a high-sensitivity CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Orca-Flash 4.0 V3) (see Supplemental Fig. 7). For phase contrast imaging, a deep red LED (Thorlabs M730L4) with low inhibition of the optogenetic expression system was used. Light control was achieved by directing light through a 10:90 beam splitter (R:T, Thorlabs BSN10R) positioned under the objective. Green and red light stimuli were provided by two LEDs (Thorlabs M530L4, Thorlabs M660L4, respectively) coupled through a dichroic mirror (Thorlabs DMLP567R) and passing through a long-pass filter at 550 nm (Thorlabs FELH0550). Epi-fluorescence imaging was conducted using a blue LED (Thorlabs M455L4) and a filter set for the CFP (Chroma 49001-ET-ECFP). To enable imaging in both phase contrast and epi-fluorescence, a motorized filter wheel (Thorlabs FW102C) was used to switch between the fluorescence filter set and a long-pass filter at 700 nm (Thorlabs FWLH0700). To maintain sample focus throughout the entire acquisition process, a custom script was developed. This script scans the sample in height finally moves to the z-plane where the image of a specific fixed structure in the chip has maximum edge enhancement (calculated with the Sobel function). To avoid drift on the x-y plane, we correlate the acquired image of the fixed structure with one acquired at the beginning of the experiment and compute the shift on the x-y plane. The scanning process was performed using a motorized vertical lift stage (Zaber X-VSR-E) and a motorized microscope stage (Zaber X-ASR100B120B-SE03D12).</p>

<title>Custom-made light-addressable multiwell plate</title>
<p>The custom-made light-addressable multiwell plate was made using an Adafruit NeoPixel NeoMatrix 8x8, a matrix of 64 RGB LEDs, attached to the bottom of a Greiner 96 well plate with black wells and removed bottoms. The matrix was placed so that each LED was directly under an individual well. An opaque foam layer was cut in order to accommodate LEDs. It was used to adjust the matrix to the plate and to reduce well-to-well light contamination. An additional plate was fixed on top of this structure to decrease light intensity on samples by increasing the distance between LEDs and samples. Opaque foam layers were cut in correspondence with the wells and attached above and below this plate, again to avoid well-to-well light contamination. The construct was fixed to a shaking incubator. A 96 well plate could be placed on top of it and removed for data acquisition. A darkened lid was placed on the samples’ plate to block environment light.</p>
<p>The LEDs matrix was controlled with an Arduino microcontroller. To ensure correct timing of inputs, we employed an AZDelivery Real Time Clock module.</p>
<p>LEDs intensity on samples was measured with Thorlabs Standard Photodiode Power Sensor S121C.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The &quot;optorepressilator&quot;, an optically controllable genetic oscillator based on the famous E. coli 3-repressor (LacI, TetR, CI) oscillator &quot;repressilator&quot;, was developed. An individual repressilator shows a stable oscillation of the protein levels with a relatively long period that extends a few doubling times of E. coli, but when many cells oscillate, their phases tend to desynchronize. The authors introduced an additional optically controllable promoter through a conformal change of CcaS protein and let it control how much additional CI is produced. By tightly controlling the leak from the added promoter, the authors successfully kept the original repressilator oscillation when the added promoter was not activated. In contrast, the oscillation was stopped by expressing the additional CI. Using this system, the authors showed that it is possible to synchronise the phase of the oscillation, especially when the activation happens as a short pulse at the right phase of the repressilator oscillation. The authors further show that, by changing the frequency of the short pulses, the repressilator was entrained to various ratios to the pulse period, and the author could reconstruct the so-called &quot;Arnold tongues&quot;, the signature of entrainment of the nonlinear oscillator to externally added periodic perturbation. The behaviour is consistent with the simplified mathematical model that simulates the protein concentration using ordinary differential equations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Optical control of the oscillation of the protein clock is a powerful and clean tool for studying the synthetic oscillator's response to perturbation in a well-controlled and tunable manner. The article utilizes the plate reader setup for population average measurements and the mother machine setup for single-cell measurements, and they compensate nicely to acquire necessary information.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The current paper added the optogenetically controlled perturbation to control the phase of oscillation and entrainment, but there are a few other works that add external perturbation to a collection of cells that individually oscillate to study phase shift and/or entrainment. The current paper lacks discussion about the pros and cons of the current system compared to previously analyzed systems.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Cannarsa et. al., the authors describe the engineering of a light-entrainable synthetic biological oscillator in bacteria. It is based on an upgraded version of one of the first synthetic circuits to be constructed, the repressilator. The authors sought to make this oscillator entrainable by an external forcing signal, analogous to the way natural biological oscillators (like the circadian clock) are synchronized. They reasoned that an optogenetic system would provide a convenient and flexible means of manipulation. To this end, the authors exploited the CcaS-CcaA light-switchable system, which allows activation and deactivation of transcription by green and red light, respectively. They used this system to make the expression of one of the repressilator's transcription factors (lacI) light-controlled, from a construct separated from the main repressilator plasmid. This way, under red light the oscillator runs freely, but exposure to green light causes overexpression of the lacI, pushing the system into a specific state. Consequently, returning to red light will restore the oscillations from the same phase in all cells, effectively synchronizing the cell population.</p>
<p>After demonstrating the functionality of the basic concept, the authors combined modeling and experiments to show how periodic exposure to green light enables efficient entrainment, and how the frequency of the forcing signal affects the oscillatory behavior (detuning).</p>
<p>This work provides an important demonstration of engineering tunability into a foundational genetic circuit, expands the synthetic biology toolbox, and provides a platform to address critical questions about synchronization in biological oscillators. Due to the flexibility of the experimental system, it is also expected to provide a fertile ground for future testing of theoretical predictions regarding non-linear oscillators.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>* The study provides a simple and elegant mechanism for the entertainment of a synthetic oscillator. The design relies on optogenetic proteins, which enable efficient experimentation compared to alternative approaches (like using chemical inducers). This way, a static culture (without microfluidics or change of growth media) can be easily exposed to flexible temporal sequences of the zeitgeber, and continuously measured through time.</p>
<p>* The study makes use of both plate-reader-based population-level readout and mother-machine single-cell measurements. Synchronization through entrainment is a single cell level phenomenon, but with a clear population-level manifestation. Thus, this experimental approach combination provides a strong validation to their system. At the same time, differences between the readout from the two systems have emerged, and provided a further opportunity for model refinement and testing.</p>
<p>* The authors correctly identified the main optimization goal, namely the effective leakiness of their construct even under red light. Then, they successfully overcame this issue using synthetic biology approaches.</p>
<p>* The work is supported by a simplified model of the repressilator, which provides a convenient analytical and numerical means to draw testable predictions. The model predictions are well aligned with the experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>* Even after optimizing the expression level of the light-sensitive gene, the system is very sensitive, i.e., a very short exposure is sufficient to elicit the strongest entertainment. This limited dynamic range might hamper some model testing and future usage.</p>
<p>* As a result of the previous point, the system is entrained by transiently &quot;breaking&quot; the oscillator: each pulse of green light represents a Hopf bifurcation into a single attractor. it means that the system cannot oscillate in constant green light. In comparison, this is generally not the case for natural zeitgebers like light and temperature for the circadian rhythms. Extreme values might prevent oscillations (not necessarily due to breaking the core oscillator), but usually, free running is possible in a wide range of constant conditions. In some cases, the free-running period length will vary as a function of the constant value.</p>
<p>While the approach presented in this manuscript is valid, a comprehensive analysis of more subtle modes of repressilator entrainment could also be of value.</p>
<p>* The entire work makes use of a single intensity and single duration of the green pulse to force entrainment. While the model has clear predictions for how those modalities should affect entrainment, none of the experiments attempted to validate those predictions.</p>
