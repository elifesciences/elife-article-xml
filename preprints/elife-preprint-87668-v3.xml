<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Advances in tracking technologies have revealed the diverse migration patterns of birds, which are critical for range mapping and population estimation. While population trends are typically estimated in breeding ranges where birds remain stationary, trends are commonly assessed in non-breeding ranges for species that breed in inaccessible regions such as the Arctic. This task is challenging due to the extensive movements of birds in these ranges, which require a deep understanding of the dynamics of these movements. However, these movements remain understudied, particularly in the mid-latitudes, where many Arctic breeders winter, increasing the risk of misestimating their ranges and numbers. Here, we show that the Arctic breeding raptor Rough-legged buzzard, which overwinters in the mid-latitudes, has a specific wintering strategy: during the entire non-breeding season, they move about 1000 km back and forth under the influence of the advancing snowline, making their non-breeding area dynamic. In essence, this movement represents an extension of the quick migration process, albeit at a slower pace, and we have termed this migration pattern ‘foxtrot migration,’ drawing an analogy to the alternating fast and slow movements of the foxtrot dance. These results highlight the potential errors in range mapping from single mid-winter surveys and emphasize the importance of this migration pattern in assessing the conservation status of bird species. Understanding this migration pattern helps to correctly estimate bird populations in non-breeding areas, which is especially important for species that nest in hard-to-reach regions such as the Arctic.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We have completely rewritten this substantially revised manuscript's Introduction and Discussion sections. At the reviewer's request, we have removed the overly long paragraph on basics at the beginning of the Introduction and all references to foxtrot migrations from the Introduction. In the Discussion, we have added a substantial section (and made it the first) on how the pattern we describe differs from itinerancy. We also revised Figure 4 to show this difference.
Regardless of the terms, itinerancy and the pattern we describe are two different behavior patterns with distinct biology, dynamics, modes of origin, and geography. We have shown that in our case, unlike itinerancy, birds do not stop for 1-2 months at 3-4 non-breeding sites but migrate considerable distances - 1000 km - throughout the winter. Also, unlike itinerancy, in our case, the sites where the birds arrive are free of snow throughout the year, i.e., if we follow the logic of the publications on Montagu's harriers to which the reviewer refers, the birds do not wait for favorable conditions at the next site, as happens in itinerancy. Also, unlike itinerancy, it occurs under the influence of external factors - snow cover dynamics and in mid-latitudes. Moreover, researchers who observed a similar pattern while studying a species close to our object - the common buzzard, did not use the term itinerancy but used the term - 'prolonged autumn migration.' In their studies, the transmitters stopped working in the middle of winter, and they did not see the whole annual cycle. Still, they caught the general meaning and tried to convey it - it is precisely continuing migration, but at a slower pace, which is not similar to itinerancy.
Overall, we believe that the manuscript has been greatly improved. We are grateful for the reviewers' constructive input and appreciate the opportunity to incorporate their comments.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, advances in tracking technology have greatly improved our understanding of bird migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wikelski et al. 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kays et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jetz et al. 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kays and Wikelski 2023</xref>). By tracking tagged birds, we can study various migratory behaviors, such as their propensity to migrate, connectivity and philopatry, length of migration routes, variations in flight speed, and movements within a single season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alerstam et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Newton 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alerstam 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berthold et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Trierweiler et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schlaich et al. 2023</xref>). Different combinations of these behaviors contribute to various bird migration patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chapman et al. 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alerstam and Bäckman 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lislevand et al. 2020</xref>). Understanding the migratory patterns of birds is critical to accurately mapping their ranges and estimating population trends. Typically, population trends are assessed in breeding areas, where birds are linked to their nesting sites, allowing reliable estimates of breeding numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reif 2013</xref>). However, access to some breeding areas, such as the Arctic, presents logistical and political challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Koivurova and Shibata 2023</xref>). As a result, population trends for these species are often estimated in non-breeding areas where birds aren’t tied to specific locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Robinson et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">JIa et al. 2016</xref>). This challenges accurately censusing birds and delineating their ranges, especially when birds move extensively in non-breeding ranges during the season, and censuses are conducted only once per non-breeding season. Therefore, understanding bird movements in non-breeding areas is essential for understanding the ecology of birds in these regions and has practical implications for accurately assessing their ranges and trends in their populations.</p>
<p>Many bird species experience significant seasonal changes in food availability within their non-breeding range due to environmental conditions. This often triggers movements across these areas. For Palearctic migrants wintering in Africa, these movements have been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moreau 1972</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Trierweiler et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Thorup et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schlaich et al. 2023</xref>). However, the non-breeding movements of mid-latitude birds remain poorly understood. At the same time, many Arctic birds winter in the mid-latitudes, and understanding their movement patterns could be crucial for interpreting their population trends. In the mid-latitudes, food availability is strongly influenced by environmental factors such as snow cover dynamics. The progressive movement of the snow cover line from north (-east) to south (-west) and back again between October and May in many mid-latitude regions, particularly those exposed to northwesterly wind systems, significantly affects food availability for numerous bird species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sonerud 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vansteelant et al. 2011</xref>). We propose that species dependent on this environmental factor gradually move away from snow-covered areas during winter and then gradually move back in the opposite direction, resulting in a directed and continuous displacement of their non-breeding range.</p>
<p>The Rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus) is an Arctic breeding and mid-latitude wintering raptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bechard and Swem 2002</xref>). Rough-legged buzzards feed mainly on small rodents in the Arctic and its wintering grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tast et al. 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pokrovsky et al. 2014</xref>). They prefer open areas for hunting, and trees and tall bushes or uplands for resting. In the Arctic, such areas are the southern and typical tundra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Walker et al. 2005</xref>), and in the mid-latitudes, areas with fields and patches of forests (wooded fields). The taiga zone, where there is little open space, is unsuitable for them, although they may nest in the northern taiga zone on the border with the tundra zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sundell et al. 2004</xref>). Snow cover and day length are important in their life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Terraube et al. 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Curk et al. 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pokrovsky et al. 2021</xref>). Rough-legged buzzards can only hunt during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pokrovsky et al. 2021</xref>), and heavy snow cover makes hunting for small rodents problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sonerud 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vansteelant et al. 2011</xref>). These two environmental factors, therefore, affect the availability of prey for Rough-legged buzzards. At the same time, these factors vary considerably in mid-latitudes during winter. Thus, prey availability for Rough-legged buzzards in the mid-latitudes increases until mid-winter if they migrate southwards and after mid-winter if they migrate northwards. We, therefore, assume that Rough-legged buzzards could track prey availability and experience a dynamic non-breeding range.</p>
<p>In this study, we tracked GPS-tagged Rough-legged buzzards for ten years and analyzed their movements in the non-breeding mid-latitude range in relation to snow cover. For this study, we made the following predictions. 1) Rough-legged buzzards would exhibit a directional and seasonal movement pattern during the non-breeding period, moving from the northeast to the southwest and back again. This would result in a dynamic non-breeding range that would continue to move geographically throughout the season. 2) The non-breeding movements would differ from the fall and spring migrations in duration, extent, speed, and direction but would continue throughout the season. Thus, over the entire annual cycle, Rough-legged buzzards would be characterized by a migratory pattern consisting of an alternation of quick (fall and spring migrations) and slow (non-breeding movements) phases. 3) Non-breeding movements would occur in suitable open habitats, while fall and spring migrations would occur in unsuitable forested areas. Thus, vegetation land cover will determine the extent of quick and slow migration phases. 4) During non-breeding movements, Rough-legged buzzards will experience less snow cover than if they had stayed where they arrived at the end of the fall migration. Thus, snow cover dynamics will determine the dynamics of non-breeding movements.</p>

<title>Dataset</title>
<p>For this study, we tracked 43 adult Rough-legged buzzards (35 females and eight males) with the solar GPS-GSM loggers (e-obs GmbH and UKn – University of Konstanz). Twenty-eight birds were fitted with E-obs loggers, 13 birds were fitted with UKn loggers, and two birds were initially fitted with UKn loggers that were later replaced with E-obs loggers. E-obs loggers weighed 45 g, or 3.6% of the bird’s weight, while UKn loggers weighed 15 g, or 1.2% of the bird’s weight. E-obs loggers recorded GPS positions every hour in full battery mode and every 5 hours in normal battery mode. UKn loggers recorded GPS positions every hour with a full battery and every 12 hours with a normal battery. Both models operated continuously 24 hours a day. More detailed information about this dataset can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Curk et al. (2022)</xref>.</p>
<p>The fieldwork was carried out in the Russian Arctic in 2013-2019 at four study sites: Kolguev Island (69°16′N, 48°87′E), Nenetsky Nature Reserve (68°20′N, 53°18′E), Vaigach Island (69°43′N, 60°08′E), and Yamal Peninsula (68°12′N, 68°59′E). For details on capture methods, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Curk et al. (2022)</xref>; for detailed study descriptions, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pokrovsky et al. (2015)</xref> for Kolguev and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pokrovsky et al. (2019)</xref> for Yamal and Nenetsky.</p>
<p>During data pre-processing, we estimated the date of death using an accelerometer and GPS data and excluded tracking data corresponding to the period after the bird’s death. We then removed duplicated timestamps and calculated the mean daily positions of each individual. We partitioned the resulting dataset into several periods: 1) breeding, 2) fall migration, 3)1<sup>st</sup> part of winter, 4) 2<sup>nd</sup> part of winter, and 5) spring migration. We estimated the migration dates – the start and stop dates of the spring and fall migrations – using an iterative search procedure for piecewise regression described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Crawley (2007)</xref>. We created two models for each of the four dates: a simple model and a piecewise one. The simple model was linear, with latitude as the response variable and day of the year as a fixed effect. The piecewise model was also linear, with latitude as the response variable and day of the year as a fixed effect, and included two logical statements in its formula because we expected two linear segments in the fit. Specifically, it used “Day Of the Year &lt; BREAK” to define the left regression (before the estimated date) and “Day Of the Year ≥ BREAK” for the right regression (after the estimated date). We explored different BREAK values to fit the piecewise model, looking for the value that minimized the residual standard error. The BREAK values examined included those associated with the start and end of the fall migration (September 5 to October 5 and October 5 to November 5, respectively), as well as those associated with the start and end of the spring migration (April 10 to May 10 and May 10 to June 10, respectively). We then validated (using the R function ‘anova’) that the piecewise model significantly improved the fit compared to the simple model (p&lt;0.001). We estimated the date between winter’s first and second parts as the day when the mean daily latitude was minimum.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>First, we used linear mixed-effects models (R function ‘lmer’ in the library ‘lme4’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bates et al. 2015</xref>)) to investigate whether or not Rough-legged buzzards migrated during winter. Latitude was the response variable, day of the year was a fixed effect, and individuals and year were included as random effects. Analyses were conducted separately for each migration period (fall, first phase of winter, second phase of winter, and spring). For both phases of the winter migration, we analyzed two additional models with longitude as the response variable instead of latitude. Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare candidate models. The year was not a calendar year but a year between two consecutive breeding seasons. Thus, fall migration, consecutive winter, and consecutive spring have the same value for the year. The day of the year was recalculated consecutively.</p>
<p>Second, we used linear mixed-effects models (R function ‘lmer’ in the library ‘lme4’) to investigate whether migrations’ parameters differ between the migration periods. We analyzed four migration parameters: distance, duration, speed, and direction. The distance was calculated as the distance between two coordinates (start and end of migration) using the R function ‘distm’ in the library ‘geosphere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hijmans 2016</xref>). The duration was calculated as the number of days between the start and end of migration. Speed was calculated as the ratio of distance to duration. The direction was calculated as the bearing from the start of the migration coordinates to the end of the migration coordinates using the R function ‘bearing’ in the library ‘geosphere’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hijmans 2016</xref>). The migration parameter was used as the response variable, the type of migration as a fixed factor, and individuals as a random factor. Likelihood ratio tests were used to compare candidate models. We considered four different parameters of migration (distance, duration, speed, and direction) and four types of migration (fall, first phase of winter, second phase of winter, and spring). The analysis was done separately for each of the migration parameters. Then, we used post hoc comparisons using the R function ‘emmeans’ in the library ‘emmeans’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lenth et al. 2019</xref>) to compare the estimated means.</p>
<p>In some raptor species, adult females disperse further than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mearns and Newton 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Serrano et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bildstein 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Whitfield et al. 2009</xref>). Therefore, we conducted an additional analysis on the effect of sex on migration length using linear mixed-effects models (R function ‘lmer’ in the library ‘lme4’). The migration distance was used as the response variable, sex as a fixed factor, and individuals as a random factor.</p>
<p>Third, we investigated whether vegetation land cover differed between areas crossed during the quick (fall and spring) and slow (winter) migrations. We used the combined Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Climate Modelling Grid (CMG) (MCD12C1) version 6 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Friedl and Sulla-Menashe 2015</xref>). We used a modified Leaf Area Index (LAI) as a classification scheme. We combined all four forest types and savannas into one category (forest) and excluded the categories: water bodies, and unclassified. We, therefore, had five types of vegetation cover: forest, grassland, cropland, shrubland, and urban. We annotated the mean daily positions with the vegetation cover type using the Env-DATA tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dodge et al. 2013</xref>). We used general linear mixed effects models with a binomial distribution (R function ‘glmer’ in the library ‘lme4’) to investigate whether vegetation cover types differ between migration periods. Presence/absence of the studied vegetation land cover type was used as a response variable, migration type as a fixed factor, and individuals as a random factor. The analysis was done separately for each of the vegetation land cover types.</p>
<p>Fourth, we investigated whether snow cover could drive the slow migration phenomenon. We then compared the snow cover conditions the birds experienced during the winter with two hypothetical snow cover conditions that the birds would have experienced if they had not migrated during the winter. The first hypothetical snow cover condition would have happened if the birds had stayed where they arrived from the north (i.e., where their fall migration ended). To estimate this parameter, we calculated the winter dynamics of the average snow cover at the minimum convex polygons (MCP) occupied by the birds in October and April (northeast of their winter range). A second hypothetical snow cover condition would be if the birds flew immediately to the southwest and spent the whole winter there. To evaluate this, we calculated the winter dynamics of average snow cover on the MCPs occupied by the birds in January and February (southwest of their winter range). We then compared the values obtained for the real snow cover and two hypothetical snow covers using general linear mixed effects models with a binomial distribution (R function ‘glmer’ in the ‘lme4’ library). Presence/absence of snow cover was used as a response variable, type of snow cover (real, 1<sup>st</sup> hypothetical, or 2<sup>nd</sup> hypothetical) as a fixed factor, and years as a random factor. The analysis was done separately for each month. We then used post hoc comparisons to compare the estimated means, using the R function ‘emmeans’ in the ‘emmeans’ library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lenth et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We obtained monthly snow cover data with a spatial resolution of ca 500 meters (Global SnowPack MODIS) from the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This product is based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover products MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 (version 6 as provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center NSIDC), which have been processed to remove the gaps due to cloud cover and polar darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dietz et al. 2015</xref>). These processing steps include a combination of data available from different satellites (Aqua and Terra), 3-day temporal moving window filtering, a regional snow line elevation interpolation relying on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and a seasonal filter running through the time series for the whole hydrological year (1<sup>st</sup> of September through August 31<sup>st</sup>). The proportion of days in which one pixel is snow-covered per month is referred to here as fractional snow cover and is derived from these daily gap-filled rasters. Five MODIS tiles (h19v03, h20v03, h20v04, h21v03 and h21v04) were mosaicked and re-projected to WGS84. Then, for each month from October to April, we calculated 95% minimum convex polygons (MCPs) for the distribution of Rough-legged buzzards using the R function ‘mcp’ in library ‘adehabitatHR’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Calenge 2006</xref>). We extracted mean snow cover values from each MCP from every monthly snow cover raster separately, using the R library ‘raster’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hijmans and van Etten 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>All calculations were performed using R version 4.2.2 ‘Innocent and Trusting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">R Development Core Team 2022</xref>) and RStudio version 353 ‘Elsbeth Geranium’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Posit team 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Migration of Rough-legged buzzards – always on the move</title>
<p>Except during the breeding season, Rough-legged buzzard migration continues throughout the year, even after the birds’ arrival at their traditionally recognized ‘wintering grounds’ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a, b</xref>). Rough-legged buzzards started their fall migration on 28 September (hereafter mean±sd for the day of the year: 271±11, n=31) and ended on 12 October (285±11, n=33). The mean latitude/longitude where the birds ended their fall migration was 55.57±1.92°/49.35±5.63° (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). During the winter, birds continued to migrate at a slower pace down to 49.53±2.01° latitude (on 5 February, 36±40, n=23) and 34.29±5.11° longitude (on 24 January, 24±47, n=23). Afterward, during the second part of the winter, birds returned to 55.52±2.63° latitude and 49.79±8.24° longitude to start the spring migration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). Rough-legged buzzards started their spring migration to the Arctic on 27 April (117±7, n=27) and arrived at the breeding grounds on 15 May (135±8, n=18).</p>

<title>Quick-slow phase features comparison</title>
<p>During the quick phase, individual birds flew greater distances in a shorter time, i.e., at a faster rate, than during the slow phase. After arriving at what is traditionally known as the wintering grounds, the direction of migration changed, so the direction of quick and slow phases also differed (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). The quick phase was 1415±50 km long (hereafter mean±sd), whereas the slow phase (one part) was 1026±55 km, i.e., 389±60 km shorter (p&lt;0.001, Table S4, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). During the quick phase, birds flew for 15±3 days, and one part of the slow phase lasted 100±4 days, i.e., 85±5 days longer (p&lt;0.001, Table S5, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). At the same time, the second part of the slow phase was 54±7 days shorter than the first (p&lt;0.001, Table S5, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). The migration speed was 104±6 km/day during the quick phase and 12±7 km/day during the slow phase, i.e., about eight times higher (p&lt;0.001, Table S6, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). During the fall migration, birds moved in the SSW direction (7±2 deg), then turned 50±3 deg (p&lt;0.001, Table S7, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>) to the west and started their 1<sup>st</sup> slow phase until mid-winter. After that, they turned back to the NEE direction (57±2 deg) and performed their 2<sup>nd</sup> slow phase for several months until they turned 54±3 deg (p&lt;0.001, Table S7, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>) to the north and started their spring migration. As a result of additional analysis of the effect of sex on migration length, we found no significant difference between the migration distances of males and females (Table S8).</p>

<title>Vegetation land cover during migration</title>
<p>During quick phases, Rough-legged buzzards cross the forest zone, while during the slow phase, they migrate within the grassland and cropland zone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Rough-legged buzzards migrated fast across the tundra zone on the north in the Arctic and then through the taiga zone. Therefore, during the quick phase, the three most common vegetation land cover types were forest (44.5±2.9 %, hereafter, percentage of all mean daily positions annotated with the given vegetation type ± sd), shrublands (29.9±3 %), and grasslands (24.7±2.8 %, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). During the slow phase, the three most common vegetation land cover types were grasslands (65.1±6.2 %), croplands (26.9±6.3 %), and forests (4.9±1.4 %, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). According to the linear mixed-effects models, the percentage of all vegetation land cover types differed between the slow and quick phases (p&lt;0.001, Table S9), except for the urban lands. Urban lands were more common during the slow than quick phase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, this type has been annotated for too few birds to make an adequate comparison.</p>

<title>Snow cover – the main reason for the dynamic winter range</title>
<p>During the slow phase of the migration, Rough-legged buzzards experienced snow cover ranging from 4.8±1.0% in October (hereafter mean±sd) to 85.2±4.6% in February (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). If birds spent the winter in the place where they arrived after the fall migration, they would experience snow cover conditions ranging from 4.6±0.6% in October to 99.5±0.1% in February (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, green line). If birds fly directly to the southeast and stay there for the whole winter, they would experience snow cover conditions ranging from 1.4±0.2 % in October to 81.1±5.0 % in January (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, red line). Thus, if birds fly immediately to the southwest and stay there until the end of the winter, they will find conditions with less snow cover in spring (p&lt;0.001, Table S10). And if birds stay where they ended the fall migration, they will find themselves in situations with more snow cover (p&lt;0.001, Table S10). In the latter case, the difference between real and hypothetical situations is not as pronounced (85.2% vs. 99.5%), but more means that snow cover will be close to 100% for several months in this hypothetical situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study identified and characterized a bird migration pattern consisting of an alternation of quick (fall and spring migrations) and slow (non-breeding movements) phases. This migration pattern causes the non-breeding range of birds to shift and become dynamic throughout the season. This has obvious implications for range delineation and assessment of bird population trends.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Non-breeding movements and migratory patterns</title>
<p>Different bird species employ various wintering strategies, leading to diverse migration patterns. One strategy is residency, where birds arriving at non-breeding grounds remain there throughout the season, undertaking only minor foraging flights (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Their home ranges in non-breeding areas are compatible with those in breeding areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kjellén et al. 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alerstam et al. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Newton 2008</xref>). Another strategy, initially identified by Moreau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moreau 1972</xref>), is itinerancy, wherein birds fly between several sites separated by distances ranging from ten to several hundred kilometers throughout the non-breeding period, spending 1-2 months at each site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Most Palearctic-African species adopt this itinerant behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Trierweiler et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Thorup et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schlaich et al. 2023</xref>). The third strategy investigated here involves birds moving slowly and steadily throughout the non-breeding season, initially in one direction and then in the opposite direction. In 2009, Strandberg et al. used GPS transmitters to track Common buzzards <italic>(Buteo buteo)</italic>. Despite some transmitters in their study ceasing to function mid-winter, the authors observed a phenomenon they termed “prolonged autumn migration,” wherein birds arriving at their wintering grounds did not halt migration but continued moving at a slower pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Strandberg et al. 2009</xref>). In our study, we observed this phenomenon throughout the annual cycle. We demonstrated that, unlike itinerancy, movements in the non-breeding area are essentially a continuation of migration at a slower pace, influenced by external factors such as snow cover dynamics. Considering this behavior as an extension of migration and examining the complete life cycle of such species, it involves a quick phase during the transition between breeding and non-breeding areas, followed by a slow phase of directed and seasonal movement within the non-breeding area, and finally, another quick phase towards the breeding area. Drawing an analogy to the alternating quick and slow movements of the foxtrot dance, we propose the term ‘foxtrot migration’ for this seasonal movement to offer a concise and easily understandable description (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). Consequently, we suggest referring to the non-breeding range of species exhibiting itinerancy or foxtrot migration as the ‘dynamic range’ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b, c</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Debates may arise regarding introducing a new term for this phenomenon and whether it should fall under the general term “nomadism” or be categorized as a modified form of another migratory pattern, such as “slow directional itinerancy.” We assert that behavioral pattern names should aid in understanding movement strategies and avoid confusion. One might ask whether it is necessary to distinguish between migration and wintering at all, given that migration is essentially a matter of tracking spatial and temporal changes in favorable conditions. Authors studying Montagu’s harriers <italic>(Circus pygargus)</italic> argue that such generalization hampers understanding of wintering strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schlaich et al. 2023</xref>). Instead, Schleich et al. (2023) propose explicitly considering the functions of animal-used sites, particularly their contributions to “wintering” and “refueling for migration.” For instance, cuckoos <italic>(Canorus sp</italic>.<italic>)</italic> utilize stopovers for both peak foraging conditions and refueling for long flights to subsequent sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Thorup et al. 2017</xref>). Conversely, Montagu’s harriers exhibit negligible refueling between sites due to short distances and energy-efficient soaring flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Trierweiler et al. 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schlaich et al. 2023</xref>). In our case, Rough-legged buzzards do not make several long stopovers, unlike species experiencing itinerancy, but move gradually in one direction and then return during the whole season (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). As Schleich et al. (2023) suggested, examining the functions of animal-used sites reveals another difference between these strategies. The difference is that itinerant birds wait for better conditions at subsequent sites. In contrast, in our case, the southeastern areas that birds reach after several months are suitable and offer better conditions than the northeastern areas, as they have less snow throughout the whole non-breeding season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). All these differences highlight the discrepancy between the wintering strategies referred to as itinerancy and those described in this study. Therefore, using another term - foxtrot migration - for this phenomenon is more appropriate.</p>

<title>The dynamic of the foxtrot migration</title>
<p>Our study affirmed the presence of foxtrot migration and a dynamic non-breeding range in Rough-legged buzzards. The taiga zone posed as an unfavorable habitat during the quick phase of foxtrot migration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), given the difficulty of Rough-legged buzzards locating open areas for hunting in this habitat. Conversely, the grassland and cropland zone served as favorable habitats during the slow phase throughout the entire non-breeding period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), offering numerous open areas for hunting. Snow cover was the external factor driving their continual 1000 km southwest movement during winter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our analysis revealed that if Rough-legged buzzards remained at their fall migration endpoint without moving southwest, they would encounter 14.4% more snow cover (99.5% vs. 85.1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Although this difference may seem small (14.4%), it holds significance for rodent-hunting birds, distinguishing between complete and patchy snow cover. Simultaneously, if Rough-legged buzzards immediately flew to the southwest and stayed there throughout winter, they would experience 25.7% less snow cover (57.3% vs. 31.6%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Despite a greater difference than in the first case, it doesn’t compel them to adopt this strategy, as it represents the difference between various degrees of landscape openness from snow cover. However, it is noteworthy that one bird followed this strategy by flying directly to the southwest and remaining there throughout the winter (Figure S1), exhibiting a residency strategy. This observation suggests that the distinction between winter strategies is flexible.</p>
<p>African-Palearctic migrants do not strictly adhere to a binary division between residency and itinerancy but demonstrate a continuum between these two strategies. Many species in Africa exhibit a mixture of both strategies in varying proportions; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schlaich et al. (2023)</xref> and reference therein. Similarly, in the mid-latitudes, species may not only show any of the three strategies but also a considerable degree of individual and regional variation. For example, Rough-legged buzzards from western Arctic regions that overwinter in mid-latitude areas where snow cover dynamics are less pronounced than in eastern regions are likely to have a higher proportion of birds with a resident strategy. At the same time, Rough-legged buzzards in North America also exhibit a foxtrot migration pattern, although with variations. There, birds make a direct and rapid migration, usually across the boreal forest, followed by slower, more facultative movements once birds get south of the boreal. However, there is a lot of variation among individuals and even regions; there are more non-breeding slow movements in eastern North America but less in western North America (Neil Paprocki pers. comm.). Thus, Rough-legged buzzards in North America lie along a gradient between foxtrot migration and residency, likely influenced by different snow cover dynamics on the east and west coasts.</p>
<p>The foxtrot migration pattern is expected to be observed in many migratory species that exhibit distinct seasonal cycles in their non-breeding range. This migration pattern is expected to be prevalent for species living in regions where snow cover is a significant determinant of food availability, which is the case in large parts of the mid-latitudes. Therefore, understanding bird migration patterns is critical to accurately mapping ranges and assessing population trends in this region.</p>

<title>Mapping ranges and assessing population trends</title>
<p>The implementation of our study is twofold: 1) the use of mid-winter bird surveys to determine non-breeding range may yield inaccurate results for species with dynamic range (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>), and declines in abundance within a particular segment of the non-breeding range may indicate changes in range dynamics rather than widespread declines in species abundance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure. 5b</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In North America and Europe, the number of non-breeding birds is typically estimated once a season in mid-winter. In North America, these estimates are made during the Christmas counts, usually once in late December (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">National Audubon Society 2024</xref>), while in Europe, they are made during the IWC counts, usually once in January or February (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wetlands International 2024</xref>). This approach can lead to errors in range estimation for birds with dynamic ranges. For such species, habitats occupied by birds in fall and spring will be listed as “uncommon” at best, while habitats occupied by birds only in mid-winter will be listed as “common.” However, the situation is the opposite if we consider the time birds spend in these habitats (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). For example, based on our study of the Rough-legged buzzard, during mid-winter, the species is predominantly present in the southwestern portion of its non-breeding range, with only a tiny proportion present in the rest of the region. As a result, a map of the non-breeding range may show the species as “common” in the southwest and “uncommon” in the northeast. This map would be inaccurate because, during the entire non-breeding period, Rough-legged buzzards spend both fall and spring in the northeastern part and only mid-winter in the southwestern part.</p>
<p>To address this, continuous year-round GPS tracking of the species provides a means to track bird locations throughout the non-breeding season, facilitating the creation of accurate distribution maps, particularly for species that exhibit dynamic ranges. We advocate representing temporal heterogeneity (range dynamics) on maps as distinct zones, denoting periods when the species is abundant in a given area. To distinguish temporal from spatial heterogeneity, we recommend using lines to delineate the boundaries of these zones, rather than color shading, and incorporating numbers to denote the months of species abundance in a given zone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). We suggest ecologists include dynamic non-breeding ranges in descriptions and range maps for foxtrot migratory and itinerant bird species.</p>
<p>Population counts for a species are often limited to a portion of its range. Therefore, conclusions about conservation status drawn from such counts may be misleading. A decline in abundance within a particular portion of the non-breeding range may indicate changes in range dynamics rather than a general decline in the species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). For example, climate change may affect snow cover dynamics, reducing its intensity in northern regions. As a result, species whose range dynamics depend on snow cover may choose to remain in the northern areas and not migrate as far south as they traditionally have. Despite this shift in range dynamics, overall species abundance may remain unchanged. Similar patterns have affected Rough-legged buzzards in some areas of the European non-breeding range.</p>
<p>A 2022 Dutch study found a decline in wintering Rough-legged buzzards over the last 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hornman et al. 2022</xref>). On the one hand, this may represent a conservation concern. On the other hand, applying the rationale of the dynamic range, the apparent local decline may be attributed to climate change, resulting in less comprehensive snow coverage in the northeastern wintering areas of Rough-legged buzzards relative to the Netherlands. Such a shift in snow coverage makes it less probable for the birds to migrate to the Netherlands for overwintering. This proposition is further supported by a study of the winter population dynamics of Rough-legged buzzards in the Netherlands in 2011, showing that the main winter population peak occurred in late December, with many birds migrating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vansteelant et al. 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vansteelant et al. (2011)</xref> also found that the main migration occurred after heavy snowfall in northern Europe, supporting our foxtrot migration explanation for this decline. Therefore, investigating the dynamic range is critical to understanding a species’ range and effectively assessing its conservation status.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study sheds light on the overwintering strategy of the Rough-legged buzzard, an Arctic breeder that migrates to mid-latitudes during the non-breeding season. We have observed a migration pattern in which these birds travel about 1000 km round trip in response to changing snowline conditions, which we call the ‘foxtrot migration’ for its similarity to the alternating quick and slow movements of the foxtrot dance. Our results highlight the importance of this migration pattern and the concept of ‘dynamic range’ in revealing potential inaccuracies in range mapping from single midwinter surveys and suggest that species distribution maps should represent temporal variations in range dynamics as separate zones. Understanding and accounting for this migratory behavior is critical for accurately assessing bird populations in non-breeding areas. This is especially important for species such as Arctic nesting birds, where population assessments are primarily conducted in non-breeding ranges due to the logistical and political challenges of the Arctic.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study describes an understudied migration pattern of dynamic non-breeding range using data from an Arctic raptor. Using data from GPS tags, the study describes the known pattern of fast migration during autumn and spring, and an undescribed pattern of slow migration, at much slower pace, throughout the over-wintering season.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study presents a comprehensive analysis of the annual cycle of an interesting and undescribed migration system. The conceptual advancement is original and the data is rich and persuading. The Discussion part of the manuscript is well written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Other sections of the manuscript need some more polish, both in terms of the terminology, the language and the logic of the presentation of the subject. The title is not good. During most of the text, the authors do not properly follow a certain terminology regarding migration, over-wintering, non-breeding range, and this is very confusing. So, consistency of the text is warranted. A bigger issue is the selection of latitudes (or the actual reason for movement) during the over-wintering period. The study claims that this relates to snow cover but fails to properly demonstrate it. It is likely that the birds move because of changes in snow cover rather than because of the level of snow cover. This is a testable prediction. A possible explanation is that there is a cost for moving further south and thus the birds are reluctant of moving unless they are forced to do it by the high snow cover. Another, similar and testable prediction is that the birds aim at selecting latitudes where snow cover is partial and move slowly during the winter to areas that are only partially covered by the snow with the progression of the winter. A modified, non-linear, snow cover analysis using GAMM could uncover such patterns.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #4</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the time and effort you have taken to review our manuscript. We followed your recommendations to polish the text and make it easier to understand.</p>
<p>Regarding terms and terminology, we changed “non-breeding” everywhere in the text to “over- wintering.”</p>
<p>Regarding the title, as it was suggested by reviewer #1 as his recommendation, we tried to find a compromise and make the changes you suggested but left part of the suggestion from reviewer #1. So, now it’s “Foxtrot migration and dynamic over-wintering range of an arctic raptor”</p>
<p>Thank you for highlighting the importance of snow cover and changes in snow cover as a possible factor of over-wintering movements. We appreciate your feedback and have explored several approaches to address this issue. Specifically, we examined how both snow cover extent and changes in snow cover influenced movement distance. However, we found no effect of either factor on movement distance.</p>
<p>Our data show that birds leave their sites in October and move southwest, even though snow cover is minimal at that time. They also leave their sites in November and in subsequent months, regardless of the snow cover levels. Thus, we observed no pattern of birds leaving sites when snow cover reaches a specific threshold (e.g., 75-80%). Similarly, we found no evidence of birds staying in areas with a certain snow cover extent (e.g., 30%), nor did they leave sites when snow cover increased by a specific amount (e.g., by 10 or 20%).</p>
<p>It is possible that more experienced birds anticipate that October plots will become inaccessible later in the winter and, therefore, leave early without waiting for significant snow accumulation. Alternatively, other factors, such as brief heavy snowfalls, may trigger movement, even if these do not lead to sustained increases in snow cover. Multiple factors, possibly acting asynchronously, could also play a role. This complexity adds an interesting dimension to the study of ecological patterns. However, in this study, we chose to focus on describing the migration pattern itself and its impact on aspects like over-winter range determination and population dynamics. While we have prioritized this approach, we remain committed to further analyzing the data to uncover additional details about this behavior.</p>
<p>In response to your suggestion, we have expanded the Methods sections to clarify that we tested the effects of snow cover and changes in snow cover on distance (Lines 241-246); the Results section (Lines 348-349). We have also included the relevant plots in the Supplementary Materials. In the Discussion, we noted that this approach did not reveal any significant dependence and acknowledged that this issue requires further investigation (Lines 422-459).</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the time and effort you have taken to review our manuscript.</p>
<p>First of all, we apologize for publishing the preprint without incorporating certain adjustments outlined in our earlier response, particularly in the Methods section. This was due to an oversight regarding the different versions of the manuscript. We have corrected this mistake. Our response to the feedback on this section (Methods), with line numbers of the changes made, is immediately below this response. In addition, we have included the units of measurement (mean and standard deviation) in both the results and figure captions for clarity.</p>
<p>To focus on the main point regarding wintering strategies, we acknowledge that in the previous versions, this aspect was inadequately addressed and caused some confusion. In the revised edition, both the Introduction and the Discussion have been thoroughly reworked.</p>
<p>As you suggested, we have removed the long introductory paragraph and all references to foxtrot migrations from the Introduction. As a result, the Introduction is now short and to the point. In the second paragraph, we explain why we propose the wintering strategies outlined (L74-81).</p>
<p>In the Discussion, we've added a substantial new section at the beginning that discusses different wintering strategies. We have also updated Figure 4 accordingly. Previously, we erroneously suggested that Montagu's harrier and other African-Palaearctic migrants might adopt wintering strategies similar to those we describe. Upon further investigation, however, we found that almost all African-Palaearctic migrants exhibit an itinerant wintering strategy. Conversely, the strategy we describe is primarily observed in mid-latitude wintering species.</p>
<p>We have shown that, unlike itinerancy, the birds in our study don't pause for 1-2 months at multiple non-breeding sites, but instead migrate significant distances, up to 1000 km, throughout the winter. Furthermore, unlike itinerancy, the sites they reach are consistently snow-free throughout the year. Following the logic of publications on Montagu's harriers (Schlaich et al. 2023), our birds do not wait for favorable conditions at the next site, as is typical of itinerancy. Moreover, this behavior is influenced by external factors such as snow cover dynamics and occurs primarily in mid-latitudes. Researchers studying a species similar to our subject, the Common buzzard, observed a similar pattern and termed it &quot;prolonged autumn migration&quot; rather than itinerancy. Although their transmitters stopped working in mid-winter, precluding a full observation of the annual cycle, they captured the essence of continued migration at a slower pace, distinct from itinerancy. We've detailed all of these findings in a new section.</p>
<p>In addition, we acknowledge the mischaracterization of the implications of our research as ‘Conservation implications’ and have corrected this to ‘Mapping ranges and assessing population trends’, as you suggested.</p>
<p>Finally, we've rewritten the Conclusion, removing overly grandiose statements and simply summarizing the main findings.</p>
<p>We appreciate your time and effort in reviewing our manuscript. With your invaluable input, it has become clearer, more concise, and easier to understand.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Dataset: unclear what is the frequency of GPS transmissions. Furthermore, information on relative tag mass for the tracked individuals should be reported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included this information in our manuscript (L 115-122). We also refer to the study in which this dataset was first used and described in detail (L 123).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Data pre-processing: more details are needed here. What data have been removed if the bird died? The entire track of the individual? Only the data classified in the last section of the track? The section also reports on an 'iterative procedure' for annotating tracks, which is only vaguely described. A piecewise regression is mentioned, but no details are provided, not even on what is the dependent variable (I assume it should be latitude?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding the deaths, we only removed the data when the bird was already dead. We estimated the date of death and excluded tracking data corresponding to the period after the bird's death. We have corrected the text to make this clear (L 130-131).</p>
<p>Regarding the piecewise regression. We have added a detailed description on lines 136-148.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Data analysis: several potential issues here:</p>
<p>(1) Unclear why sex was not included in all mixed models. I think it should be included.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our dataset contains 35 females and eight males (L116). This ratio does not allow us to include sex in all models and adequately assess the influence of this factor. At the same time, because adult females disperse farther than males in some raptor species, we conducted a separate analysis of the dependence of migration distance on sex (Table S8) and found no evidence for this in our species. We have written about that in the Methods (L177-181) and after in the Results (L277-278).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Unclear what is the rationale of describing habitat use during migration; is it only to show that it is a largely unsuitable habitat for the species? But is a formal analysis required then? Wouldn't be enough to simply describe this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Habitat use and snow cover determine the two main phases (quick and slow) of the pattern we describe. We believe that habitat analysis is appropriate in this case, and a simple description would be uninformative and not support our conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Analysis of snow cover: such a 'what if' analysis is fine but it seems to be a rather indirect assessment of the effect of snow cover on movement patterns. Can a more direct test be envisaged relating e.g. daily movement patterns to concomitant snow cover? This should be rather straightforward. The effectiveness of this method rests on among-year differences in snow cover and timing of snowfall. A further possibility would be to demonstrate habitat selection within the entire non-breeding home range of an individual in relation snow cover. Such an analysis would imply associating presenceabsence of snow to every location within the non-breeding range and testing whether the proportion of locations with snow is lower than the proportion of snow of random locations within the entire nonbreeding home range (95% KDE) for every individual (e.g. by setting a 1/10 ratio presence to random locations).</p>

<p>The proposed analysis will provide an opportunity to assess whether the Rough-legged buzzard selects areas with the lowest snow cover, but will not provide an opportunity to follow the dynamics and will therefore give a misleading overall picture. This is especially true in the spring months. In March-April, Rough-legged buzzards move northeast and are in an area that is not the most open to snow. At this time, areas to the southwest are more open to snow (this can be seen in Figure 3b). If we perform the proposed analysis, the control points for this period would be both to the north (where there is more snow) and to the south (where there is less snow) from the real locations, and the result would be that there is no difference in snow cover.</p>
<p>A step-selection analysis could be used, as we did in our previous work (Curk et al 2020 Sci Rep) with the same Rough-legged buzzards (but during migration, not winter). But this would only give us a qualitative idea, not a quantitative one - that Rough-legged Buzzards move from snow (in the fall) and follow snowmelt progression (in the spring).</p>
<p>At the same time, our analysis gives a complete picture of snow cover dynamics in different parts of the non-breeding range. This allows us to see that if Rough-legged buzzards remained at their fall migration endpoint without moving southwest, they would encounter 14.4% more snow cover (99.5% vs. 85.1%). Although this difference may seem small (14.4%), it holds significance for rodent-hunting birds, distinguishing between complete and patchy snow cover.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, if Rough-legged buzzards immediately flew to the southwest and stayed there throughout winter, they would experience 25.7% less snow cover (57.3% vs. 31.6%). Despite a greater difference than in the first case, it doesn't compel them to adopt this strategy, as it represents the difference between various degrees of landscape openness from snow cover.</p>
