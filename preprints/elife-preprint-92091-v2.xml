<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Retinal degeneration in mammals causes permanent loss of vision, due to an inability to regenerate naturally. Some non-mammalian vertebrates show robust regeneration, via Muller glia (MG). We have recently made significant progress in stimulating adult mouse MG to regenerate functional neurons by transgenic expression of the proneural transcription factor Ascl1. While these results showed that MG can serve as an endogenous source of neuronal replacement, the efficacy of this process is limited. With the goal of improving this in mammals, we designed a small molecule screen using sci-Plex, a method to multiplex up to thousands of single nucleus RNA-seq conditions into a single experiment. We used this technology to screen a library of 92 compounds, identified, and validated two that promote neurogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results demonstrate that high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling can substantially improve the discovery process for molecules and pathways that can stimulate neural regeneration and further demonstrate the potential for this approach to restore vision in patients with retinal disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mammalian species, retinal neurodegeneration results in permanent visual impairment because the central nervous system (CNS) lacks an endogenous regenerative capacity. By contrast, many non-mammalian vertebrates can replace lost neurons via neurogenic reprogramming of non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Efforts to stimulate neural cell replacement in mammals, akin to what occurs in regenerative species, have been met with some success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). These approaches are typically focused on using transcription factors to reprogram glial cells into neurogenic precursors in contexts across the CNS (brain, retina, spinal cord). However, the reprogramming is incomplete, affecting only a subset of cells or producing cells without mature neuronal markers. Given the vast array of small molecules and biologics available, there is potential to screen for factors that improve such gene therapy techniques. Scalable methods capable of screening an increased number of reprogramming treatments have the potential to uncover factors that improve the regenerative potential of the mammalian CNS. These efforts may lead to future cell-replacement therapeutics.</p>
<p>We have recently developed methods to stimulate the regeneration of neurons from Muller glia (MG) in the mammalian retina <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)</italic>. The <italic>in vitro</italic> viral overexpression of Ascl1 in primary MG is able to reprogram glia from young mice to acquire a neurogenic progenitor state and generate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), and similar results have been obtained with brain astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Ascl1 can also stimulate a neurogenic state in MG <italic>in vivo</italic> using a transgenic mouse line that targets this transcription factor (TF) specifically to MG. When these mice are subjected to retinal injury using a neurotoxic dose of NMDA and subsequently treated with histone-deacetylase inhibitors, the MG regenerate functional neurons in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Follow-up studies combining Ascl1 with other TFs have proven useful in stimulating glia to regenerate alternate arrays of neuronal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). These findings have established glia as a promising source for new neurons that could potentially be used to treat neurodegenerative disorders; however, the efficacy of neurogenesis is often too low to provide enough cells for functional recovery. Several studies have shown that cell signaling molecules can also affect the process of reprogramming cell fates, and investigators have suggested that small molecules might be useful in optimizing this approach for clinical applications of neural repair in combination or separate from TF overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify additional compounds that aid in the reprogramming process and further stimulate neurogenesis from MG-derived progenitors, we set forth to design an assay that could scale the number of small molecules tested in a given <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment. Several limitations had made such plate-based screening difficult in the past: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) screening was performed using marker genes and required the design of specific mice or cell lines to detect the emergence of only a single cell type; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) MG are not a large population of cells in the retina of young mice, thus the starting material is limited; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) current imaging-based methods to quantify the reprogramming outcome are low throughput. While traditional single-cell sequencing methods enable the molecular characterization of all cell types in a culture using low cell input without the need for marker genes, they are too costly for most labs to perform for more than a handful of samples.</p>
<p>sci-Plex, a combinatorial indexing-based technology, scales the number of samples within a given single-cell sequencing experiment to up to thousands of samples, overcoming such limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). However, current applications of sci-Plex have been performed in combination with the high throughput sci-RNA-seq3 protocol using culturing systems or organisms in which cell number is not limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Here we demonstrate that sci-Plex is also compatible with lower input samples in combination with the sci-RNA-seq2 protocol which requires a lower cell input and has a higher cell recovery rate.</p>
<p>Our application of sci-Plex to reprogramming MG is the first demonstration of sci-Plex’s utility for screening chemical compounds in a low abundance primary cell type with disease relevance. To examine and validate the utility of sci-Plex for this purpose, we applied sci-Plex to MG exposed to Ascl1 overexpression for different timings and durations. We saw that, increasing the length of Ascl1 exposure increased the number of neurons produced, and we uncovered molecular features associated with progression towards the neuronal fate. When we applied sci-Plex to a small molecule screen for factors associated with stem cell biology, we uncovered compounds that had effects on neurogenesis and total cell recovery. Several of the most effective compounds identified <italic>in vitro</italic> were further tested <italic>in vivo</italic> in a reprogramming assay where Ascl1 is over-expressed specifically in MG (i.e. ANT protocol). The results of this secondary <italic>in vivo</italic> screen identified two compounds that significantly enhanced neurogenesis in adult mouse retina.</p>

<title>sci-Plex captures the in vitro temporal dynamics of neurogenic reprogramming from MG</title>
<p>We first aimed to assess the ability of sci-Plex to assign cells to specific wells in an expected manner by observing the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetics and dynamic gene expression program of Ascl1-dependent MG reprogramming. Retinas were isolated from P11 mice expressing a constitutive rtTA driving a tet-inducible Ascl1-GFP. The retinas were dissociated and grown as previously described to enrich for MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). We have previously shown that induction of Ascl1, by addition of doxycycline to the medium, induces neurogenesis in the MG, and that the new neurons generated from the reprogrammed MG most closely resemble bipolar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). Taking advantage of the ease by which condition number can be scaled with sci-Plex, we induced Ascl1 in replicate for 1-5 days at varying windows of time, allowing us to temporally track the conversion of MG to neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref></bold>). Upon collection, nuclei were isolated in their individual treatment wells, the nuclei were barcoded with well-specific polyadenylated oligonucleotides “hashes”, and then pooled for sci-RNA-seq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). We recovered 12,850 cells across two experiments and 30 wells (Timecourse: 7,004, Pulse: 5,846) with a median UMI count of 3,172 and 2,398 after all filtering steps, respectively (<bold>Fig. S1 A-K</bold>). The hash recovery rate was 68% for both experiments (<bold>Fig. S1C-D, G-H</bold>). The experiments were integrated and visualized by UMAP using Monocle3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The clusters were annotated according to cell type using the expression of known marker genes (<bold>Fig. S1L-N, Table S1</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Most cells fell into one of four clusters: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) MG; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) Progenitor-like cells (ProL); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) Transition; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) neuronal precursors (NeuPre). In addition, we identified other clusters of non-MG derived cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and fibroblast-like cells (FibroL), potentially derived from vascular cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Having annotated the cells, we next ordered all the cells originating from reprogrammed MG into a pseudotime trajectory to better understand the sequence of gene regulatory events on the path from MG to neuronal identity (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold>). We then assessed how the timing and duration of Ascl1 overexpression affected reprogramming progression when Ascl1 was added continuously (Timecourse) or pulsed (Pulse). In the Timecourse experiment, Ascl1 expression was induced for either 0,1,2,3,4 or 5 days and then the cells were collected (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). During the timecourse, we saw that Ascl1 stimulated a rapid transition away from MG (i.e. the start of the pseudotime trajectory) that persisted across all timepoints (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>). As expected, increased duration of Ascl1 overexpression led to cells further along the pseudotime trajectory, consistent with the need for Ascl1 expression to drive cells from the ProL state towards the neuronal state.</p>
<p>In the Pulse experiment, we initiated Ascl1 expression in all samples at the same time, but then removed doxycycline after either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days to shutdown Ascl1 overexpression. The cells were all collected 5 days after the start of Ascl1 expression regardless of Ascl1 expression duration (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Pulse</bold>). When Ascl1 was maintained for the entire 5 day period (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-E</xref></bold>), the distribution of cells across pseudotime was similar to that observed in the Timecourse experiment, with few MG remaining. However, the pseudotime profiles were remarkably different when Ascl1 overexpression was removed for any period of time for all cell types with the exception of NeuPre (<bold>Fig. S1Q</bold>). When Ascl1 was expressed in the cells for 2 or fewer days, almost all of the cells were identified as MG (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref></bold>). After 3 or more days of Ascl1 expression, transition and neurogenic precursor (NeuPre) cells began to accumulate, though a substantial number of MG were also present even after 4 days of Ascl1 exposure and one day without when compared to the Timecourse experiment (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, Fig S1Q</bold>). These results suggest that even after 4 days of Ascl1 expression, removal of Ascl1 allows a subset of the cells to return to a glial state, while another subset of cells that have made it far enough along the reprogramming trajectory are no longer dependent on Ascl1 to remain committed to their neuronal fate.</p>
<p>To further understand the molecular features of the cells as they progress towards a more neuronal fate, we analyzed changes in gene expression around the pseudotime stage associated with a decreased reliance on Ascl1. We found the local minima (10 &lt; pseudotime &lt; 20) of pseudotime density plots from the Pulse experiment to be 16 (<bold>Fig S1R</bold>). The accumulation of cells with a pseudotime value of &gt; 16 encompasses the population of cells that remain in the NeuPre or Bipolar fate even after removal of Ascl1 induction. Coincidentally, in the Timecourse experiment, decreased Ascl1 expression is observed at pseudotime values &gt; 16 (<bold>Fig. S1S</bold>). While seemingly surprising, this decrease in Ascl1 expression with continued exposure to the induction signal is a phenomenon we consistently observe in both our in vitro and in vivo reprogramming paradigms (Todd et al. 2021; Todd et al. 2022; Todd et al. 2020). We do not have definitive knowledge of the mechanism behind how Ascl1 expression is repressed, but it is possible that mature neurons have a mechanism to downregulate it.</p>
<p>To find the genes dynamically expressed during the loss of Ascl1 expression and gain of a more neuronal fate, we performed differential gene expression analysis across pseudotime using cells with pseudotime values from 10-20 (<bold>Dataset S1</bold>). We were particularly interested in identifying transcriptional regulators and signaling molecules. In the top 250 most differentially expressed genes, three major regulatory patterns (Cluster 1: increasing, Cluster 2: a transient increase, Cluster 3: decreasing) were observed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-H</xref></bold>). The downregulation of Id1 and Id3 in Cluster 2 was consistent with known biology: these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) form heterodimers with bHLH TFs making them incapable of binding their target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) have been previously implicated in maintaining retinal progenitors and Muller glia in a progenitor-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Genes in Cluster 1, which increase during the progenitor-to-neuron transition, are also associated with the normal development of neurons (Elavl3, Map2) and with processes such as neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis (Nrxn3, Syt1). There were also four TFs that increased in their expression right around the loss of Ascl1 dependence: Sox4, Neurog2, Myt1, and Rorb. All of these genes are expressed in the retina during the early stages of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Of note, Myt1 is a direct target of Ascl1 and although it has been studied more thoroughly in the brain, it is associated with repression of progenitor gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Another factor on the list, Rorb is involved in the specification of photoreceptor, amacrine, and horizontal but not bipolar cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Our results thus show the ability of sci-Plex to be used in MG cultures and we have identified potential regulators of critical steps in the MG to neuron reprogramming paradigm.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>sci-Plex as a screen to identify small molecules that affect Ascl1-dependent MG reprogramming</title>
<p>The above results supported the potential of sci-Plex to study neurogenic reprogramming, so we next embarked on a larger-scale screen for factors that can improve the efficiency of neurogenesis from MG. We screened through 92 small molecules from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.tocris.com/products/tocriscreen-stem-cell-library_7340">TocriScreen Stem Cell Library</ext-link> (<bold>Dataset S2</bold>). The compounds target a range of biological functions with a bias towards epigenetic modulators and modulators of common signaling pathways (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). We followed the same treatment regime as for the timecourse experiment in which MG were isolated from P11 mice that express a constitutive rtTA and harbor a tet-inducibe Ascl1-GFP. The MG were selectively cultured before induction of Ascl1 with doxycycline. Small molecules from the TocrisScreen Stem Cell Library were added at the same time as the doxycycline and remained in culture until the cells were collected on Day 5 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). The compounds were applied across three doses (0.1, 1, and 10 uM) with each compound being tested on one of two different collection days. We included three wells per collection day in which only doxycycline was added (Only Ascl1) and three wells per collection day in which doxycycline was not added (No Ascl1). To maximize the range of compounds tested, we opted to perform the sci-Plex experiment once, and then follow up with compounds that elicited strong effects through subsequent <italic>in vivo</italic> validation experiments. In sum, we screened 92 small molecules and two control conditions from a total of 265 individual wells after filtering out conditions with low cell recovery.</p>

<p>We used sci-RNA-seq2 to profile a total of 27,152 cells (Collection 1: 6,282, Collection 2: 20,870) (<bold>Fig. S2A-G</bold>). The median UMI count was 3,551 for Collection 1 and 2,166 for Collection 2 (<bold>Fig. S2H-I</bold>). A hash could be called for 65-74% of the cells (<bold>Fig. S2F</bold>). We performed dimensionality reduction and clustering with Monocle3 and used marker genes to annotate cell types by cluster. All cell types not of retinal/MG origin were discarded (<bold>Fig. S2J-L</bold>), and the dimensionality reduction and cell type annotation was repeated (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Table S1</bold>).</p>
<p>To identify the molecules most likely to promote reprogramming, we pooled the clusters corresponding to neurogenic precursors (NeuPre: Gap43, Snap25, Dcx) and bipolar neurons (BP: Snap25, Vsx2, Cabp5, Otx2, Grik1) together into a common Neuron annotation and for each drug, calculated the abundance of Neurons relative to Ascl1(<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold> and <bold>Dataset S2</bold>). Many of the molecules did not have clear effects on the reprogramming process. However, we found several molecules that increased neurogenesis and others that reduced neurogenesis. The molecules that most markedly increased the percentage of Neurons, included DBZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), DMH-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), RepSox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), SB 431542 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), and WH-4-023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). These compounds target one of three molecular signaling pathways: Notch, BMP/TGF-beta, and LCK/SRC. We also calculated the number of cells recovered per well, and noticed that for a few treatments, far more total cells, regardless of cell type identity, were recovered than average. This was most prominent for metformin, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, and valproic acid (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). Both sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and valproic acid are HDAC inhibitors which is of interest because TSA, another HDAC inhibitor, is a significant stimulus for Ascl1-dependent reprogramming <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Unexpectedly, metformin, a compound that is approved for the treatment of diabetes with other potential clinical uses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), also increased cell recovery in our assay. Because metformin has not been evaluated in the context of retinal reprogramming, we decided to pursue it and the 5 compounds that increased neurogenesis with further experiments <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, the use of sci-Plex aided us in narrowing down 92 compounds to 6 for follow up investigations.</p>
<p>In addition to detecting shifts along the reprogramming trajectory, we also detected what appeared to be previously undetected cell states (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Unknown clusters</bold>). To characterize these, we performed Biological Process GO term enrichment on genes with high regional specificity for each cluster (<bold>Dataset S3</bold>). Cluster Unknown 1 was enriched with genes related to ER stress, Unknown 2 had markers of Immune reactive cells, and Unknown 3 had non-retinal neuronal characteristics (<bold>Fig. S2M-O, Dataset S3</bold>). The Unknown 4 cells had 77 genes with high specificity to the cluster, but only two enriched gene sets “regulation of ion transmembrane transport” and “action potential” (<bold>Dataset S3</bold>). With such a small number of enriched gene sets, we were unable to make further conclusions about the identity of that cell cluster and have left them annotated as Unknown.</p>
<p>We next set out to understand how each treatment altered the distribution of cells across these novel clusters. We generated a heatmap in which treatments with similar cell type compositions were clustered together (<bold>Fig. S2P</bold>). In doing this, we found that for a small number of treatments, the majority of cells come from either the ER stressed cluster of cells or the Unknown cluster of cells (<bold>Fig. S2Q-R</bold>). Interestingly, the treatments that led to the Unknown cluster include two histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (CI 994, SAHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). It’s possible that these cells are deregulated without having yet experienced a change in fate towards a more specific cell type. The treatments that lead to increased cell counts in the ER stressed cluster include two bromodomain (acetylated lysine binders) inhibitors (I-BET 151 dihydrochloride, CPI 203) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). While these observations don’t directly help us identify better treatments for reprogramming MG, they do help us find compounds that affect the molecular state of MG cells exposed to Ascl1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Validating sci-Plex hits in an <italic>in vivo</italic> neuronal regeneration paradigm</title>
<p>We next aimed to assess whether the positive hits that increased neurogenesis from the <italic>in vitro</italic> sci-Plex screen could be validated <italic>in vivo</italic>. Before testing compounds from the <italic>in vitro</italic> screen <italic>in vivo</italic>, we sought to validate that <italic>in vivo</italic> MG express the signaling pathways targeted by our small molecule compounds during neurogenic reprogramming. We analyzed scRNA-seq libraries made from our <italic>in vivo</italic> regeneration experiments where we used mice engineered to express Ascl1 specifically in the MG (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>), then induced retinal injury with an intravitreal injection of NMDA, and a co-injection of TSA (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref></bold>). The mice were sacrificed and GFP expressing cells were sorted and subjected to 10x scRNA-seq either 5, 9, or 21 days after injury (the day 5 and 9 libraries were originally published in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>)). Dimensionality reduction was performed to generate a UMAP from which clusters were defined and cell types were annotated using Marker genes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>, Fig S3A-H, Table S1</bold>). A small number of rod and cone cells are present even in the earliest time point and most likely are contaminating cells from the FACs sorting. As expected, with increasing time after injury, we observe greater numbers of MG-derived bipolar cells. This is most evident in the time between 9 and 21 days. However, even between 5 and 9 days there is a small increase in bipolar cells. Additionally, when pseudotime analysis was performed, a shift in the MG cluster towards a more mature state became apparent even by 9 days (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref></bold>). Lastly, using the pseudotime analysis across all time points, we looked at how the expression of key target genes for each of the drugs are expressed throughout the reprogramming process (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref></bold>). In all cases, at least some of the target genes are expressed early and decrease over time, making them ideal candidates for small molecule intervention.</p>

<p>Using the same mice as above, we aimed to validate five hits <italic>in vivo</italic> (the γ-secretase inhibitor DBZ, Lck and Src inhibitor WH-4-023, LKB1/AMPK activator metformin, the BMP inhibitor DMH-1, and the TGF-BR1 inhibitor SB43152) for their ability to increase neurogenic reprogramming of MG <italic>in vivo</italic>. We originally also identified RepSox as a hit, but because RepSox and SB43152 have the same target, we decided to only pursue SB43152. Ascl1 was induced in the MG with tamoxifen, retinal injury was performed by NMDA, and TSA was given in conjunction with one of the small molecule hits from the screen; animals were sacrificed two weeks later, and their retinas were assayed for lineage traced MG-derived cells (GFP+) and the retinal neuronal maker (Otx2+) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref></bold>). Out of the compounds tested, two significantly boosted the number of Otx2+ neuronal cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H-J</xref></bold>). The first identified compound was DBZ, a γ-secretase/Notch inhibitor (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref></bold>). This is consistent with reports in the chick retina where the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT increased neuronal differentiation from proliferating MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Inhibition of Notch is also well known to promote neural differentiation from retinal progenitors in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). While this result was not unexpected, DBZ represents a new compound found to promote neurogenesis in the mammalian retina. The second positive hit, metformin, showed the biggest effect on MG-neurogenesis (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H-I</xref></bold>). In some retinas, metformin increased the rate of neurogenesis to 75% of the Ascl1-expressing MG, a higher rate than any of our previous pharmaceutical treatments. The MG derived neurons expressed Otx2, and were primarily located in the INL; this is similar to what we observe in the ANT treatment condition, and so it does not appear that metformin altered the fates of the MG-derived neurons; In addition, the neurons in the metformin treated retinas do not express markers of ganglion/amacrine cells (<bold>Figure S3K</bold>). These <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments thus confirm that the <italic>in vitro</italic> sci-Plex screening is an effective method to identify new compounds that increase the regeneration potential of mammalian MG.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Screening large numbers of chemical compounds has become a routine path to drug discovery, but limitations remain. Most high-throughput screening assays use relatively limited read-outs, such as cell morphology, proliferation or changes in expression of a reporter. Many assays cannot access molecular information about responding cells or identify factors that make a cell type resistant to a treatment. Single-cell transcriptomic assays overcome these hurdles, but the conventional protocols are costly and highly limited in sample number. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the utility of sci-Plex, an ultra-scalable scRNA-seq protocol, for studying reprogramming primary cells through screening drugs in low-input cultures and subsequently validating them <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our experiments both identified drugs that support reprogramming and revealed underlying biology important for the progression of glial cell reprogramming.</p>
<p>We first used sci-Plex to pinpoint the moment during <italic>in vitro</italic> reprogramming at which cells become committed towards a neurogenic cell fate independent of continued Ascl1 expression. Next, we tested 92 compounds across 3 doses each and identified 6 molecules of interest, two of which also had significant proneural effects <italic>in vivo</italic>. With our observation that cells no longer require Ascl1 to maintain their neuronal identity after a certain point along their reprogramming trajectory, we looked at the transcriptional regulators that were changing in their expression around this point and identified Myt1 as a potentially critical factor for commitment towards the neuronal fate. Myt1 is a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding transcription factor that is found specifically in neuronal cells and is important in neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). In neural stem cells, the Myt1 promoter is bound by Ascl1 and protein expression is induced following the overexpression of Ascl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Myt1 and its family member Myt1l function by binding to and repressing their target genes which include non-neuronal genes, progenitor genes, and regulators of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Myt1l has also been associated with aiding in the <italic>in vitro</italic> reprogramming of fibroblasts to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). However, little is known about its role in the retina, and no previous reports indicate a direct role for Myt1 in committing cells to the neuronal fate after the removal of other proneural transcription factors. Additional work will be needed to determine whether Myt1 is the regulator holding cells in the neuronal fate after removal of Ascl1 in our Pulse experiment, but the depth of information that can be obtained by single cell sequencing provided us with an intriguing candidate gene.</p>
<p>The first hit of our screen was the Notch inhibitor DBZ. It targets the ability of gamma-secretase to cleave the intracellular domain of activated Notch receptors. While DBZ has not previously been used in retinal reprogramming studies, Notch is well-known to affect neurogenesis and neural regeneration in the retina. Pharmacological manipulation of Notch signaling has been used to alter the proliferative and neurogenic capacity of MG in fish and chick retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). It is also interesting that Myt1, identified in our Pulse experiment as a factor that may prevent neuronal cells from returning to the progenitor fate, inhibits Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). That our screen recovered a gamma-secretase inhibitor, in line with the known role of Notch in the retina, confirmed the ability of our workflow to identify important regulators.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the second compound that increased neurogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> was metformin. Mechanistically, metformin is typically thought to work via AMPK, and while used clinically for Type2 diabetes, many studies have noted its neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). In our screen, metformin increased the total number of cells recovered by sci-Plex, including those in the neurogenic precursor stage. Even with the increased number of cells recovered compared to other treatments, the small number of cells recovered from each treatment by sci-Plex made it difficult to identify confident DEGs. However, by leveraging followup experiments <italic>in vivo</italic> we did find that metformin had a clear effect on neurogenesis from Ascl1-reprogrammed MG. The effect we find on neurogenesis is consistent with the promotion of neurogenesis reported in another <italic>in vitro</italic> study using mouse cortical and hippocampal progenitors and human ESC-derived neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), and may in part be mediated by Gadd45g, via DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, metformin restored blood flow and vascular density in aged mice and promoted neurogenesis from the SVZ <italic>in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>)</italic>. Further investigations of this molecule in astrocyte to neuronal reprogramming in other regions of the CNS will be necessary to validate the utility of metformin in <italic>in vivo</italic> neural regeneration more generally.</p>
<p>Repairing the nervous system has been an elusive goal, and while progress is being made with transplantation of pluripotent stem cell derived neurons, there are many complexities in neural transplantation. Reprogramming glia to serve as a source of neural repair is a strategy utilized by non-mammalian vertebrates, and inspired by nature, we and others have shown that harnessing this latent neural regenerative capacity by proneural TF over-expression can revive the neuronal reprogramming program in mammals. Layering in the use of small molecules can increase the efficiency of such reprogramming, and we show here that screening through larger libraries of compounds at single-cell resolution <italic>in vitro</italic> can point us towards new <italic>in vivo</italic> hits. We are particularly excited by the future therapeutic potential of our compounds: metformin and DBZ; as well as the use of similar screening strategies for the identification of treatments in glial-based regeneration and wider contexts.</p>

<title>Primary cell culture, MG freezing, thawing, and plating</title>
<p>Muller glia cultures were derived from the retinas of Postnatal Day 11 (P11) rtTa:tetO-Ascl1-ires-GFP mice of both sexes. After retina harvest, the retinas were incubated for 7 min at 37°C in a solution of papain and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) (Worthington, #LK003172). Incubation was followed by trituration of the mixture to dissociate the cells, then to stop the reaction, an equal volume of ovomucoid (Worthington, #LK003182) was added. To isolate the cells, the solution was spun at 4°C at 300g for 10 minutes. Pelleted cells were resuspended in growth medium consisting of Neurobasal medium (Gibco, #10888-022), 10% tet-approved fetal bovine serum (tet-FBS) (Takara/Clontech, #631367), N2 (Gibco, #17502-048), 1 mM l-glutamine (Gibco, #25030-, 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, #15140-122), and mouse epidermal growth factor (100 ng/ml) (R&amp;D Systems, #2028-EG-200). Cells were plated in a six-well dish at a density of about 2 retinas per 10cm2 well, then incubated at 37°C. The entire volume of medium was changed every 48 hours until confluent or after 7 days. At confluence or after 7 days, cells were removed from the plate using TrypLE (Gibco, #12605-028), spun at 4°C at 300g for 10 minutes, then resuspended in a small volume of growth medium. The entire volume of cell suspension was added to a freezing medium containing 40% tet-FBS, and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with the remaining 50% being the growth medium from the resuspension. The cells were then frozen for at least 24 hours at -80C before being moved to storage in liquid nitrogen for at least one day. Cells were thawed at room temperature, then spun at 300 RCF for 10 minutes. After thawing, cells were seeded in 500 uL of 10% tet-FBS growth medium in 24 well plates or in 250ul of the same medium in 48 well plates. Cells were grown for 24-48 hours in the growth medium until they appeared healthy.</p>

Media was aspirated, and 200 uL 1 x dPBS (no calcium, no magnesium) was added to each well. The plate was centrifuged at 600x g for 5 minutes and the dPBS was pipetted off. To each well containing cells, 50 uL of CLB+hash solution (45 uL of Cold Lysis Buffer – 10mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 0.1% IGEPAL, 1% (v/v, Sigma-Aldrich, I8896), SuperaseIn RNase Inhibitor (20 U/μL, Ambion, AM2694), 1% (v/v) BSA (20 mg/ml, NEB, B9000S) + 5μL of hash oligo (10 uM, IDT)) was added and then mixed by pipetting up and down for 5-10 strokes. The plate was incubated on ice for 3 minutes, after which, 200 uL of fixation buffer (5% paraformaldehyde (EMS, cat. no. 50-980-493), 1.25x dPBS) was mixed with the nuclei by pipetting up and down for 10 strokes. The cells were incubated with the fixative for 15 minutes on ice during which the hashes were affixed to the nuclei. All nuclei from all wells were then collected into a single 15 or 50 mL conical tube, depending on the size of the experiment, and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 800xg.</p>
<p>Pellets were resuspended in 1mL of NSB (Nuclei Buffer + SuperaseIn + BSA – 10mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 10mM NaCl, 3mM MgCl2, 1% (v/v) BSA, 1% (v/v) SuperaseIn RNase Inhibitor), and centrifuged again for 5 minutes at 800 x g. One final wash with 1 mL of cold NSB was performed. Upon resuspension, nuclei were transferred to a 1.5 mL LoBind microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf, Z666491) and counted using a hemocytometer. The 1.5 mL tube was placed within a 15 mL conical and centrifuged in a swinging bucket centrifuge for 5 minutes at 800 x g. The nuclei were resuspended in 500 uL of NSB and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at -80C.</p>

<title>Sectioning and Immunostaining</title>
<p>For immunohistochemistry, whole eye globes were fixed for 30 minutes in 4% PFA after lens removal. Eyes were then soaked in 30% sucrose overnight and processed for sectioning the following day. For sectioning, retinas were frozen in O.C.T and cryosectioned at 18μm thickness. Slides were washed in PBS two times for 10 minutes and then primary antibodies were applied overnight in 10% normal horse serum (Vector Labs, #S-2000-20), 0.5% Triton-X-10 (Sigma, #T8787-100ML) and PBS. The following day sections were rinsed two times for 10 minutes in PBS and secondary antibodies were applied at a concentration of 1:1000 in PBS for 1 hour. Slides were washed again in PBS and then coverslipped using Fluromount-G (Southern Biotechnology, #0100-01)</p>

<title>sci-RNA-seq</title>
<p>After hashing, the nuclei were subjected to the original 2-level sci-RNA-seq protocol(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, the hashed nuclei were thawed on ice, subjected to centrifugation at 800 x g for 5 minutes, the liquid was aspirated away, and then the nuclei were incubated on ice for 3 minutes in 500 uL of NSB + 0.2% Triton X-100 (ThermoFisher, A16046.AP). Permeabilized nuclei were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 800 x g, resuspended in 400 uL NSB, and counted using a hemocytometer. The desired number of nuclei were subjected to one final centrifugation step at 800 x g for 5 minutes. They were then resuspended to a concentration of ∼800-3000 nuclei per uL across 3-4 x twin.tec™ 96 Well LoBind PCR Plates (Eppendorf, 0030129512) in NSB. The RT reaction was carried out using an increasing temperature gradient (4°C 2 min, 10°C 2 min, 20°C 2 min, 30°C 2 min, 40°C 2 min, 50°C 2 min, 55°C 15 min), but was otherwise the same as in Cao et. al.</p>
<p>All nuclei were pooled. DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 3 uM final<bold>)</bold> (Invitrogen, D1306) was used to stain the DNA content of cells so that doublets and debris could be removed by sorting on the DAPI height vs DAPI area, and FSC vs SSC respectively using a FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Into each well of a twin.tec™ 96 Well LoBind PCR Plate, ∼180 nuclei were sorted. This was performed across 4-5 plates depending on the experiment. Each of the wells that the nuclei were sorted into contained 5 uL of EB buffer (Qiagen, 19086), 0.5 uL of 5 x mRNA Second Strand Synthesis buffer (New England Biolabs, E6111L), and 0.25 uL of mRNA Second Strand Synthesis enzyme (New England Biolabs, E6111L). The plates were incubated at 16°C for 3 hours. Tagmentation was performed at 55°C for 5 minutes in 5.75 uL of Tagmentation mix (1.1 uL N7 loaded custom TDE1 enzyme (MacroLab, UC Berkeley) per 632.5 uL 2xTD buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20% v/v Dimethyl Formamide (Sigma-Aldrich, 227056-100ML)).</p>
<p>The reaction was stopped with 12 uL of DNA binding buffer (Zymo Research, D4004-1-L). Ampure-based bead purification, PCR, and final library purification were performed as published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The library was visualized using a D1000 Screen Tape (Agilent Technologies, 5067-5583) and quantified by Qubit using Broad Range DNA reagents (Invitrogen, Q32853).</p>

<title>Filtering and dimensionality reduction (Pulse vs Timecourse)</title>
<p>Cells with &lt; 500 UMIs and &gt; 20,000 UMIs were discarded. The ratio of the most common hash barcode to the second most common hash barcode was calculated (top_to_second_best_ratio). For the time course experiment, all cells with a top_to_second_best_ratio &gt; 4 were retained. A cutoff of a top_to_second_best_ratio &gt; 5 was used for the pulse experiment. Using Monocle3, the two datasets were combined with <monospace>combine_cds()</monospace> and subjected to dimensionality reduction to generate a 2D UMAP from 20 PCA dimensions, a UMAP mindist of 0.1, and 50 nearest neighbors.

<title>Sub clustering of reprogramming MG cells (Small Molecule Screen)</title>
<p>The cells annotated as Bipolar and Reprogramming_MG were selected and dimensionality reduction was performed of the subset of cells with 30 PCA dimensions, a mindist of 0.1, and 12 nearest neighbors. A resolution of 5 x 10<sup>−4</sup> was used for clustering. Common markers were used to assign cell types on a cluster by cluster basis (Table S1), but some clusters could not be assigned in this manner. To find the sets of genes that most specifically define these unknown clusters, for each gene, the fraction of cells within a cluster that express the gene as well as the mean expression of that gene within a cluster were calculated. The mean expression values were then normalized to sum to one across all cell types for a given gene. This was used as input for Jensen Shannon distance calculations comparing the observed normalized expression distribution across cell types to simulated distributions in which all expression of a given gene comes from a single cell type. This was done for each cell type across all genes. Specificity scores were calculated by subtracting the Jensen Shannon distance from 1. The genes with a fraction expressing &gt; 0.05 and a specificity of &gt; 0.3 were categorized as highly specific for that cell type. For each Unknown cluster, the highly specific genes were used as input to <monospace>enrichGO()</monospace> from the clusterProfiler package with a pvalueCutoff of 0.01, qvalueCutoff = 0.05, and Benjamini Hoechberg adjustment using the org.Mm.eg.db OrgDb.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study used the sci-Plex system to perform in vitro screen of chemicals and found that 2 compounds improved the reprogramming efficiency in Ascl1-overexpressed MG (Muller glia), and in addition, administration of the identified compounds in the previously established in vivo model (Ascl1, NMDA, TSA) showed that DBZ and metformin increased Otx2+ cells for improved neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The overall study was straightforward and well-designed. The method in the study could be potentially useful for large-scale in vitro screens for compounds to further improve reprogramming efficiency. The data and results of the study are of good quality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Future studies may help provide more in-depth mechanistic examinations of the reprogramming process such as whether the compound treatment indeed affects the corresponding signaling pathways.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the current manuscript, Tresenrider et al., present their recent study focusing on screening of small molecules to enhance the conversion from Müller cells (MG) to retina neurons induced by ectopic Ascl1 expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>To analyze results from multiple treatment conditions in a single experiment, the authors employed a method called sci-Plex to perform scRNA-seq on mixed samples to investigate the effects of different durations of Ascl1 expression and screen for potential small molecules to promote reprogramming. Ultimately, they identified two compounds with intended activities on mouse retina. The findings may aid in future development of a cell replacement strategy for treating retinal degeneration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The mechanistic insights are limited. Certain claims are confusing or superficial at this point.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the recommendations of the reviewers and have performed further analyses with existing data where requested.</p>
<p>Below are our responses to each of the individual points.</p>

<p>(1) P11 mouse retina is still quite young, would MG isolated from adult retina be more interesting and relevant to disease-oriented cell replacement therapy? How efficiently would the sci-Plex system work for in vitro screen of mature murine MG?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for bringing this up. While a protocol for the conversion of MG to neurons with adult mice in vivo exists, it has proven to be more difficult to maintain adult MG in dissociated cell cultures, due to their more limited proliferation in vitro. This makes it difficult to use the sci-Plex assay, since cell number is limiting for treatment conditions. Therefore, we have chosen the strategy of screening on P11, where MG undergo proliferative cell divisions in dissociated cultures, allowing us to grow the millions of cells needed for this assay, and then to test the efficacy of the compounds we find from the screen with an adult in vivo assay.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The study identified and tested the compounds individually, how would a combination of the compounds work in vivo? It would be interesting to examine how different combinations may affect the reprogramming efficiency and neuronal compositions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this would be very interesting to investigate.  However, the number of treatment conditions then expands beyond the scale of the current sci-Plex technology with the number of MG that we are able to collect.  We instead adopted the strategy of casting a very wide net to identify additional molecular pathways that might be important in the reprogramming process.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In-depth mechanistic and/or functional studies of the reprogrammed MG are highly desirable to improve the quality and significance of the study and to better understand how the compounds may influence the signaling and the reprogramming process.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree that this would strengthen the study, this would increase the scope of the required revisions considerably. We are very interested in following up on some of the hits and look forward to providing additional details of mechanisms in future publications.  However, we feel that reporting this method and the results will stimulate those interested in reprogramming glia in other areas of the nervous system to test the compounds we identified in this assay.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors employed two protocols to initiate direct reprogramming of MG into retinal neurons in vitro. These protocols, referred to as &quot;Timecourse&quot; and &quot;Pulse,&quot; involved short-term treatments lasting no more than 5 days. However, the findings obtained indicate that these brief treatments were insufficient to achieve a stable conversion. This conclusion is supported by the comparison between the &quot;4 days (Timecourse)&quot; and &quot;4 days (Pulse)&quot; conditions, as depicted in Figure 1 (D and E). In this set of experiments, labeling cells that express specific neuronal markers as neurons raises concerns, as these cells may have multiple fates, either died, reverted, arrested in certain intermediate stages, or converted to functional neurons. It is thus critical to determine whether the conversion to functional neurons is enhanced.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for your concern about this. We aimed to be very careful in our naming. In our naming scheme for this figure, we only consider the small number of cells with specific Bipolar markers (Trpm1, Grm6, Capb5, Otx2) neurons based on previous publications (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/yyN3xe/dXek+49D5+LI1F+rFYk">(Jorstad et al. 2017; Todd et al. 2021; Todd et al. 2022; Todd et al. 2020))</ext-link>. The other cells that have some neuronal markers are identified as neuronal precursors (NeuPre) and are, as you mentioned, not necessarily mature/functional. While these NeuPre cells may eventually have multiple fates/may die/may revert to more ProL cells at some rate we believe it’s fair to define them as Neuronal Precursors due to the genes they are expressing (Dcx, Snap25, Elavl3, Gap43) at the moment of collection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, your statement indicating that “the findings obtained indicate that these brief treatments were insufficient to achieve a stable conversion” is not what we intended to demonstrate. The text will be reworked to reflect what we hoped to convey. We acknowledge that 1) the majority cells are not stably converted, and 2) the levels of NeuPre cells are lower in the Pulse experiment overall, but this is true even at Day 5 when the conditions should be the same across experiments. The Pulse and Timecourse experiments were done on different days, and having previously found that there are differences in MG to BP conversion rate from experiment to experiment, these results were not unexpected. Of more note to us was that while ProL cells, Transition cells, and MG have very different patterns of abundance across time when comparing the experiments, the NeuPre cells accumulate at a similar time and pattern across the two experiments. This indicated to us that they uniquely have some amount of Ascl1 independent stability in their cell fate even when exposed to Ascl1 for as little as 3 days. See Author response image 1 below. This plot will be added to Fig. S1.</p>

<p>(2) The authors made a claim that a pseudo time value of 15 represents a crucial timepoint where the transition in cell fate becomes stable and ceases to rely on ectopic Ascl1 expression. However, it is essential to provide concrete evidence to substantiate this assertion. It is prudent to perform quantitative analyses rather than relying solely on the deduced trajectory to make this claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a fair point, the value of 15 was estimated by eye. We have returned to the data and estimated a density function for the pseudotime scores of the cells from the 1, 2, 3, and 4 day conditions in both the Pulse and Timecourse experiments (Author response image 2A-B below). We then calculated 16 to be the local minima between the pseudotime values of 10-20 for the Pulse experiment (Blue line). When comparing the two experiments, it’s apparent that there is a massive accumulation of cells with a pseudotime value just lower than 16 in the Timecouse experiment (values 10-15), and very few cells across the same region for the Pulse experiment, indicating some dependence on continued Ascl1 expression for the cell fate that exists from pseudotime 10-16 (mostly ProL cells). To the contrary, cells with greater pseudotime values exist across both experiments at similar levels.</p>
<p>We have also looked at the expression of Ascl1 along the pseudotime trajectory in the Timecourse experiment. Interestingly, and consistent with experiments in previous studies, both in vitro and in vivo <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/yyN3xe/49D5+LI1F+rFYk">(Todd et al. 2021; Todd et al. 2022; Todd et al. 2020),</ext-link> we see a decrease in Ascl1 expression as the cells move towards the end of the pseudotime trajectory (C below). It’s intriguing to us that the downregulation also happens right after a pseudotime value of 16. The temporal coalescence of the loss of Ascl1 expression in the Timecourse experiment with the persistence of cells with pseudotime values &gt; 16 in the Pulse experiment provides strong evidence that we have identified the point at which cells stop expressing Ascl1 while maintaining more mature cell fates. The plots below will be added to the manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) It is intriguing to observe that the expression of Ascl1 was down-regulated in both neuronal precursors and bipolar cells in the mouse retina following tamoxifen and NMDA treatment (refer to Fig. 3C). However, the expression of ectopical Ascl1 should have been constitutively activated by tamoxifen. Therefore, if the GFP+ bipolar cells and neuronal precursors were indeed converted from Müller cells, we would expect to capture a high level of Ascl1 expression. How to account for this discrepancy? How is the expression exogenous Ascl1 expressed from a constitutive promoter attenuated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above, this has been observed previously. Ascl1 driven from the TTA transgenic mouse line is high in the MG, but declines as these cells are reprogrammed into neurons in vivo or in vitro.  One possibility is that the TTA is not as active in neurons as in MG, but in other lines of transgenic mice, eg. TRE-Atoh1 mice, the transgene continues to be expressed at a high level even in the differentiating neurons, so this downregulation appears to be unique to Ascl1.  We do not understand why Ascl1 levels decline in the differentiating neurons, but this has been a consistent finding across several studies of in vivo and in vitro reprogramming.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Exogenous Ascl1 was shut down after other neuronal specific genes were induced during MG reprogramming in vitro. Is this also the case during Ascl1-mediated reprogramming in vivo? If so, do converting cells show a distinct gene expression program if exogenous Ascl1 is constitutively overexpressed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, as can be seen in Fig 3C Ascl1 expression is high in the MG and Transition cell populations, but decreases in the NeuPre and Bipolar cells. As stated above, continued high Ascl1 expression keeps cells in a more progenitor-like state. This is true in vivo and in vitro. It has been more clearly addressed upon revision.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) As previously documented in their Science Advances publication, the authors have established the requirement of NMDA injury for facilitating the successful induction of neuronal conversion through Ascl1 over-expression. Why is injury required for MG conversion in vivo, but not in vitro? This is related to question #1 above that certain signals may be required for the full conversion process, not just the initial induction of a few neuronal specific genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the in vitro and in vivo systems share similarities, there are key differences, which affect what must be done to the cells in order to produce converted neurons. In our initial publication demonstrating that Ascl1 can reprogram mouse MG to a neurogenic state, we carried out our experiments in dissociated cell cultures (Pollak et al 2013) like those described in this report.  At that time, we did not need to add either NMDA or TSA to the cultures to induce neurogenesis from Ascl1.  However, when we attempted the reprogramming in vivo, we found that after postnatal day 8, injury and TSA were required in vivo (Ueki et al; Jorstad et al). We surmise that the massive neuronal loss that occurs in establishing dissociated MG cultures replaces the NMDA injury we carry out in vivo.</p>
<p>To your second point about the requirement for more than “just the initial induction of a few neuronal specific genes”. This is definitely true. When we carry out reprogramming in vivo with Ascl1 or other transcription factors, the MG-derived neurons acquire neuronal morphology, develop neuron-like electrophysiological properties, integrate into the retinal circuit and respond to light stimulus; however, they are still not identical in gene expression or morphology to normal retinal neurons. This  is why we are continuously looking for more compounds or conditions that can help improve the process.</p>

<p>(6) The discovery that Metformin acts as a stimulator for MG-to-neuron conversion is interesting.</p>
<p>However, before drawing definitive conclusions, several questions need to be addressed:</p>
<p>(a) As specific small molecules have been identified to change cell fates, the question is whether Metformin and other effective compounds can function alone or have to effect in conjunction with Ascl1? This can and should be tested in vitro by simply treating MG with Metformin but not doxycycline.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To our knowledge there are no convincing in vivo trials in which neurons have been generated from MG using only combinations of small molecules. Because Metformin was identified in vitro due to the increase in recovered cells and not an increase in % neurons, we especially doubt it would have the desired increase in neurons without expression of a transcription factor.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(b) Metformin is known to target AMPK, but this is unlikely the only target of the drug. Does AMPK knockdown have the same enhancement effect?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the drug screen, we also tested the AMPK inhibitor Dorsomorphin dihydrochloride, but it didn’t have any effect. However, Metformin is an activator, so it would be interesting to see in future studies if Dorsomorphin dihydrochloride could inhibit the effect of Metformin or if the enhancement is acting independently.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(c) Is the effect of Metformin specific for Ascl1 or any TF(s) that stimulates MG-to-neuron conversion?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to follow up with this in future.</p>
