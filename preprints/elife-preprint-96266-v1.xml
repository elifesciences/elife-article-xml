<title>Abstract</title><p>Programmed cell death occurring during plant development (dPCD) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction. Here, we investigate the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus <italic>Serendipita indica</italic>, primarily in the differentiation zone. <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants additionally exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced root-growth promotion. This demonstrates that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Additionally, reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that <italic>BFN1</italic> expression is downregulated during <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting transcriptional control as a means for microbial regulation of host dPCD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant roots elongate by producing new cells in the root apical meristem at the root tip. As roots extend further into the soil environment, the newly formed root tissue is naturally exposed to microbial attack, challenging the successful establishment of root systems. However, microbial colonization at the meristematic zone is rarely detected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The sensitive tissue of meristematic stem cells is surrounded by the root cap, a specialized root organ that orchestrates root architecture, directs root growth based on gravitropism and hydrotropism, and senses environmental stimuli. In addition, the root cap is presumed to have a protective function in soil exploration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (hereafter Arabidopsis), the root cap consists of two distinct tissues: the centrally located columella root cap at the very root tip and the peripherally located lateral root cap (LRC), which flanks both the columella and the entire root meristem <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. A ring of specific stem cells continuously generates both new LRC cells and root epidermal cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, despite the constant production of LRC cells, the root cap itself does not grow in size but matches the size of the meristem <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To maintain size homeostasis, root cap development is a highly regulated process that varies in different plant species. In Arabidopsis, a combination of dPCD and shedding of old cells into the rhizosphere has been described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The centrally located columella root cap along with adjacent proximal LRC cells is shed as a cell package, followed by a PCD process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In contrast, LRC cells at the distal end of the root tip elongate and reach the edge of the meristematic zone where they undergo dPCD, orchestrated as part of a terminal differentiation program by the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC33/SOMBRERO (SMB) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. SMB belongs to a plant-specific family of transcription factors carrying a NAC domain (NAM - no apical meristem; ATAF1 and -2, and CUC2 - cup-shaped cotyledon). SMB promotes the expression of genes involved in the initiation and execution of LRC cell death, including the senescence-associated bifunctional nuclease <italic>BFN1</italic> and the putative aspartic protease <italic>PASPA3</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. BFN1 localizes in the ER, but upon cell death the protein is released and its nuclease activity ensures rapid and irreversible degradation of RNA and DNA in the nucleus and cytoplasm as part of a rapid cell-autonomous corpse clearance at the root surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Accordingly, DNA and RNA fragmentation in <italic>bfn1-1</italic> loss-of-function mutants is delayed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Precise timing of cell death and elimination of LRC cells before they fully enter the elongation zone is essential for maintaining root cap size and optimal root growth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Loss of SMB activity results in a delayed cell death, causing LRC cells to enter the elongation zone where they eventually die without expression of dPCD executor genes in the root cap <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the aberrant cell death of LRC cells in the elongation zone of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants is not followed by corpse clearance, resulting in an accumulation of uncleared cell corpses along the entire root surface <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite its importance in root morphology and plant development, little is known about the importance of dPCD and rapid cell corpse clearance on plant-microbe interactions. To address this question, we tested two well-characterized loss-of-function T-DNA insertion lines, <italic>smb-3</italic> and <italic>bfn1-1</italic>, during colonization with <italic>Serendipita indica</italic>, a beneficial fungus of the order Sebacinales. As a root endophyte, <italic>S. indica</italic> colonizes the epidermal and cortex layers of a broad range of different plant hosts, conferring various beneficial effects, including plant growth promotion, protection against pathogenic microbes and increased tolerance to abiotic stresses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The colonization strategy of <italic>S. indica</italic> comprises an initial biotrophic interaction, followed by a growth phase associated with a restricted host cell death that does not, however, diminish the beneficial effects on the plant host. The induction of restricted cell death in the epidermal and cortex layers is a crucial component of the colonization strategy of <italic>S. indica</italic> and is accompanied by an increased production of fungal hydrolytic enzymes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The switch between biotrophic and cell death-associated phase can vary depending on the host system and environmental conditions, but has been postulated to occur approximately 6 to 8 days post inoculation (dpi) in Arabidopsis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Although several effector proteins involved in fungal accommodation have been described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, the exact mechanism by which <italic>S. indica</italic> manipulates host cell death and the role of dPCD in fungal accommodation in the roots are largely unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we show that the accumulation of uncleared LRC cell corpses on the roots of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants triggers hypercolonization by <italic>S. indica</italic>, especially around the meristematic zone, and delays <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced root growth promotion. We propose that a tight regulation of host dPCD and rapid and complete root cap clearance play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. Furthermore, we show that <italic>S. indica</italic> downregulates <italic>BFN1</italic> in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. Our results emphasize that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant dPCD processes to enhance host colonization.</p>

<title>The SMB-mediated clearance of dead cells protects the root meristem and regulates symbiosis</title>
<p>dPCD and corpse clearance are the final steps of LRC differentiation that maintain root cap organ size in root tips of Arabidopsis. This process is orchestrated by the LRC-specific transcription factor SMB and executed by its direct and indirect downstream targets (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). To characterize the role of disrupted dPCD in Arabidopsis LRCs, we analyzed the phenotypic implications of the SMB loss-of-function allele <italic>smb-3</italic>. We first visualized the extent of cell death in the <italic>smb-3</italic> T-DNA insertion line with Evans blue staining, a viability dye that penetrates non-viable and damaged/dying cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Evans blue staining highlighted the presence of uncleared LRC cell corpses along the surface of primary roots of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants, starting at the distal boarder of the meristematic zone (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref> and Fig. S1A</bold>). We further characterized <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants with Proteostat staining, a fluorescent dye that binds to quaternary protein structures typically found in misfolded and/or aggregated and condensed proteins (hereafter referred to as protein aggregates) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Proteostat staining revealed an accumulation of protein aggregates in uncleared dead LRC cells adhering to the roots of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D – F</xref></bold>). Additional filter trap analysis confirmed increased levels of protein aggregates in <italic>smb-3</italic> mutant compared to WT roots (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>). We previously observed that aggregated proteins accumulate in WT roots in dying and sloughed columella cell packages but not in young LRC-, meristematic- or healthy differentiated-cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Notably, in <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants, neither Proteostat nor Evans blue was detected in young LRC cells covering the meristem or in epidermal cells beneath the uncleared LRC cell corpses along the elongation and differentiation zone. This highlights that loss of SMB activity specifically affects the induction of dPCD in LRC cells at the transition between meristematic and elongation zone (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, F</xref> and Fig. S1A</bold>). These data show that the delayed cell death of LRC cells of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants in the elongation zone is accompanied by an impaired protein homeostasis (proteostasis), resulting in the accumulation of misfolded and aggregated proteins in uncleared LRC cell corpses.</p>

<p>To assess the effects of impaired dPCD processes in the <italic>smb-3</italic> mutant root cap on plant- microbe interactions, we measured colonization rates of <italic>S. indica</italic>. We quantified extraradical colonization using the chitin-binding fluorescent marker Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated to Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA-AF 488) as a proxy for fungal biomass. We compared staining intensities of WGA-AF 488 between <italic>S. indica</italic>-colonized WT and <italic>smb-3</italic> roots. <italic>S. indica</italic> showed a clear hypercolonization phenotype along the main root axis of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref></bold>). On WT roots, <italic>S. indica</italic> preferentially colonized the differentiation zone, leaving the meristematic and elongation zone largely uncolonized, whereas mycelial growth was clearly detectable at the root tips of <italic>smb-3</italic> plants (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Fig. S1B</bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Intraradical colonization by <italic>S. indica</italic> was quantified by comparing fungal and plant single-copy housekeeping marker genes using quantitative PCR (qPCR), after washing of roots to remove outer fungal mycelium. The results showed a significant increase in intraradical fungal accommodation in <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants compared to WT roots (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). To assess the biological implications of hypercolonization, we measured <italic>S. indica</italic>-induced root growth in WT and <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants. While <italic>S. indica</italic> consistently and significantly increased root length in WT plants at 8, 10 and 14 dpi, increased length of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutant roots was only observable at later stages of colonization, indicating a delayed growth promotion phenotype (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>). Detailed cytological analysis confirmed that <italic>S. indica</italic> grew extensively around the meristematic zone of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants but not of WT roots (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B</xref></bold>) and showed increased colonization of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants in the differentiation zone (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). We further observed that <italic>S. indica</italic> was accommodated in cells that were subject to cell death and protein aggregation in the <italic>smb-3</italic> background (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, D, E</xref></bold>). Together, these findings indicate that loss of SMB activity in the root cap results in an accumulation of uncleared LRC cell corpses that promotes fungal colonization from the meristematic to the differentiation zone. Therefore, we postulate that the continuous clearance of root cap cells in WT roots is important to limit microbial colonization along the entire root axis and prevent microbial colonization in the meristematic zone.</p>

<p>While <italic>SMB</italic> expression is restricted to the LRC, <italic>BFN1</italic> exhibits a broader expression pattern across various cell types and tissues, such as root cap cells, cells adjacent to emerging lateral root primordia, differentiating xylem tracheary elements, as well as senescent leaves, and abscission zones of flowers and seeds <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. This widespread expression establishes BFN1 as a key player in the general regulation of dPCD and senescence processes in various tissues in Arabidopsis. To visualize the extent of <italic>BFN1</italic> downregulation upon <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization in different zones of the root, we used a transgenic <italic>BFN1</italic> promoter-reporter line (<italic>pBFN1::NLS-tdTOMATO</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In agreement with the previously described GUS reporter lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, we detected activation of the <italic>BFN1</italic> promoter via accumulation of the fluorescent tdTOMATO signal in the nucleus of root cap and xylem cells in mock-treated roots (<bold>Fig. S2A</bold>). Additionally, we observed promoter activation in epidermal root cells of the differentiation zone (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref></bold>). In the distal region of the differentiation zone in young epidermal cells, the tdTOMATO signal was observed in nuclei, while in the basal region of the differentiation zone in older epidermal cells, the tdTOMATO signal appeared to be dispersed (<bold>Fig S2</bold>). These findings indicate ongoing nuclear membrane degradation and cell death in the older part of the root, independent of fungal colonization and suggest activation of <italic>BFN1</italic> during root epidermal cell aging/senescence. Next, we inoculated the <italic>pBFN1</italic> reporter lines with <italic>S. indica</italic> and observed a reduction in promoter activity in epidermal cells that were in contact with the fungus compared with mock-treated roots (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E, F</xref></bold>). <italic>BFN1</italic> expression and nuclear localization in the root cap or xylem was not affected by <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization (<bold>Fig. S2B</bold>). This indicates that the downregulation of <italic>BFN1</italic> by <italic>S. indica</italic> occurs mainly in epidermal cells of the differentiation zone and is regulated independently of SMB and its activity in the root cap.</p>
<p>To assess the phenotypic effects of <italic>BFN1</italic> downregulation, we analyzed Arabidopsis <italic>bfn1-1</italic> KO mutants using the cell death and protein aggregates markers, Evans blue and Proteostat. Staining of <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants with Evans blue showed an increase of cell remnants in the epidermal cell layer of the differentiation zone (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref></bold>), consistent with a proposed delay of dPCD and cell corpse clearance by the BFN1 activity. Furthermore, while WT roots were devoid of protein aggregates, <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants exhibited aggregates along the primary root axis, starting at the transition between elongation and differentiation zone. The meristematic zone remained free of protein aggregates (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, D</xref></bold>). These data suggest that the lack of BFN1 activity in the root cap, xylem, and senescent epidermis creates a general cellular stress in the roots that affects proteostasis in the differentiation zone (<bold>Fig. S3</bold>). Similar to <italic>bfn1-1</italic>, WT roots colonized by <italic>S. indica</italic> showed increased Evans blue and Proteostat signal in the differentiation zone. Aggregated proteins were detected in colonized and adjacent non-colonized cells along the differentiation zone, suggesting a non-cell autonomous host response to the fungus (<bold>Fig. S4</bold>).</p>

<p>To investigate the biological relevance of <italic>BFN1</italic> downregulation during <italic>S. indica</italic> root colonization, we quantified extraradical fungal growth using the WGA-AF 488 stain. When comparing staining intensities of <italic>S. indica</italic>-inoculated <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants and WT seedlings, we observed a significantly stronger fluorescence signal at the roots of <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants, indicating a higher extraradical fungal colonization along the differentiation zone (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, F</xref> and Fig. S3D</bold>). However, similar to WT roots, <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants did not exhibit fungal colonization around the meristematic zone as observed in <italic>smb-3</italic>-colonized roots (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). Quantification of intraradical colonization by qPCR, after removal of outer fungal mycelium, showed a significant increase of <italic>S. indica</italic> biomass in <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants at later stages of interaction (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref></bold>). Together, these results emphasize that downregulation of <italic>BFN1</italic> during colonization is beneficial for intra- and extraradical fungal accommodation in the differentiation zone.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the impact of other beneficial microbes on dPCD by examining transcriptional responses in Arabidopsis roots colonized by different organisms. These included <italic>S. vermifera</italic>, an orchid mycorrhizal fungus closely related to <italic>S. indica</italic>, and two bacterial synthetic communities derived from either Arabidopsis roots or the rhizosphere of <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In all three interactions, <italic>BFN1</italic> expression was consistently decreased in Arabidopsis roots (<bold>Fig. S5A</bold>). Additionally, RNA-Seq analysis of Arabidopsis dPCD marker genes during <italic>S. vermifera</italic> colonization confirmed the downregulation of <italic>BFN1</italic> (<bold>Fig. S5 B, C</bold>).

<caption><title>dPCD and its proposed effects on plant-microbe interactions.</title><p>The root cap protects and covers the stem cells of the root apical meristem. Its size in Arabidopsis is maintained by a high cellular turnover of root cap cells. While the columella root cap is shed from the root tip, a dPCD machinery marks the final step of LRC differentiation and prevents LRC cells from entering into the elongation zone. Induction of cell death by the transcription factor SMB is followed by irreversible DNA fragmentation and cell corpse clearance, mediated by the nuclease BFN1, a downstream executor of dPCD (Fendrych et al., 2014). The absence of dPCD induction in the <italic>smb-3</italic> knockout mutant leads to a delay in LRC differentiation and allows LRC cells to enter the elongation zone, where they die uncontrolled, resulting in an accumulation of LRC cell corpses along the differentiation zone. In a WT background, the fungal endophyte <italic>S. indica</italic> colonizes the differentiation zone of Arabidopsis roots and can also be found in shed columella cell packages. The impaired dPCD of the s<italic>mb-3</italic> mutant phenotype results in a hypercolonization of Arabidopsis, along the differentiation zone as well as the meristematic zone, highlighting that the continuous clearance of root cap cells is necessary for restricting microbial accommodation at the meristematic zone. Loss of the downstream dPCD executor <italic>BFN1</italic> does not affect fungal colonization in the meristematic zone but increases accommodation by <italic>S. indica</italic> in the differentiation zone, where BFN1 appears to be involved in dPCD of senescent epidermal cells and undergoes downregulation during <italic>S. indica</italic> colonization.</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated the functional link between dPCD and microbial accommodation in roots. Impaired dPCD in the Arabidopsis <italic>smb-3</italic> and <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants increased colonization by the beneficial endophyte <italic>S. indica</italic>. The <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants display hypercolonization along the entire primary root, suggesting that the extra sheet of cell corpses surrounding <italic>smb-3</italic> roots provide additional and easily accessible nutrients that fuel fungal colonization. In fact, we observed a clearing effect with progressive colonization stages. Furthermore, hypercolonization of Arabidopsis, caused by the loss of dPCD in the root cap, mitigates the beneficial effects of <italic>S. indica</italic> by delaying the induction of growth promotion. Most notably, we observed hypercolonization of the meristematic zone of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). The root apical meristem embedded in this zone of the root tip is essential for root growth, as all primary root tissue originates from these continuously dividing and differentiating stem cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. This sensitive tissue is surrounded by the root cap, which protects it from external stresses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The phenotype of <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants shows resemblance to the human skin disease hyperkeratosis. In healthy human skin, a pool of stem cells produces layers of cells that divide, differentiate, die, and are shed. Such developmental programs form a physical and dynamic barrier against environmental factors. Microbes attempting to establish themselves are consistently removed by skin exfoliation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Patients with hyperkeratosis show an accumulation of dead cells on the outer skin layer, making them more susceptible to microbial infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Likewise, malfunctions within regulated cell death in mammal gut epithelial cells produce death-induced nutrient release (DINNR) that can fuel bacterial growth and infection and could cause a variety of disorders such as inflammatory diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. The importance of an intact root cap in plant-microbe interactions is further highlighter by the fact that the physical removal of root caps in maize plants leads to increased colonization of the root tip by the plant growth promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and to changes in the rhizosphere microbiome composition along the root axis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Moreover, it has been suggested that border cells released from the root cap may distract root-feeding nematodes from attacking plant roots <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Our results provide strong evidence that root cap size maintenance in the form of constant root cap cell turnover in Arabidopsis acts as a dynamic barrier, analogous to epidermal cell turnover in animals. It thus represents a sophisticated physical mechanism to prevent or reduce intracellular microbial colonization near the root meristematic tissue and contributes to the maintenance of a beneficial interaction with root endophytes.</p>
<p>Mutation of <italic>BFN1</italic> displayed significantly increased colonization in the differentiation zone but not in the meristematic zone (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). The differences in colonization patterns to the <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants likely reflect spatial expression and localization patterns of SMB and BFN1 activity throughout Arabidopsis roots. While the expression of the transcription factor <italic>SMB</italic> is restricted to the LRC, the senescence-associated nuclease <italic>BFN1</italic> is expressed in different tissues undergoing dPCD and senescence below and above ground <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Here, we show that <italic>BFN1</italic> is additionally expressed in differentiated root epidermal cells that undergo nuclear degradation during root maturation. This suggests an age-dependent dPCD in the outer epidermal layer of Arabidopsis roots where expression of <italic>BFN1</italic> possibly pre-dates cortical and epidermal abscission during secondary root growth and contributes to clearance of cell corpses during periderm emergence <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. This process resembles root cortex senescence (RCS) and cell death (RCD) in grass species such as wheat, barley, and corn, which typically start in the epidermis and spread toward the endodermis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we observe differences in the presence and distribution of protein aggregates in <italic>smb-3</italic> and <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutants. In <italic>smb-3</italic> mutants protein aggregates are restricted to LRC cells adhering to the primary root. In contrast, <italic>bfn1-1</italic> mutation results in scattered cell death in the epidermal cell layer, which is additionally littered with protein aggregates along the differentiation zone, regardless of the occurrence of cell death.</p>
<p>While we show that dPCD protect the meristem from microbial colonization, we propose that some adapted microbes manipulate host dPCD processes by affecting the transcriptional expression of <italic>BFN1</italic> to facilitate accommodation in the root. Whether active interference by fungal effector proteins, fungal-derived signaling molecules or a systemic response of Arabidopsis roots underlies <italic>BFN1</italic> downregulation by <italic>S. indica</italic> remains to be investigated. It was recently demonstrated that small active metabolites produced either by Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-containing leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> or by fungal-derived enzymes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> through hydrolysis of RNA/DNA can mediate host cell death. This raise the exiting possibility that RNAse and DNAse activities of BFN1 may be involved in the production of small active nucleotide-derived metabolites that affect cell death, cell corpse clearance, proteostasis and fungal accommodation in the differentiation zone. This hypothesis should be followed up by metabolomic and proteomic approaches. Notably, we have shown that other beneficial microbes such as the closely related fungus <italic>S. vermifera</italic> and synthetic bacterial communities isolated from Arabidopsis and <italic>H. vulgare</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> also downregulate <italic>BFN1</italic> in Arabidopsis. These findings emphasize the presence of a conserved pathway influenced by diverse beneficial microbes to downregulate <italic>BFN1</italic> expression in epidermal tissue to facilitate symbioses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data show that tight regulation of host dPCD in epidermal- and root cap-tissue plays an important role in restricting fungal colonization. From a microbial perspective, dPCD pathways represent a potential intersection for promoting symbiotic interactions and possibly nutrient availability (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref></bold>). These results shed light on the complex relationship between PCD and microbial accommodation in plant roots, offering valuable insights into the development of plants that establish more efficient partnerships with beneficial microbes.</p>

A cellulose acetate membrane filter (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and 3 filter papers (BioRad, 1620161) were immersed in 1x PBS and placed in a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) connected to a vacuum system. The membrane was equilibrated by 3 washes with equilibration buffer (native buffer containing 0.5% SDS). 300, 200 and 100 µg of the protein extract were mixed with SDS at a final concentration of 0.5% and filtered through the membrane. The membrane was then washed with 0.2% SDS and blocked with 3% BSA in TBST for 30 minutes, followed by 3 washes with TBST. Incubation was performed with anti-polyQ [1:1000] (Merck, MAB1574). The membrane was washed 3 times for 5 min and incubated with secondary antibodies in TBST 3% BSA for 30 min. The membrane was developed using the Odyssey M Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Extracts were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting against anti-Actin [1:5000] (Agrisera, AS132640) to determine loading controls.</p>

<title>Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and Proteostat staining quantification</title>
<p>CLSM images were acquired using either the FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus) or a Meta 710 confocal microscope with laser ablation 266 nm (Zeiss). All images were acquired using the same parameters between experiments. Excitation of WGA-AF 488 was done with an argon laser at 488 nm and the emitted light was detected with a hybrid detector at 500-550 nm. Proteostat was excited at 561 nm and the signal was detected between 590-700 nm. Hoechst was excited with a diode laser at 405 nm and the emitted light was detected with a hybrid detector at 415-460 nm.</p>

<title>Proteostat staining</title>
<p>For the detection of aggregated proteins, we used the Proteostat Aggresome detection kit (Enzo Life Sciences). Seedlings were stained according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Seedlings were incubated with permeabilizing solution (0.5% Triton X-100, 3 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 30 minutes at 4°C with gentle shaking. The seedlings were washed twice with 1X PBS. Then the plants were incubated in the dark with 1x PBS supplemented with 0.5 µl/ml Proteostat and 0.5 µl/ml Hoechst 33342 (nuclear stain) for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the seedlings were washed twice with 1x PBS and mounted on a slide for CLSM analysis or in mounted in fresh MS plates for LI-COR analysis. Quantification of Proteostat fluorescence was performed using Fiji software or EmpiriaStudio Software (LI-COR Biosciences).</p>

<title>Transcriptomic analysis</title>
<p>Arabidopsis Col-0 WT roots were inoculated with <italic>S. indica</italic>. Arabidopsis roots were harvested from mock-treated plants and inoculated plants at four different time points post inoculation: 1, 3, 6 and 10 dpi. Three biological replicates were used for each condition. The RNA-seq libraries were generated and sequenced at US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) under a project proposal (Proposal ID: 505829) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. For each sample, stranded RNA-Seq libraries were generated and quantified by qRT-PCR. RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced with Illumina sequencer. Raw reads were filtered and trimmed using the JGI QC pipeline. Filtered reads from each library were aligned to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10) using HISAT2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and the reads mapped to each gene were counted using featureCounts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Samples harvested at 1 dpi were omitted from the analysis because we decided to focus on the time points at which the interaction between Arabidopsis and <italic>S. indica</italic> is well established. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the R package DESeq2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Genes with an FDR adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs).</p>

<p>This study explores the interplay between fungal colonization and controlled programmed cell death in Arabidopsis thaliana root cells. The authors reveal how this process is affected by corpse clearance in the root cap, highlighting some of the key elements in this process including a root cap-specific transcription factor. With this, the authors have discovered an <bold>important</bold> relationship between transcriptional regulation of developmentally controlled cell death and the beneficial colonization of plants by fungi. The work thus establishes a <bold>solid</bold> basis for further studies of plant-microbiome associations along the root axis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study investigated how root cap cell corpse removal affects the ability of microbes to colonize Arabidopsis thaliana plants. The findings demonstrate how programmed cell death and its control in root cap cells affect the establishment of symbiotic relationships between plants and fungi. Key details on molecular mechanisms and transcription factors involved are also given. The study suggests reevaluating microbiome assembly from the root tip, thus challenging traditional ideas about this process. While the work presents a key foundation, more research along the root axis is recommended to gain a better understanding of the spatial and temporal aspects of microbiome recruitment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identify the root cap as an important key region for establishing microbial symbioses with roots. By highlighting for the first time the crucial importance of tight regulation of a specific form of programmed cell death of root cap cells and the clearance of their cell corpses, they start unraveling the molecular mechanisms and its regulation at the root cap (e.g. by identifying an important transcription factor) for the establishment of symbioses with fungi (and potentially also bacterial microbiomes).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is often believed that the recruitment of plant microbiomes occurs from bulk soil to rhizosphere to endosphere. These authors demonstrate that we have to re-think microbiome assembly as a process starting and regulated at the root tip and proceeding along the root axis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study is a first crucial starting point to investigate the spatial recruitment of beneficial microorganisms along the root axis of plants. It identifies e.g. an important transcription factor for programmed cell death, but more detailed investigations along the root axis are now needed to better understand - spatially and temporally - the orchestration of microbiome recruitment.</p>
