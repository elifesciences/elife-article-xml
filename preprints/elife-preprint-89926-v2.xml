<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>In a developing nervous system, axonal arbors often undergo complex rearrangements before neural circuits attain their final innervation topology. In the lateral line sensory system of the zebrafish, developing sensory axons reorganize their terminal arborization patterns to establish precise neural microcircuits around the mechanosensory hair cells. However, a quantitative understanding of the changes in the sensory arbor morphology and the regulators behind the microcircuit assembly remain enigmatic. Here, we report that Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) acts as an important mediator of these processes. Utilizing a semi-automated three-dimensional neurite tracing methodology and computational techniques, we have identified and quantitatively analyzed distinct topological features that shape the network in wild-type and Sema7A loss-of-function mutants. In contrast to those of wild-type animals, the sensory axons in Sema7A mutants display aberrant arborizations with disorganized network topology and diminished contacts to hair cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of a secreted form of Sema7A by non-hair cells induces chemotropic guidance of sensory axons. Our findings propose that Sema7A likely functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pathfinding axons are directed to their appropriate synaptic targets by a variety of guidance cues. While approaching or traversing the target field, the growth cones of migrating axons encounter secreted or cell surface-attached ligands and respond by steering toward or away from their sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Fine-grained control of these factors is critical for the establishment of proper neural circuitry.</p>
<p>The zebrafish’s lateral line provides a tractable <italic>in vivo</italic> system for exploring the mechanisms that guide the assembly of neural circuits in a peripheral nervous system. In particular, it is possible to detect individual hair cells and the sensory axons that innervate them throughout the first week of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The primary posterior lateral line on each side of the zebrafish’s tail consists of about seven neuromasts, which contain mechanoreceptive hair cells of opposing polarities—half sensitive to headward (rostrad) water motion and the complementary half to tailward (caudad) water motion—that cluster at their centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The sensory axons of the lateral-line nerve branch, arborize, and consolidate around the basolateral surfaces of the hair cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To aid in an animal’s swimming behavior, these hair cells sense water currents and relay signals to the brain through the sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The well-defined structure of the ramifications and synaptic contacts of the sensory axons highlight the need to determine the molecular signals behind the assembly of such precise microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>We adopted a candidate-gene strategy to seek factors that direct the growth of afferent growth cones in the zebrafish’s lateral line. Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data identified the <italic>semaphorin7a</italic> (<italic>sema7a</italic>) gene to be highly expressed in hair cells of that organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Semaphorins are important regulators of axonal growth and target finding during the patterning of diverse neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The semaphorin family includes proteins that are secreted, transmembrane, and cell surface-attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Among these, Semaphorin7A (Sema7A) is the only molecule that is anchored to the outer leaflet of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Unlike many other semaphorins, which act as repulsive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), Sema7A is involved in promoting axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and imparting directional signals by interacting with the integrin and plexin families of receptors residing on the pathfinding axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Sema7A likely occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> in both GPI-anchored and soluble forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), and studies of neuronal explants confirm that both forms can induce directed axonal outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the GPI anchor is cleaved by membrane-resident GPI-specific phospholipases (GPI-PLs) or matrix metalloproteases to release the Sema7A into the extracellular environment and thus regulate dynamic cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Because these observations indicate that Sema7A might influence neuronal development both as a juxtracrine and as a diffusive signal, we investigated the role of Sema7A in sculpting a vertebrate peripheral sensory organ.</p>

<title>Sema7A expression and localization in hair cells</title>
<p>The zebrafish genome contains a single <italic>sema7a</italic> gene that produces two transcripts. One transcript encodes Sema7A-GPI, a full-length, GPI-linked, cell surface-attached protein. The second transcript yields Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>, a protein with a truncated C-terminus, which we conjecture is secreted into the local environment. Each transcript encodes an N-terminal signal sequence and a single copy of the conserved Sema domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). To detect the presence of both <italic>sema7a</italic> transcripts in the hair cells of the lateral-line neuromasts, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to capture the labeled hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and isolated total RNA. Using primers that flank the regions encoding the conserved Sema domain and the distinct C-termini of the two transcripts, we performed reverse transcription and polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) to identify both the membrane-anchored and the secreted transcript in developing larvae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). Single-cell RNA sequencing data also have shown that the GPI-linked <italic>sema7a</italic> transcript is particularly enriched in the immature and mature hair cells of the neuromast during early larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), a period when sensory axons of the posterior lateral line contact hair cells and form synapses with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Indeed, we have observed Sema7A to be specifically localized in both mature and immature hair cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>).</p>
<p>As neuromasts mature, the contacts between sensory axons and hair cells increase in number, become stabilized, and establish synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Because Sema7A can modulate axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), we wondered whether the level of Sema7A also changes during neuromast development. Upon quantifying the average intensity of Sema7A, we found similar expression in rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells of neuromasts at 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 days post fertilization (dpf). The average Sema7A intensity increased significantly over this period in both rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells. At 1.5 dpf, the neuromasts harbor primarily immature hair cells that make minimal contacts with sensory axons and do not form stable association with axonal terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). At this stage the average Sema7A intensity in hair cells remained low. By 2-4 dpf the hair cells mature to form stable contacts and well-defined synapses with the sensory axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The average Sema7A intensity in hair cells at each of these stages rose to levels that significantly exceeded those of 1.5 dpf neuromasts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This rise in the amount of Sema7A during neuromast maturation supports a role for Sema7A in the guidance of sensory axons and their interaction with hair cells.</p>
<p>We additionally demonstrated an anisotropic distribution of Sema7A along the apicobasal axis of each hair cell. As neuromasts develop through 2, 3, and 4 dpf, Sema7A remained highly enriched in the subapical region of the hair cell, the site of the Golgi network (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). This localization suggests that Sema7A—like other proteins of the semaphorin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>)—is directed to the plasmalemma through Golgi-mediated vesicular trafficking. Using the transgenic line <italic>Tg(cldnb:LY-mScarlet)</italic> that expresses membrane-tethered mScarlet in all cells of the neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), we detected Sema7A at the plasma membrane and potentially in vesicles (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E-H</xref>). While Sema7A maintained a high level in the subapical region, the protein increasingly accumulated at the base of the hair cell: the Sema7A level at the hair cell base was low at 2 dpf, but increased sharply by 3 dpf and 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>,<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">J</xref>). During this period the hair cells increase in number and mature, whereas the associated sensory axons arborize to contact multiple hair cells and form robust synaptic boutons at their bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Does progressive basal accumulation of Sema7A facilitate association of sensory axon terminals to the hair cell? To address this question, we utilized doubly labeled transgenic fish <italic>Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP;neurod1:tdTomato)</italic> that marked the hair cells and the sensory axons of the posterior lateral line with distinct fluorophores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). We quantified the average Sema7A intensity and the accumulation of sensory arbors, measured by td-Tomato intensity, at the bases of the hair cells. Across developmental stages, the basal association of the sensory arbors showed a positive correlation with Sema7A accumulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>,<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">I</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A-E</xref>, Video 1). The progressive enrichment of Sema7A at the hair cell base with the sensory axons suggests that Sema7A acts as a mediator of contacts between sensory axons and hair cells.</p>

<title>Sema7A restricts sensory axons around clustered hair cells</title>
<p>If Sema7A guides and restricts the sensory arbors at and around the hair cells clustered in a neuromast, then inactivating Sema7A function should disrupt this process. To test this hypothesis, we obtained a <italic>sema7a</italic> mutant allele (<italic>sema7a<sup>sa24691</sup></italic>) with a point mutation that introduces a premature stop codon in the conserved sema domain (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The homozygous mutant, hereafter designated <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic>, should lack both the secreted and the membrane-attached forms of Sema7A. The average intensity of Sema7A immunolabeling in hair cells diminished by 61% in <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic>larvae (0.34 ± 0.01 arbitrary units) in comparison to controls (0.87 ± 0.01 arbitrary units). In a few cases we observed minute accumulations of Sema7A at the subapical region, but little or no protein at the base of the mutant hair cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we tested the mechanotransduction ability of <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutant hair cells by labeling with the styryl dye FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> larvae incorporated the FM4-64 as effectively as the control animals. This result suggests that the mutation does not impact essential hair cell functions (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>,<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, Videos 2,3).</p>

<p>(A) In a micrograph of a 3 dpf <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromast, Myosin VI (green) marks the hair cells (green dashed lines) in which the level of Sema7A (orange) is highly reduced, with sporadic localization in the subapical region (arrowheads) and none in the basolateral (arrow) region. A plot of normalized Sema7A intensity from 99 control and 100 <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hair cells quantitates the effect. (B,C) Surface views of a control and a <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromast at 4 dpf depict the interaction of the sensory arbors (magenta) with hair cell clusters (green). In the control, the arbors intimately contact the hair cells, with a few exceptions (arrowhead). In the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant, the arbors direct many aberrant projections (arrowheads) away from the hair cell cluster.

<p>To characterize the impact of the <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mutation on arbor patterning, we utilized doubly labeled transgenic fish <italic>Tg(myo6b:actb1-EGFP;neurod1:tdTomato)</italic> that distinctly labeled the hair cells and the sensory arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). In control neuromasts, the sensory axons approached, arborized, and consolidated around the bases of clustered hair cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Although the sensory axons approached the hair cells of <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts, they displayed aberrant arborization patterns with wayward projections that extended transversely to the organ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). To quantitatively analyze the arborization morphology, we traced the sensory arbors in three dimensions to generate skeletonized network traces that depict–as pseudocolored trajectories–the increase in arbor length from the point of arborization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>).</p>
<p>To visualize the hair cell clusters and associated arborization networks from multiple neuromasts, we aligned images of hair cell clusters, registered them at their hair bundles, from neuromasts at 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>,<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Throughout development, the arborization networks of control neuromasts largely remained within the contours of the hair cell clusters; the few that reached farther nonetheless lingered nearby (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>,<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">I</xref>). This result suggests that an attractive cue retained the axons near the sensory organ. In <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neuromasts, however the neuronal arbors failed to consolidate within the boundaries of hair cell clusters and extended far beyond them (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>,<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">J</xref>; Video 4).</p>
<p>We quantified the distribution of the sensory arbors around the center of the combined hair cell clusters. For both the control and the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts, the arbor densities peaked proximal to the boundaries of the hair cell clusters. Beyond the cluster boundaries, in control neuromasts at 2 dpf, 3 dpf, and 4 dpf the arbor densities fell sharply at respectively 31.7 µm, 36.6 µm, and 32.7 µm from the center. In <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts of the same ages, the sensory arbors extended respectively 38.5 µm, 51.4 µm, and 56.6 µm from the center (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>,<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">L</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, we quantified the degree of contact of the sensory arbors to their hair cell clusters in individual neuromasts from both control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants. In control neuromasts, the degree of contact was 83 ± 1 % (mean ± SEM) at 2 dpf and 84 ± 1 % at 3 dpf, but significantly increased to 90 ± 1 % at 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This observation indicates that the sensory arbors reinforce their association to the hair cell clusters as neuromasts develop. However, in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts such contact was significantly reduced. Only 69 ± 4 % of sensory arbors at 2 dpf were closely associated with the corresponding hair cell clusters, a value that remained at 67 ± 2 % at both 3 dpf and 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). These findings signify that, with simultaneous disruption of both signaling modalities of Sema7A, the organ fails to restrict the localization of sensory arbors and has significantly diminished contact with them.</p>

<title>Sema7A patterns the arborization network’s topology</title>
<p>Accurate spatial arrangement of the neuronal projections around hair cells is essential for proper retrieval and transmission of sensory information. Mutations that perturb proper assembly of sensory neuronal microcircuits lead to hearing impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Quantitative insight into the wiring pattern is therefore essential to identify systematic aberrations in the microcircuit arising from genetic deficits. The three-dimensional skeletonized network traces allowed us to accurately delineate the microcircuit topology across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes from living animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). To quantitatively analyze the arbor network, we defined five topological attributes: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) nodes, denoted as junctions where arbors branch, converge, or cross; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) loops, comprising minimal arbor cycles forming topological holes; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) bare terminals, defined as arbors with free ends; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) the node degree, calculated as the number of first-neighbor nodes incident to a node; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) the arbor curvature, measured as the total curvature of a bare terminal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>To determine how internode connectivity is distributed across networks, we quantified the distribution of node degrees along the relative height of the hair cell cluster across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes. As for most other real-world networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), we observed a highly skewed node-degree distribution: the majority of nodes had low node degrees (three and four) and a small number of nodes—often acting as hubs, like the arborization initiation point—had high node degrees (five to seven). The node degree varied from three to seven in control larvae and three to six in <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> larvae. Across developmental stages and genotypes, the high node degrees primarily occurred at the base (region from 0 % to 10 % of the cluster height) of the hair cell cluster and acted as hubs for the majority of branching events. Low node degrees primarily occurred along the basolateral region (region from 10 % to 60 % of the cluster height) of the hair cell cluster. The apical region (region from 60 % to 100 % of the cluster height) was sparsely populated with low node degrees. The network’s hierarchical organization along the organ’s axis suggests that arbors receive sensory inputs at multiple levels, allowing the network to carry out robust neural computations. Even though nodes of low degree were most prevalent between genotypes across developmental stages, their distribution along the relative organ axis became significantly different at 4 dpf, with nodes in control larvae localized higher along the axis than in <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> larvae (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These observations indicate that Sema7A regulates both the spatial organization and node-degree complexity of the sensory arbor network.</p>
<p>An average of 9.3 sensory axonal branches approach the hair cell cluster of a neuromast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Pathfinding of sensory axons around the hair cell cluster results in the formation of axonal fascicles that form numerous loops and bare terminals, which determine the microcircuit topology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). To optimally surround and contact the hair cell cluster, do the sensory arbors prefer to adopt one topological feature over the other? To address this question, we measured the correlation between the number of bare terminals and the number of loops across individuals, developmental stages, and genotypes. In both 2 dpf and 3 dpf larvae, the distributions remained highly scattered across individuals and genotypes. However, by 4 dpf in the control larvae the arbor network contained either a high number of loops with a low number of bare terminals or a high number of bare terminals with a low number of loops. This result suggests that the stereotypical circuit topology observed in the mature organ may emerge through transition of individual arbors from forming bare terminals to forming closed loops encircling topological holes. That we did not observe a similar transition in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts of the same age suggests that Sema7A may direct the switch between these two distinct topological features (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Measurement of the contour length of both bare terminals and loops additionally revealed that across developmental stages in control larvae the sensory arbors followed a three-step process to choose the appropriate topological feature: arbors shorter than 10 µm always formed bare terminals; arbors between 10 µm and 30 µm began to switch between features, with arbors longer than 20 µm strongly preferring to form loops; and arbors longer than 30 µm always formed loops. These results imply that the switch between bare terminals and loops is partly dependent on the length of the arbors. However, this characteristic topological preference was significantly perturbed in the <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> larvae across developmental stages, as many of the sensory arbors longer than 30 µm remained as bare terminals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>,<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">G</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, in 4 dpf control neuromasts the majority of the loops contained four nodes and utilized 30-40 µm of arbors to form closed cycles. These conserved topological attributes were significantly perturbed in the <italic>sema7a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> larvae of same age (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These findings indicate that Sema7A tightly monitors the sensory arbor loop formation, including the preferred loop length and number of nodes per loop, to properly surround and contact the hair cell cluster.</p>
<p>As observed previously, bare terminals in control neuromasts project transverse to the organ and linger nearby, often curving back to form new loops and contact the hair cell cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>,<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). To analyze the propensity of the bare terminals to curl backward, we measured their total curvatures, defined as the sum of the curvature at each point along the length of an arbor. Henceforth, we address the total curvature as the curvature of a bare terminal. We classified the bare terminals in two categories: high-curvature arbors with curled morphology and curvature greater than <italic>π</italic>/6 (30 degrees); and low-curvature arbors with linear morphology and curvature less than <italic>π</italic> /6. In control neuromasts 44.8 % of arbors had low curvature compared to 56.4 % in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuromasts at 4 dpf. Concomitantly, 55.2 % of arbors had high curvature in control neuromasts compared to 43.6 % in <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neuromasts at 4 dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">F</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These observations further confirm our hypothesis that a Sema7A-mediated attractive cue is involved in orienting bare neural arbors toward the hair cell cluster to potentially form loops.</p>
<p>In summary, we propose that Sema7A mediates four key aspects of the topology of the arborization network: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) the node degree complexity along the organ’s axis; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) the transition of arbors from bare terminals to loops; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) the preference for forming loops containing four nodes with 30-40 µm of arbors; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) the preference of bare terminals to adopt higher curvature.</p>

<title>Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> is a sufficient chemoattractive cue for sensory axon guidance</title>
<p>Because genetic inactivation of the <italic>sema7a</italic> gene disrupts both signaling modalities of the cognate protein, we could not assess the specific activity of the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue in guiding lateral-line sensory axons. To independently verify the potential role of that isoform, we therefore expressed the secreted variant ectopically and investigated the resultant arborization patterns.</p>
<p>Analysis of the microcircuit connectivity of the neuromasts has demonstrated bare sensory-axonal terminals in the perisynaptic compartments, where they do not contact the hair cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). We speculate that these bare terminals are attracted by a Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue. To test this hypothesis, we ectopically expressed Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> protein tagged with the fluorophore mKate2, then analyzed its effect on the morphology of sensory arbors. Fertilized one-cell embryos were injected with the <italic>hsp70:sema7a<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2</italic> plasmid and raised to 3 dpf. Larvae expressing the transgenesis marker—the lens-specific red fluorescent protein mCherry—were heat-shocked, incubated to allow expression, and subsequently mounted for live imaging. In these larvae, a random mosaic of cells—often embryonic muscle progenitors in the dermomyotome or mature myofibers—expressed the exogenous Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2 protein. We selected only those neuromasts in which a single mosaic ectopic integration had occurred near the network of sensory arbors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). In all 22 such cases, we observed robust axonal projections from the sensory arbor network toward the ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cells. When the exogenous <italic>sema7a<sup>sec</sup></italic> integration occurred in embryonic muscle progenitor cells, which reside in a superficial layer external to the muscle fibers and adjacent to the larval skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), the projections were able to form direct contacts with them (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; Videos 5,6). But more often, when mature myofibers expressed the exogenous Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> deep in the myotome, the axonal projections approached those targets but failed to contact them (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Videos 7,8). This behavior likely arose because other components in the myotomal niche—including the fibrous epimysium, other myofibers, myoblasts, and immature myotubes whose surroundings are permeable to diverse diffusive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>)—physically obstructed direct interaction of the extended neurites with the ectopically expressing myofibers. All 18 of the injected but not heat-shocked control larvae did not express ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>, and we did not observe aberrant projections from the sensory arbor network (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>

<p>To measure the accuracy of the extended axonal projections in finding the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> source, we defined three parameters: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) the source path, denoted as the linear distance from the point of arborization to the boundary of an ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cell; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) the projection path, representing the linear distance from the point of arborization to the terminus of the extended projection; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) the projection proximity, calculated as the linear distance from the terminus of the extended axonal projection to the nearest boundary of the ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We quantified these parameters from 18 of the 22 mosaic integration events; in the remainder the extended axonal projections– although following the ectopic source–reentered the posterior lateral-line nerve so that identification of the axon terminals was not possible (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-A</xref>”; Video 9). When we plotted the projection path length against the source-path length, we observed a nearly perfect correlation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). This result signifies that irrespective of the location of the ectopic source–whether proximal or distal to the sensory arbor network–the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cue sufficed to attract axonal terminals from the sensory arbor. Furthermore, the low average projection-proximity length of 3.5 ± 0.7 µm (mean ± SEM) indicated that the extended projection terminals remained either in contact (8 of 18) or in the vicinity (10 of 18) of the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). These observations together demonstrate that the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue is sufficient to provide neural guidance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>As the posterior lateral-line ganglion matures, newly formed neurons extend their axonal growth cones along the posterior lateral-line nerve to reach the neuromasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). We wondered whether the axonal projections that had yet to be associated with a neuromast could also respond to an ectopic source of Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>. Indeed, on seven occasions in which <italic>sema7a<sup>sec</sup></italic> integration had occurred between two neuromasts, we detected neurite extensions from the posterior lateral-line nerve to the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-B</xref>”, Videos 10-12). Live time-lapse video microscopy further revealed dynamic association between the extending neurites and the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources. Long and thin along their entire extents, the neurites were highly motile, extending and retracting rapidly near the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> expressing cells. Many neurites maintained their contact with the ectopic sources of Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> from one hour to almost eight hours (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">J</xref>; <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, Videos 13-16). The responsiveness of the posterior lateral-line axons to Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> might therefore be an intrinsic property of the neurons that does not require the neuromast microenvironment.</p>

<title>Sema7A deficiency impacts synaptic assembly</title>
<p>Contact stabilization between an axon and its target cell is essential for synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Neural GPI-anchored proteins can act as regulators of various synaptic-adhesion pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In the mouse olfactory system, GPI-anchored Sema7A is enriched in olfactory sensory axons and mediates sustained interaction with the dendrites of mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb to establish synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). In the developing mouse brain–particularly in Purkinje cells–GPI-anchored Sema7A instead regulates the elimination of synapses onto climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). The role of anchored Sema7A in regulating synaptic architecture can thus vary according to the cell type and developmental stage. Our demonstration that Sema7A is necessary to consolidate the contact between sensory axons and hair cells during neuromast development suggests a possible role in regulating synaptic structure.</p>
<p>Proper synaptogenesis requires the correct spatial organization of the presynaptic and postsynaptic apparatus at the apposition of two cells. At the interface between hair cells and sensory axons, the synaptic network involves two scaffolding proteins in particular: ribeye, a major constituent of the presynaptic ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK), a conserved group of proteins that organize postsynaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Utilizing these scaffolding proteins as markers, we investigated the impact of the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutation on synapse formation. To analyze the distribution of presynaptic densities–immunolabeled with an antibody against the ribeye-associated presynaptic constituent C-terminal binding protein (CTBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>)–we counted the number and measured the area of CTBP punctae from multiple neuromasts at several stages of neuromast development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). The CTBP punctae in each hair cell ranged from zero to seven across developmental stages. In the zebrafish’s posterior lateral line, the formation of presynaptic ribbons is an intrinsic property of the hair cells that does not require contact with lateral-line sensory axons. However, sustained contact with the sensory axon influences the maintenance and stability of ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). As neuromasts matured from 2 dpf to 4 dpf, we identified similar distribution patterns with a characteristic increase in the number of CTBP punctae in both control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>larvae (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). This result implies that the formation of new presynaptic ribbons is not perturbed in the mutants, even though there are on average fewer CTBP punctae (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Measurement of the areas of CTBP punctae also showed similar distributions in both genotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">F</xref>) but the average area of presynaptic densities was reduced in the mutants (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because GPI-anchored Sema7A lacks a cytosolic domain, it is unlikely that Sema7A signaling directly induces the formation of presynaptic ribbons. We propose that the decrease in average number and area of CTBP punctae likely reflects decreased stability of the presynaptic ribbons owing to lack of contact between the sensory axons and the hair cells.</p>

<p>Our analysis of the skeletonized network traces of the sensory arbor network identified distinct topological features that are resultant of collective assemblies of each sensory axon. Because postsynaptic aggregates are organized at the sensory axons, we wondered whether they are associated with a specific topological feature of the network. To identify the distribution of the postsynaptic aggregates along the arbor network, we utilized the transgenic animal <italic>TgBAC(neurod1:EGFP)</italic> that labeled the sensory axons of the posterior lateral line in green fluorescence protein (GFP), and marked the postsynaptic aggregates through immunostaining with a pan-MAGUK antibody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). We generated skeletonized network traces of the arbor network and determined the three-dimensional spatial locations of the MAGUK punctae (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Comparison of the topological features of the network and the spatial locations of the MAGUK punctae revealed that the postsynaptic densities occur more extensively on the loops than on the bare terminals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). We measured 567 MAGUK punctae from 16 sensory arbor networks, where 531 punctae were located on the loops and only 36 punctae on the bare terminals. Furthermore, the MAGUK punctae predominantly aggregate near the node and their density sharply diminishes moving farther from the node (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These observations suggest that the distribution of the postsynaptic aggregates is closely associated with the topological attributes of the sensory circuit. Because in the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants the arbor networks have significantly lower number of loops and nodes, and more bare terminals, we hypothesize that in the mutants the occurrence of postsynaptic aggregates is perturbed. Moreover, Sema7A-GPI-mediated juxtracrine signaling onto the apposed axonal membrane is essential to induce postsynaptic assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>
<p>To characterize the impact of <italic>sema7a</italic> mutation on the formation of postsynaptic aggregates, we counted the number and measured the area of MAGUK punctae from multiple neuromasts at several stages of neuromast development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6J</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">K</xref>). At 4 dpf, 68.3 % of the hair cells in the control neuromasts were associated with at least one MAGUK punctum. In the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant this value fell to 37.5 % (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">M</xref>). The average number of MAGUK punctae also declined in the mutants (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G-I</xref>). As control neuromasts matured from 2 dpf to 4 dpf, the MAGUK punctae showed a shift toward smaller sizes, suggesting that the postsynaptic structure fragmented into smaller entities as observed in other excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). At 4 dpf, 77.5 % of the hair cells in the control neuromasts had postsynaptic densities with areas between 0.10 µm<sup>2</sup> and 0.40 µm<sup>2</sup>. In the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant the corresponding value was only 42.5 % (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N</xref>,<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">O</xref>). The average area of MAGUK punctae was also reduced in the mutants compared to the controls (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J-L</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We speculate that the abnormalities in the postsynaptic structure of the <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants arose from reduced contact between the hair cells and the sensory axons and perturbed topological attributes of the sensory circuit or from the lack of Sema7A-GPI-mediated juxtracrine signaling onto the apposed neurite terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The specification of neural circuitry requires precise control of the guidance cues that direct and restrict neural arbors at their target fields and facilitate synapse formation. In the lateral-line neuromast of the zebrafish, we have identified Sema7A as an essential cue that regulates the interaction between hair cells and sensory axons. We have discovered dual modes of Sema7A function <italic>in vivo</italic>: the chemoattractive diffusible form is sufficient to guide the sensory arbors toward their target, whereas the membrane-attached form likely participates in sculpting accurate neural circuitry to facilitate contact-mediated formation and maintenance of synapses. Our results suggest a potential mechanism for hair cell innervation in which a local Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> diffusive cue likely consolidates the sensory arbors at the hair cell cluster and the membrane-anchored Sema7A-GPI molecule guides microcircuit topology and synapse assembly.</p>
<p>The role of Sema7A in regulating diverse topological features of the arborization network suggests that microcircuits of control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>neuromasts have important functional differences. Loss of Sema7A disrupts the hierarchical organization of the node-degree distribution along the organ’s axis, as well as the preference towards forming loops containing four nodes with 30-40 µm of arbors. What benefit does the network gain from surrounding the hair cell cluster with closed loops instead of bare terminals? The network may actively form loops to contribute to the neuromast’s overall structure and function, or else emerge as a consequence of the arbors navigating the intervening spaces between the hair cells and support cells. The preferential localization of the postsynaptic aggregates in the loops and an enrichment near the nodes of the arbor network suggest that the precise patterning of the network—with characteristic looping behaviors—is not merely a byproduct of neuromast architecture, but may contribute to the network’s ability to gather sensory inputs through properly placed postsynaptic aggregates and to faithfully transmit sensory information to higher processing centers in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the potential role of these topological features in regulating the distribution of synaptic bodies and optimizing robust neural transmission in the lateral-line microcircuit.</p>
<p>Recent studies have begun to dissect the molecular mechanisms of semaphorin signaling in axonal navigation. In explants derived from the murine olfactory bulb, Sema7A interacts directly with integrinβ1 to trigger downstream signaling effectors involving focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are critical regulators of the cytoskeletal network during axonal pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Moreover, the interaction between Sema7A and its receptor plexinC1 activates the rac1-cdc42-PAK pathway, which alters the actin network to promote axonal guidance and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). We speculate that lateral-line sensory axons utilize similar mechanisms to sense and respond to Sema7A in the establishment of microcircuits with hair cells.</p>
<p>During early development of the posterior lateral line, the growth cones of sensory axons intimately associate with the prosensory primordium that deposits neuromasts along the lateral surface of the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). The growth of the sensory fibers with the primordium is regulated by diverse neurotrophic factors expressed in the primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Impairing brain-derived or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factors and their receptors perturbs directed axonal motility and innervation of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Lateral-line hair cells are particularly enriched in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) and other chemotropic cues (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Because the sensory axons of <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants reliably branch from the lateral-line nerve to reach hair cell clusters, these chemoattractive factors might compensate in part for the absence of Sema7A function. Although sensory axons are strict selectors of hair cell polarity and form synapses accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), diverse chemoattractant cues including Sema7A occur uniformly between hair cell polarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). It seems likely that unbiased attractive signals bring sensory arbors toward hair cells, after which polarity-specific molecules on hair cell surfaces dictate the final association between axonal terminal and hair cells. Notch-delta signaling and its downstream effectors regulate hair cell polarity and the innervation pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). It would be interesting to determine whether Notch-mediated polarity signatures on the hair cell’s surface can refine the neuromast neural circuitry.</p>

<p>The <italic>sema7a-GPI</italic> coding sequence without the stop codon (<italic>sema7a-GPI<sup>no-stop</sup></italic>) was synthesized using gBlocks HiFi Gene Fragments (Integrated DNA Technologies). The <italic>sema7a-GPI<sup>no-stop</sup></italic> coding sequence was then cloned into the pDONR221 vector by BP recombination to generate the middle entry pME-sema7a-GPI<sup>no-stop</sup> vector, henceforth denoted as pME-sema7a-GPI. To generate the hsp70:sema7a-GPI-2A-mCherry construct, gateway cloning was performed by combining the plasmids p5E-hsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), pME-sema7a-GPI, p3E-2A-mcherrypA (Addgene, 26031), and pDESTtol2pACryGFP (Addgene, 64022) with LR Clonase II Plus (Invitrogen). Verified constructs (25 ng/μl plasmid DNA) were injected with Tol2 Transposase mRNA (approximately 25 ng/μl) into one-cell embryos. The transiently transgenic larvae—identified by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in their lenses—were raised till 3 dpf, heat-shocked in a water bath at 37 °C for 1 hr, incubated at 28 °C for 1 hr to allow expression, and subsequently mounted for live imaging.</p>

<title>Microscopy and volumetric rendering of living neuronal arbors and cells</title>
<p>Living larvae were dechorionated, anaesthetized in 600 μM 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester methanesulfonate in system-water with 1 μg/mL methylene blue, and mounted in 1 % low-melting-point agarose on a glass-bottom MetTek dish at specific stages. The larvae were maintained at 28 °C during imaging in a temperature-controlled stage top chamber (OKO Lab UNO-T). Static images at successive focal depths were captured at 200 nm intervals and deconvolved with Microvolution software in ImageJ (NIH). For time-lapse video microscopy, the ectopic <italic>sema7a<sup>sec</sup></italic> integration sites were imaged at intervals of 5 min as Z-stacks acquired with 1.0 μm steps with laser excitation at 488 nm and 561 nm under a 60X, silicone-oil objective lens of numerical aperture 1.30. The three-dimensional datasets were processed and volume-rendered with the surface evolver and filament-tracer tools in Imaris (Bitplane, Belfast, UK). The Imaris workstation was provided by the Rockefeller University Bio-imaging Resource Center.</p>

<title>Generation of pseudocolored trajectories of the dwell times of sensory neurites at the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources</title>
<p>Fluorescent intensity values of the sensory neurites and the ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> sources were measured from the maximal-intensity projections at each time during the time-lapse video microscopy. The intensity values were normalized and binarized before summing across each timepoint for locations across the XY plane. The resulting pseudocolored trajectories represent the dwell times of the neurites and the Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> cells through the 10 hr time-lapse video sequence.</p>

<title>Generation of skeletonized networks</title>
<p>The labeled sensory axons were traced in three dimensions with ImageJ’s semi-automated framework, SNT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Each trace depicts the skeletonized form of the posterior lateral-line nerve, the posterior lateral-line branch, and the point of arborization from which the sensory arbors radiate to contact the hair cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>,<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>. The three-dimensional pixels or voxels obtained from the skeletonized sensory arbor traces were processed using custom code written in Python for visual representation and quantitative analysis.</p>

<title>Generation of combined hair cell clusters and the corresponding combined skeletonized networks</title>
<p>The hair cell clusters of neuromasts from each developmental stage were aligned by the centers of their apices, which were identified by the hair bundles, and overlayed to generate combined hair cell clusters (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>,<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">F</xref>) using custom Python code. The associated skeletonized sensory-arbor traces at each developmental stage were aligned similarly using custom Python code. The details of the procedures are available upon request and the corresponding code is available on GitHub.</p>

<title>Quantification of sensory arbor distributions around hair cell clusters</title>
<p>The region from the center of the combined hair cell cluster to 60 μm in the post-cluster region was divided into 3600 concentric sections of equal area. Each section, as depicted with a distinct color shade, had an area of π μm<sup>2</sup>. Sensory arbor density was defined as Log<sub>10</sub>[(Area occupied by the arbors in each section)/ (Area of each section)]. The arbor density was then plotted as a histogram against distance from the center of the combined hair cell cluster. Each bin of the histogram represents an area of π µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The histograms were finally represented as density trace graphs with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) in Python.</p>

<title>Quantification of contact between sensory arbors and hair cell clusters</title>
<p>For each hair cell cluster, the voxels of the sensory arbor traces that were inside or within 0.5 µm—the average neurite radius—of the cluster boundary were denoted as arbors in contact with their corresponding hair cell cluster (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The percentage of arbors in contact with each hair cell cluster was defined as: (Number of voxels that remained inside the cluster boundary/Total number of voxels in the arbor) X 100. The data were analyzed through an automated pipeline with custom Python code.</p>

<sec id="s4q">
<title>Quantification of the sensory arborization network topology</title>
<p>We developed a custom Python script (snt_topology.py; available on GitHub) to convert the skeletonized sensory arborization networks to network graphs (NetworkX, v3.1). We first used a custom ImageJ macro to convert SNT skeletons to csv files, then generated the network graph from the individual arbor paths. As noted previously, we defined five topological attributes: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) nodes— junctions where arbors branch, converge, or cross; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) loops—minimal arbor cycles forming topological holes; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) bare terminals—arbors with free ends; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) node degree—the number of first-neighbor nodes incident to a node; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) arbor curvature—the total curvature of a bare terminal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To enumerate loops and quantify their lengths and node numbers, we computed the minimum cycle basis for each network graph. The relative organ height of each node in a graph was defined in 3D using <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (1)</xref>:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="516962v4_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="516962v4_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the vector from the arborization initiation point to a node and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="516962v4_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the vector from the arborization initiation point to the hair cell cluster apex. The relative occurrence of nodes (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) was normalized by both the number of hair cells per neuromast and the total number of neuromasts, for comparison across ages and genotypes. The relative number of bare terminals and loops (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>) was normalized by the number of hair cells per neuromast and scaled between 0 and 1. The density was then normalized by the total number of neuromasts imaged for each developmental stage and genotype. For <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>, the normalized occurrence was computed as the number of arbors of a given length that formed either a bare terminal or a loop, divided by the total number of arbors of either feature of that length. Lastly, we defined bare terminals as having either high or low curvature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>,<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">F</xref>) if their absolute total signed curvature [<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation (2)</xref>] in three dimensions was either higher or lower than <italic>π</italic>/6, respectively:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="516962v4_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>s</italic> is the arc-length parameter of the bare terminal, <italic>T(s)</italic> is the unit tangent vector at each point along the arbor, <italic>N(s)</italic> is the unit normal vector at each point, and the integral is evaluated from the terminal’s branching node to the arbor’s tip. For a closed curve forming a full loop, this value will equal 2<italic>π</italic>. In practice, we first fit B-splines (scipy.interpolate.splprep; SciPy, v1.10.1) in 3D to the skeletons for each bare terminal before evaluating their derivatives (scipy.interpolate.splev) and integrating (scipy.integrate.simpson) over their lengths.</p>

<title>Quantification of aberrant sensory arborization in ectopic Sema7A<sup>sec</sup> expression</title>
<p>The sensory arbor networks were traced in three dimensions with SNT. The surface of each of the ectopically expressing Sema7A<sup>sec</sup>-mKate2 cells was represented by a single point that was closest to the terminal point of the guided neurite. Distances between two points were calculated using standard mathematical operations.</p>

<title>Quantification of presynaptic and postsynaptic assembly number and area</title>
<p>Maximal-intensity projections of consecutive through-focus scans encompassing the entire neuromast of control and <italic>sema7a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant larvae at 2 dpf, 3 dfp, and 4 dpf were utilized to capture the presynaptic and postsynaptic assemblies. The number of the synaptic densities across genotypes were measured using ImageJ’s cell counter framework. Area of the synaptic densities from the maximal-intensity projections were measured using ImageJ’s polygon selection tool (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>).</p>

<title>Quantification of the distribution of postsynaptic aggregates along the loops and the bare terminals of the sensory arbor networks</title>
<p>Four-day-old <italic>TgBAC(neurod1:EGFP)</italic> larvae were fixed and stained for sensory arbors and postsynaptic aggregates marked by GFP and MAGUK, respectively. The GFP-positive sensory arbors were traced in three dimensions with ImageJ’s semi-automated framework, SNT. The topological attributes of the arbor network, such as the loop and the bare terminal, were determined as described previously. The localizations of the MAGUK punctae along the three-dimensional arbor network were measured using ImageJ’s cell counter framework (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>,<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). We measured 567 MAGUK punctae from 16 sensory arbor networks. Whether the MAGUK-punctae were associated with a loop or a bare terminal, we categorized them in two groups and quantified their distribution across 16 neuromasts.</p>

<title>Quantification of the distribution of postsynaptic-aggregate density along the distance from the nearest node</title>
<p>The three-dimensional space surrounding each node of the arbor network were divided into concentric shells of equal volume (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). For each node, we computationally generated 100,000 concentric shells that reached a 10 µm radius. We measured the number of MAGUK punctae located within each of those concentric shells from their nearest nodes.</p>

<p>Dasgupta and colleagues make a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to the understanding how the guidance factor Sema7a promotes connections between mechanosensory hair cells and afferent neurons of the zebrafish lateral line system. The authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence that loss of Sema7a function results in fewer contacts between hair cells and afferents through comprehensive quantitative analysis. Additional work is needed to distinguish the effects of different isoforms of Sema7a to determine whether there are specific roles of secreted and membrane bound forms.</p>

<p>Dasguta et al. have dissected the role of Sema7a in fine tuning of a sensory microcircuit in the posterior lateral line organ of zebrafish. They attempt to also outline the different roles of a secreted verses membrane-bound form of Sema7a in this process. Using genetic perturbations and axonal network analysis, the authors show that loss of both Sema7a isoforms causes abnormal axon terminal structure with more bare terminals and fewer loops in contact with presynaptic sensory hair cells. Further, they show that loss of Sema7a causes decreased number and size of both the pre- and post-synapse. Finally, they show that overexpression of the secreted form of Sema7a specifically can elicit axon terminal outgrowth to an ectopic Sema7a expressing cell. Together, the analysis of Sema7a loss of function and overexpression on axon arbor structure is fairly thorough and revealed a novel role for Sema7a in axon terminal structure. However, the connection between different isoforms of Sema7a and the axon arborization needs to be substantiated. Furthermore, the effect of loss of Sema7a on the presynaptic cell is not ruled out as a contributing factor to the synaptic and axon structure phenotypes. These issues weaken the claims made by the authors including the statement that they have identified dual roles for the GPI-anchored verses secreted forms of Sema7a on synapse formation and as a chemoattractant for axon arborization respectively.</p>

<p>In this work, Dasgupta et al. investigates the role of Sema7a in the formation of peripheral sensory circuit in the lateral line system of zebrafish. They show that Sema7a protein is present during neuromast maturation and localized, in part, to the base of hair cells (HCs). This would be consistent with pre-synaptic Sema7a mediating formation and/or stabilization of the synapse. They use sema7a loss-of-function strain to show that lateral line sensory terminals display abnormal arborization. They provide highly quantitative analysis of the lateral line terminal arborization to show that a number of specific topological parameters are affected in mutants. Next, they ectopically express a secreted form of Sema7a to show that lateral line terminals can be ectopically attracted to the source. Finally, they also demonstrate that the synaptic assembly is impaired in the sema7a mutant. Overall, the data are of high quality and properly controlled. The availability of Sema7a antibody is a big plus, as it allows to address the endogenous protein localization as well to show the signal absence in the sema7a mutant. The quantification of the arbor topology should be useful to people in the field who are looking at the lateral line as well as other axonal terminals. I think some results are overinterpreted though. The authors state: &quot;Our findings demonstrate that Sema7A functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.&quot; However, they have not actually demonstrated which isoform functions in HCs (also see comments below). In addition, they have to be careful in interpreting their topology analysis, as they cannot separate individual axons. Thus, such analysis can generate artifacts. They can perform additional experiments to address these issues or adjust their interpretations.</p>

<p>The data reported here demonstrate that Sema7a defines the local behavior of growing axons in the developing zebrafish lateral line. The analysis is sophisticated and convincingly demonstrates effects on axon growth and synapse architecture. Collectively, the findings point to the idea that the diffusible form of sema7a may influence how axons grow within the neuromast and that the GPI-linked form of sema7a may subsequently impact how synapses form, though additional work is needed to strongly link each form to its' proposed effect on circuit assembly.</p>
<p>Comments on revised submission:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript is significantly improved. The authors comprehensively and appropriately addressed most of the reviewers' concerns. In particular, they added evidence that hair cells express both Sema7A isoforms, showed that membrane bound Sema7A does not have long range effects on guidance, demonstrated how axons behave close to ectopic Sema7A, and analyzed other features of the hair cells that revealed no strong phenotypes. The authors also softened the language in many, but not all places. Overall, I am satisfied with the study as a whole.</p>

<p>This study provides direct evidence showing that Sema7a plays a role in the axon growth during the formation of peripheral sensory circuits in the lateral-line system of zebrafish. This is a valuable finding because the molecules for axon growth in hair-cell sensory systems are not well understood. The majority of the experimental evidence is convincing, and the analysis is rigorous. The evidence supporting Sema7a's juxtracrine vs. secreted role and involvement in synapse formation in hair cells is less conclusive. The study will be of interest to cell, molecular and developmental biologists, and sensory neuroscientists.</p>

<p>Comments: Thank you for your valuable comments. We have analyzed the hair cell scRNA transcriptome data of zebrafish neuromasts from published works and have not identified known expression of receptors of the Sema7A protein, particularly PlexinC1 and Integrin β1 molecules (reference 4 and 15) in hair cells. This result suggests that the Sema7A protein molecule, either secreted or membrane-bound, does not possess its cognate receptor to elicit an autocrine function on the hair cells. Moreover, the GPI-anchored Sema7A lacks a cytosolic domain. So it is unlikely that Sema7A signaling directly induces the formation of presynaptic ribbons. We propose that the decrease in average number and area of synaptic aggregates likely reflects decreased stability of the synaptic structures owing to lack of contact between the sensory axons and the hair cells, which has been identified in zebrafish neuromasts (reference 38).</p>
<p>Thank you for pointing missing critical control experiments. Additional control experiments (lines 333-346) with a new figure (Figure 5) have been added.</p>

<p>Comments: We have rephrased our statement and argue in lines 428-430 that our experiments “suggest a potential mechanism for hair cell innervation in which a local Sema7Asec diffusive cue likely consolidates the sensory arbors at the hair cell cluster and the membrane-anchored Sema7A-GPI molecule guides microcircuit topology and synapse assembly.”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: Thank you for making this point. To investigate the presence of both sema7a transcripts in the hair cells of the lateral-line neuromasts, we used the Tg(myo6b:actb1EGFP) transgenic fish to capture the labeled hair cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and isolated total RNA. Using transcript specific DNA oligonucleotide primers, we have identified the presence of both sema7a transcript variants in the hair cell of the neuromast. Even though we have not developed transcript specific knockout animals, we speculate that the presence of both transcript variants in the hair cell implies that they function in distinct fashion. We have changed our interpretation in lines 32-34 to “Our findings propose that Sema7A likely functions both as a juxtracrine and as a secreted cue to pattern neural circuitry during sensory organ development.”</p>
<p>In future we will utilize the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to target the unique C-terminal domain of the GPI-anchored sema7a transcript variant. We believe that this will only perturb the formation of the full-length Sema7A protein and help us determine the role of the membrane-bound Sema7AGPI molecule as well as the Sema7Asec in sensory arborization and synaptic assembly.</p>

<p>Comments: Thank you for this insightful comment. In a previous eLife publication from our laboratory, we utilized the serial blockface scanning electron micrograph (SBFSEM) technique to characterize the connectome of the neuromast microcircuit where patterns of innervation of all the individual axons can be delineated in five-days-old larvae (reference 8). However, the collective behavior of all the sensory axons that build the innervation network remained enigmatic, especially in a living animal during development. In this paper we addressed how the sensory-axon collective behaves around the clustered hair cells and build the innervation network in living animals during diverse developmental stages. Our analyses have not only identified how the axons associates with the hair cell cluster as the organ matures, but also discovered distinct topological features in the arbor network that emerges during organ maturation, which may influence assembly of postsynaptic aggregates (lines 384-403, Figure 6G-I). We believe that our quantitative approach to capture collective axonal behaviors and their topological attributes during circuit formation have highlighted the importance of understanding network assembly during sensory organ development.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study demonstrates that the axon guidance molecule Sema7a patterns the innervation of hair cells in the neuromasts of the zebrafish lateral line, as revealed by quantifying gain- and loss-of function effects on the three-dimensional topology of sensory axon arbors over developmental time. Alternative splicing can produce either a diffusible or membrane-bound form of Sema7a, which is increasingly localized to the basolateral pole of hair cells as they develop (Figure 1). In sema7a mutant zebrafish, sensory axon arbors still grow to the neuromast, but they do not form the same arborization patterns as in controls, with many arbors overextending, curving less, and forming fewer loops even as they lengthen (Figure 2,3). These phenotypes only become significant later in development, indicating that Sema7a functions to pattern local microcircuitry, not the gross wiring pattern. Further, upon ectopic expression of the diffusible form of Sema7a, sensory axons grow towards the Sema7a source (Figure 4). The data also show changes in the synapses that form when mutant terminals contact hair cells, evidenced by significantly smaller pre- and post-synaptic punctae (Figure 5). Finally, by replotting single cell RNA-sequencing data (Figure 6), the authors show that several other potential cues are also produced by hair cells and might explain why the sema7a phenotype does not reflect a change in growth towards the neuromast. In summary, the data strongly indicate that Sema7a plays a role in shaping connectivity within the neuromast.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of this study is the sophisticated analysis that was used to demonstrate fine-level effects on connectivity. Rather than asking &quot;did the axon reach its target?&quot;, the authors asked &quot;how does the axon behave within the target?&quot;. This type of deep analysis is much more powerful than what is typical for the field and should be done more often. The breadth of analysis is also impressive, in that axon arborization patterns and synaptic connectivity were examined at 3 stages of development and in three-dimensions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness is that the data do not cleanly distinguish between activities for the secreted and membrane-bound forms of Sema7a, which the authors speculate may influence axon growth and synapse formation respectively. The authors do not overstate the claims, but it would have been nice to see some additional experimentation along these lines, such as the effects of overexpressing the membrane-bound form,</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: We have accepted this useful suggestion. In lines 333-346 and in Figure 5 we have demonstrated the impact of overexpressing the membrane-bound transcript variant on arborization pattern of the sensory axons.</p>

<p>Some analysis of the distance over which the &quot;diffusible&quot; form of Sema7a might act (many secreted ligands are not in fact all that diffusible), or</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some live-imaging of axons before they reach the target (predicted to be the same in control and mutants) and then within the target (predicted to be different).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: We have accepted this useful suggestion. We demonstrate the dynamics of the sensory arbors that are attracted to an ectopic Sema7Asec source in lines 325-332, Figure 4I,J; Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, and Videos 13-16.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Clearly, although the gain-of-function studies show that Sema7a can act at a distance, other cues are sufficient. Although the lack of a phenotype could be due to compensation, it is also possible that Sema7a does not actually act in a diffusible manner within its natural context. Overall, the data support the authors' carefully worded conclusions. While certain ideas are put forward as possibilities, the authors recognize that more work is needed. The main shortcoming is that the study does not actually distinguish between the effects of the two forms of Sema7a, which are predicted but not actually shown to be either diffusible or membrane linked (the membrane linkage can be cleaved). Although the study starts by presenting the splice forms, there is no description of when and where each splice form is transcribed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: We have utilized the HCR™ RNA-FISH Technology to generate transcript specific probes. To generate transcript-specific HCR probes to distinctly detect the sema7aGPI (NM_001328508) and the sema7asec (NM_001114885) transcripts, Molecular Instruments could design only 11 probes against the sema7aGPI transcript and only one probe against the sema7asec transcript (personal correspondence with Mike Liu, PhD, Head of Operations and Product Development Lead Molecular Instruments, Inc.). The HCR probe against the sema7aGPI transcript showed a very faint signal. Unfortunately, the HCR probe against the sema7asec transcript failed to detect the presence of any transcript. For robust detection of transcripts, the protocol demands a minimum of 20 probes. We believe that the very low number of probes against our transcripts is the primary reason for the absence of a signal.</p>
<p>We therefore utilized fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to capture the labeled hair cells and isolated total RNA to perform RT-PCR using transcript specific DNA oligonucleotide primers. We identified the presence of both the secreted and the membrane-bound transcripts at four-days-old neuromasts (lines 80-84, Figure 1B-D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, since the mutants are predicted to disrupt both forms, it is a bit difficult to disentangle the synaptic phenotype from the earlier changes in circuit topology - perhaps the change at the level of the synapse is secondary to the change in topology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: Thank you for the insightful suggestion. We have analyzed the relationship between the sensory arbor network topology and the distribution of postsynaptic structures
(lines 384-403, Figure 6G-I). We identified that the distribution of the postsynaptic aggregates is closely associated with the topological attributes of the sensory circuit. We further clarify the potential origin of disrupted synaptic assemblies in sema7a-/- mutants in lines 380-382 and lines 417-420.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Further, the authors do not provide any data supporting the idea that the membrane bound form of Sema7a acts only locally. Without these kinds of data, the authors are unable to attribute activities to either form.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: We have accepted this useful suggestion and have prepared the Figure 5 with the necessary details.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The main impact on the field will be the nature of the analysis. The field of axon guidance benefits from this kind of robust quantification of growing axon trajectories, versus their ability to actually reach a target. This study highlights the value of more careful analysis and as a result, makes the point that circuit assembly is not just a matter of painting out paths using chemoattractants and repellants, but is also about how axons respond to local cues. The study also points to the likely importance of alternative splice forms and to the complex functions that can be achieved using different forms of the same ligand.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #4 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work by Dasgupta et al identifies Sema7a as a novel guidance molecule in hair cell sensory systems. The authors use the both genetic and imaging power of the zebrafish lateralline system for their research. Based on expression data and immunohistochemistry experiments, the authors demonstrate that Sema7a is present in lateral line hair cells. The authors then examine a sema7a mutant. In this mutant, Sema7a proteins levels are nearly eliminated. Importantly, the authors show that when Sema7a is absent, afferent terminals show aberrant projections and fewer contacts with hair cells. Lastly the authors show that ectopic expression of the secreted form of Sema7a is sufficient to recruit aberrant terminals to non-hair cell targets. The sema7a innervation defects are well quantified. Overall, the paper is extremely well written and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The axon guidance phenotypes in sema7a mutants are novel, striking and thoroughly quantified.</p>
<p>(2) By combining both loss of function sema7a mutants and ectopic expression of the secreted form of Sema7a the authors demonstrate the Sema7a is both necessary and sufficient to guide sensory axons</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Control. There should be an uninjected heatshock control to ensure that heatshock itself does not cause sensory afferents to form aberrant arbors. This control would help support the hypothesis that exogenously expressed Sema7a (via a heatshock driven promoter) is sufficient to attract afferent arbors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: Thank you for the suggestion. We have added the uninjected heatshock control experiment in Figure 5 and described experimental details in the text, lines 343-345.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Synapse labeling. The numbers obtained for postsynaptic labeling in controls do not match up with the published literature - they are quite low. Although there are clear differences in postsynaptic counts between sema7a mutants and controls, it is worrying that the numbers are so low in controls. In addition, the authors do not stain for complete synapses (pre- and post-synapses together). This staining is critical to understand how Sema7a impacts synapse formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: Thank you for raising this issue. We believe the low average numbers of the postsynaptic punctae in control neuromasts arise from lack of formation of postsynaptic aggregates beneath the immature hair cells, which are abundant in early stages of neuromast maturation. We have performed exhaustive analysis on the formation of pre- and postsynaptic structures and have identified how their distribution changes along neuromast development in control larvae. We have further analyzed how such distribution is perturbed in the sema7a-/- mutants. We do not think analyzing the complete synapse structure will add much to our understanding of how Sema7A influence synapse formation and maintenance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Hair cell counts. The authors need to provide quantification of hair cell counts per neuromast in mutant and control animals. If the counts are different, certain quantification may need to be normalized.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: We have added the raw data with the hair cell counts in both control and sema7a-/- mutants across developmental stages. The homozygous sema7a-/- mutants have slightly less hair cells and we have normalized all our topological analyses by the corresponding hair cell numbers for each neuromast in each experiment (lines 669-675).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Developmental delay. It is possible that loss of Sema7a simply delays development. The latest stage examined was 4 dpf, an age that is not quite mature in control animals. The authors could look at a later age, such as 6 dpf to see if the phenotypes persist or recover.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: The homozygous sema7a-/- mutants are unviable and die at 6 dpf. We therefore restricted our analysis till 4 dpf. The association of the sensory arbors with the clustered hair cells gradually decreases as the neuromasts mature from 2 dpf to 4dpf in the sema7a-/- mutants (lines 174-176, Figure 2I). Moreover, in the sema7a-/- mutants the sensory axons throw long projections that keep getting farther away from the clustered hair cells as the neuromast matures from 2 dpf to 4 dpf (lines 166-168, Figure 2H; Figure 2—figure supplement 1K,L). These observations suggest that if the phenotypes in the sema7a-/- mutants were due to developmental delays, then we should have seen a recovery of disrupted arborization patterns over time. But instead, we observe a further deterioration of the arborization patterns and other architectural assemblies. These findings confirm that the observed phenotypes in the sema7a-/- mutants are not due to delayed development of the larvae, but a specific outcome for the loss of Sema7A protein.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>Issue 1: One of the most interesting conclusions in this manuscript is the function of the GPIanchored vs. secreted form of Sema7a in axon structure and synapse formation. In lines 357360 of the discussion (for example) the authors state that they have shown that the GPIanchored form of Sema7a is responsible for contact-mediated synapse formation while the secreted form functions as a chemoattractant for axon arbor structure. &quot;We have discovered dual modes of Sema7A function in vivo: the chemoattractive diffusible form is sufficient to guide the sensory arbors toward their target, whereas the membrane-attached form likely participates in sculpting accurate neural circuitry to facilitate contact-mediated formation and maintenance of synapses.&quot; However, the data do not support this conclusion. Specifically, no analysis is done showing unique expression of either isoform in hair cells and no functional analysis is done to conclusively determine which isoform is important for either phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: We have shown that both sema7a transcripts are expressed in the hair cells of four-day-old neuromasts (lines 78-84, Figure 1C,D). Ectopic expression of the sema7asec transcript variant robustly attracts the lateral-line sensory arbors toward itself, whereas ectopic expression of the sema7aGPI variant fails to impart sensory guidance from a distance, suggesting that the membrane-bound form likely participates in contact-mediated neural guidance. These experiments decisively show, for the first time in zebrafish, the dual modes of Sema7A function in vivo. However, we agree that the sema7aGPI transcript-specific knockout animal would be essential to conclusively prove that the membrane-attached form is primarily involved in forming accurate neural circuitry and contact-mediated formation and maintenance of synapses.  Hence, we have very carefully stated in lines 427-428 that “the membrane-attached form likely participates in sculpting accurate neural circuitry to facilitate contact-mediated formation and maintenance of synapses”. We will follow up on this suggestion in our upcoming manuscript that will incorporate transcript-specific genetic ablations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Though the authors present RT-PCR analysis of sema7a isoforms, it is not interpretable. The second reverse primer will also recognize the full-length transcript (from what I can gather) so it does not simply show the presence of the secreted form. Is there a unique 3'UTR for the short transcript that can be used? Additionally, for the GPI-anchored version can you use a forward primer that is not present in the short isoform? This would shed some light on the respective levels of both transcripts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: The C-termini of the two transcript variants are distinct and we have designed distinct primers that will selectively bind to each transcript (lines 503-511). Since, we have not performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), relative levels of each transcript are hard to determine.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Alternatively, and perhaps of more use, in situ hybridization using unique probes for each isoform would allow you to determine which are actually present in hair cells.</p>

<p>Comments: We have tried this approach and explained the point earlier (refer to lines 203212 of this response letter).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To decisively state that these isoforms have unique functions in axon terminal structure and synapse formation, other experiments are also essential. For example, RNA-mediated rescue analyses using both isoforms would tell you which can rescue the axonal structure and synapse size/number phenotypes. Overexpression of the GPI-anchored form, like the secreted form in Figure 4, would allow you to determine if only the secreted form can cause abnormal axon extension phenotypes. Expression of both forms in hair cells (using a myo6b promotor for example) would allow assessment of their role in presynapse formation.</p>

<p>For the overexpression experiments, expression of mKate alone (with and without heat shock) is also a critical control to include.</p>

<p>Issue 2: A second concern is the lack of data showing support cell and hair cell formation and function is unaffected. Analysis of support and hair cell number with loss of Sema7a as well as simple analyses of mechanotransduction (FM4-64) would help alleviate concerns that phenotypes are due to disrupted neuromast formation and basic hair cell function rather than a specific role for Sema7a in this process.</p>

<p>Can you speculate on how the looping structure may alter number of synaptic contacts per axon for instance? For this, it would be useful to know if normally the synapses form on loops versus bare terminals.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Does this looping facilitate single axons contacting more hair cells of the same polarity? Would that be beneficial?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: Looping behaviors indeed facilitate the contact between the axons and the hair cells. As we have observed, the primary topological attribute that the sensory arbor network underneath the clustered hair cells adopts is a loop. The bare terminals are predominantly projected transverse to the clustered hair cells and lack contact with them. Whether a single axon, being part of a loop, preferentially contacts hair cells of same polarity is yet to be determined. We can address this question by mosaic labeling a single axon in the arbor network and determine its association with the hair cells. We intend to do these experiments in our upcoming manuscript.</p>

<p>Presumably, sema7a is trafficked to the membrane during HC maturation. This is consistent with the authors' observation that sema7a localization is changing as NM mature. However, actin-sema7a co-labeling does not actually show whether sema7a is on the membrane.
Labeling HCs with a membrane marker (transgene) would be much more convincing. Alternatively, can the authors show sema7a localization actually correlates with the presence of sensory axon terminals? They already have immunos that label both. Thus, this should be pretty straightforward.</p>

<p>Arborization topology: While I appreciate the very careful characterization of the topology for wild-type and mutant NMs, I think it would be much more informative to mark individual axons and then analyze their topology. The main reason is that the authors cannot really distinguish whether some aspects of topology they describe are really due to the densely packed overlapping terminals of multiple axons or these are really characteristic, higher order organization of individual axons. Because of this, they cannot be certain what is really happening with sema7a mutant terminals. Related to the point above. While it is clear that the overall topology is abnormal in the mutant, the authors should be careful in concluding that sema7a regulates specific aspects of it. The overall structure is probably highly interconnected perturbing one parameter would likely affect all the others.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: Thank you for this comment. In a previous eLife publication from our laboratory, we utilized the serial blockface scanning electron micrograph (SBFSEM) technique to characterize the connectome of the neuromast microcircuit where patterns of innervation of all the individual axons can be delineated in five-days-old larvae (reference number 8). However, the collective behavior of all the sensory axons that build the innervation network remained enigmatic, especially in a living animal during development. In this paper we addressed how the sensory axon-collective behave around the clustered hair cells and build the innervation network in living animals during diverse developmental stages. Our analyses have not only identified how the axon-collective associates itself with the hair cell cluster as the organ matures, but also discovered distinct topological features in the arbor network that emerges during organ maturation, which may influence assembly of postsynaptic aggregates (lines 384-403, Figure 6G-I). We believe that our quantitative approach to capture collective axonal behaviors and their topological attributes during circuit formation have highlighted the importance of understanding network assembly during sensory organ development.</p>

<p>The phenotype of ectopic projections in sema7a overexpression experiments is pretty dramatic, especially given the fact that these were performed in wild-type animals. Does this mean that the phenotype would be even more dramatic in sema7a mutants, as they have more bare axon terminals according to the authors' analysis. Have the authors attempted this type of experiments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: That is an interesting suggestion. We have not tested that yet. Our guess is that in the sema7a-/- mutants, the abundant bare terminals will be far more sensitive to an ectopic source of Sema7A. But even in the sema7a-/- mutants, other chemotropic cues are still functional, which may impart certain restrictions on how many bare terminals are allowed to leave the neuromast region.</p>

<p>Comments: We have utilized the HCR™ RNA-FISH Technology to generate transcript specific probes. To generate transcript-specific HCR probes to distinctly detect the sema7aGPI (NM_001328508) and the sema7asec (NM_001114885) transcripts, Molecular Instruments could design only 11 probes against the sema7aGPI transcript and only one probe against the sema7asec transcript (personal correspondence with Mike Liu, PhD, Head of Operations and Product Development Lead Molecular Instruments, Inc.). The HCR probe against the sema7aGPI transcript showed a very faint signal. Unfortunately, the HCR probe against the sema7asec transcript failed to detect the presence of any transcript. For robust detection of transcripts, the protocol demands a minimum of 20 probes. We believe that the very low number of probes against our transcripts is the primary reason for the lack of a signal.</p>

We imaged the control and the sema7a-/- mutants of each developmental stage in parallel, within a span of two hours, and repeated these experiments multiple times to gather almost a hundred larvae from each genotype. Even though the sensory arbor network is dynamic, we believe imaging both the genotypes in parallel and within a span of two hours, and averaging almost a hundred larvae from each genotype minimize the temporal variability observed in the arbor architecture.</p>

<p>(5) Ideally, the authors should use CRISPR/cas-9 to create a mutation in the C-terminus that would prevent production of the GPI-anchored form and not of the diffusible form. I understand if this is too much work to do in a short time, and would be satisfied with another experiment that could distinguish roles for at least one isoform more clearly. For instance, it would be interesting to see an analysis of how far an axon can be from a source to detect diffusible Sema7a (live imaging would be ideal for this) and then to show that the effect is different when the membrane bound form is expressed.</p>

<p>(2) Synapse staining - regarding Figure 5 and related supplement</p>
<p>Understanding whether guidance defects ultimately impact synapse formation is an important aspect of this paper. Therefore, is necessary to have accurate measurements of the number of complete synapses, and the overall numbers of pre- and postsynaptic components. Currently the data plotted in Figure 5 is extensive, but the way the data is laid out, the relevant comparisons are challenging to make. Perhaps include this quantification in the supplement, and move the data from the supplement to the main figure? The quantifications in the supplement are easier to follow and easier to compare between genotypes.</p>

<p>Comments: We have performed exhaustive analysis on the formation of pre-  and postsynaptic structures and have identified how their distribution changes along neuromast development in control larvae. We have further analyzed how such distribution is perturbed in the sema7a-/- mutants. We believe that showing only the average numbers will not reveal the changes in the distribution of the synaptic structures during development and across genotypes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Looking at the data itself, there seems to be some discrepancies with the synaptic counts compared to published work. While the CTBP numbers seem in order, the Maguk numbers do not. In both mutant and control there are many hair cells without any Maguk puncta/aggregates-leading to 0.75-1 postsynapses per hair cell (Figure 5 supplement H-I). Typically, the numbers should be more comparable to what was obtained for CTBP, 3-4 puncta per cells (Figure 5 supplement B-C), especially by 3-4 dpf. 3-4 CTPB or Maguk puncta per cell is based on previously published immunostaining and EM work.</p>
<p>The Maguk immunostaining, especially at early stages (2-3 dpf) is challenging. To compound a challenging immunostain, around 2019 Neuromab began to outsource the purification of their Maguk antibody. After this outsourcing our lab was no longer able to get reliable label with the Maguk antibody from Neuromab.</p>

<p>Comments: Thank you for suggesting the new MAGUK antibody. We have utilized this new MAGUK antibody from Millipore and added a new segment in lines 389-408. In future publication we will utilize this antibody to capture the postsynaptic densities in the sensory arbors.</p>
<p>The discrepancies in the postsynaptic punctae number in our control larvae may arise due to the reliability of the Neuromab MAGUK antibody. We have utilized this same antibody to stain the sema7a-/- mutants and have observed a significant decrease in MAGUK punctae number and area. On grounds of keeping parity between the control and the sema7a-/- mutants, we have decided to keep our experimental results in the manuscript.</p>
<p>In addition to a more accurate Maguk label, a combined pre- and post-synaptic label is essential to understand whether synapses pair properly in the sema7a mutants. This can be accomplished using subtype specific antibodies using goat anti-mouse IgG1/Maguk and goat anti-mouse IgG2a/CTBP secondaries.</p>

<p>(3) Does sema7a lesion impact the number of hair cells per neuromast? If hair cell numbers are reduced several of the quantifications could be impacted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: We have added the raw data with the hair cell counts in both control and sema7a-/- mutants across developmental stages. The homozygous sema7a-/- mutants have slightly less hair cells and we have normalized all our topological analyses by the corresponding hair cell numbers for each neuromast in each experiment (lines 669-675).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Could innervation just be developmentally delayed in sema7a mutants? At 4 dpf the sensory system is just starting to come online and could still be in the process of refinement. Did you look at slightly older ages, after the sensory system is functional behaviorally, for example, 6 dpf? Do the cores phenotypes (synapse defects and excess arbors) persist at 6 dpf in the sema7a mutants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: The homozygous sema7a-/- mutants are unviable and start to die at 6 dpf. We therefore restricted our analysis until 4 dpf. The association of the sensory arbors with the clustered hair cells gradually decreases as the neuromasts mature from 2 dpf to 4dpf in the sema7a-/- mutants (lines 174-176, Figure 2I). Moreover, in the sema7a-/- mutants the sensory axons throw long projections that keep getting farther away from the clustered hair cells as the neuromast matures from 2 dpf to 4 dpf (lines 166-168, Figure 2H; Figure 2—figure supplement 1K,L). These observations suggests that if the phenotypes in the sema7a-/- mutants were due to developmental delays, then we should have seen a recovery of disrupted arborization patterns over time. But instead, we observe a further deterioration of the arborization patterns and other architectural assemblies. These findings confirm that the observed phenotypes in the sema7a-/- mutants are not due to delayed development of the larvae, but a specific outcome for the loss of Sema7A protein.</p>

<p>Comments: In lines 44-48, we explain that the hair cells in the neuromast contain mechanoreceptive hair cells of opposing polarities that help them detect water currents from opposing directions. In lines 93-106, we tested whether the Sema7A level varies between the two polarities. We observed that the Sema7A level is similar between the two polarities of hair cells, but the average Sema7A intensity increases significantly over the developmental period of 2 dpf to 4 dpf in both rostrally and caudally polarized hair cells.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Page 14 Lines 359-360. There is not enough evidence provided in this work to suggest that the membrane attached form of Sema7a is playing a role. Both the secreted and membrane form are gone in the sema7a mutants. If the membrane attached form was specifically lesioned, and resulted in a phenotype, then there would be sufficient evidence. Currently there is strong evidence for a distinct role for the secreted form. Although the authors qualify the outlined statement with the word 'likely', stating this possibility in the discussion take-home is misleading.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comments: In future we will utilize the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to target the unique Cterminal domain of the GPI-anchored sema7a transcript variant. We believe that this will only perturb the formation of the full-length Sema7A protein and help us differentiate between the roles of the membrane-bound Sema7AGPI molecule and the secreted Sema7Asec in sensory arborization and synaptic assembly.</p>
