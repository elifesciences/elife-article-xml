<title>Abstract</title><p>Dysregulation of sleep has widespread health consequences and represents an enormous health burden. Short-sleeping individuals are predisposed to the effects of neurodegeneration, suggesting a critical role for sleep in the maintenance of neuronal health. While the effects of sleep on cellular function are not completely understood, growing evidence has identified an association between sleep loss and DNA damage, raising the possibility that sleep facilitates efficient DNA repair. The Mexican tetra fish, <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> provides a model to investigate the evolutionary basis for changes in sleep and the consequences of sleep loss. Multiple cave-adapted populations of these fish have evolved to sleep for substantially less time compared to surface populations of the same species without identifiable impacts on healthspan or longevity. To investigate whether the evolved sleep loss is associated with DNA damage and cellular stress, we compared the DNA Damage Response (DDR) and oxidative stress levels between <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> populations. We measured markers of chronic sleep loss and discovered elevated levels of the DNA damage marker γH2AX in the brain, and increased oxidative stress in the gut of cavefish, consistent with chronic sleep deprivation. Notably, we found that acute UV-induced DNA damage elicited an increase in sleep in surface fish but not in cavefish. On a transcriptional level, only the surface fish activated the photoreactivation repair pathway following UV damage. These findings suggest a reduction of the DDR in cavefish compared to surface fish that coincides with elevated DNA damage in cavefish. To examine DDR pathways at a cellular level, we created an embryonic fibroblast cell line from the two populations of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>. We observed that both the DDR and DNA repair were diminished in the cavefish cells, corroborating the <italic>in vivo</italic> findings and suggesting that the acute response to DNA damage is lost in cavefish. To investigate the long-term impact of these changes, we compared the transcriptome in the brain and gut of aged surface fish and cavefish. Strikingly, many genes that are differentially expressed between young and old surface fish do not transcriptionally vary by age in cavefish. Taken together, these findings suggest that have developed resilience to sleep loss, despite possessing cellular hallmarks of chronic sleep deprivation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sleep is ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom and has been identified in animals with relatively simple neural networks, including jellyfish and nematodes through primates, suggesting ancient function and shared evolutionary origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. While the primary functions of sleep are not fully understood, it is essential for many processes including neural connectivity, clearance of toxic metabolites, immunity, learning, and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. There is growing evidence that DNA damage may play an important role in sleep drive[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. DNA damage is associated with periods of prolonged wakefulness and is reduced during sleep across numerous species, including C. <italic>elegans</italic>, zebrafish, mice, and humans[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. In turn, sleep disruption is associated with DNA damage, and sleep deprivation (SD) inhibits the expression of DNA repair genes in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] suggesting a critical role for sleep in the maintenance of genome integrity and function and an association between sleep loss and DNA damage, which could lead to neurodegeneration. Further, chronic sleep loss results in elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the gut and/or brain that contribute to mortality in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Despite these advances, little is known about the cellular consequences of sleep loss the evolutionary relationship between DNA damage and sleep regulation.</p>
<p>Comparative approaches examining evolutionarily derived differences in sleep have provided significant insight into the genetic and functional basis of sleep regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. While the majority of sleep studies in fish have used zebrafish, the Mexican tetra <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> is an emerging model for investigating the genetic and evolutionary basis underlying behavioral and physiological traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> exists as blind cave populations and an extant surface population that are interfertile. In this system, there are similar sleep loss phenotypes among geographically and geologically isolated cave populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] with likely unique genetic bases between caves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Further, the evolved differences in DNA repair genes, including links between mechanisms regulating sleep, light responsiveness, and DNA repair across all three cave populations studied to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] These findings support the notion that the genetic and molecular underpinnings of sleep are closely related to DNA repair processes in cavefish.</p>
<p>Examining the ecological factors that contribute to evolved changes in sleep regulation and the physiological consequences of this sleep loss has the potential to address the fundamental functions of sleep. For example, in humans, insomnia is associated with many different diseases and increased morbidity, suggesting that sleep is critical for healthy aging[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Despite the dramatic reduction in sleep, there are no apparently health consequences to cavefish, suggesting an established resilience to sleep loss[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Considering that changes in the levels of DNA breaks are associated with sleep regulation in flies, zebrafish, mice, and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], it is possible that intrinsic changes in the DNA repair and DDR pathways underlie reduced sleep need in cavefish.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to investigate the relationship between DNA damage and the evolution of sleep, to test at the cellular and organismal levels whether cavefish have markers of chronic sleep deprivation and accelerated aging. We find that DNA damage is elevated in cavefish brains, consistent with the notion that sleep loss is associated with elevated levels of DNA damage. The transcriptional and behavioral response to UV damage is blunted in cavefish, and cavefish cells exhibit diminished DNA repair capabilities raising the possibility that reduced DDR function may contribute to sleep loss in cavefish. To examine the long-term consequences of reduced DDR, we examined transcriptional differences in young and aged surface and cavefish. While aging in surface fish is associated with broad transcriptional changes across tissue types, there are relatively few transcriptional differences between young and aged cavefish. Together, these findings reveal that cavefish appear to have developed molecular resilience to aging despite elevated DNA damage that likely derives from sleep loss.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In vertebrates, including teleost fish such as zebrafish and <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>, DNA damage activates a highly conserved and stereotypical response and repair program. Markers of DDR proteins can be localized and quantified at the cellular and whole organism levels. Phosphorylation of histone H2AX on serine 139 (γH2AX) offers a well-established and quantifiable biomarker of cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks that is necessary for the assembly of repair complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We compared γH2AX between surface fish and Pachón cavefish brains at ZT0, a time when both populations are behaviorally activity and sleep is minimal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A–B</xref> and Supplemental Movie 1). Levels of γH2AX were elevated in the rhombencephalon, telencephalon, and mesencephalon of cavefish compared to surface fish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). These findings suggest that DNA damage is elevated in short-sleeping cavefish compared to their surface fish counterparts.</p>

<p>Sleep loss is associated with reduced gut function, including the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. To examine whether markers of sleep loss extend to the gut in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>, we compared ROS in the guts of surface and cavefish. Fish aged 6 days post fertilization (dpf) were incubated in the ROS marker dihydroethidium (DHE), and guts were imaged on a confocal microscope. We found that ROS in the gut is upregulated in cavefish, reinforcing the idea that cellular stress and canonical markers of DDR are elevated in these short-sleeping fish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D–G</xref>); ROS levels were elevated in the stomach, midgut, and hindgut, but not in the rectum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). Together, these findings fortify the notion that cellular stress is elevated in the gut of cavefish relative to surface fish.</p>
<p>To further examine the direct link between DNA damage and sleep in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic>, surface fish and cavefish were exposed to short periods of UV-B radiation, known to cause DNA damage and inducing double-stranded breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In surface fish, UV exposure resulted in a dose-dependent increase in sleep for up to three hours, similar to findings in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Interestingly, sleep decreased in surface fish sleep during the nighttime, perhaps the result of sleep credit that derives from increased sleep during the day (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Increases in sleep amount in surface fish were mediated by both increased bout number, and, at the higher dose, an increase in bout length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Conversely, there was no effect of UV treatment on daytime or nighttime sleep in cavefish (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E–H</xref>). Analysis of sleep- and wake-probability was consistent with these measurements, showing elevated sleep pressure and reduced wake pressure in surface fish during the three hours following treatment, whereas in cavefish, there was no change (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). These results confirm that UV-induced DNA damage promotes sleep in <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> surface fish, whereas this response is lost in cavefish.</p>

<p>To differentiate between these two possibilities, we examined the effects of the high dose (60 seconds) of UV treatment at zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 (onset of lights on) on the transcriptional response in surface fish and cavefish. Fish aged 6 dpf were harvested for RNA extraction 90 minutes following UV exposure (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, Supplemental Data 1). PCA analysis of RNA expression showed that the largest factor driving variability across samples was population, with principal component 1 separating samples by population and accounting for 86% of the variance. Principal component 2 separated samples by treatment and accounted for 9% of the variance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Analysis revealed numerous genes that were differentially expressed in both populations, including upregulation of the RNA Polymerase regulating transcription factor <italic>fosl1a</italic> and downregulation of <italic>spi-</italic>c (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Numerous genes were selectively differentially expressed, including upregulation of the heat shock protein <italic>hspb9</italic> in surface fish and downregulation of the glucose sensor <italic>gck</italic> in cavefish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A,B</xref>). To determine if the DDR pathway is activated in cavefish following exposure to UV light, we quantified changes in pathway components in surface fish and cavefish. A heat map of DNA repair genes significantly upregulated in surface fish revealed that several components of DNA repair pathways are differentially expressed in cavefish following UV treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Notably, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer photolyase (<italic>cpdp)</italic>, an important component of the photoreactivation repair pathway for UV-induced DNA damage, responds strongly in surface fish, but fails to respond in cavefish. Although previous groups have reported that <italic>cpdp</italic> is constitutively upregulated in adult cavefish[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], our analysis did not align with this finding; however, this could be due to differences in the age or circadian timepoint studied. A more detailed analysis of previous circadian transcriptomic studies in cavefish revealed that two of the DDR genes are elevated at some, but not all phases of the circadian cycle (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3</xref>). Additionally, <italic>xrcc3</italic>, a paralog of human <italic>rad51</italic> that is important for homologous recombination, and <italic>fan1</italic>, a component of the Fanconi Anemia pathway, are nonresponsive to UV-B treatment in cavefish. Conversely, <italic>ube2al</italic>, which is required for post-replication DNA repair, is perhaps even more strongly activated in cavefish compared to surface fish. Together, these findings suggest that DNA repair processes in cavefish have undergone complex changes, with some pathways rendered nonfunctional, while others may have been upregulated in order to compensate for loss of function in other areas. To understand transcriptional changes more fully as a result of UV-B treatment, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on both surface fish and cavefish. A large number of pathways were enriched in both populations (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2C</xref> and S2D); to examine differences between the transcriptional responses of the two populations, we identified pathways which were specifically enriched in either surface fish or cavefish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Only surface fish showed significant activation of genes associated with response to ROS and cell redox homeostasis, consistent with measurements of elevated ROS in cavefish, whereas cavefish showed activation of genes associated with metabolic processes and suppression of genes associated with synaptic signaling, suggesting altered responses to DNA damage.</p>

<p>To quantify DNA damage on a cellular level, we established embryonic fibroblast cell lines derived from surface fish and Pachón cavefish embryos (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4A</xref>). In brief, we dissociated and sterilized cells from embryos less than 12 hours post fertilization and isolated individual clones that were propagated for over 40 passages. To confirm that the cell lines indeed represented fibroblasts, we stained the cells for the presence of vimentin, a known fibroblast marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Both cell lines exhibited stable vimentin expression (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4B</xref>). We further validated the fibroblast nature of the cell lines by RNA sequencing, which showed enhanced expression of other fibroblast signature genes such as <italic>col1a1</italic> compared to other cell types, including the previously established liver-derived cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] from the same species, mouse stem cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4C</xref>).</p>
<p>We next used the newly generated fibroblast cell lines to measure DNA damage level upon UV radiation exposure. We exposed the cells to 100 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV radiation and visualized UV-induced DNA lesions using an antibody targeting cyclobutene pyrimidine dimer (CPD) as a DNA damage marker. Both the surface fish and cavefish-derived cell lines exhibited strong CPD induction, indicating pronounced UV-induced DNA damage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). We quantified the mean fluorescence per nucleus area using the Cellpose function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] of ImageJ and found no significant difference between the two derived cell lines (<italic>p</italic> = 0.6404, two-way ANOVA, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess whether a similar level of DNA damage in the different cell lines results in variations in DNA damage repair, we quantified γH2AX levels after UV treatment. Measurements were taken bi-hourly for 6 hours post exposure. The surface fish cells demonstrated a marked increase in γH2AX, whereas the cavefish cell lines showed only a modest rise, implying a diminished UV damage repair capability in cavefish cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). To validate these results, we repeated these experiments on liver-derived cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] and observed a similar trend of reduced levels of γH2AX after radiation exposure in cavefish-derived cells, while the surface fish cells showed strong induction (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig S4D</xref>). This pattern suggests that the DDR differences are not confined to tissue type. To directly test the ability to repair DNA, we employed a host cell reactivation assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Briefly, green fluorescent protein (GFP) plasmid was treated with 600 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV. We transfected the cell lines with either an intact or the <italic>in vitro</italic> UV damaged GFP plasmid and tracked GFP fluorescence recovery after 50 hours using flow cytometry as a proxy for the ability of the host cell to repair the plasmid (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>). Consistent with the γH2AX findings, the UV-damaged plasmid transfected cavefish cells displayed a substantially lower GFP signal recovery (∼22% relative to control) than the surface fish cells (∼49% relative to control) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). These observations, indicating a diminished DNA repair capacity, align with the sleep behavior differences we observed in UV-treated fish larvae.</p>
<p>DNA damage in the brain, ROS in the gut, and sleep loss are associated with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. While <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> cavefish have evolved many traits that would be detrimental to humans or other species there is evidence that they have also evolved metabolic and physiological resilience, enabling them to enjoy a similar or even extended lifespan compared to surface fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. To examine the effects of long-term accumulation of DNA damage in the brain, elevated gut ROS, and sleep loss, we examined the transcriptional profiles of tissue in young and aged fish. Briefly, we dissected the brain, gut, liver, muscle, and heart of young (∼1 year old) and aged (7–8 year old) surface fish and Pachón cavefish. PCA analysis for brain samples revealed a strong contribution of population to the sample variance, with samples separated by population across PC1 and accounting for 51% of the variance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Interestingly, while surface fish samples were separated by age across PC2, there was no separation of samples by age in cavefish (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). The same trend held true for gene expression in the gut (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5A</xref>). PCA plots of gene expression in the heart and liver did not show clear separation across either population or age, while muscle tissue showed separation by population, but not age (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5B–D</xref>). To examine the impacts on the broader transcriptome, we compared the number of differentially expressed genes between young and aged populations of surface fish and cavefish. Across all tissues, there were markedly more transcripts that were differentially expressed between young and aged surface fish than cavefish in the brain, gut, heart, liver, and muscle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Together, these findings reveal that the transcriptome of cavefish is resilient to age-associated changes despite sleep loss, elevated ROS, and elevated DNA damage.</p>

<p>We sought to examine the specific genes that were differentially expressed between surface fish and cavefish, providing potential mechanisms of resilience to DNA damage and sleep loss. Because sleep is considered necessary, specifically for repair of neuronal DNA damage, we first examined transcriptional differences in the aging surface fish and cavefish brains. Within the brain, there were only five genes which showed significant changes in both surface fish and cavefish; among these was the gene <italic>top2a</italic>, which is reduced in both populations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). <italic>Top2a</italic> is considered essential for structural maintenance of chromosomes during cell division. Intriguingly, GSEA analysis did not reveal any significantly enriched pathways in aged surface fish brains despite the high number of differentially regulated genes, while the aged cavefish brains showed suppression of gene sets related to chromosome condensation and segregation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). These processes are known to deteriorate with age as a consequence of unrepaired DNA damage, particularly in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Across non-brain tissues, we found enrichment for a wide variety of processes, some which overlapped across tissues and populations and some which did not, consistent with the idea that aging is a complex process governed by many factors (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig S6</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that, despite elevated levels of DNA damage and impaired DNA damage and repair mechanisms, cavefish are at least partially protected from their harmful effects, and exhibit reduced transcriptional changes during aging.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have investigated differences in DNA damage and the DDR pathway in <italic>A. mexicanus,</italic> a model for evolved sleep loss. UV and other agents that induce DNA damage promote sleep in diverse animals, suggesting a fundamental and highly conserved relationship between DNA damage and sleep regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Similarly, we find that DNA damage in the brain and ROS levels in the gut are elevated in Pachón cavefish compared to surface fish. These findings are consistent with the phenotypes of sleep-deprived invertebrates and mammals, supporting the notion that cavefish are sleep deprived[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Beyond the Pachón cavefish population, all three other cavefish populations have been found to have reduced sleep (Cite). Further investigation of DNA damage in these populations is necessary to determine whether the cellular effects of sleep loss are conserved in independently evolved cavefish populations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. There are many species that have evolved sleep loss, particularly in defined ecological contexts, including newborn cetaceans that forgo sleep, the Arctic tern that suppresses sleep during the mating season, and frigate birds that have reduced and unilateral sleep during prolonged flight[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. It will be highly informative to investigate the presence of DNA damage and other markers of sleep loss within a natural ecological context and in evolutionary models with altered sleep.</p>
<p>Our cellular analysis further revealed a muted DDR in cavefish, which likely contributes to the increased DNA damage noted <italic>in vivo</italic>. Since photolyases are primarily utilized for the repair of UV-induced cyclobutene pyrimidine dimers, and their repair processes are also dependent on light input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], it is plausible that these genes were not favored by natural selection in cavefish, leading to accumulated mutations and a loss of functional DNA damage response. This hypothesis is supported by findings that Somalian cavefish have lost critical DNA repair enhancers needed for an induced DDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. The fact that Mexican cavefish retain some capacity for light-induced DNA repair might be attributed to their relatively recent divergence from their surface-dwelling counterparts, estimated to be less than 200,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Although our findings are consistent with studies on DNA repair in other cavefish species, they contrast with previous research suggesting an increased DNA repair function in certain <italic>Astyanax</italic> cavefish populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. While increased expression of DNA repair genes is also observed in our study (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3</xref>), our cellular assays demonstrate that this does not equate to enhanced DNA repair activity. However, our analysis focused only on two different cell lines (embryonic fibroblasts and liver-derived cells), while the previous study looked at DNA repair in fins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Further research will be required to resolve these differences and fully understand DNA repair dynamics in cavefish.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophil</italic>a and mice, both acute and chronic sleep loss is associated with reduced longevity, and it is postulated that ROS-associated gut dysregulation leads to death in chronically sleep-deprived individuals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Therefore, it is interesting that cavefish do not exhibit clear signs of accelerated aging compared to surface fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. The lifespan of surface and cave populations of <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> is reported to exceed 20 years, largely preventing the use of longevity as a readout for aging (Rohner, personal communication). However, DNA damage and aging-associated transcriptional changes can provide a proxy for biological aging. The findings that the transcriptional architecture of cavefish does not vary to the degree of surface fish indicates a form of genomic stability or a decelerated aging process, which could be a focal point for future research into the mechanics of aging and its relationship with sleep and DNA repair. In addition to sleep loss, cavefish have fatty livers, reductions in heart regeneration, and chronically elevated blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. These findings raise the possibility that cavefish may have evolved a broad range of resilience mechanisms to biological stress. Consistent with this notion, cavefish have evolved a reduced metabolic rate and elevated metabolites associated with hypoxia and longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Many of these features, such as reduced metabolic rate, are present in other long-lived organisms, including the naked mole-rat (<italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic>) and the cave olm (<italic>Proteus anguinus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Comparing differences between surface fish and cavefish, or similarities between cavefish and other long-lived models, may provide a system to study resilience to biological stress.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings suggest that cavefish can be used as a model to study evolved loss of DDR and biological resilience. Growing genetic and genomic tools in cavefish including multiple chromosome-level sequenced genomes and single-cell RNA sequencing atlases may allow for the identification of markers of selection for DNA repair and cell-type specific transcriptional changes in sleep-regulating neurons. In addition, the study of DNA damage and ROS in additional populations of cavefish provides the opportunity to identify multiple mechanisms of DNA damage response.</p>

<p>Fish used in behavioral, immunohistochemistry, and UV-B experiments were generated and raised at Texas A&amp;M University in dedicated aquarium facilities, with water temperature maintained at 23°C on a 14 hour light: 10 hour dark schedule as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. To stimulate breeding, water temperature was raised by ∼2°C with a submersible heater, and fish were fed frozen blood worms to satiation 2–3 times daily[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Following breeding, embryos were collected from tanks and raised in a temperature-controlled incubator under the same temperature and light cycle until used for experiments. Fish used for tissue dissections were collected from aquarium facilities at Florida Atlantic University, maintained under the same conditions. Fish and embryos used for cell line derivation were collected from the cavefish facility at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research, maintained under similar conditions, except for the food. Adult fish were fed with Mysis shrimp once in the morning and Gemma 800 (Skretting, Gemma Silk) once in the afternoon. Fish in the breeding cycle were fed with Gemma 800 once at noon.</p>

<p>Embryos were collected after spawning and were dechorionated before 14 hours post fertilization (hpf). Embryos were then washed in washing media (PBS supplemented with 50 U/ml Penicillin + 0.05 mg/ml Streptomycin) for 30 min three times. Five embryos were transferred to a sterile 1.5 ml tube with 0.5 ml of wash media where the yolk sac of embryos was removed by pipetting up and down ∼10 times with a 200 μl pipette tip. Tissues in 1.5 ml tubes were then centrifuged at 1200 g for 2 min at room temperature (RT) and the supernatant was discarded carefully. Next, 300 μl of TrypLE (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #12604021) was added to each 1.5 ml tube and incubated at 28°C for 5 min in a thermomixer at 800 g. Once the embryos were dissociated, embryo tissues were pipetted up and down several times, followed by centrifugation at 1200 g for 4 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 400 µl growth media containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Cytiva, #SH30071.02E), 0.8 mM calcium chloride, 1 μg/ml human insulin solution (Sigma, #I9278), and 1X L-Glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #25030081) in L-15 (Corning, #10-045-CV), and transferred to 1 well of a 48 well plate coated with 0.1% gelatin in advance. Cells were maintained and incubated with growth media in the incubator at 28°C without CO<sub>2</sub> and were observed every day with media changes 3 times per week (400 μl per well). Cells usually reached confluency 7–10 days after derivation.

An amount of 25 μl of pmaxGFP plasmid from Lonza Amaxa cell Nucleofector Kit V (Lonza, #VCA-1003) at a concentration of ∼0.2 μg/μl was aliquoted into a 10 cm plate and irradiated with 600 J/m<sup>2</sup> of UV-C light with the lid open. The same batch of UV-treated plasmids was used for testing all species to avoid batch-to-batch variation. Next, 1.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were co-transfected with 6 μg of treated or untreated pmaxGFP. For each reaction, 82 μl base media and 18 μl of supplement was used to make the Nucleofector® Solution. Cell pellets were resuspended carefully in 100 µl RT Nucleofector® Solution per sample with 5 μg treated or untreated pmaxGFP added, then transferred into a certified cuvette. It was necessary for the samples to cover the bottom of the cuvette without air bubbles. Transfections were carried out with program T-027 using Amaxa Nucleofector II. Cuvettes were taken out of the holder once the program was finished. An amount of 20 μl of the mixture was added to 24-well plates with 1 ml of cell media and imaged every 1.5 hours for 3 days using a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2 microscope with a 10X lens; the rest of the cells were added to 6-well plates with 3 ml of cell media for flow cytometry analysis.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Cells were harvested 50 hours post-transfection. The cell pellet collected from each well of a 6-well plate was resuspended in 500 μl 1X PBS. An amount of 1 μl of Ghost Dye solution (Cytek Bioscience, #13-0865-T100) was added to each 500 μl cell suspension, vortexed immediately, and was then incubated for 30 min at 2–8°C protected from light. After incubation, the cell suspension was spun at 400 g for 5 min at RT and the supernatant was discarded. Next, 500 μl media was added to the cell pellets to prepare for flow cytometry using Cytek Aurora. The %GFP relative expression (%RE) was calculated using F = N × MFI/S, where N is the total number of live cells appearing in the positive region for GFP, MFI is the mean fluorescence intensity of the N cells, and S is the total number of live cells; %RE = F<sub>t</sub>/F<sub>u</sub>, where F<sub>t</sub> is the F of cells transfected with treated plasmids and F<sub>u</sub> is the F of cells transfected with undamaged plasmids. Live cells were identified based on altered forward and side scatters.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>For immunostaining in fish, larvae aged 6 dpf were fixed at ZT1 in a 1X Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS) with 4% Paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Tween 20 for 6 hours on ice as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. After fixation, samples were rinsed 3 times in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBT) at RT, with 10 min between rinses. Samples were incubated overnight at 4°C in 1:500 anti-γH2AX (Genetex, #GTX127342) with 0.1% PBT and 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). After overnight incubation, samples were rinsed 3 times in 0.1% PBT at RT, with 10 min between rinses. Next, samples were incubated in 1:500 Goat anti-rabbit 488 (Abcam, #ab150077) and 1 μg/ml DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #D1306) in 0.1% PBT. Finally, samples were rinsed again 3 times in 0.1% PBT at RT with 10 min between rinses, stored overnight at 4°C, and then imaged on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 20X water immersion lens.</p>
<p>For vimentin staining in cell culture, cells were fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at RT. After fixation, cells were rinsed 3 times in PBS at RT, with 5 min between rinses. After fixation, cells can be stored for up to 1 week at 4°C. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 30 min at RT, then blocked with 20% FBS diluted in 0.1% PBT for 1 hour at RT. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:200 anti-vimentin antibody (Sigma, #V5255) in blocking buffer. After overnight incubation, samples were rinsed 3 times in 0.1% PBT at RT with 5 min between rinses. Next, samples were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in darkness with 1:300 Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) 568 (Biotium, #20105) and 1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma, #10236276001) in 5% FBS and 0.1% PBT. Finally, samples were rinsed again 3 times in 0.1% PBT with 5 min between rinses, rinsed once with PBS, stored overnight at 4°C, and then imaged on a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2 confocal microscope with a 40X water immersion lens.</p>
<p>For CPD staining in cell culture, cells were plated at 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> per well in a glass bottom dish (Cellvis, #D35C4-20-1.5-N) 2 days before the experiment. Cells were washed once with PBS and cell media was removed before exposure to 100 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV-C (Stratalinker® UV Crosslinker, Model 2400, #400075). Cells were fixed 5 min after UV-C treatment using 4% Paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at RT. After fixation, cells were rinsed 3 times in PBS at RT with 5 min between rinses. After fixation, cells can be stored up to 1 week at 4°C. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS for 30 min at RT, followed by 2 rinses in PBS with 5 min between rinses. Next, 2M Hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used to denature cellular DNA for 30 min at RT, followed by 5 rinses in 0.1% PBT with 5 min between rinses. After this, cells were blocked with 20% FBS diluted in 0.1% PBT for 1 hour at RT. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:1000 anti-CPD antibody (TDM-2, Cosmo Bio, #CAC-NM-DND-001) in blocking buffer. After overnight incubation, samples were rinsed 3 times in 0.1% PBT at RT with 5 min between rinses. Next, samples were incubated for 1 hour in darkness with 1:300 Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) 568 (Biotium, #20105) and 1 μg/ml DAPI (Sigma, #10236276001) in 5% FBS and 0.1% PBT. Finally, samples were rinsed again 3 times in 0.1% PBT with 5 min between rinses, rinsed once with PBS, stored overnight at 4°C, and then imaged on a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti2 confocal microscope with a 40X water immersion lens.</p>

<title>Western Blot analysis</title>
<p>Fish fibroblast cells and liver-derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] were plated at 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> per well in 6-well plates 4 days before the experiment. Cell media was removed before cells were exposed to 3000 J/m<sup>2</sup> UV-C. Fresh cell growth media was added to the cells and incubated for 2, 4, or 6 hours. Lysis buffer was made with 1X protease inhibitor (25X stock, Sigma, #11873580001) and 1X phosphatase inhibitor (100X stock, Cell Signaling, #5870S) in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #89900). Next, 100 μl lysis buffer was added to each well and cells were detached by cell scraper (VWR INTERNATIONAL, #10062-904). Samples were fully lysed by pipetting up and down ∼5 times with a fine needle syringe (BD Medical, #328438) and vortexed for 10 seconds. The supernatant was collected as protein fractions after two rounds of centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23227).</p>
<p>Protein samples were loaded to the protein gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #NP0323BOX) at ∼10– 13 μg per lane. Protein gels were run in MOPS buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #NP0001) at 130 V for 80 min, then transferred to PVDF membrane (Sigma, #IPVH00010) in 4°C at 215 mA for 50 min. PVDF membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (LI-COR, #927-80001) for an hour at RT, then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C in 1:1000 anti-γH2AX (Genetex, #GTX127342) and 1:1000 anti-GAPDH (Proteintech, #60004-1-Ig) with blocking buffer. On the next day, PVDF membranes were washed 3 times in 0.1% TBST with 5 min between rinses and incubated with 1:10,000 Donkey anti-mouse (LI-COR, #926-32212) and anti-rabbit (LI-COR, #926-68073) secondary antibody at RT for an hour. Finally, samples were rinsed again 3 times in 0.1% TBST with 10 min between rinses, and then imaged and quantified on LI-COR Odyssey® CLx with Image Studio v5.2 software.</p>

<title>ROS imaging</title>
<p>ROS imaging was implemented based on previous protocols used in Drosophila[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Larvae aged 6 dpf were euthanized at ZT1 by immersion in ice-chilled aquarium water for 30 min. Following euthanasia, samples were incubated in 60 μM dihydroethidium (DHE; Thermo Fisher Scientific, D11347) for 5 min at RT, covered in foil to protect it from light. Next, samples were rinsed for 5 min in 1X PBS, then mounted in 2% low melting point agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, A9414) and the entire gut was imaged on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a 10X air objective, with a slice thickness of 4 μm. After interaction with superoxide radicals, DHE is converted into 2-hydroxy ethidium, which is optimally excited at 480 nm and fluoresces red (wavelength &gt; 550 nm); therefore, the sample was excited with a 488 nm laser and imaged with a detector in the 570–616 nm range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. ROS in the gut was quantified by calculating a z-projection (calc: Average Intensity) in ImageJ (NIH, v1.54f) and manually drawing ROIs around anatomically defined regions of the gut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>].</p>

<title>Sleep Experiments</title>
<p>Sleep experiments used previously described methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. For induction of DNA damage, larvae aged 5 dpf were transferred to individual wells of a 24-well plate at ZT7–8 (VWR, 82050-892), and acclimated overnight to the testing environment. At ZT0 the next day, larvae were subjected to either 60 seconds of control white light or 30 or 60 seconds of UV-B light in a UV-Crosslinker cabinet (Spectro-UV, XL-1500) fitted with UV bulbs with a spectral peak at 315 nm (UV-B; Spectro-UV, BLE-1T158). Following treatment, well plates were immediately returned to the testing environment and filmed from above using a USB camera (Basler, acA1300-200) fitted with a 16 mm fixed focal length lens (Edmund Optics, 67-714) and an infrared pass filter (Edmund Optics, 65-796) to ensure consistent image quality after the day/night transition. Larvae were lit from below using infrared light strips (850 nm), diffused through a custom-made white acrylic light box (TAP Plastics).</p>
<p>Locomotor behavior was tracked in Ethovision XT (Noldus), and frame-by-frame velocity data was exported and analyzed using a custom Python script, with sleep defined as 60 seconds or more of consolidated immobility. A velocity cut-off of 6 mm/s was used to distinguish active swimming from passive drift.</p>

<title>RNA Extraction and Sequencing</title>
<p>For RNA sequencing on fish fibroblast cells, cells were detached with TrypLE and washed once with cell media. Cell pellets were collected after centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80°C prior to RNA extraction. For UV RNA sequencing experiments, larvae were treated identically to the sleep experiments until 1.5 hours after UV exposure, at which point they were transferred to 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, with 4 larvae pooled into each tube. The larvae were euthanized by chilling on ice before immediately proceeding to RNA extraction.</p>
<p>For RNA sequencing experiments on adults, dissections were performed at Florida Atlantic University. Briefly, tissue was dissected between ZT0 and ZT3 from at least 4 fish at each age and population group. Tissue was immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. To extract RNA, 1 ml of TRIzol was added to each sample. Samples were homogenized, and then 200μl chloroform was added to each tube, followed by vigorous shaking. Samples were incubated on ice for 15 min, then phase separated by centrifuging at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The resulting aqueous phase of the liquid was transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml tube, and then RNA was precipitated out by mixing with 0.5 ml isopropanol. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed by pouring and lightly shaking the tube, then the resulting pellet was washed by the addition of 1 ml 70% EtOH while vigorously flicking the tube. The samples were then centrifuged at 7500 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed by pouring and lightly shaking the tube, and the samples were air dried upside down for 10 min. Finally, the pellet was redissolved in 100ul of RNAse-free H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<title>RNA Sequencing Data Analysis</title>
<p>Sample quality control, library preparation, and sequencing were performed by Novogene. Raw reads received from Novogene were mapped against the <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> reference genome (version 2.0, GenBank Accession Number: GCA_000372685.2) using the splice-aware mapper STAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>] to generate raw counts. Annotations were extracted from the <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> annotation file from Ensembl (Astyanax_mexicanus-2.0.108.gtf). Subsequent analysis was performed in RStudio (v4.3.0) using the differential expression testing software DESeq2 (v1.40.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>].</p>
<p>Data from the UV-B experiment and the aging experiment were analyzed using the same analysis pipeline, with each tissue type from the aging experiment analyzed separately. First, a DESeq object was created from the raw counts matrix and processed using the DESeq() command, which estimates size factors and dispersion, and fits the data to a negative binomial GLM. Normalized count values used in downstream analysis were generated using the counts() function (normalized = T). Sample variability for each group was visualized by first performing a variance stabilizing transformation using the vst() function, then generating a PCA plot from the resulting object with the plotPCA() function. To identify genes which were differentially expressed in response to UV-B treatment (or aging), each population treatment subset was reanalyzed as above, so that the effects of treatment on each population were considered separately. An adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 was used to determine a significant response to treatment.</p>

<title>Gene Ontology (GO) analysis</title>
<p>Gene ontology pathway analyses were performed using the clusterProfiler package (v4.8.3) in R. For gene set enrichment analyses, genes were first ranked according to the magnitude of their response; the ranking value was calculated as -log<sub>10</sub>(pval)/sign(log<sub>2</sub>FC), to account for both direction and magnitude of response. The resulting ranked list was processed using the gseGO() function (options: ont=’BP’’, keyType=’SYMBOL’, pvalueCutoff=0.05, OrgDB = org.Dr.eg.db, pAdjustMethod = ‘BH’). For visualization purposes, similar GO terms were grouped together using the simplify() function (options:by=’p.adjust’, select_fun=min), and visualized using the dotplot() function. For the UV-B experiment, since there were many overlapping GO terms, the top 10 unique terms in each direction were plotted.</p>

<title>Quantitative PCR</title>
<p>Adult fins were collected at Zeitgeber or Circadian time 8. 5 dpf larvae were collected at Zeitgeber or Circadian time 2, 6, 10 and 14. Samples were then homogenized and total RNA extracted as above. cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng RNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BIO-RAD, #1708891). Approximately 50 ng of cDNA was used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) using Perfecta SYBR Green with Low ROX (Quantabio, #95074-012) with a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System. Specificity of each amplicon and cDNA final concentration was optimized via analysis of post-reaction dissociation curves, validating a single amplicon for each set of primers. Analysis was conducted using the ΔΔCt method. All samples were run in 3-4 replicates and normalized to the housekeeping gene <italic>rpl13a</italic>. Primer sequences used are as follows:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lloyd et al employ an evolutionary comparative approach to study how sleep deprivation affects DNA damage repair in Astyanax mexicanus, using the cave vs surface species evolution as a playground. The work shows, convincingly, that the cavefish population has evolved an impaired DNA damage response both following sleep deprivation or a classical paradigm of DNA damage (UV).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study employs a thorough multidisciplinary approach. The experiments are well conducted and generally well presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Having a second experimental mean to induce DNA damage would strengthen and generalise the findings.</p>
<p>Overall, the study represents a very important addition to the field. The model employed underlines once more the importance of using an evolutionary approach to study sleep and provides context and caveats to statements that perhaps were taken a bit too much for granted before. At the same time, the paper manages to have an extremely constructive approach, presenting the platform as a clear useful tool to explore the molecular aspects behind sleep and cellular damage in general. The discussion is fair, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the work and its implications.</p>

<p>The manuscript investigates the relationship between sleep, DNA damage, and aging in the Mexican cavefish (Astyanax mexicanus), a species that exhibits significant differences in sleep patterns between surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling populations. The authors aim to understand whether these evolved sleep differences influence the DNA damage response (DDR) and oxidative stress levels in the brain and gut of the fish.</p>
<p>Summary of the Study:</p>
<p>The primary objective of the study is to determine if the reduced sleep observed in cave-dwelling populations is associated with increased DNA damage and altered DDR. The authors compared levels of DNA damage markers and oxidative stress in the brains and guts of surface and cavefish. They also analyzed the transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage and evaluated the DDR in embryonic fibroblast cell lines derived from both populations.</p>
<p>Strengths of the Study:</p>
<p>Comparative Approach:</p>
<p>
The study leverages the unique evolutionary divergence between surface and cave populations of A. mexicanus to explore fundamental biological questions about sleep and DNA repair.</p>
<p>Multifaceted Methodology:</p>
<p>
The authors employ a variety of methods, including immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, and in vitro cell line experiments, providing a comprehensive examination of DDR and oxidative stress.</p>
<p>Interesting Findings:</p>
<p>The study presents intriguing results showing elevated DNA damage markers in cavefish brains and increased oxidative stress in cavefish guts, alongside a reduced transcriptional response to UV-induced DNA damage.</p>
<p>Weaknesses of the Study:</p>
<p>Link to Sleep Physiology:</p>
<p>
The evidence connecting the observed differences in DNA damage and DDR directly to sleep physiology is not convincingly established. While the study shows distinct DDR patterns, it does not robustly demonstrate that these are a direct result of sleep differences.</p>
<p>Causal Directionality:</p>
<p>
The study fails to establish a clear causal relationship between sleep and DNA damage. It is possible that both sleep patterns and DDR responses are downstream effects of a common cause or independent adaptations to the cave environment.</p>
<p>Environmental Considerations:</p>
<p>
The lab conditions may not fully replicate the natural environments of the cavefish, potentially influencing the results. The impact of these conditions on the study's findings needs further consideration.</p>
<p>Photoreactivity in Albino Fish:</p>
<p>
The use of UV-induced DNA damage as a primary stressor may not be entirely appropriate for albino, blind cavefish. Alternative sources of genotoxic stress should be explored to validate the findings.</p>
<p>Assessment of the Study's Achievements:</p>
<p>The authors partially achieve their aims by demonstrating differences in DNA damage and DDR between surface and cavefish. However, the results do not conclusively support the claim that these differences are driven by or directly related to the evolved sleep patterns in cavefish. The study's primary claims are only partially supported by the data.</p>
<p>Impact and Utility:</p>
<p>The findings contribute valuable insights into the relationship between sleep and DNA repair mechanisms, highlighting potential areas of resilience to DNA damage in cavefish. While the direct link to sleep physiology remains unsubstantiated, the study's data and methods will be useful to researchers investigating evolutionary biology, stress resilience, and the molecular basis of sleep.</p>

<p>Lloyd, Xia, et al. utilised the existence of surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling morphs of Astyanax mexicanus to explore a proposed link between DNA damage, aging, and the evolution of sleep. Key to this exploration is the behavioural and physiological differences between cavefish and surface fish, with cavefish having been previously shown to have low levels of sleep behaviour, along with metabolic alterations (for example chronically elevated blood glucose levels) in comparison to fish from surface populations. Sleep deprivation, metabolic dysfunction, and DNA damage are thought to be linked and to contribute to aging processes. Given that cavefish seem to show no apparent health consequences of low sleep levels, the authors suggest that they have evolved resilience to sleep loss. Furthermore, as extended wake and loss of sleep are associated with increased rates of damage to DNA (mainly double-strand breaks) and sleep is linked to repair of damaged DNA, the authors propose that changes in DNA damage and repair might underlie the reduced need for sleep in the cavefish morphs relative to their surface-dwelling conspecifics.</p>
<p>To fulfill their aim of exploring links between DNA damage, aging, and the evolution of sleep, the authors employ methods that are largely appropriate, and comparison of cavefish and surface fish morphs from the same species certainly provides a lens by which cellular, physiological and behavioural adaptations can be interrogated. Fluorescence and immunofluorescence are used to measure gut reactive oxygen species and markers of DNA damage and repair processes in the different fish morphs, and measurements of gene expression and protein levels are appropriately used. However, although the sleep tracking and quantification employed are quite well established, issues with the experimental design relate to attempts to link induced DNA damage to sleep regulation (outlined below). Moreover, although the methods used are appropriate for the study of the questions at hand, there are issues with the interpretation of the data and with these results being over-interpreted as evidence to support the paper's conclusions.</p>
<p>This study shows that a marker of DNA repair molecular machinery that is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks (γH2AX) is elevated in brain cells of the cavefish relative to the surface fish and that reactive oxygen species are higher in most areas of the digestive tract of the cavefish than in that of the surface fish. As sleep deprivation has been previously linked to increases in both these parameters in other organisms (both vertebrates and invertebrates), their elevation in the cavefish morph is taken to indicate that the cavefish show signs of the physiological effects of chronic sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that induction of DNA damage can directly drive sleep behaviour, with a notable study describing both the induction of DNA damage and an increase in sleep/immobility in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae by exposure to UV radiation (Zada et al. 2021 doi:10.1016/j.molcel.2021.10.026). In the present study, an increase in sleep/immobility is induced in surface fish larvae by exposure to UV light, but there is no effect on behaviour in cavefish larvae. This finding is interpreted as representing a loss of a sleep-promoting response to DNA damage in the cavefish morph. However, induction of DNA damage is not measured in this experiment, so it is not certain if similar levels of DNA damage are induced in each group of intact larvae, nor how the amount of damage induced compares to the pre-existing levels of DNA damage in the cavefish versus the surface fish larvae. In both this study with A. mexicanus surface morphs and the previous experiments from Zada et al. in zebrafish, observed increases in immobility following UV radiation exposure are interpreted as following from UV-induced DNA damage. However, in interpreting these experiments it is important to note that the cavefish morphs are eyeless and blind. Intense UV radiation is aversive to fish, and it has previously been shown in zebrafish larvae that (at least some) behavioural responses to UV exposure depend on the presence of an intact retina and UV-sensitive cone photoreceptors (Guggiana-Nilo and Engert, 2016, doi:10.3389/fnbeh.2016.00160). It is premature to conclude that the lack of behavioural response to UV exposure in the cavefish is due to a different response to DNA damage, as their lack of eyes will likely inhibit a response to the UV stimulus. Indeed, were the equivalent zebrafish experiment from Zada et al. to be repeated with mutant larvae fish lacking the retinal basis for UV detection it might be found that in this case too, the effects of UV on behaviour are dependent on visual function. Such a finding should prompt a reappraisal of the interpretation that UV exposure's effects on fish sleep/locomotor behaviour are mediated by DNA damage. An additional note, relating to both Lloyd, Xia, et al., and Zada et al., is that though increases in immobility are induced following UV exposure, in neither study have assays of sensory responsiveness been performed during this period. As a decrease in sensory responsiveness is a key behavioural criterion for defining sleep, it is, therefore, unclear that this post-UV behaviour is genuinely increased sleep as opposed to a stress-linked suppression of locomotion due to the intensely aversive UV stimulus.</p>
<p>The effects of UV exposure, in terms of causing damage to DNA, inducing DNA damage response and repair mechanisms, and in causing broader changes in gene expression are assessed in both surface and cavefish larvae, as well as in cell lines derived from these different morphs. Differences in the suite of DNA damage response mechanisms that are upregulated are shown to exist between surface fish and cavefish larvae, though at least some of this difference is likely to be due to differences in gene expression that may exist even without UV exposure (this is discussed further below).</p>
<p>UV exposure induced DNA damage (as measured by levels of cyclobutene pyrimidine dimers) to a similar degree in cell lines derived from both surface fish and cave fish. However, γH2AX shows increased expression only in cells from the surface fish, suggesting induction of an increased DNA repair response in these surface morphs, corroborated by their cells' increased ability to repair damaged DNA constructs experimentally introduced to the cells in a subsequent experiment. This &quot;host cell reactivation assay&quot; is a very interesting assay for measuring DNA repair in cell lines, but the power of this approach might be enhanced by introducing these DNA constructs into larval neurons in vivo (perhaps by electroporation) and by tracking DNA repair in living animals. Indeed, in such a preparation, the relationship between DNA repair and sleep/wake state could be assayed.</p>
<p>Comparing gene expression in tissues from young (here 1 year) and older (here 7-8 years) fish from both cavefish and surface fish morphs, the authors found that there are significant differences in the transcriptional profiles in brain and gut between young and old surface fish, but that for cavefish being 1 year old versus being 7-8 years old did not have a major effect on transcriptional profile. The authors take this as suggesting that there is a reduced transcriptional change occurring during aging and that the transcriptome of the cavefish is resistant to age-linked changes. This seems to be only one of the equally plausible interpretations of the results; it could also be the case that alterations in metabolic cellular and molecular mechanisms, and particularly in responses to DNA damage, in the cavefish mean that these fish adopt their &quot;aged&quot; transcriptome within the first year of life.</p>
<p>A major weakness of the study in its current form is the absence of sleep deprivation experiments to assay the effects of sleep loss on the cellular and molecular parameters in question. Without such experiments, the supposed link of sleep to the molecular, cellular, and &quot;aging&quot; phenotypes remains tenuous. Although the argument might be made that the cavefish represent a naturally &quot;sleep-deprived&quot; population, the cavefish in this study are not sleep-deprived, rather they are adapted to a condition of reduced sleep relative to fish from surface populations. Comparing the effects of depriving fish from each morph on markers of DNA damage and repair, gut reactive oxygen species, and gene expression will be necessary to solidify any proposed link of these phenotypes to sleep.</p>
<p>A second important aspect that limits the interpretability and impact of this study is the absence of information about circadian variations in the parameters measured. A relationship between circadian phase, light exposure, and DNA damage/repair mechanisms is known to exist in A. mexicanus and other teleosts, and differences exist between the cave and surface morphs in their phenomena (Beale et al. 2013, doi: 10.1038/ncomms3769). Although the present study mentions that their experiments do not align with these previous findings, they do not perform the appropriate experiments to determine if such a misalignment is genuine. Specifically, Beale et al. 2013 showed that white light exposure drove enhanced expression of DNA repair genes (including cpdp which is prominent in the current study) in both surface fish and cavefish morphs, but that the magnitude of this change was less in the cave fish because they maintained an elevated expression of these genes in the dark, whereas the darkness suppressed the expression of these genes in the surface fish. If such a phenomenon is present in the setting of the current study, this would likely be a significant confound for the UV-induced gene expression experiments in intact larvae, and undermine the interpretation of the results derived from these experiments: as samples are collected 90 minutes after the dark-light transition (ZT 1.5) it would be expected that both cavefish and surface fish larvae should have a clear induction of DNA repair genes (including cpdp) regardless of 90s of UV exposure. The data in Supplementary Figure 3 is not sufficient to discount this potentially serious confound, as for larvae there is only gene expression data for time points from ZT2 to ZT 14, with all of these time points being in the light phase and not capturing any dynamics that would occur at the most important timepoints from ZT0-ZT1.5, in the relevant period after dark-light transition. Indeed, an appropriate control for this experiment would involve frequent sampling at least across 48 hours to assess light-linked and developmentally-related changes in gene expression that would occur in 5-6dpf larvae of each morph independently of the exposure to UV.</p>
<p>On a broader point, given the effects of both circadian rhythm and lighting conditions that are thought to exist in A. mexicanus (e.g. Beale et al. 2013) experiments involving measurements of DNA damage and repair, gene expression, and reactive oxygen species, etc. at multiple times across &gt;1 24 hour cycle, in both light-dark and constant illumination conditions (e.g. constant dark) would be needed to substantiate the authors' interpretation that their findings indicate consistently altered levels of these parameters in the cavefish relative to the surface fish. Most of the data in this study is taken at only single time points.</p>
<p>In summary, the authors show that there are differences in gene expression, activity of DNA damage response and repair pathways, response to UV radiation, and gut reactive oxygen species between the Pachón cavefish morph and the surface morph of Astyanax mexicanus. However, the data presented does not make the precise nature of these differences very clear, and the interpretation of the results appears to be overly strong. Furthermore, the evidence of a link between these morph-specific differences and sleep is unconvincing.</p>
