<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic. We apply a vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX), combining the concepts of “functional connectivity” and “encoding models”, to intracranial recordings in humans. This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs, leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching. The model shows that an external stimulus can reduce intrinsic noise. It also shows that sensory areas have mostly outward, whereas higher-order brain areas mostly incoming connections. We conclude that the response to an external audiovisual stimulus can largely be attributed to the intrinsic dynamic of the brain, already observed during rest.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>The manuscript has been revised in response to reviewer comments for an eLife submission. In addition we added more data and additional statistical analysis.
The abstract has been clarified to highlight the use of the model in separating the extrinsic effect of stimulus and the intrinsic effect of recurrent brain dynamic. In addition by adding more data to our analysis we find a difference in the recurrent connectivity between movie and resting state data.
To clarify terminology the terms intrinsic and extrinsic have been defined in the introduction and their use harmonized across the paper.
The definition of the model has been updated to show more details of the dimensionality of variables and the convolution.
The use of the neural mass model simulation has been motivated and a supplementary Figure S1 added for clarification.
Data from 2 more patients, eyes-closed resting state and 3 additional input features have been added to the models. All figures, stats and results have been updated accordingly (see Fig. 3F, S4, S5F)
To control for subject effects in the analysis of movie and resting state data as well as symmetry, we use a linear mixed effect model.
A control analysis for confounds on the B filters has been added (Fig. S11).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The primate brain is highly interconnected between and within brain areas. This includes areas involved in sensory processing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Strikingly, most computational models of brain activity in response to external natural stimuli do not take the recurrent architecture of brain networks into account. We will refer to the dynamic driven by this recurrent architecture as the <italic>intrinsic dynamic</italic> of the brain. “Encoding” models often rely on simple input/output relationships such as general linear models in fMRI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, or temporal response functions in EEG/MEG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Interactions between brain areas are captured often just as instantaneous linear correlations that are referred to as “functional connectivity” when analyzing fMRI activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Others capture synchronous activity in different brain areas by measuring phase locking of electrical neural signals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, these measures of instantaneous correlation do not capture time delays inherent in recurrent connections. By taking temporal precedence into account with recurrent models the “Granger-causality” formalism can establish directed “connectivity”. This has been used to analyze both fMRI and electrical activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The concept of functional connectivity was first developed to analyze neural activity during rest, where there are no obvious external signals to stimulate brain activity. But it is now also used to analyze brain activity during passive exposure to a stimulus, such as watching movies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. A general observation of these studies is that a portion of the functional connectivity is preserved between rest and stimulus conditions, while some aspects are altered by the perceptual task <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, sometimes showing increased connectivity during the stimulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> This should be no surprise, given that an external stimulus can drive multiple brain areas and thus induce correlations between these areas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Removing such stimulus-induced correlations by controlling for a common cause is standard practice in statistical modeling and causal inference <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, in studies that focus on functional connectivity in neuroscience, stimulus-induced correlations are often ignored when analyzing the correlation structure of neural signals. A notable exception is “dynamic causal modeling” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In this modeling approach the “input” can modulate functional connectivity. This is particularly important in the context of active behavioral tasks, where the common finding is that correlation structure changes with task states <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study we are interested in “passive” tasks such as rest and movie watching. We will ask here whether, after removing some of the stimulus-induced correlations, the intrinsic dynamic is similar between stimulus and rest conditions. Attempts to factor out the effects of intrinsic dynamics from that of the stimulus come from work on response variability. For instance, fMRI shows that variability across trials in motor cortex is due to an intrinsic “noise” which is linearly superimposed on a common response in both hemispheres due to a simple motor action <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Stimulus-response variability in the visual cortex has been attributed to variability of the ongoing dynamic <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Some studies of electrical recordings from the visual cortex show that correlations of spiking activity between different recording locations are largely unaffected by visual stimulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Yet, other studies show that visual input affects local correlation in the visual cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and across the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The technical challenge when addressing these questions is to separate the direct effect of the stimulus from the intrinsic dynamic. Here we propose to separate these effects by modeling them simultaneously with the simplest possible model, namely, linear intrinsic effects between brain areas and linear responses to extrinsic input. A mathematical model that implements this is the vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX). This model is well established in the field of linear systems <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and econometrics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, where it is used to capture intrinsic dynamics in the presence of an external input. The VARX model is an extension of the VAR model that is routinely used to establish “Granger-causality” in neuroscience (cited above). In the VARX model, Granger analysis provides a measure of statistical significance for the external input, as well as for the intrinsic dynamic, including its directionality, all as part of a single model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>While linear systems are an inadequate model of neuronal dynamics, they remain an important tool to understand neural representations because of their conceptual simplicity. They are routinely used for event-related fMRI analysis but also for “encoding models” to link non-linear features of continuous stimuli to neural responses. They have been used to analyze responses to video in fMRI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, to speech in EEG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> or to audio in intracranial EEG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. They are even used to analyze the encoding in deep-neural network models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Here we use a classic linear model to combine two canonical concepts in neuroscience, which have thus far remained separated, namely, that of “encoding models” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and “functional connectivity” models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. We will use this to analyze whole-brain, intracranial EEG in human patients at rest, and while they watch videos. Our main finding is that the recurrent connections observed during rest are only minimally altered by watching videos. Instead, the brain’s response to naturalistic stimulus appears to be substantially shaped by the same intrinsic dynamic of the brain observed during rest.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The vector-autoregressive model with external input (VARX) falls within a group of well-established linear models used in neuroscience (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Prominent examples in this group are the generalized linear model (GLM), dynamic causal model (DCM) and temporal response functions (TRF). While these models have been extensively used for neural signal analysis, the VARX model has not. We start therefore with a brief introduction.

<title>VARX model</title>
<p>The VARX model explains a time-varying vectorial signal <bold>y</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) as the result of an intrinsic autoregressive feedback driven by an innovation process <bold>e</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) and an extrinsic input <bold>x</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) (We adopt here the terminology of “intrinsic” and “extrinsic” as it is commonly used in neuroscience and psychology. In system modeling and econometrics, where the VARX model is prevalent, the more common terminology is “endogenous” and “exogenous”, meaning the same things.). For the <italic>i</italic> th signal channel the recurrence of the VAX model is given by:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="606665v3_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p><bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> are matrices of filters of lengths <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> respectively. Therefore, <bold>A</bold> has dimensions [<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>] and <bold>B</bold> has dimensions [<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>], where <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> are the dimensions of <bold>y</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) and <bold>x</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) respectively. The innovation process <bold>e</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) captures the internal variability of the model. Without it, repeating the same input <bold>x</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) would always result in a fixed deterministic output <bold>y</bold>(<italic>t</italic>). The innovation is assumed to be uncorrelated in time and has therefore an uniform spectrum. The recurrent filters in <bold>A</bold> modify this spectrum to match the spectrum of <bold>y</bold>(<italic>t</italic>), thereby capturing the intrinsic dynamic. The feed-forward filters in <bold>B</bold> inject a filtered version of the extrinsic input <bold>x</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) into this intrinsic dynamic. The role of each of these terms for brain activity is explained in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. We will refer to the filters in matrix <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> as recurrent and feed-forward “connections”, but avoid the use of the word “causal” which can be misleading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup></p>

<p>Filter matrices <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> are unknown and can be estimated from the observed history of <bold>x</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) and <bold>y</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) using ordinary least squares (OLS).

<p>The innovation is also the prediction error, for predicting <bold>y</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) from the past <bold>y</bold> (<italic>t</italic> − 1) and input <bold>x</bold>(<italic>t</italic>). In the Granger formalism the prediction error is calculated with all predictors included (error of the full model, <bold>σ</bold><italic>f</italic>) or with individual dimension in <bold>y</bold> <italic>t (</italic>− 1) or <bold>x</bold>(<italic>t</italic>) omitted from the prediction (error of the reduced models, <bold>σ</bold><italic>r</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. To quantify the “effect” of the specific dimension one can take the ratio of these errors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> leading to the test statistic <italic>D</italic> known as the “deviance”. When the number of samples <italic>T</italic> is large, the deviance follows the Chi-square distribution with cumulative density <italic>F</italic>, from which one can compute a p-value:
<disp-formula id="ueqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="606665v3_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>

<title>Overall system response</title>
<p>The overall brain response to the stimulus for the VARX model is given by the system impulse response (written here in the <italic>z</italic>-domain, or Fourier domain):

</p>
<p>What we see here is that the system response <bold>H</bold> is factorized into an autoregressive (AR) filter <bold>A</bold> and a moving average (MA) filter <bold>B</bold>. When modeled as a single MA filter, the total system response has been called the “multivariate Temporal Response Function” (mTRF) in the neuroscience community <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We found that the VARX estimate of <bold>H</bold> is nearly identical to the estimated mTRF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In other words, <bold>B</bold> and <bold>A</bold> are a valid factorization of the mTRF into feed-forward extrinsic versus recurrent intrinsic effects.</p>
<p>Note that the extrinsic effects captured with filters <bold>B</bold> are specific (every stimulus dimension has a specific effect on each brain area), whereas the intrinsic dynamic propagates this initial effect to all connected brain areas via matrix <bold>A</bold>, effectively mixing and adding the responses of all stimulus dimensions. Therefore, this factorization separates stimulus-specific effects from the shared intrinsic dynamic.</p>

<title>Relation to common neural signal models</title>
<p>The VARX model fits naturally into the existing family of models used for neural signals analysis (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). While they differ in the formulation and statistical assumptions, their defining equations have a similar general form with the following attributes:</p>
<p>An important simplifying assumption for the mTRF, VAR, and VARX models is that <bold><italic>y</italic></bold>(<italic>t</italic>) is observable with additive normal distributed innovation. As a result, parameter estimation can use ordinary least squares, which is fast to compute. In contrast, GLM, DCM, and some variants of VAR models assume that <bold><italic>y</italic></bold>(<italic>t</italic>) is not directly observable, and needs to be estimated in addition to the unknown parameters <bold>A</bold> or <bold>B</bold>. The same is true for the basic “output error” model in linear systems theory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. This requires slower iterative algorithms, such as expectation maximization. As a result, these models are often limited to small networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> of a few nodes to test specific alternative hypotheses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In contrast, here we will analyze up to 300 channels per patient to draw general conclusions about overall brain organization.</p>

<title>Validation of recurrent connectivity estimate with whole-brain neural mass model</title>
<p>To test the descriptive validity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> of the VARX model we follow the approach of recovering structural connectivity from functional activity in simulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Specifically, we will compare the recurrent connectivity <bold>A</bold> derived from brain activity simulated assuming a given structural connectivity, i.e. we ask, can the VARX model recover the underlying structural connectivity, at least in a simulated whole-brian model with known connectivity? We simulated neural activity for a whole-brain neural mass model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. We used the default model simulation of the neurolib python library (using their sample code for the “ALNModel”), which is a mean-field approximation of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons. This model can generate simulated mean firing rates in 80 brain areas based on connectivity and delay matrices determined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We used 5 min of “resting state” activity (no added stimulus, simulated at 0.1ms resolution, subsequently downsampled to 100Hz). The VARX model was estimated with <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>=2, and no input. The resulting estimate <bold>A</bold> for is dominated by the diagonal elements that capture the autocorrelation within brain areas (Fig. S1). The true connectivity matrix from DTI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) is similar to the effect size estimate <italic>R</italic> for the recurrent connections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Following <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> we compare the two as a scatter plot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and observed a Spearman correlation of 0.69. For comparison, we also used the sparse-inverse covariance method to recover connectivity from the correlation matrix (functional connectivity). This method is considered state-of-the-art as it is more sensitive than other methods in detecting structural connections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> and uses the graphical lasso algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The resulting connectivity estimate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) only achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.52. We note that the structural connectivity determined with DTI is largely symmetric. When enhancing the asymmetry the VARX model is not as accurate, but correctly recovers the direction of the asymmetry (Fig. S2).</p>

<title>Intracranial EEG recordings and stimulus features</title>
<p>We analyzed intracranial EEG and simultaneous eye-tracking data recorded from patients (N=26 recordings, mean age 38.69 years, age range 19-59 years, 11 female, Table S1) during rest and while they watched various video clips. Four out of 22 individual patients underwent two implantations and recordings at different times resulting in a total of 26 recording sessions with a total of 5,093 recording channels. The video clips included animations with speech (‘Despicable Me’, two different clips, 10 min each, in English and Hungarian), an animated short film with a mostly visual narrative and music, shown twice (‘The Present’, 4.3 min), and three clips of documentaries of macaques (‘Monkey’, 5 min each, without sound) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In addition to the clips from the previous analysis, we included a movie clip of abstract animations (‘Inscapes’, 10 min) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and an eyes-open resting state with maintained fixation (‘Resting state’, 5 min), and eyes-closed resting state (‘Eyes Closed Rest’, 5min). In total, we recorded up to 64.7 minutes of data for each patient (Table S1).</p>
<p>Neural signals were preprocessed as previously described to reduce noise <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. We re-reference signals in a bipolar montage to ensure analysis of local activity. We analyze local field potentials (LFPs) and broadband high-frequency activity (BHA) power. BHA is the power of the signal bandpass filtered between 70-150Hz. We perform analysis on both signals after downsampling to 60Hz. Example traces of y(t) for LFP and BHA are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B&amp;C</xref>.</p>
<p>We extract six features of the movies that serve as external inputs for the VARX model: fixation onset, fixation novelty, film cuts, motion, sound envelope and acoustic edges (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Fixation onset, fixation novelty, film cuts and acoustic edges are represented in x(t) as pulse trains with pulses occurring at the time of these events <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Motion and the sound envelope are continuous regressors. Motion is the average optic flow across each frame <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Fixation novelty is computed as the euclidean distance between features of a convolutional neural network computed on pre-and post fixation image patches. Fixation novelty aims to capture the change of the semantics of visual input across eye movements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The fixation novelty impulses are the same as the fixation regressor, but with their amplitude scaled by novelty. Sound envelope is computed as the absolute value of the Hilbert transform of the sound from the movie files. The envelope is downsampled to 60 Hz. Acoustic edges are peaks in the derivative of the sound envelope, representing rapid changes in the input <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. All videos and resting state include fixations. Since the visual environment is constant during fixations, there is no fixation novelty regressor. The video ‘Inscapes’, resting state and eyes-closed rest do not include film cuts as external input. The ‘Monkey’ video clips, resting state, and eyes-closed rest do not include the sound envelope or acoustic edges as input features. Eyes-closed rest does not include any external inputs. When a feature is not available it is replaced with features from a different recording. Therefore, the statistics of the feature are consistent, but not aligned to the neural recording. When comparing models with different features we always keep the number of input variables consistent between models to avoid a bias by the number of free parameters of the model. Features that are not considered in the analysis are shuffled in time by a circular shift by half the duration of the signals.</p>
<p>The models were fitted to data with the matlab version of the publicly-available VARX code <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> using conventional L2-norm regularization. The corresponding regularization parameter was set to λ=0.3. For all analyses we use filters of 600 ms length for inputs (<italic>n</italic><sub>b</sub>=36 samples for VARX models, <italic>L</italic>=36 samples for mTRF models). Delays for connections between channels are set to 100ms (<italic>n</italic><sub>a</sub>=6 samples) for both LFP and BHA signals. Increasing the number of delays <italic>n</italic><sub>a</sub>, increases estimated effect size <italic>R</italic> (Fig. S3A,B), however, larger values lead to fewer significant connections (Fig. S3C). Significance (p-value) is computed analytically, i.e. non-parametrically, based on deviance.

<title>Extrinsic input leads to spurious recurrent connectivity</title>
<p>To determine the effect of the extrinsic inputs on connectivity estimates we either fit a VARX model or a VAR model (i.e. a VARX model with no external input). We analyze LFP data on all available recordings, movies and resting state for all N=26 recording sessions. As extrinsic inputs we included film cuts, motion, fixation onset, fixation novelty, the sound envelope and acoustic edges. VAR models contain the same external inputs as the VARX model, but the time alignment is disrupted by a circular shuffle. This keeps the number of parameters in different models constant and ensures the inputs have the same covariance structure. We found a similar connectivity structure for the estimated VAR and VARX models (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p>
<p>However, they vary systematically in the number of significant recurrent connections <bold>A</bold> (those with p&lt;0.0001, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), which drops when adding inputs (median=-7.3*10<sup>−4</sup>, p&lt;0.0001, N=26, Wicoxon). The effect sizes <italic>R</italic> also significantly decreases in the VARX model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, median=-2.2*10<sup>−5</sup>, p&lt;0.0001, N=26, Wicoxon). Therefore, accounting for the external input removes spurious “connections”. We also analyzed how much each of these extrinsic inputs contributed to this effect. Removing any of the input features increased the effect size of recurrent connections compared to a model with all features (Fig. S4). We then cumulatively added each feature to the VARX model. Effect size monotonically decreases with each feature added (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Decreases of effect size are significant when adding film cuts (ΔR=-3.6*10<sup>−6</sup>, p&lt;0.0001, N=26, FDR correction, a=0.05) and the sound envelope (ΔR=-3.59*10<sup>−6</sup>, p=0.002, N=26, FDR correction, a=0.05). Thus, adding more input features progressively reduces the strength of recurrent “connections”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Recurrent connectivity is reduced during movies compared to rest</title>
<p>Next we compared recurrent connectivity between movie watching and rest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In the rest condition patients have a fixation cross on a gray background. This obviously reduces the size and number of saccades as compared to movie watching, but does not abolish them (Fig. S6). We therefore use a VARX model including fixation onset as extrinsic variable in both cases. Movies include fixation novelty, film cuts, the sound envelope, acoustic edges and motion as external inputs. To control for the number of free parameters, we include copies of features from the movies in the resting state model. The number of significant recurrent connections <bold>A</bold> in were significantly reduced during movie watching compared to rest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, fixed effect of stimulus: beta = -3.8*10<sup>−3</sup>, t(88) = -3.9, p&lt;0.001), as is the effect size <italic>R</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, fixed effect of stimulus: beta = -2.5*10<sup>−4</sup>, t(88) = -4.1, p&lt;0.001). While the effect size decreases on average, there is some variation across different brain areas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-G</xref>). In a subset of patients with eyes-closed resting state we find the same effect, that is qualitatively more pronounced (Fig. S8).</p>

<sec id="s3c">
<title>Recurrent connectivity enhances and prolongs stimulus responses</title>
<p>We also compared the feed-forward extrinsic effect with <bold>B</bold> the total system response <bold>H</bold>, which includes the additional effect of the recurrent connectivity <bold>A</bold>. We estimate <bold>B</bold> with the VARX model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) on data during video watching and resting state, and estimate the total response <bold>H</bold> directly using temporal response functions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Both models include fixation onset, film cuts and sound envelope as external inputs. We compare the power and length of filters from both models (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-D</xref>). We compare responses in channels with significant effects of <bold>B</bold> (FDR correction, a=0.05). We see that the total response <bold>H</bold> fixation onset is significantly stronger (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, medianΔ=1.5*10<sup>−4</sup>, p&lt;0.0001, N=23, Wilcoxon) and longer than the feed-forward effect <bold>B</bold> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, medianΔ=10.9ms, p=0.0002, N=23, Wilcoxon). The same effect is observed for BHA (Fig. S9) and other input features (Fig. S10). This suggests that the total response of the brain to these external inputs is dominated by the intrinsic dynamic of the brain. As with conventional linear regression, the estimate in <bold>B</bold> for a particular input and output channel is not affected by which other signals are included in x(<italic>t</italic>) or y(<italic>t</italic>), provided those other inputs are uncorrelated. We confirmed this here empirically by removing dimensions from y(<italic>t</italic>) (Fig. S11A), and by adding uncorrelated input to x(<italic>t</italic>) (Fig. S11B, adding fixation onset does not affect the estimate for auditory envelope responses). In other words, to estimate <bold>B</bold>, we do not require all possible stimulus features and all brain activity to be measured and included in the model. In contrast, <bold>B</bold> does vary when correlated inputs are added to x(<italic>t</italic>) (Fig. S11C, adding acoustic edges changes the auditory envelope response). Evidently the auditory envelope and acoustic edges are tightly coupled in time, whereas fixation onset is not. When a correlated input is missing (acoustic edges) then the other input (auditory envelope) absorbs the correlated variance, thus capturing the combined response of both.</p>

<title>Results are similar for VARX models of BHA and LFP</title>
<p>We repeated the same analyses of <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> with broadband high frequency activity (BHA). While LFP are thought to capture dendritic currents, BHA is correlated with neuronal firing rates in the vicinity of an electrode. Generally we find a more sparse recurrent connectivity for BHA as compared to LFP (compare <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>&amp;<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> with Fig. S5&amp;S7). Perhaps this is expected, given that LFP covers a broader frequency range. Regardless of this overall difference, we find similar results when analyzing BHA with the VARX model. Namely, taking the extrinsic input into account removed stimulus-induced recurrent connections (Fig. S5); the fraction of significant channels decreases during movie watching compared to rest (Fig. S7); and responses to the stimulus are stronger and more prolonged when separately modeling the effect of recurrent connectivity (Fig. S9). In the Discussion section we will argue that some of these results are expected in general when decomposing the total system response into extrinsic and intrinsic effects.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>Intrinsic “noise” in BHA is reduced by external stimulus</title>
<p>So far we have discussed the mean response captured by <bold>B</bold> and the activity mediated by <bold>A</bold>. We now want to analyze whether the external input modulates the internal variability of brain activity. As a metric of internal variability we measured the power of the intrinsic innovation process e(<italic>t</italic>), which captures the unobserved “random” brain activity which leads to variations in the responses. For the LFP signal we see a drop in power during movies as compared to rest, for both the original signal y(<italic>t</italic>) (Fig. S12A) and the model’s innovation process e(t) (Fig. S12B). Notable is the stronger oscillatory activity during rest (Fig. S12A). In this example we see a drop in power in the theta/alpha band (5-11 Hz) during movie watching across all electrodes (Fig. S12A, dotted lines). We observe similar narrow-band drop in power in most patients, albeit at different frequencies (not shown). When analyzing BHA, we find no difference in power of the innovation process between movie and rest, but we do find a drop in power relative to the overall BHA signals for some channels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These channels seem to coincide with channels that responded to the external stimuli, i.e. channels with a significant effect in <bold>B</bold> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). If we take for each patient the median relative power for responsive channels (median among those with p&lt;0.0001), then we find that relative power drops for nearly all patients (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>, Wilcoxon rank sum test, p=8.8*10<sup>−7</sup>, N=26). The motivation for analyzing only responsive channels comes from a simple gain adaptation (Fig. S13). Gain adaptation keeps the power of y(<italic>t</italic>) constant, so that the extra power injected by the stimulus implicitly reduces the relative power of the innovation process. This effect is specific to channels receiving external input (Fig. S13D) and absent in a linear system without gain adaptation (Fig. S13C). To demonstrate that this simple gain adaptation can explain the noise quenching in the neural data, we simulated data with the gain adaptation model (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>) using parameters estimated for the example patient of <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A/B</xref>.</p>

Therefore, the difference of <italic>R</italic> − <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>) averaged along a column has positive values if a node has overall stronger outgoing connections, and negative values if it has stronger incoming connections. We measured this directionality for each channel across all patients and averaged also across channels within parcels of the Desikan-Killiany atlas (N=34 regions of interest, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. We expected this to co-vary with “cortical hierarchy”. To test this, we compared this asymmetry metric with the T1w/T2w ratio, which captures gray matter myelination and is used as an indirect measure of cortical hierarchy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. We also average T1w/T2w ratio in the same parcels of the Desikan-Killiany atlas (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). We used a mixed effect model and find that cortical areas showing more outgoing connections (<italic>R</italic> − <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>T</italic></sup> &gt; 0) have higher T1w/T2w ratio, which are located lower on the cortical hierarchy (t(533)=2.62, p = 0.009, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). BHA analysis shows the same effect (Fig. S14).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results suggest that the duration and magnitude of responses to extrinsic input is in large part a result of the intrinsic dynamic of the recurrent brain network. We also found that the intrinsic dynamic had reduced recurrent connectivity and weaker intrinsic variability during movie stimulus.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Response to extrinsic input versus intrinsic dynamics</title>
<p>Previous literature does often not distinguish between intrinsic dynamics and extrinsic effects. By factoring out some of the linear effects of the external input we conclude here that recurrent connectivity is reduced on average. From our prior work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, we know that the stimulus features we included here capture a substantial amount of variance across the brain in intracranial EEG. Arguably, however, the video stimuli had rich semantic information that was not captured by the low-level features used here. Adding such semantic features could have further reduced shared variance, and consequently further reduced average recurrent connectivity in the model.</p>
<p>Similarities and differences between rest and movie watching conditions reported previously, do not draw a firm conclusion as to whether overall “functional connectivity” is increased or reduced. Results seem to depend on the time scale of neural activity analyzed, and the specific brain networks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. However, in fMRI, the conclusion seems to be that functional connectivity during movies is stronger than during rest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, which likely results from stimulus induced correlations. The VARX model can remove some of the effects of these stimuli, revealing that average recurrent connectivity may be reduced rather than increased during stimulus processing.</p>
<p>In this work we focused on “passive” tasks, i.e. resting with gaze on a fixation point, versus watching movies without any associated tasks. We did not analyze data during an active task requiring behavioral responses. The literature on active tasks emphasizes “state change” in functional connectivity. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> Efforts to factor out task-evoked activity when computing functional connectivity concord with our conclusions that connectivity is inflated by a task <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, we hesitate extrapolating our findings to active tasks, as we have not analyzed such data. Future studies should test if our findings replicate in an independent iEEG datasets, including active tasks and whether they generalize to other neuroimaging modalities.</p>
<p>Conventional “encoding” models, such as temporal response functions, capture the total response <bold>H</bold> of the brain to an external stimulus. Here we factored this into a moving average filter <bold>B</bold>, followed by and autoregressive filter <bold>A</bold>. The important observation is that this intrinsic dynamic governed by <bold>A</bold> does not change during stimulus processing. Arguably then, the role of the initial responses <bold>B</bold> is to shape the input to be processed by the existing intrinsic dynamic.</p>
<p>This interpretation is consistent with the view of “the brain from the inside out” advocated by György Buzsáki <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In this view, learning of a stimulus representation consists in learning a mapping of the external stimulus to an existing intrinsic dynamic of the brain.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Similar findings for LFP and BHA</title>
<p>We found a more sparse recurrent connectivity for BHA as compared to LFP. This may be expected because correlations in lower frequencies (that dominate LFPs) reach over longer distances compared to correlations in higher frequencies (e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>). BHA has been linked to a mixture of neuronal firing and dendritic currents <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, in contrast to LFP, which is thought to originate from widespread dendritic currents. Despite the observed differences in sparsity, for both LFP and BHA we found that modeling the intrinsic dynamic removed spurious recurrent connections. Removal of spurious effects when controlling for a common cause is a generic finding in multivariate statistical models. We also found for both LFP and BHA that the duration and strength of stimulus responses can be largely attributed to the recurrent connections. Arguably, this is a generic feature of an autoregressive model, as it more readily captures longer impulse responses. However, the extrinsic filters <bold>B</bold> in principle have an advantage as they can be fit to each stimulus and brain location. In contrast, the recurrent filters <bold>A</bold> are constrained by having to capture a shared dynamic for all stimulus dimensions. Thus, the predominance of the intrinsic dynamic in the total system response is not a trivial result of the factorization into intrinsic and extrinsic effects.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Stimulus-induced reduction of noise in the intrinsic activity</title>
<p>One difference we did find between LFP and BHA is the intrinsic innovation process, i.e. the internal sources of variability or “noise”. For both BHA and LFP we saw a drop in the magnitude of signal fluctuations during the movie watching condition. For the BHA but not the LFP, this was explained as a drop in intrinsic noise. Specifically, for BHA there was less relative power in the intrinsic “noise” for channels that are responsive to the stimulus. This is consistent with the notion that response variability is due to variability of intrinsic activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> which is found to decrease across the brain with the onset of an external stimulus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. This type of noise quenching has been associated with increased attention <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> and improved visual discrimination performance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. The effect we found here can be explained by a VARX model with the addition of a divisive gain adaptation mechanism that keeps the total power of brain activity constant. When the input injects additional power, this nonlinear gain adaptation implicitly reduces the contribution of the intrinsic noise to the total power. The noise-quenching result and its explanation via gain adaptation shows the benefit of using a parsimonious linear model, which can suggest nonlinear mechanisms as simple corrections from linearity.</p>
<p>We also observed an overall drop in LFP power during movie watching. This phenomenon was strongest in oscillatory bands, with frequencies in theta (5-8Hz) to beta (15-25Hz) band differing across patients. In scalp EEG, noise quenching is associated with a similar overall drop in power with the stimulus <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. This quenching of neural variability was also found to reduce correlation between brian areas for fMRI and neural spiking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Both fMRI and neural spiking correlated with BHA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Stimulus features</title>
<p>During the movie and rest periods, we utilized fixation onset to capture activity that is time-locked to visual processing because patients move their eyes even during rest. We also added the fixation novelty regressor to capture semantic changes in the visual input across eye movements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. We incorporated the sound envelope, a prominent feature known for capturing the dominant audio-induced variance in scalp EEG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, as well as acoustic edges that capture strong transients in the auditory input <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. In addition, we included film cuts as features, as we had previously demonstrated that they dominate the response in the BHA across the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Motion is added as an additional feature to capture while other basic visual features such as overall optic flow or fixations on faces elicited responses in the BHA, their contribution was relatively smaller. The analysis is not limited to these few features, and future research should explore which stimulus features capture variance in the data and how they affect the apparent recurrent connectivity. There is a substantial body of literature on encoding models of semantic features, where nonlinear features of a continuous natural stimulus are extracted and then linearly regressed against fMRI <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> or EEG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. This work can be directly replicated with the VARX model which further models the recurrent connectivity.</p>

<title>Alternative approaches</title>
<p>The traditional VAR model has been used extensively in neuroscience to establish directed “Granger causal” connections <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. This approach has been very fruitful and found numerous extensions, e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, these model implementations do not specifically account for an external input.</p>
<p>A few methods have attempted to model the effect of varying task conditions on functional connectivity, mostly in the analysis of fMRI. One approach is to first model the task-evoked responses, equivalent to estimating <bold>B</bold> alone, and then compute the conventional “functional connectivity”, i.e. the correlation matrix, on the residuals <bold><italic>e</italic></bold>(<italic>t</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Others suggested to estimate <bold>B</bold> in multiple time windows and then estimate a “task related functional connectivity” by correlating the multiple <bold>B</bold> over time windows <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. It is not clear that these ad-hoc methods systematically separate intrinsic from extrinsic factors.</p>
<p>A more principled modeling approach is “dynamic causal modeling” (DCM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and extensions thereof <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. Similar to the VARX model, DCM includes intrinsic and extrinsic effects <bold><italic>A</italic></bold> and <bold>B</bold>. However, the modeling is limited to first-order dynamics (i.e. <italic>n</italic><sub>a</sub>=<italic>n</italic><sub>b</sub>=1). Thus, prolonged responses have to be entirely captured with a first-order recurrent <bold>A</bold>. In contrast, the DCM includes a multiplicative interaction of extrinsic input <bold><italic>x</italic></bold>(<italic>t</italic>) on the connectivity <bold>A</bold>, which does not exist in the VARX model. This interaction has been used to explicitly model a change in recurrent connectivity with task conditions. Here we found that this may not be necessary for intracranial EEG. A practical advantage of the VARX model is the assumption that the neural activity is directly observed. Instead, many existing models assume an error in the observations, which triggers computationally intensive estimation algorithms, typically the expectation maximization algorithm. The same is true for the “output error” model in linear systems theory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As a result, these models are often limited to small networks to test specific alternative hypotheses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (The original DCM proposed for fMRI included an added complication of modeling the hemodynamic response, which amounts to adding a temporal filter to each output node and prior to adding observation noise.). In contrast, here we have analyzed up to 300 channels per patient across the brain, which would be prohibitive with DCM. By analyzing a large number of recordings we were able to draw more general conclusions about whole-brain activity.</p>

<title>Caveats</title>
<p>The stimulus features we included in our model capture mostly low-level visual and auditory input. It is possible that regressing out a richer stimulus characterization would have removed additional stimulus-induced correlation. While we do not expect that this would change the overall effect of a reduced number of “connections” during movie watching compared to resting state, the interpretation of changes in specific connections will be affected by the choice of features. For example, in sensory cortices, higher recurrent connectivity in the LFP during rest would be consistent with the more synchronized state we saw in rest, as reflected by larger oscillatory activity. Synchronization in higher-order cortices, however, is expected to be more strongly influenced by semantic content of external input.</p>
<p>We find a correlation of DTI structural connectivity used in a model with a VARX estimate of 0.70. That is considered a relatively large value compared to other studies that attempt to recover DTI connectivity from the correlation structure of fMRI activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. A Caveat is that this was done on a biophysical model of firing rate, not fMRI, and we have not explored the parameters of the model that might affect the results.</p>
<p>We used fixation onsets as external input, but it should be noted that they are tightly correlated in time with saccade onsets (there is only about a 30 ms jitter between the two, depending on saccade amplitude). While saccades are driven by visual movement, they are generated by the brain itself and arguably could also be seen as intrinsic. The same is true for all motor behaviors, most of which cause a corresponding sensory response, similar to the visual response following a saccade. Including them as external input is a modeling choice we have made here, but it is important to acknowledge that fixation onsets can therefore have “acausal” components <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. By “acausal” we mean a fixation-locked response that precedes the fixation onset and is due to the neural activity leading up to the saccade and subsequent fixation. Such acausal responses can be captured by the VARX Granger formalism by delaying the input relative to the neural activity, which we have not done here.</p>
<p>The correlation between the average incoming and outgoing connections and cortical hierarchy (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) is not significant when normalizing for the number of electrodes in each region of interest. Regions in the temporal lobe with a large number of electrodes might drive this correlation. A more fine grained analysis in these regions could be the goal of future analysis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We analyzed whole-brain intracranial recordings in human patients at rest and while they watched videos. We used a model that separates intrinsic dynamics from extrinsic effects. We found that the brain’s response to the audiovisual stimuli appears to be substantially shaped by its endogenous dynamic. The model revealed a small but significant decrease of recurrent connectivity when watching movies. Finally, we observed a reduction in intrinsic variance during the extrinsic stimulus, which may be the result of neuronal gain adaptation.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents an interesting new framework (VARX) for simultaneously quantifying effective connectivity in brain activity during sensory stimulation and how that brain activity is being driven by that sensory stimulation. The reviewers thought the model was original and its conclusion that intrinsic connectivity is reduced (rather than increased) during sensory stimulation is very interesting, but that for ideal performance, one must specify all sensory features in the model, which is not possible. Overall, however, this work is <bold>important</bold> with <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for its conclusions - it will be of interest to neuroscientists working on brain connectivity and dynamics.</p>

<p>The responses to the previous comments are very helpful. I think the manuscript does a nice job now of presenting its interesting findings in a convincing and measured manner.</p>
<p>I had only one small remaining suggestion - to maybe link the finding of reduced intrinsic connectivity during stimulation to previous work on that topic. I thought of Nauhaus et al., Nature Neurosci, 2009.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors apply the recently developed VARX model, which explicitly models intrinsic dynamics and the effect of extrinsic inputs, to simulated data and intracranial EEG recordings. This method provides a directed method of 'intrinsic connectivity'. They argue this model is better suited to the analysis of task neuroimaging data because it separates the intrinsic and extrinsic activity. They show: that intrinsic connectivity is largely unaltered during a movie-watching task compared to eyes open rest; intrinsic noise is reduced in the task; and there is intrinsic directed connectivity from sensory to higher-order brain areas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The paper tackles an important issue with an appropriate method.</p>
<p>(2) The authors validated their method on data simulated with a neural mass model.</p>
<p>(3) They use intracranial EEG, which provides a direct measure of neuronal activity.</p>
<p>(4) Code is made publicly available and the paper is written well.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents an interesting new framework (VARX) for simultaneously quantifying effective connectivity in brain activity during sensory stimulation and how that brain activity is being driven by that sensory stimulation. Overall, I thought this was an interesting manuscript with some rich and intriguing ideas. That said, I had some concerns also - one potentially major - with the inferences drawn by the authors on the analyses that they carried out.</p>
<p>Main comments:</p>
<p>(1) My primary concern with the way the manuscript is written right now relates to the inferences that can be drawn from the framework. In particular, the authors want to assert that, by incorporating an encoding model into their framework, they can do a better job of accounting for correlated stimulus-driven activity in different brain regions, allowing them to get a clearer view of the underlying innate functional connectivity of the brain. Indeed, the authors say that they want to ask &quot;whether, after removing stimulus-induced correlations, the intrinsic dynamic itself is preserved&quot;. This seems a very attractive idea indeed. However, it seems to hinge critically on the idea of fitting an encoding model that fully explains all of the stimulus-driven activity. In other words, if one fits an encoding model that only explains some of the stimulus-driven response, then the rest of the stimulus-driven response still remains in the data and will be correlated across brain regions and will appear as functional connectivity in the ongoing brain dynamics - according to this framework. This residual activity would thus be misinterpreted. In the present work, the authors parameterize their stimulus using fixation onsets, film cuts, and the audio envelope. All of these features seem reasonable and valid. However, they surely do not come close to capturing the full richness of the stimuli, and, as such, there is surely a substantial amount of stimulus-driven brain activity that is not being accounted for by their &quot;B&quot; model and that is being absorbed into their &quot;A&quot; model and misinterpreted as intrinsic connectivity. This seems to me to be a major limitation of the framework. Indeed, the authors flag this concern themselves by (briefly) raising the issue in the first paragraph of their caveats section. But I think it warrants much more attention and discussion.</p>

<p>We agree. One can never be sure that all stimulus induced correlation is accounted for. We now formulate our question more cautiously:</p>
<p>“We will ask here whether, after removing some of the stimulus-induced correlations, the intrinsic dynamic is similar between stimulus and rest conditions.”</p>
<p>We also highlight that one may expect the opposite result of what we found:</p>
<p>“A general observation of these studies is that a portion of the functional connectivity is preserved between rest and stimulus conditions, while some aspects are altered by the perceptual task [12,16], sometimes showing increased connectivity during the stimulus.[15].”</p>
<p>We have added a number of additional features (acoustic edges, fixation novelty, and motion) and more carefully characterize how much “connectivity” each one explains in the neural data:</p>
<p>“Removing any of the input features increased the effect size of recurrent connections compared to a model with all features (Fig. S4). We then cumulatively added each feature to the VARX model. Effect size monotonically decreases with each feature added (Fig. 3F). Decreases of effect size are significant when adding film cuts (ΔR=-3.6*10<sup>-6</sup>, p&lt;0.0001, N=26, FDR correction, α=0.05) and the sound envelope (ΔR=-3.59*10<sup>-6</sup>, p=0.002, N=26, FDR correction, α=0.05). Thus, adding more input features progressively reduces the strength of recurrent “connections”.”</p>
<p>We also added more data to the analysis comparing movies vs rest. We now use 4 different movie segments instead of 1 and find reduced recurrent connectivity during movies:</p>
<p>“The number of significant recurrent connections in  were significantly reduced during  movie watching compared to rest (Fig. 4C, fixed effect of stimulus: beta = -3.8*10<sup>-3</sup>, t(17) = -3.9, p&lt;0.001), as is the effect size <italic>R</italic> (Fig. 4D, fixed effect of stimulus: beta = -2.5*10<sup>-4</sup>, t(17) = -4.1, p&lt;0.001).”</p>
<p>The additional analysis is described in the Methods section:</p>
<p>“To compare recurrent connectivity between movies and the resting-state, we compute VARX models in four different movie segments of 5 minutes length to match the length of the resting state recording. We use the first and second half of ‘Despicable Me English’, the first half of ‘Inscapes’ and one of the ‘Monkey’ movies. 18 patients include each of these recordings. For each recording in each patient we compute the fraction of significant channels (p&lt;0.001) and average the effect size <italic>R</italic> across all channel pairs, excluding the diagonal. We test the difference between movies and resting-state with linear mixed-effect models with stimulus as fixed effect (movie vs rest), and patient as random effect, using matlab’s fitlme() routine.”</p>
<p>We had already seen this trend of decreasing connectivity during movie watching before, and reported on it cautiously as “largely unaltered”. We updated the Abstract correspondingly from “largely unaltered” to “reduced”:</p>
<p>“We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching.”</p>
<p>We mentioned this possibility in the Discussion before, namely, that additional input features may reduce recurrent connectivity in the model, and therefore show a difference. We discuss this result now as follows:</p>
<p>“The stimulus features we included in our model capture mostly low-level visual and auditory input. It is possible that regressing out a richer stimulus characterization would have removed additional stimulus-induced correlation. While we do not expect that this would change the overall effect of a reduced number of “connections” during movie watching compared to resting state, the interpretation of changes in specific connections will be affected by the choice of features. For example, in sensory cortices, higher recurrent connectivity in the LFP during rest would be consistent with the more synchronized state we saw in rest, as reflected by larger oscillatory activity. Synchronization in higher-order cortices, however, is expected to be more strongly influenced by semantic content of external input.”</p>
<p>In the Discussion we expand on what might happen if additional stimulus features were to be included into the model:</p>
<p>“Previous literature does often not distinguish between intrinsic dynamics and extrinsic effects. By factoring out some of the linear effects of the external input we conclude here that recurrent connectivity is reduced in average. From our prior work49, we know that the stimulus features we included here capture a substantial amount of variance across the brain in intracranial EEG. Arguably, however, the video stimuli had rich semantic information that was not captured by the low-level features used here. Adding such semantic features could have further reduced shared variance, and consequently further reduced average recurrent connectivity in the model.”</p>
<p>“Similarities and differences between rest and movie watching conditions reported previously, do not draw a firm conclusion as to whether overall “functional connectivity” is increased or reduced. Results seem to depend on the time scale of neural activity analyzed, and the specific brain networks [12,16,63]. However, in fMRI, the conclusion seems to be that functional connectivity during movies is stronger than during rest[15], which likely results from stimulus induced correlations. The VARX model can remove some of the effects of these stimuli, revealing that average recurrent connectivity may be reduced rather than increased during stimulus processing.”</p>
<p>And in the conclusion we now write:</p>
<p>“The model revealed a small but significant decrease of recurrent connectivity when watching movies.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Related to the previous comment, the authors make what seems to me to be a complex and important point on page 6 (of the pdf). Specifically, they say &quot;Note that the extrinsic effects captured with filters B are specific (every stimulus dimension has a specific effect on each brain area), whereas the endogenous dynamic propagates this initial effect to all connected brain areas via matrix A, effectively mixing and adding the responses of all stimulus dimensions. Therefore, this factorization separates stimulus-specific effects from the shared endogenous dynamic.&quot; It seems to me that the interpretation of the filter B (which is analogous to the &quot;TRF&quot;) for the envelope, say, will be affected by the fact that the matrix A is likely going to be influenced by all sorts of other stimulus features that are not included in the model. In other words, residual stimulus-driven correlations that are captured in A might also distort what is going on in B, perhaps. So, again, I worry about interpreting the framework unless one can guarantee a near-perfect encoding model that can fully account for the stimulus-driven activity. I'd love to hear the authors' thoughts on this. (On this issue - the word &quot;dominates&quot; on page 12 seems very strong.)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point we had not thought about. After some theoretical considerations and some empirical testing we conclude that the effect of missing inputs is relevant, but can be easily anticipated.</p>
<p>We have added the following to the Results section explaining and demonstrated empirically the effects of adding features and signals to the model:</p>
<p>“As with conventional linear regression, the estimate in <bold>B</bold> for a particular input and output channel is not affected by which other signals are included in <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula id="sa3equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, provided those other inputs are uncorrelated. We confirmed this here empirically by removing dimensions from <inline-formula id="sa3equ3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ3.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> (Fig. S11A), and by adding uncorrelated input to <bold>B</bold>, we do not require all possible stimulus features and all brain activity to be measured and included in the model. In contrast, <bold>B</bold> does vary when correlated inputs are added to <inline-formula id="sa3equ4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ4.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> (Fig. S11B, adding fixation onset does not affect the estimate for auditory envelope responses). In other words, to estimate <inline-formula id="sa3equ5"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ5.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> (Fig. S11C, adding acoustic edges changes the auditory envelope response). Evidently the auditory envelope and acoustic edges are tightly coupled in time, whereas fixation onset is not. When a correlated input is missing (acoustic edges) then the other input (auditory envelope) absorbs the correlated variance, thus capturing the combined response of both.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Regarding the interpretation of the analysis of connectivity between movies and rest... that concludes that the intrinsic connectivity pattern doesn't really differ. This is interesting. But it seems worth flagging that this analysis doesn't really account for the specific dynamics in the network that could differ quite substantially between movie watching and rest, right? At the moment, it is all correlational. But the dynamics within the network could be very different between stimulation and rest I would have thought.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above, with more data and additional stimulus features we now see detectable changes in the connectivity. The example in Figure 4G also shows that specific connections may change in different directions, while overall the strength of connections slightly decreases during movie watching compared to rest. We added the following to the results:</p>
<p>“While the effect size decreases on average, there is some variation across different brain areas (Fig. 4E-G).”</p>
<p>But even if the connectivity were unchanged, the activity on this network can be different with varying inputs. We actually also saw that there were changes in the variability of activity (Figs. 6 and S13) that may point to non-linear effects. It seems that injecting the input will cause an overall change in power, which can be explained by a relatively simple non-linear gain adaptation. These effects are already discussed at some length in the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) I didn't really understand the point of comparing the VARX connectivity estimate with the spare-inverse covariance method (Figure 2D). What was the point of this? What is a reader supposed to appreciate from it about the validity or otherwise of the VARX approach?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the following motivation and clarification on this topic:</p>
<p>“To test the descriptive validity [43] of the VARX model we follow the approach of recovering structural connectivity from functional activity in simulation. [44] Specifically, we will compare the recurrent connectivity <bold>A</bold> derived from brain activity simulated assuming a given structural connectivity, i.e. we ask, can the VARX model recover the underlying structural connectivity, at least in a simulated whole-brian model with known connectivity? … For comparison, we also used the sparse-inverse covariance method to recover connectivity from the correlation matrix (functional connectivity). This method is considered state-of-the-art as it is more sensitive than other methods in detecting structural connections [48]”</p>
<p>(5) I think the VARX model section could have benefitted a bit from putting some dimensions on some of the variables. In particular, I struggled a little to appreciate the dimensionality of A. I am assuming it has to involve both time lags AND electrode channels so that you can infer Granger causality (by including time) between channels. Including a bit more detail on the dimensionality and shape of A might be helpful for others who want to implement the VARX model.</p>
<p>Your assumption is correct. We added the following to make this easier for readers: </p>
<p>“Therefore, <bold>A</bold>  has dimensions <inline-formula id="sa3equ6"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ6.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula><bold>B</bold> has dimensions <inline-formula id="sa3equ7"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ7.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula id="sa3equ8"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ8.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> are the dimensions of <inline-formula id="sa3equ9"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ9.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="sa3equ10"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-104996-sa3-equ10.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> respectively.”</p>

<p>(6) A second issue I had with the inferences drawn by the authors was a difficulty in reconciling certain statements in the manuscript. For example, in the abstract, the authors write &quot;We find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is largely unaltered during movie watching.&quot; And they also write that &quot;Failing to account for ... exogenous inputs, leads to spurious connections in the intrinsic &quot;connectivity&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps this segment of the abstract needed more explanation. To enhance clarity we have also changed the ordering of the findings. Hopefully this is more clear now:</p>
<p>“This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic. We find that the intrinsic dynamic enhances and prolongs the neural responses to scene cuts, eye movements, and sounds. Failing to account for these extrinsic inputs, leads to spurious recurrent connections that govern the intrinsic dynamic. We also find that the recurrent connectivity during rest is reduced during movie watching.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors apply the recently developed VARX model, which explicitly models intrinsic dynamics and the effect of extrinsic inputs, to simulated data and intracranial EEG recordings. This method provides a directed method of 'intrinsic connectivity'. They argue this model is better suited to the analysis of task neuroimaging data because it separates the intrinsic and extrinsic activity. They show: that intrinsic connectivity is largely unaltered during a movie-watching task compared to eyes open rest; intrinsic noise is reduced in the task; and there is intrinsic directed connectivity from sensory to higher-order brain areas.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The paper tackles an important issue with an appropriate method.</p>
<p>(2) The authors validated their method on data simulated with a neural mass model.</p>
<p>(3) They use intracranial EEG, which provides a direct measure of neuronal activity.</p>
<p>(4) Code is made publicly available and the paper is written well.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is unclear whether a linear model is adequate to describe brain data. To the author's credit, they discuss this in the manuscript. Also, the model presented still provides a useful and computationally efficient method for studying brain data - no model is 'the truth'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We fully agree and have nothing much to add to this, except to highlight the benefit of a linear model even as explanation for non-linear phenomena:</p>
<p>“The [noise-quenching] effect we found here can be explained by a VARX model with the addition of a divisive gain adaptation mechanism … The noise-quenching result and its explanation via gain adaptation shows the benefit of using a parsimonious linear model, which can suggest nonlinear mechanisms as simple corrections from linearity.”</p>
<p>Appraisal of whether the authors achieve their aims:</p>
<p>As a methodological advancement highlighting a limitation of existing approaches and presenting a new model to overcome it, the authors achieve their aim. Generally, the claims/conclusions are supported by the results.</p>
<p>The wider neuroscience claims regarding the role of intrinsic dynamics and external inputs in affecting brain data could benefit from further replication with another independent dataset and in a variety of tasks - but I understand if the authors wanted to focus on the method rather than the neuroscientific claims in this manuscript.</p>
<p>We fully agree. We added the following to the Discussion section:</p>
<p>“Future studies should test if our findings replicate in an independent iEEG datasets, including active tasks and whether they generalize to other neuroimaging modalities.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) I'm curious about the authors' opinions on the conditions studied. Naively, eyes open rest and passive movie watching seem like similar conditions - were the authors expecting to see a difference with VARX? Do the authors expect that they would see bigger differences when there is a larger difference in sensory input, e.g. eyes closed rest vs movie watching? Given the authors are arguing the need to explicitly model external inputs, a real data example contrasting two very different external inputs might better demonstrate the model's utility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We added an analysis of eyes-closed rest recordings, available in 8 patients (Fig. S8). The difference between movie and rest is indeed more pronounced than for eyes open rest. The result is described in the methods:</p>
<p>“In a subset of patients with eyes-closed resting state we find the same effect, that is qualitatively more pronounced (Fig. S8).”</p>
<p>This complements our updated finding of a difference between movie and eyes-open rest that does show a significant difference after adding more data to this analysis. The results have been updated as following</p>
<p>“The number of significant recurrent connections in  were significantly reduced during  movie watching compared to rest (Fig. 4C, fixed effect of stimulus:</p>
<p>beta = -3.8*10<sup>-3</sup>, t(17) = -3.9, p&lt;0.001), as is the effect size <italic>R</italic> (Fig. 4D, fixed effect of stimulus: beta = -2.5*10<sup>-4</sup>, t(17) = -4.1, p&lt;0.001).”</p>

<p>(2) It would also have been interesting to see how the proposed model compares to DCM - however, I understand if the authors wanted to focus on their model rather than a comparison with other models.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not try the DCM for a number of reasons. 1) it does not allow for delays in the model dynamic (i.e. the entire time course of the response has to be captured by the recurrent dynamic of a single time step A). 2. It is computationally prohibitive and would not allow us to analyze large channel counts. 3. The available code is custom made for fMRI or EEG analysis with very specified signal generation models that do not obviously apply to iEEG. We added the following to the Discussion of the CDM:</p>
<p>“Similar to the VARX model, DCM includes intrinsic and extrinsic effects <bold><italic>A</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>B</italic></bold>. However, the modeling is limited to first-order dynamics (i.e. <italic>η<sub>a</sub></italic>=<italic>η<sub>b</sub></italic>=1). Thus, prolonged responses have to be entirely captured with a first-order recurrent <bold><italic>A</italic></bold>. … In contrast, here we have analyzed up to 300 channels per subject across the brain, which would be prohibitive with DCM. By analyzing a large number of recordings we were able to draw more general conclusions about whole-brain activity.”</p>

<p>We had used the term “intrinsic” and “recurrent” interchangeably. We now try to mostly say “intrinsic dynamic” when we talk about the more general phenomenon or recurrent brain dynamic, while using “recurrent connectivity” when we refer to the model parameters A.</p>
<p>We provide now a definition already at the start of the Abstract:</p>
<p>“Sensory stimulation of the brain reverberates in its recurrent neural networks. However, current computational models of brain activity do not separate immediate sensory responses from this intrinsic dynamic.

This model captures the extrinsic effect of the stimulus and separates that from the intrinsic effect of the recurrent brain dynamic.”</p>

<p>- How many filters were used here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>No input filters were used for this simulation:</p>
<p>We used 5 min of “resting state” activity (no added stimulus, simulated at 0.1ms resolution, subsequently downsampled to 100Hz).</p>

<p>c) Intracranial EEG:</p>
<p>- It's not clear how overfitting was measured and how the selection of the number of filters (n_a and n_b) was done.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have removed the statement about overfitting. Mostly the word is used in the context of testing on a separate dataset, which we did not do here. So this “overfitting” can be confusing. Instead we used the analytic p-value as indication that a larger model order is not supported by the data. We write this now as follows:</p>
<p>“Increasing the number of delays <italic>n<sub>a</sub></italic>, increases estimated effect size <italic>R</italic> (Fig. S3A,B), however, larger values lead to fewer significant connections (Fig. S3C). Significance (p-value) is computed analytically, i.e. non-parametrically, based on deviance. Values around <italic>n<sub>a</sub></italic>=6 time delays appear to be the largest model order supported by this statistical analysis.”</p>

<p>- LFP and BHA in C are defined much later in the text, would be useful to define these in the caption. o Shouldn't B (the VARX model parameter) be a 2x3 matrix for different time lags?</p>

<p>Hopefully the following clarifications address both these points:</p>
<p>“C) Example of neural signal y(t) recorded at a single location in the brain. We will analyze local field potentials (LFP) and broad-band high frequency activity (BHA) in separate analyses.  D) Examples of filters <bold>B</bold> for individual feed-forward connections between an extrinsic input and a specific recording location in the brain.”</p>

<p>(6) Discussion:</p>
<p>I could not find Muller et al 2016 listed in the references.</p>

<p>Added. Thanks for catching that omission.</p>
<p>Additional edits prompted by reviewers, but not in the context of any particular comment.</p>
<p>While reviewers did not raise this following point, we felt the need clarify the terminology in the Methods to make sure there is not misunderstanding in the proposed interpretation of the model:</p>
<p>“We will refer to the filters in matrix <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> and as recurrent and feed-forward “connections”, but avoid the use of the word “causal” which can be misleading.”</p>
<p>In addressing questions to Figure 4, we noticed that there is quite a bit of variability across patients, so the analysis for Figure 4 and 7 which combines data across patients now accounts for a random effect of patient (previously we have used mean values for repeated measures). We added the following to the Methods to explain this:</p>
<p>“To compare recurrent connectivity between movies and the resting-state (in Fig. 4), we compute VARX models in four different movie segments of 5 minutes length to match the length of the resting state recording. We use the first and second half of ‘Despicable Me English’, the first half of ‘Inscapes’ and one of the ‘Monkey’ movies. 18 patients include each of these recordings. For each recording in each patient we compute the fraction of significant channels (p&lt;0.001) and average the effect size <italic>R</italic> across all channel pairs, excluding the diagonal. We test the difference between movies and resting-state with linear mixed-effect models with stimulus as fixed effect (movie vs rest), and patient as random effect (to account for the repeated measures for the different video segments), using matlab’s fitlme() routine. For the analysis of asymmetry of recurrent connectivity (in Fig. 4) we also used a mixed-effect model with T1w/T2w ratio as fixed effect and patients as random effect (to account for the repeated measures in multiple brain locations).”</p>
<p>All analyses were rerun with more data (eyes closed resting) and 2 additional patients that have become available since the first submission. Therefore all figures and statistics have been updated throughout the paper. Other than the difference between movies and resting state which was trending before and is now significant, no results changed.</p>
