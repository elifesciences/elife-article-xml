<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Hypoxia-ischemia (HI), which disrupts the oxygen supply-demand balance in the brain by impairing blood oxygen supply and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>), is a leading cause of neonatal brain injury. However, it is unclear how post-HI hypothermia helps to restore the balance, as cooling reduces CMRO<sub>2</sub>. Also, how transient HI leads to secondary energy failure (SEF) in neonatal brains remains elusive. Using photoacoustic microscopy, we examined the effects of HI on CMRO<sub>2</sub> in awake 10-day-old mice, supplemented by bioenergetic analysis of purified cortical mitochondria. Our results show that while HI suppresses ipsilateral CMRO<sub>2</sub>, it sparks a prolonged CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge post-HI, associated with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, superoxide emission, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential necessary for ATP synthesis—indicating oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) uncoupling. Post-HI hypothermia prevents the CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge by constraining oxygen extraction fraction, reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress, and maintains ATP and N-acetylaspartate levels, resulting in attenuated infarction at 24 hours post-HI. Our findings suggest that OXPHOS-uncoupling induced by the post-HI CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge underlies SEF and blocking the surge is a key mechanism of hypothermia protection. Also, our study highlights the potential of optical CMRO<sub>2</sub>-measurements for detecting neonatal HI brain injury and guiding the titration of therapeutic hypothermia at the bedside.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human brain constitutes only 2% of the body mass, but utilizes ∼20% of body’s oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>). Disruptions in cerebral blood flow and oxygen supply cause a spectrum of brain injuries, including adult ischemic stroke and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allen and Brandon, 2011</xref>). In adult ischemic stroke, a &gt;60% reduction in the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>) is indicative of looming infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin and Powers, 2018</xref>). However, the impacts of HIE on cerebral oxygen metabolism are far less certain due to the challenge of measuring CMRO<sub>2</sub> in infant brains by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET). Studies in animal models of HIE have revealed an initial recovery of brain adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels during a short latent period after hypoxia-ischemia (HI), followed by a precipitous decline known as the secondary energy failure (SEF) that signifies looming infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blumberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yager et al., 1992</xref>). However, the mechanisms of post-HI SEF and how therapeutic hypothermia protects neonatal brains against HI injury remain uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gunn et al., 2017</xref>). Also, it is unclear whether CMRO<sub>2</sub>-measurments with recently developed bedside optical instruments, free of MRI’s susceptibility to infant motion and PET’s radiotoxicity, can detect HIE brain injury in a manner similar to adult ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">De Carli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dehaes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferradal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jain et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Mitochondrial bioenergetics is vital to cellular functions and survival, and dysregulated oxidative-phosphorylation (OXPHOS) may promote neonatal HI brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Niatsetskaya et al., 2012</xref>). While the phosphorylation efficiency of mitochondrial respiration (P/O ratio) remains stable over a wide range of substrate concentrations, it declines under hypoxia through a process known as OXPHOS-uncoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kramer and Pearlstein, 1983</xref>), which is indicated by the rise of oxygen consumption despite a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential that is needed for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kristián and Siesjö, 1998</xref>). Although OXPHOS-uncoupling has been implicated in decoupling the contractive strength from oxidative metabolism after cardiac ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benzi and Lerch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Juhaszova et al., 2004</xref>), its role in HIE is unknown. We hypothesized that OXPHOS-uncoupling may be associated with mitochondrial injury in HIE, serving as the cause of post-HI SEF and a target for therapeutic hypothermia.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we applied a head-restrained photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) technique to measure CMRO<sub>2</sub> during and immediately after HI in awake 10-day-old (P10) mice. Using multi-parametric PAM, we simultaneously acquired high-resolution images of cerebral blood flow (CBF), the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (sO<sub>2</sub>), and the total concentration of hemoglobin (C<sub>Hb</sub>), which can be combined to calculate CMRO<sub>2</sub> in absolute values (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref> and see <bold>Methods</bold> for details of the PAM system). The use of awake mouse neonates avoided the confounding effects of anesthesia on CBF and CMRO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sciortino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Slupe and Kirsch, 2018</xref>). In addition, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the membrane potential of mitochondria that were immediately purified from the same cortical area imaged by PAM. This dual-modal analysis enabled a direct comparison of cerebral oxygen metabolism and cortical mitochondrial respiration in the same animal. Moreover, we compared the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on oxygen metabolism and mitochondrial respiration, and correlated the extent of CMRO<sub>2</sub>-reduction with the severity of infarction at 24 hours after HI. Our results suggest that blocking HI-induced OXPHOS-uncoupling is an acute effect of hypothermia and that optical detection of CMRO<sub>2</sub> may have clinical applications in HIE.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Effects of Cooling and Hypoxia on CMRO<sub>2</sub> in Uninjured Mouse Neonates</title>
<p>First, we studied the effects of hypothermia alone on neonatal CMRO<sub>2</sub>. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1A and B</italic></xref>, an awake P10 mouse was placed between the PAM apparatus and a water-floated voluntary treadmill, with the temperature of the water tank above the mouse head adjusted to achieve normothermia or hypothermia based on the skull temperature (<bold><italic>Figure S1</italic></bold>). Note that while the mouse skull was exposed, no craniotomy was necessary. Multi-parametric PAM images over a 5 × 3 mm<sup>2</sup> region from the Bregma to Lambda in both cortices were acquired within 40 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref>). Using this system, we assessed the effects of hypothermia (from 37 °C to 32 °C to 29 °C of the mouse skull temperature) on CMRO<sub>2</sub> in uninjured mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Quantitative analysis revealed a decline in CBF from 38.37 mL/100g/min at 37 °C to 33.18 mL/100g/min at 32 °C (86% of the baseline) and to 22.65 mL/100g/min at 29 °C (59% of the baseline) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref>, left). In contrast, OEF remained unchanged at 32 °C and slightly declined to 85% of the baseline at 29 °C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref>, middle). Consequently, CMRO<sub>2</sub> declined from 2.27 mL/100g/min at 37 °C to 1.97 mL/100g/min at 32 °C (86% of the baseline) and further to 1.13 mL/100g/min at 29 °C (50% of the baseline) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref>, right). These results show that hypothermia reduces CMRO<sub>2</sub> in uninjured mouse neonates, primarily through the suppression of CBF.</p>
<p>Next, we studied the effects of hypoxia alone on neonatal CMRO<sub>2</sub>. Exposing anesthetized P10 mice to hypoxia (10% O<sub>2</sub>) resulted in an increase of CMRO<sub>2</sub> (from 0.91 to 1.51 mL/100g/min), which was attributed to the rise in both CBF (from 24.04 to 30.74 mL/100g/min) and OEF (from 0.17 to 0.29) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1F and G</italic></xref>). While this observation of greater oxygen consumption under a lower oxygen tension is seemingly counterintuitive, it aligns with the previous reports of higher CMRO<sub>2</sub> and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity in mild hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tsuji et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vestergaard et al., 2016</xref>). This phenomenon is presumably due to an increased cerebral energy demand under hypoxia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Effects of Combined HI on CMRO<sub>2</sub> and Mitochondrial Respiration</title>
<p>Then, we studied the effects of combined HI under the Vannucci model, which involves unilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion and transient hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kuan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Using time-lapse PAM, we compared the dynamic changes of CBF, OEF, and CMRO<sub>2</sub> in the two hemicortices from unilateral CCA-ligation to combined HI (40 minutes), and for 2 hours upon returning to normoxia in awake P10 mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2A–D</italic></xref> and <bold><italic>Table S1</italic></bold>).</p>

<p>Before the onset of hypoxia, CCA-ligation alone did not provoke a significant difference in CMRO<sub>2</sub> between the two hemicortices (1.56 <italic>vs.</italic> 1.26 mL/100g/min; <italic>p</italic>-value, 0.6107; the first pair of red and green points in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>). When hypoxia was initiated, however, the contralateral (CL) cortex had a significant increase in CMRO<sub>2</sub>, similar to the responses in uninjured mice, while the CCA-ligated counterpart showed a marked reduction in CMRO<sub>2</sub> (0.78 <italic>vs.</italic> 2.37 mL/100g/min; <italic>p</italic>-value, 0.0011; the second pair of red and green points in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>). Upon switching back to normoxia, CMRO<sub>2</sub> in the CL cortex quickly returned to the pre-hypoxia level and rose slowly afterwards, while CMRO<sub>2</sub> in the ipsilateral (IL) cortex rapidly rebounded above the pre-hypoxia level and remained elevated for at least 2 hours (the last three red and green points in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the causes of the post-HI CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) of the P10 mouse before, during, and after HI to test whether the surge was due to status epilepticus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin and Powers, 2018</xref>). Although showing seizure-like behaviors and a few spike-wave discharges on top of the EEG-suppression during HI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref>, hypoxia), mice only showed a gradual recovery from the suppression without burst discharges on EEG post-HI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref>, normoxia). Thus, the post-HI CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge was not attributed to status epilepticus.</p>
<p>We then isolated the mitochondria from both hemicortices of injured mouse brains at 2 or 5 hours post-HI and from the uninjured (UN) mouse brains for <italic>in-vitro</italic> analysis (see <bold>Materials and Methods</bold> for details of the mitochondrial function analysis). At 2 hours post-HI, mitochondria from the IL cortex showed increased OCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2F</italic></xref> and <bold><italic>Figure S2</italic></bold>) and superoxide (as measured by the MitoSox Red fluorescence, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2G</italic></xref>), but reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (ψ<sub>m</sub>, as measured by the ΔRH-123 fluorescence, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2H</italic></xref>), compared to mitochondria in the CL cortex or the UN brain. By 5 hours post-HI, mitochondria in the IL cortex manifested a lower OCR and ψ<sub>m</sub>, but an even higher superoxide emission, suggesting more substantial mitochondria injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2F–H</italic></xref>). In contrast, mitochondria in the CL cortex at both 2 and 5 hours post-HI showed comparable OCR, superoxide, and ψ<sub>m</sub> to those from the UN brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2F–H</italic></xref>). These results suggest that post-HI CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge can be attributed to OXPHOS-uncoupling and ROS-emission, which may promote mitochondrial injury.</p>

<p>Similar to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>, HI provoked a rise of CMRO<sub>2</sub> in the CL cortex and a decline of CMRO<sub>2</sub> in the IL cortex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref>). Notably, post-HI hypothermia blunted the CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge in the IL cortex, locking it at the pre-HI level throughout the 2-hour monitoring period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref> and <bold><italic>Table S2</italic></bold>). Comparison of the PAM measurements obtained under normothermia <italic>vs.</italic> hypothermia revealed that the chief effect of hypothermia was to block the rise of post-HI OEF rather than reducing CBF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref>), as observed in the uninjured neonates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref>).

<p>Finally, we compared CMRO<sub>2</sub> and brain infarction with or without hypothermia treatment at 24 hours after HI.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acute post-asphyxia HIE around the time of birth remains a major cause of neonatal death and lifelong neurological deficits. Clinical observations and animal studies suggest that brain cells initially recover from the insult during a short latent phase, typically lasting ∼6 hours, but then enter a deterioration phase characterized by progressive failure of oxygen metabolism (i.e., SEF), seizures, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blumberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gunn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Yager et al., 1992</xref>). Acute treatment with mild hypothermia (32–34 °C) prevents the onset of SEF in moderate HIE, but the mechanisms remain unclear for at least two reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gunn et al., 2017</xref>). First, hypothermia normally inhibits instead of enhancing cerebral oxygen metabolism. Second, since mild hypothermia has little effect on the EEG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Erecinska et al., 2003</xref>), which does not support the common notion that it protects through suppression of neuronal activity and cerebral energy demand. In this study we combined PAM-based optical measurement of CMRO<sub>2</sub> and functional assays of acutely purified cortical mitochondria in HI-injured awake mouse neonates to investigate the causes of post-HI SEF and hypothermia protection. Our study has three unique features. First, awake-brain imaging avoids the confounding effects of anesthesia on CBF and CMRO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sciortino et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Slupe and Kirsch, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, our PAM-based CMRO<sub>2</sub>-measurement is analogous to optical CMRO<sub>2</sub>-detection using bedside instruments that may enable non-invasive monitoring of neonatal brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">De Carli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dehaes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferradal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>). Third, our experiments establish a direct connection between the impacts of HI on CMRO<sub>2</sub> and that on mitochondria, which account for the majority of cerebral oxygen metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rolfe and Brown, 1997</xref>). In the following, we discuss the implications of our findings on the cause of post-HI SEF, the protective mechanisms of hypothermia in HI, and the potential of optic CMRO<sub>2</sub>-detection in neonatal care.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Causes of post-HI SEF: uncoupled OXPHOS and excessive ROS</title>
<p>In normal conditions, CMRO<sub>2</sub> remains relatively stable over a range of CBF and brain glucose-uptake changes as the so-called “uncoupling of CBF and cerebral oxygen metabolism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fox and Raichle, 1986</xref>). The autoregulation of CMRO<sub>2</sub>, accomplished by alterations of OEF (an index of oxygen diffusion across capillaries) in the opposite direction of CBF fluctuations, maintains a consistent level of mitochondrial respiration, while glycolysis and phosphocreatine-creatine conversion support the transient outbursts of neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin and Powers, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>As illustrated by our PAM measurements in unilateral CCA-ligation, the IL cortex showed OEF-elevation to compensate for a lower CBF than the CL cortex and maintained bilaterally similar CMRO<sub>2</sub> values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, and <bold><italic>Table S1</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>S2</italic></bold>). During combined HI, the CL cortex showed up-regulation of both CBF and OEF and produced a higher CMRO<sub>2</sub>, similar to the responses to moderate hypoxia (10% O<sub>2</sub>) in uninjured animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref>). These responses suggest a greater demand of brain energy as adaptation to hypoxia. In contrast, the IL cortex showed a smaller increase of CBF and mild or no changes of OEF in combined HI, leading to a 40–50% reduction in CMRO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, and <bold><italic>Table S1</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>S2</italic></bold>). Consistent with our findings, previous studies showed marked reduction of ATP and phosphocreatine, as well as a massive buildup of lactate, in the IL cortex during combined HI, while the CL cortex showed only minimal ATP-reduction and modest accumulation of lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gunn et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Salford and Siesjö, 1974</xref>). The bilateral disparity of ATP homeostasis-versus-reduction during combined HI may influence the divergent CMRO<sub>2</sub> responses post-HI: the CL cortex showed CMRO<sub>2</sub> recovery to the pre-HI level because extra ATP-output is no longer required to cope with hypoxia, while the IL cortex developed a surge of mitochondrial respiration (and thus CMRO<sub>2</sub>) presumably to recompense the energy deficit incurred during HI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref><bold><italic> and </italic></bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Persistent increase in oxygen consumption, albeit to a lesser degree, was also observed in post-ischemic myocardium and after spreading depression in rodent cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benzi and Lerch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Juhaszova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Piilgaard and Lauritzen, 2009</xref>). Moreover, brain-injured infants showed a higher CMRO<sub>2</sub> than healthy neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grant et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that the rebound of oxygen metabolism is a generic response to transient severe HI. Notably, our PAM measurements showed that the rise of post-HI CMRO<sub>2</sub> is primarily driven by the increase of OEF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref> and <bold><italic>Table S1</italic></bold>), which may be due to reduction of capillary transient time heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Paulson et al., 2010</xref>). The HI-induced energy deficit and tissue hypoxia may also assist oxygen diffusion across capillaries to elevate the OEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Salford and Siesjö, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yang et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, post-HI acidosis may also promote mitochondrial respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jespersen and Østergaard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Khacho et al., 2014</xref>). We suggest that these cellular and vascular factors collectively promote mitochondrial respiration and CMRO<sub>2</sub> immediately after HI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Schematic conclusion and open questions.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Combined hypoxia-ischemia (HI) initially suppresses cerebral oxygen metabolism, but sparks a rapid rebound and overshoot of post-HI CMRO<sub>2</sub> caused by uncoupled OXPHOS with greater ROS emission, which leads to the demise of mitochondria and the onset of secondary energy failure (SEF). In contrast, recovery at hypothermia attenuates the post-HI surge of mitochondrial respiration and produces more enduring cerebral oxygen metabolism. The threshold of CMRO<sub>2</sub>-reduction that causes brain infarction in neonates is expected to exist but yet to be established. (<bold>B</bold>) The combination of energy deficit and tissue acidosis accumulated during HI plus increased glucose-uptake and glycolysis acutely after HI stimulates uncoupled OPXHOS in the HI-injured neonatal brain, leading to excessive ROS emission and rapid mitochondrial injury. According to the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berntman et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hägerdal et al., 1975</xref>) and our results, hypothermia may interrupt this pathological process by inhibiting glycolysis and the TCA cycle.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="470404v2_fig5.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>However, the post-HI mitochondrial respiration has features of OXPHOS uncoupling and ROS release, as shown by the rise of oxygen consumption and mitochondrial superoxide despite the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential needed for ATP-synthesis through F0/F1 ATPase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2F–H</italic></xref>). The triggers of OXPHOS uncoupling after HI may include persistent tissue hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kramer and Pearlstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kuan et al., 2021</xref>), influx of calcium in the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benzi and Lerch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kristián and Siesjö, 1998</xref>), reverse electron transfer through Complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), nitric oxide-mediated inhibition of the cytochrome oxidase in Complex IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cooper and Giulivi, 2007</xref>), and ROS-caused disruption of the electron transport chain super-complexes and mitochondrial cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Paradies et al., 2018</xref>), according to the literature and our results (<bold><italic>Figure S4</italic></bold>). Importantly, the release of extra ROS during uncoupled OXPHOS injures the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Granger and Kvietys, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Murphy, 2009</xref>), as indicated by the reduction of oxygen consumption and mitochondrial membrane potential at 5 hours post-HI, if without hypothermia treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2F–H</italic></xref>). These results suggest that uncoupled OXPHOS and ROS-mediated injury of mitochondria are important mechanisms of post-HI SEF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref>).</p>

<title>Protective mechanisms of hypothermia</title>
<p>If the aforementioned hypothesis is correct, therapeutic hypothermia shall attenuate the post-HI CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge. Indeed, our data showed that the initiation of mild hypothermia (32 °C) post-HI efficiently clamped the rebounding CMRO<sub>2</sub> to the pre-HI level at both hemicortices over the 2-hour PAM-monitoring period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3D</italic></xref>). Furthermore, hypothermia blocked the rapid demise of mitochondria at 5 hours post-HI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3F–I</italic></xref>) and preserved cortical ATPs at 6 hours post-HI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3J</italic></xref>). In other words, neonatal mice recovering under mild hypothermia after HI escaped the initial overshoot of CMRO<sub>2</sub> and the subsequent SEF, as predicted by our hypothesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of mechanism, our PAM measurements showed that hypothermia mainly blocks the rise of post-HI OEF to constrain CMRO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref> and <bold><italic>Table S2</italic></bold>). This is different from the responses to mild hypothermia (32 °C) in uninjured mice, which showed CBF-reduction but negligible changes in OEF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref>). This difference suggests unique effects of hypothermia in the post-HI brain. Previous studies showed that mild hypothermia represses glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle at the phosphofructokinase and isocitrate dehydrogenase step, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Berntman et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hägerdal et al., 1975</xref>). Consequently, the buildup of lactate and acidosis and the electron transport chain reactions in OXPHOS are attenuated, which may repress post-HI mitochondrial respiration and prevent SEF and brain injury according to our hypothesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Whether hypothermia reduces post-HI brain glucose-uptake, however, remains unclear. Although previous studies showed a reverse correlation of cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglu) and the severity of HIE in neonates at 4–24 days of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Thorngren-Jerneck et al., 2001</xref>), the responses of CMRglu in the acute post-HI phase remain unknown. If post-HI CMRglu is similarly up-regulated due to energy deficit, the influx of glucose and the ensuing glycolysis may stimulate mitochondrial respiration to produce greater ROS injury, while hypothermia typically represses CMRglu and could reduce HI injury in this scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Erecinska et al., 2003</xref>). Future studies are thus warranted to examine the impacts of HI with or without hypothermia treatment on CMRglu in mouse neonates.</p>

<title>Optical CMRO<sub>2</sub> detection in neonatal care</title>
<p>Early detection of brain injury in neonatal care has profound importance for early intervention, treatment optimization, and outcome prognostication. Although MRI is the gold standard for detecting acute brain injury, its application in early diagnosis and HIE therapy is hampered by non-portability, high cost, and susceptibility to motion. In contrast, advances in combined near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) have enabled optical CMRO<sub>2</sub> detection as a non-invasive, bedside procedure in neonatal care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">De Carli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dehaes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferradal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jain et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2014a</xref>). This is owing to the relatively thin infant skull compared to that of adults and the separation of anterior and posterior fontanelle sutures, which facilitate the penetration of infrared light to quantify the brain tissue oxygenation. The combination of NIRS-based cerebral oximetry and DCS-based CBF mapping in the same area enables quantitative measurements of the regional CMRO<sub>2</sub> index or CMRO<sub>2i</sub>. The NIRS/DCS-measured CMRO<sub>2i</sub> correlates well with the MRI-measured CMRO<sub>2</sub> in neonates and declines during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dehaes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ferradal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jain et al., 2014</xref>). A phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02815618) is underway to determine the safety of NIRS/DCS and the normal CMRO<sub>2i</sub> in newborn infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">De Carli et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, our PAM technique is analogous to NIR/DCS, and both methods measure CMRO<sub>2</sub> in the cortical layers. Moreover, a past NIR/DCS study suggested increased cerebral oxygen consumption in infants with HIE symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Grant et al., 2009</xref>), which echoes our findings. Thus, our results may shed insights into the utility of optical CMRO<sub>2</sub> detection in neonatal care.</p>
<p>In adult ischemic stroke patients, CMRO<sub>2</sub> can be used to differentiate the infarct core and the adjacent penumbra area, where brain cells are energy-strained but remain salvageable if local blood oxygen supply is restored promptly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin and Powers, 2018</xref>). The cut-off for “salvageable penumbra” is usually at &lt;60% reduction of CMRO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). Our results showed that HI-injured mouse neonates preserved 85% of CMRO<sub>2</sub> at 24 hours post-HI if recovered under mild hypothermia (32 °C), but lost ∼75% of CMRO<sub>2</sub> without this treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4G</italic></xref>). Further, the severity of CMRO<sub>2</sub>-reduction at 24 hours correlate with infarction, as shown by the results of TTC-stain immediately after PAM-imaging (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4B and C</italic></xref>). These results suggest that a minimal level of CMRO<sub>2</sub> to prevent infarction may also exist in infants after HI, as in adults after ischemic stroke, despite that the normal CMRO<sub>2</sub> in infants is lower than that in adults and may differ between term and preterm neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Altman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2014b</xref>). Since NIRS/DCS-based CMRO<sub>2i</sub> measurement is a non-invasive procedure, it can be performed repeatedly to detect early brain injury through the trajectory of CMRO<sub>2i</sub> alterations in neonates with clinical HIE symptoms.</p>

<title>Multi-parametric PAM System</title>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref>, a nanosecond-pulsed laser (wavelength: 532 nm, repetition rate: up to 30 kHz; BX40-2-G, EdgeWave) was used in the PAM system for imaging the neonatal mouse brain. The laser beam firstly passed through a half-wave plate (HWP; WPH05M-532, Thorlabs) and an electro-optical modulator (EOM; 350-80, Conoptics) for precise control of the polarization state of the incident beam. By alteration of the voltage applied to the EOM, the polarization state could be dynamically switched between the vertical direction and the horizontal direction, which allowed a polarizing beam splitter (PBS; PBS121, Thorlabs) to dispatch the laser pulses between two optical paths through either reflection or transmission. In the reflection path, after being partially attenuated by a neutral-density filter (NDF; NDC-50C-2M, Thorlabs), the beam was coupled through a fiber collimator (CFC-11X-A, Thorlabs) into a polarization-maintaining single-mode fiber (PM-SMF; F-SPA, Newport) for stimulated Raman scattering-based wavelength conversion. The output of the PM-SMF was collimated by an identical collimator and purified by a bandpass filter (BPF; FB560-10, Thorlabs) to isolate the 558-nm component. Then, the 558-nm Raman beam generated in the reflection path and the 532-nm beam in the transmission path were combined by a dichroic mirror (DBS; FF538-FDi01, Semrock) and coupled into a single-mode fiber (SMF; P1-460B-FC-2, Thorlabs) through a fiber collimator (CFC-11X-A, Thorlabs), before which ∼5% of the combined beam was picked off by a beam sampler (BS; BSF10-A, Thorlabs) and monitored by a high-speed photodiode (PD; FDS100, Thorlabs) to compensate for possible fluctuation in the laser energy. The dual-wavelength laser beam was then delivered to the scanning head, where two identical doublets (DL; AC127-025-A, Thorlabs) were used to map the fiber output into the tissue to be imaged, and a correction lens (CL; LA1207-A, Thorlabs) was used to compensate for the optical aberration at the air-water interface. A ring-shaped ultrasonic transducer (UT; inner diameter: 2.2 mm; outer diameter: 4.0 mm; center frequency: 35 MHz; 6-dB bandwidth: 70%) was used for confocal alignment of the optical excitation and ultrasonic detection. A customized water tank (WT) was used to immerse the ultrasonic transducer for acoustic coupling. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref>, the mouse head was fixed to a customized metal arm-piece through a wearable 3-D printed head plate for head-restrained awake-brain imaging. A water-floated treadmill (03170-1008, Blick Art Materials) was used to allow the mouse to move freely with reduced reaction force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cao et al., 2017</xref>). A gas inlet and a customized face mask from syringe were used to deliver the inhalation gas (<italic>i.e.,</italic> normoxia or hypoxia).</p>

<title>Procedures for PAM Imaging</title>
<p>Before imaging of the neonatal mouse brain, the animal was first anesthetized with vaporized isoflurane (EZ-SA800, E-Z Systems) for installation of the head-restraint plastic head plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sciortino et al., 2021</xref>). Hair on the mouse scalp was removed by a trimmer (9990-1301, Wahl Clipper), and then the scalp was removed with surgical scissors (MDS10030, Medline Industries) to expose the skull. After the clearance of the blood, debris, and remaining hairs, the gel-based cyanoacrylate glue (234790, Loctite) was applied to all edges of the head plate, which was attached to the center of the skull between the Bregma and Lambda. After the applied glue is solidified (∼20 min), the frame-worn animal was carefully moved to the treadmill and secured to the metal arm-piece with two #4–40 screws. Throughout the frame installation, the body temperature of the mouse was maintained at 37 °C using a homeothermic monitoring system (No. 69020, RWD life science).</p>
<p>After the installation of the head-restraint head plate, a thin layer (∼1 mm) of ultrasound gel (Aquasonic CLEAR<sup>®</sup>, Parker Laboratories) was applied to the surface of the skull for effective acoustic coupling. Then, the metal arm-piece and the treadmill were carefully raised to bring the gel in gentle contact with the bottom of the water tank, which was filled with temperature-maintained deionized water. After fully recovering from the anesthesia, the neonatal mouse was ready for awake-brain imaging by the multi-parametric PAM system, which was controlled by a field-programmable gate array (PCIe-7841R, National Instruments) through a self-developed LabVIEW program. For the imaging field covering both hemicortices between the Bregma and Lambda of the neonatal mouse (5 × 3 mm<sup>2</sup> as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref>), the acquisition time is ∼40 minutes with step sizes set to 0.1 and 10 µm along the <italic>x</italic>-and <italic>y</italic>-direction, respectively.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>PAM Imaging under Normothermia or Hypothermia</title>
<p>The temperature of the water tank was controlled by a temperature controller (EW-89802-52, Cole-Parmer), which could also be used to effectively regulate the temperature of the underlying mouse skull. Based on our calibration experiment (<bold><italic>Figure S1</italic></bold>), the normothermia condition (37 °C) could be achieved with the water temperature set to 39 °C; while for the two hypothermia conditions (32 °C or 29 °C), the water temperature was set to 33 °C or 29 °C, respectively.</p>
<p>Throughout all the experiments, the skull temperature was closely monitored by a thin-film temperature sensor (F3132, Omega) attached to the skull. Note that the PAM measurements were performed one hour after each temperature adjustment to ensure equilibrium under the new temperature setting.</p>

<title>PAM Imaging under Normoxia or Hypoxia</title>
<p>For normoxia, the oxygen concentration in the inhalation gas was 21% (AI M-T, Praxair). For hypoxia, the medical-grade air was mixed with medical-grade nitrogen gas (NI-H, Praxair) through a gas flowmeter mixer (EW-03218-56, Cole-Parmer) to achieve a reduced oxygen concentration of 10%, which was confirmed by a clinical anesthesia monitor (Capnomac Ultima, Datex-Ohmeda). Under both conditions, the flow rate of the inhalation gas was set to 1.5 L/min.</p>

<title>HR-MAS NMR Study</title>
<p>The <italic>ex-vivo</italic> NMR experiments and analyses of mice brain tissues were performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, a 1.5-mm punch (∼10 mg) was taken from snap-frozen brain tissue and loaded into a sample rotor (4 mm ZrO<sub>2</sub>, Bruker Instruments), with 4 μL of deuterium oxide containing 100 mM sodium trimethylsilylpropionate-d4 (TSP, Sigma-Aldrich) added to obtain a frequency-lock signal and serve as an internal standard for chemical shift. HR-MAS NMR experiments were then carried out on an NMR spectrometer (AVANCE 400 WB, Bruker) with a dedicated 4 mm HR-MAS probe. Spinning rate of samples was set to 2500 kHz (± 2 Hz) at 4 °C. A T2-weighted, water-suppressed Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequence was used to acquire the data. The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra were recorded using key parameters as follows: repetition time of 2.0 seconds, spectral width of 4.8 kHz, 32K data points, and 256 transients.

<title>Assessment of Isolated Brain Mitochondrial Function</title>
<p>Mitochondria were isolated from the brain tissues using Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Caspersen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Niatsetskaya et al., 2012</xref>). Mitochondrial respiration was measured by a Clark-type electrode (Oxytherm, Hansatech). Briefly, 0.05 mg mitochondria protein were added into 0.5 mL respiration buffer at pH 7.2, which consists of 200 mM sucrose, 25 mM KCl, 2 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mg/mL of BSA, 30 µM P<sup>1</sup>, P<sup>5</sup>-di(adenosine 5’)-pentaphosphate (Ap5A), 10 mM glutamate, and 5 mM malate at 32°C, with the addition of 5 mM succinate to trigger respiration. As shown in <bold><italic>Figure S2</italic></bold>, to initiate State 3 phosphorylating respiration, 100 nmol of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was added to the mitochondrial suspension.</p>
<p>The rate of O<sub>2</sub> consumption was presented in nmol O<sub>2</sub>/mg mitochondrial protein/min. The respiratory control ratio was calculated as the ratio of the State 3 respiration rate versus the State 4 resting respiration rate recorded after the phosphorylation of ADP has been finished. 35 nM 2’-4’ Dinitrophenol (DNP) was used to initiate uncoupled respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The rate of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> emission from isolated mitochondria was measured using a fluorescence assay by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc), which was set at 555-nm excitation and 581-nm emission as previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Starkov and Fiskum, 2003</xref>). Briefly, 0.05 mg mitochondria were added into 1 mL respiration buffer and supplemented with 5 mM succinate, 10 µM Amplex Ultrared (Catalog No. A22180, Invitrogen), and 4 U/mL horse radish peroxidase (HRP). After recording the fluorescence for 400 seconds, samples were added with 1 µM rotenone, then added with 1µg/mL antimycin A after another 200 seconds. The calibration curve was calculated by sequential additions of known amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, with the cuvette containing the respiration buffer, Amplex Ultrared, and HRP.</p>
<p>Superoxide was monitored with MitoSOX Red (Catalog No. M36008, Invitrogen). Briefly, 5 µM MitoSOX Red was added to the cuvettes and the fluorescence was measured at 510-nm excitation and 579-nm emission wavelengths. Time-dependent monitoring of the MitoSOX Red-related fluorescence was done using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc) at 25 °C. Since a saturation of kinetics established after 25 minutes of the recording, the initial linear increase rates of the MitoSOX Red-related fluorescence were used for quantification.</p>
<p>For membrane potential analysis, the rhodamine 123 (RH-123; Sigma-Aldrich) quenching technique was conducted. 0.05 mg isolated mitochondria were incubated with 0.3 mM RH-123 and analyzed by a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi High Technologies America, Inc), using excitation and emission wavelengths of 503 nm and 527 nm, respectively. During the measurements, the reaction buffer containing mitochondria was continuously stirred.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reveals a novel mechanism by which hypoxia-ischemia damages the neonatal brain and how hypothermia protects from brain injury. The paper presents an interesting combination of state-of-the-art optical measurements, mitochondrial assays, and the use of various control experiments providing <bold>solid</bold> evidence for the derived conclusions. Reviewers caution that possible adverse effects of prolonged anesthesia, as well as pain and stress after a major surgical procedure might influence the outcomes and should be carefully considered. This work will be of interest to the fields of hypoxia and brain metabolism research.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript addresses an important problem of the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation due to hypoxia-ischemia injury of the neonatal brain and provides insight into the neuroprotective mechanisms of hypothermia treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a combination of in vivo imaging of awake P10 mice and experiments on isolated mitochondria to assess various key parameters of the brain metabolism during hypoxia-ischemia with and without hypothermia treatment. This unique approach resulted in a comprehensive data set that provides solid evidence for the derived conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The experiments were performed acutely on the same day when the surgery was performed. There is a possibility that the physiology of mice at the time of imaging was still affected by the previously applied anesthesia. This is particularly of concern since the duration of anesthesia was relatively long. Is it possible that the observed relatively low baseline OEF (~20%) and trends of increased OEF and CBF over several hours after the imaging start were partially due to slow recovery from prolonged anesthesia? The potential effects of long exposure to anesthesia before imaging experiments were not discussed.</p>
<p>(2) The Methods Section does not provide information about drugs administered to reduce the pain. If pain was not managed, mice could be experiencing significant pain during experiments in the awake state after the surgery. Since the imaging sessions were long (my impression based on information from the manuscript is that imaging sessions were ~4 hours long or even longer), the level of pain was also likely to change during the experiments. It was not discussed how significant and potentially evolving pain during imaging sessions could have affected the measurements (e.g., blood flow and CMRO2). If mice received pain management during experiments, then it was not discussed if there are known effects of used drugs on CBF, CMRO2, and lesion size after 24 hr.</p>
<p>(3) Animals were imaged in the awake state, but they were not previously trained for the imaging procedure with head restraint. Did animals receive any drugs to reduce stress? Our experience with well-trained young-adult as well as old mice is that they can typically endure 2 and sometimes up to 3 hours of head-restrained awake imaging with intermittent breaks for receiving the rewards before showing signs of anxiety. We do not have experience with imaging P10 mice in the awake state. Is it possible that P10 mice were significantly stressed during imaging and that their stress level changed during the imaging session? This concern about the potential effects of stress on the various measured parameters was not discussed.</p>
<p>(4) The temperature of the skull was measured during the hypothermia experiment by lowering the water temperature in the water bath above the animal's head. Considering high metabolism and blood flow in the cortex, it could be challenging to predict cortical temperature based on the skull temperature, particularly in the deeper part of the cortex.</p>
<p>(5) The map of estimated CMRO2 (Fig. 4B) looks very heterogeneous across the brain surface. Is it a coincidence that the highest CMRO2 is observed within the central part of the field of view? Is there previous evidence that CMRO2 in these parts of the mouse cortex could vary a few folds over a 1-2 mm distance?</p>
<p>(6) The justification for using P10 mice in the experiments has not been well presented in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(7) It was not discussed how the observations made in this manuscript could be affected by the potential discrepancy between the developmental stages of P10 mice and human babies regarding cellular metabolism and neurovascular coupling</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, authors have hypothesized that mitochondrial injury in HIE is caused by OXPHOS-uncoupling, which is the cause of secondary energy failure in HI. In addition, therapeutic hypothermia rescues secondary energy failure. The methodologies used are state-of-the art and include PAM technique in live animal , bioenergetic studies in the isolated mitochondria, and others.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is comprehensive and impressive. The article is well written and statistical analyses are appropriate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript does not discuss the limitation of this animal model study in view of the clinical scenario of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.</p>
<p>(2) I see many studies on Pubmed on bioenergetics and HI. Hence, it is unclear what is novel and what is known.</p>
<p>(3) What are the limitations of ex-vivo mitochondrial studies?</p>
<p>(4) PAM technique limits the resolution of the image beyond 500-750 micron depth. Assessing basal ganglia may not be possible with this approach.</p>
<p>(5) Hypothermia in present study reduces the brain temperature from 37 to 29-32 degree centigrade. In clinical set up, head temp is reduced to 33-34.5 in neonatal hypoxia ischemia. Hence a drop in temperature to 29 degrees is much lower relative to the clinical practice. How the present study with greater drop in head temperature can be interpreted for understanding the pathophysiology of therapeutic hypothermia in neonatal HIE. Moreover, in HIE model using higher temperature of 37 and dropping to 29 seems to be much different than the clinical scenario. Please discuss.</p>
<p>(6) NMR was assessed ex-vivo. How does it relate to in vivo assessment. Infants admitted in Neonatal intensive Care Unit, frequently get MRI with spectroscopy. How do the MRS findings in human newborns with HIE correlate with the ex-vivo evaluation of metabolites.</p>

<p>Sun et al. present a comprehensive study using a novel photoacoustic microscopy setup and mitochondrial analysis to investigate the impact of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) on brain metabolism and the protective role of therapeutic hypothermia. The authors elegantly demonstrate three connected findings: (1) HI initially suppresses brain metabolism, (2) subsequently triggers a metabolic surge linked to oxidative phosphorylation uncoupling and brain damage, and (3) therapeutic hypothermia mitigates HI-induced damage by blocking this surge and reducing mitochondrial stress.</p>
<p>The study's design and execution are great, with a clear presentation of results and methods. Data is nicely presented, and methodological details are thorough.</p>
<p>However, a minor concern is the extensive use of abbreviations, which can hinder readability. As all the abbreviations are introduced in the text, their overuse may render the text hard to read to non-specialist audiences. Additionally, sharing the custom Matlab and other software scripts online, particularly those used for blood vessel segmentation, would be a valuable resource for the scientific community. In addition, while the study focuses on the short-term effects of HI, exploring the long-term consequences and definitively elucidating HI's impact on mitochondria would further strengthen the manuscript's impact.</p>
<p>Despite these minor points, this manuscript is very interesting.</p>
