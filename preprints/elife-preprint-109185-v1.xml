<abstract>
<p>The cognitive mechanisms linking chronic pain to motivational symptoms remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that individuals with chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD), a common cause of chronic pain, exhibit a specific deficit in adaptive learning in uncertain environments, characterized by failure to reduce uncertainty over time and maintain efficient learning rates. Using a probabilistic reward task, we pioneered the application of a novel volatile Kalman filter to model behavior in 26 TMD participants and 39 matched controls, uniquely tracking trial-wise updates in uncertainty, volatility, and learning rate. Although surface-level performance did not differ across groups, model-based analysis revealed that those with TMD failed to reduce uncertainty and adapt their learning over time. TMD participants also reported significantly greater apathy, depression, and pain catastrophizing, as well as lower health-related quality of life. Mediation analysis confirmed that impaired uncertainty adaptation partially mediated the relationship specifically between TMD and apathy. These findings identify a computational signature of disrupted uncertainty adaptation in people with TMD and provide evidence for a mechanistic link between chronic pain and motivational dysfunction. This work lays a foundation for future studies examining how belief-updating deficits contribute to broader affective and cognitive symptoms in chronic pain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chronic pain affects 21% of the population and causes substantial morbidity and disability. Although often treated as peripheral in origin, a growing body of evidence suggests that chronic pain involves central mechanisms linked to emotion, cognition, and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Apkarian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baliki and Apkarian, 2015</xref>). In particular, perceptions of uncertainty may play an important role in the burden experienced by people with chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brown et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Wiech and Tracey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Yoshida et al., 2013</xref>). Uncertainty about diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment efficacy can amplify pain perception, increase anxiety, and lead to maladaptive coping mechanisms. For many patients, not knowing what causes their symptoms or when pain might intensify creates a state of hypervigilance that can exacerbate muscle tension and pain. This uncertainty often leads to catastrophizing thoughts, where patients anticipate the worst possible outcomes, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of stress and pain that can leave patients feeling helpless and apathetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Quartana et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Vlaeyen and Linton, 2000</xref>). Clinicians working with people who have chronic pain have long known that addressing altered perceptions of these uncertainties may help reduce anxiety and improve outcomes.</p>
    <p>One particularly disabling form of chronic pain, temporomandibular disorders (TMD), affects 5% to 10% of the population and is the second most common cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine et al., 2020</xref>). Anxiety and depression, conditions associated with low motivation, are found in 20-60% of patients with TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">De La Torre Canales et al., 2018</xref>), similar to the prevalence rates seen in chronic pain more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aaron et al., 2025</xref>). Patients with TMD exhibit executive function deficits related to the functional disconnection of the cognitive, motivational, and affective areas of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Weissman-Fogel et al., 2011</xref>). Whether these deficits reflect generalized impairment or disruption in specific cognitive processes that represent potential therapeutic targets remains unknown despite the use of cognitive behavioral therapy as a standard treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Shivakumar et al., 2025</xref>). Previously, we found that perceptions of uncertainty influence motivation levels in a large normative sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Yan et al., 2025</xref>). Here we provide behavioral and computational evidence that individuals with TMD exhibit a core deficit in adaptive learning in response to uncertainty, which contributes to motivational dysfunction, particularly apathy.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We recruited 26 individuals with chronic TMD (age±SD=33.69±14.45) and 40 healthy controls (age±SD = 32.60±13.68). One control participant reported unexpectedly high pain (VAS=68/100) despite no diagnosed pain conditions and was excluded as an outlier, yielding a final control sample of 39 participants (age±SD=32.75±13.81). After exclusion, control participants showed minimal pain levels (VAS=6.44±9.76) compared to TMD participants (VAS=36.58±20.64, t(63)=7.91, p&lt;0.001). All TMD participants had a muscle pain diagnosis (9 local myalgia, 17 myofascial pain with referral), and 96% had a joint pain diagnosis (7 unilateral, 18 bilateral arthralgia). The distribution of Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) was I=11 (42%), II= (27%), III=6 (23%), and IV=2 (8%), which is similar to the distribution in U.S. dental practice settings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Velly et al., 2022</xref>) and is composed of primarily mild to moderate severity. Participants completed a 300-trial three-armed bandit task (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Method) designed to probe learning under uncertainty. Participants with TMD reported higher pain at baseline (t(63)=7.91, p&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) and completed self-report assessments of apathy, mood, and pain catastrophizing (details see Method). Task behavior was analyzed using a volatile Kalman filter model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Method), which estimates latent learning parameters on a trial-by-trial basis.</p>

<title>TMD participants failed to adapt to uncertainty</title>
<p>Although participants with TMD performed similarly (all p &gt; 0.400, see Method) to healthy controls in model-free measures (e.g., accuracy, performance, win-stay/lose-shift), model-based analyses revealed persistent deficits in learning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Compared to controls (HC), participants with TMD failed to reduce their uncertainty estimates and adapt their learning rates over time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Regression analysis showed that controls decreased their learning rates over time, with significant negative slopes in uncertainty and volatility estimates (all p&lt;0.001), while TMD participants exhibited flat or non-significant trajectories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D–F</xref>). This pattern suggests TMD participants maintain a chronically heightened sensitivity to environmental changes. First, they fail to decrease their estimate of environmental volatility despite substantial experience. Second, they maintain high uncertainty about reward expectations throughout the experiment. Third, their persistently elevated learning rates indicate that they continually prioritize recent feedback over prior beliefs. This computational signature resembles a trauma-like state where the individual anticipates ongoing volatility and remains hypervigilant to environmental changes. Such a persistent state of uncertainty about the environment may undermine the ability to form stable expectations, contributing to learned helplessness and apathy observed in chronic pain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Samwel et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To ensure the robustness of these findings, we also tested exponential decay models (see Methods &amp; Table S2 for details). This analysis revealed that TMD participants not only failed to show expected exponential decay but often exhibited paradoxical patterns. For volatility, 82% of controls showed adaptive exponential decay versus only 42% of TMD participants (Fisher’s exact p = 0.001), with 39% of TMD participants showing exponential growth. The decay rate parameter for uncertainty differed significantly between groups (HC: b = -0.00094 vs TMD: b = +0.00012, two-sample t test, p = 0.002), with TMD’s positive value indicating increasing uncertainty over time. For learning rate, 69% of controls versus 35% of TMD participants showed adaptive decay (Fisher’s exact p = 0.01). These converging analyses, whether using linear slopes or exponential parameters, demonstrate that TMD participants exhibit qualitatively aberrant learning trajectories incompatible with adaptive uncertainty processing.</p>
<p>Together, this computational profile, where uncertainty remained unchanged rather than resolved with experience, aligns with predictive-processing (Bayesian) accounts of pain that emphasize aberrant precision (uncertainty) weighting and misestimation of environmental volatility, and with evidence that people learn the statistics of pain in Bayesian-like ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Onysk et al., 2024</xref>). It is also consistent with patients’ lived reports that chronic pain is increasingly unpredictable, which fosters ongoing uncertainty in day-to-day functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Little et al., 2025</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Uncertainty learning dynamics predict psychological outcomes in TMD participants</title>
<p>To assess the clinical relevance of these findings, we examined the psychiatric symptom burden across groups. TMD participants showed significantly higher apathy (Apathy Motivation Index, t(63)=-3.63, p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ang et al., 2017</xref>), depression (PHQ-9, t(63)=-6,63, p&lt;0.001), pain catastrophizing scores (t(63)=-4.15, p&lt;0.001), and lower quality of life (EQ-5D; t(63)=-3.70, p&lt;0.001, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Mediation analysis demonstrated that reduced uncertainty adaptation significantly mediated the relationship between TMD status and apathy indirect effect (ab), effect = 0.175, 95%CI = [0.006, 0.484], 5000 sample bootstrap) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that disrupted uncertainty learning may underlie motivational symptoms in chronic TMD pain. We did not find any other significant mediation results for PHQ-9 (95%CI = [-0.153, 0.283]), Pain Catastrophizing score (95%CI = [-0.123, 0.395]), or EQ-5D (95%CI = [-0.003, 0.447]).</p>

<p>The selective mediation of apathy, but not depression or pain catastrophizing, by uncertainty adaptation deficits reveals a specific computational pathway linking chronic pain to motivational dysfunction. This persistent uncertainty state mirrors the clinical phenomenology of chronic pain, where patients cannot predict when symptoms will worsen, which may lead to learned helplessness and withdrawal.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings identify a computational mechanism that links chronic pain to apathy: impaired adaptation of uncertainty over time. Healthy controls reduced volatility and uncertainty with experience, showing robust exponential decay, whereas participants with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) often failed to reduce uncertainty, and nearly 40% showed paradoxical increases in volatility or uncertainty. This qualitative breakdown suggests that the pain state disrupts belief updating itself, not merely the pace of learning. Such results align with predictive-processing accounts of pain, which propose that maladaptive precision-weighting of sensory and contextual signals sustains hypervigilance and unpredictability(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Apkarian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Wiech and Tracey, 2009</xref>). Clinically, patients often describe their pain as arising “out of nowhere,” and our findings provide a computational basis for this lived experience.</p>
<p>Mediation analysis further underscored the specificity of this mechanism. Impaired uncertainty adaptation predicted apathy, but not depression, catastrophizing, or quality of life. Apathy is frequently conflated with depression, yet evidence points to distinct neural substrates(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Husain and Roiser, 2018</xref>). Our results extend this dissociation into chronic pain, highlighting apathy as the behavioral outcome most directly tied to uncertainty misestimation and suggesting it may serve as a mechanistic bridge between disrupted learning and functional disability.</p>
<p>At the same time, surface performance was preserved. TMD participants tracked rewards above chance, exploited optimal options, and showed normal win–stay/lose–shift behavior. Their impairment emerged only at the computational level, where latent learning parameters failed to adapt. This dissociation explains how patients can appear cognitively intact while struggling with motivation. Together, these findings reframe motivational symptoms in chronic pain as arising from domain-general failures of belief updating rather than nociception or mood symptoms alone. They also suggest a testable therapeutic direction: interventions that recalibrate uncertainty, through cognitive-behavioral strategies or neuromodulation of prefrontal–striatal circuits, may help restore adaptive learning and motivation in patients with chronic pain.</p>

<title>Three-armed restless bandit task</title>
<p>In this three-armed restless bandit task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ebitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Yan et al., 2025</xref>), participants completed 200 trials where they freely selected between three targets on each trial to earn potential rewards of 1 point. Each target is associated with a hidden reward probability that randomly and independently changes throughout the task. We seeded each participant’s reward probability randomly to prevent biases due to particular kinds of environments. Specifically, on each correct trial, there was a 10% chance that the reward probability for each target would either increase or decrease by 1.0, with these probabilities bounded between 0.1 and 0.9. Due to the variable and independent nature of the rewards, participants could only estimate the probabilities by actively sampling from the targets and accumulating their reward experiences over time. Trials were excluded if participants failed to respond within 5 seconds. The task was programmed in MATLAB using Psychtoolbox 3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psychtoolbox.org/">http://psychtoolbox.org/</ext-link>). Stimuli were presented on an HP laptop positioned approximately 70 cm from the participant’s face and centered in their field of view while they sat upright in their hospital bed.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Self-reported measures</title>
<p>Participants completed a comprehensive battery of validated self-report measures. The Graded Chronic Pain Scale (GCPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Korff et al., 1992</xref>) assessed pain intensity and pain-related disability. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kroenke et al., 2001</xref>) was administered to evaluate the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. The EuroQol Five Dimension (EQ-5D)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brooks et al., 2020</xref>) questionnaire assessed health-related quality of life, with a higher score indicating better health status. Motivational deficits were evaluated using the Apathy Motivation Index (AMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ang et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c">
<title>Model-free analyses</title>
<p>We adopted some widely used model-free measures, including win-stay and lose-switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">den Ouden et al., 2013</xref>), as the direct measurement for this learning task.</p>
<p><italic>Win-stay</italic>. Win-stay is the percentage of times that the choice in trial t-1 was repeated on trial t following a reward.</p>
<p><italic>Lose-switch</italic>. In contrast, the lose-switch equals the percentage of trials in which the choice was shifted or changed when the outcome of trial t-1 was non-reward.</p>
<p>Initial analysis of model-free behavioral metrics, including stay rate, switch rate, win-stay/lose-switch behaviors, overall performance (corrected for chance level), and response times, revealed no significant differences between TMD patients and controls (all p &gt; 0.400; see Figure S1). Given the non-stationary nature of our restless bandit task, we assessed learning through maintenance of above-chance performance and adaptive strategy (see below) use rather than traditional improvement curves, as reward probabilities changed continuously throughout the experiment.</p>
<p>To comprehensively characterize task behavior, we computed seven model-free metrics examining reward sensitivity, choice consistency, and performance optimization (see below).</p>
<p>We first examined choice autocorrelation to assess systematic decision patterns independent of reward feedback. The lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient revealed positive values for both groups (HC: 0.270 ± 0.051; TMD: 0.169 ± 0.064; t(63) = 1.24, p = 0.221), calculated as r = Σ[(choice_t - mean)×(choice_{t+1} - mean)] /Σ(choice - mean)<sup>2</sup>. These positive autocorrelations indicate that both groups exhibited systematic choice patterns rather than random responding, with TMD participants showing a non-significant trend toward lower perseveration that did not reach the statistical threshold.</p>
<p>To assess reward-driven learning, we evaluated how well participants tracked and exploited the objectively best option. Both groups performed well above the chance level of 33.3%, with TMD participants (52.1 ± 3.4%) tracking the best option as effectively as controls (50.4 ± 1.9%; t(63) = -0.49, p = 0.624). Furthermore, we quantified reward-seeking behavior by correlating each participant’s choice probability with each option’s average reward rate. Both groups showed strong positive correlations (HC: 0.522 ± 0.101; TMD: 0.643 ± 0.089; t(63) = -0.84, p = 0.405), with TMD participants displaying numerically higher reward sensitivity, directly contradicting any hypothesis of disengagement or reward insensitivity.</p>
<p>To assess learning success, we calculated individualized chance levels for each participant based on the mean reward probabilities of their specific bandit instantiation. Binomial tests revealed that 66.7% of controls and 61.5% of TMD participants performed above their personalized baseline, with group-level analyses confirming both groups performed significantly above chance (both p &lt; 0.0001). This comparable achievement rate demonstrates that TMD participants successfully learned the task structure and exploited reward opportunities as effectively as controls.</p>
<p>Across all behavioral metrics spanning reward sensitivity, choice consistency, and performance optimization, TMD participants showed normal task behavior with no significant group differences (all p &gt; 0.14). This behavioral equivalence, including reward tracking, systematic choice patterns, and above-chance performance, makes our computational finding particularly specific and interpretable. Despite demonstrating intact trial-by-trial learning and reward processing at the behavioral level, TMD participants uniquely fail to reduce their uncertainty estimates over time, revealing a selective deficit in uncertainty resolution rather than a general learning impairment. This dissociation between preserved behavioral performance and impaired uncertainty updating highlights a subtle but critical difference in how TMD patients process and integrate information under uncertainty.</p>

<title>Temporal dynamics of model-free behavioral metrics</title>
<p>To examine learning dynamics across the task, we divided each participant’s 200 trials into consecutive 10-trial bins (20 bins total). Within each bin, we calculated win-stay rate (proportion of rewarded trials followed by staying with the same choice) and lose-shift rate (proportion of non-rewarded trials followed by switching to a different choice). These metrics were averaged across participants within each group to generate temporal trajectories. Group differences at each time point were assessed using independent samples t-tests. To examine learning phases, we aggregated data into early (trials 1-50), middle (trials 51-100), and late (trials 151-200) learning periods.</p>
<p>Analysis of behavioral dynamics across 10-trial bins revealed remarkably stable performance in both groups throughout the task (Figure S2). Win-stay rates remained consistently high across all learning phases (early: Controls = 64.0 ± 6.1%, TMD = 67.1 ± 4.2%; late: Controls = 72.6 ± 1.3%, TMD = 71.5 ± 3.8%), with no significant group differences at any time point (0/20 bins, all p &gt; 0.05). Similarly, lose-shift rates showed no group differences across bins (0/20 bins, all p &gt; 0.05), though both groups showed increasing lose-shift rates from early (Controls = 67.8 ± 7.6%, TMD = 71.7 ± 7.0%) to middle learning (Controls = 75.7 ± 5.2%, TMD = 65.3 ± 3.9%).</p>

<title>Kalman filter</title>
<p>The Kalman filter (KF) model has been widely applied in psychology and neuroscience to study various aspects of learning and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dayan et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In the Kalman filter model for a multi-armed bandit task, <italic>process noise</italic>, and <italic>observation noise</italic> refer to two distinct sources of uncertainty that affect the learning and decision-making process. Process noise represents the uncertainty in the evolution of the hidden state (reward mean) over time. It accounts for how the true state evolves from one point in time to the next. In mathematical terms, process noise is part of the state transition equation in the Kalman Filter:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="25336624v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is the state at time <italic>t</italic></p>
<p><italic>e</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> is the process noise <italic>t</italic>, which is assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution with zeros mean and <bold>process noise variance</bold> <italic>v</italic>. Where the <italic>e</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>∼<italic>N</italic>(0, <italic>v</italic>).</p>
<p>The process noise captures the idea that the reward means for each arm can change from one trial to the next, even in the absence of any observations. A higher process noise variance <italic>v</italic> indicates a more volatile environment, where the reward means are expected to change more rapidly.</p>
<p>In contrast, <bold>observation noise</bold> represents the uncertainty in the observed rewards, given the current hidden state (reward mean). Which is assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and a fixed variance <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The observation noise captures the idea that the observed rewards are noisy and can deviate from the true reward mean due to random fluctuations or measurement errors.</p>
<p>A higher measurement noise variance indicates a more stochastic environment, where the observed rewards are less reliable and informative about the underlying reward means.</p>
<p>The Kalman Filter operates optimally when the statistical properties of the process noise and the measurement noise are accurately known.</p>
<p>When observation noise variance (<italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>) is high relative to the process noise variance (<italic>v</italic>), the Kalman gain will be small, and the model will rely more on its prior beliefs and less on noisy observations. Conversely, when the observation noise variance (<italic>v</italic>), is high relative to the process noise variance (<italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>), the Kalman gain will be large, and the model will update its beliefs more strongly based on the observed rewards.</p>

<title>Volatile kalman filter for three-armed bandit task</title>
<p>The key difference between a standard Kalman filter and a volatile Kalman filter (VKF) is the variance of the process noise, a stochastic variable that changes with time.

<title>Alternative models: Rescorla-Wagner models</title>
<p>We also fitted the data to the classical Rescorla-Wagner model. Successful adaptation in a dynamic situation requires the appropriate feedback-based learning process where individuals integrate the feedback (reward or non-reward) into the stimulus-outcome association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Forstmann et al., 2016</xref>). The basic reinforcement learning model, the Rescorla-Wagner model can address this process well. So the first model (RW1) was defined as:

<title>Model fitting and comparison</title>
<p>Hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) is a powerful method for model fitting and comparison in group studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Piray et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike traditional approaches such as maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, which fit models to each subject independently, HBI simultaneously fits models to all subjects while constraining individual fits based on group-level statistics (i.e., empirical priors). This approach yields more robust and reliable parameter estimates, particularly when individual subject data is noisy or limited. In our study, we employed HBI to fit models to choice data. The method quantifies group-level mean parameters and their corresponding hierarchical errors. To ensure that parameter estimates remain within appropriate bounds during the fitting process, we used the sigmoid function to transform parameters bounded in the unit range or with an upper bound and the exponential function to transform parameters bounded to positive values. The initial parameters of all models were obtained using a MAP procedure, with the initial prior mean and variance for all parameters set to 0 and 6.25, respectively, based on previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Piray and Daw, 2020</xref>). This initial variance allows parameters to vary widely without substantial influence from the prior.</p>
<p>We used Bayesian model selection (26) for model comparison, specifically employing the exceedance probability (XP) to select the winning model. The XP quantifies the probability that a given model is more frequent in the population than all other models under consideration while accounting for the possibility that the observed differences in model evidence may be due to chance (see Table S1).</p>

<title>Model validation</title>
<p>To validate our model fitting procedure, we conducted a comprehensive parameter recovery analysis that strictly follows the standard method described in the original methodology paper of VKF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Piray and Daw, 2020</xref>) (page 21/26). We generated synthetic data from 30 artificial subjects using the binary VKF combined with a softmax choice model. We employed the same Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) approach used in our empirical data analysis for parameter estimation. We repeated this procedure 20 times with different random seeds to ensure robust estimation and minimize the effects of random variation.</p>
<p>The recovery analysis revealed strong correlations between the true and recovered parameters, with median correlation coefficients across the 20 simulations: <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>λ</italic></sub> = 0.852, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>v</italic>0</sub> = 0.473, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>σ</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.919, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>β</italic>1</sub> = 0.918, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>β</italic>2</sub> = 0.782 (Figure S3).</p>

Using the same set of simulated data, we found that the recovery rates for the key parameters (λ, <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>, β1, β2) remained stable regardless of the fixed value. Specifically, the correlations between true and recovered parameters maintained consistent levels (λ= 0.852, <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup>= 0.949, β1= 0.937, β2= 0.831) across all values, suggesting that it does not substantially interact with the recovery of other parameters.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates how individuals with chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) learn from uncertain rewards, using a probabilistic three-armed bandit task and computational modelling. The authors aim to identify whether people living with chronic pain show altered learning under uncertainty and how such differences might relate to psychological symptoms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work addresses an important question about how chronic pain may influence cognition and motivation. The task design is appropriate for probing adaptive learning, and the modelling approach is novel. The findings of altered uncertainty updating in the TMD group are interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several aspects of the paper limit the strength of the conclusions. The group differences appear only in model-derived parameters, with no corresponding behavioural differences in task performance. Model parameters do not correlate with pain severity, making the proposed mechanistic link between pain and learning speculative. Some of the interpretations extend beyond what the data can directly support.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors report on a case-control study in which participants with chronic pain (TMD) were compared to controls on performance of a three-option learning task. The authors find no difference in task behavior, but fit a model to this behavior and suggest that differences in the model-derived metrics (specifically, change in learning rate/estimated volatility/model estimated uncertainty) reveal a relevant between-group effect. They report a mediation effect suggesting that group differences on self-report apathy may be partially mediated by this uncertainty adaptation result.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The role of sensitivity to uncertainty in pathological states is an interesting question and is the focus of a reasonable amount of research at present. This paper provides a useful assessment of these processes in people with chronic pain.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The interpretation of the model in the absence of any apparent behavioral effect is not convincing. The model is quite complex with a number of free parameters (what these parameters are is not well explained in the methods, although they seem to be presented in the supplement). These parameters are fitted to participant choice behavior - that is, they explain some sort of group difference in this choice behavior. The authors haven't been able to demonstrate what this difference is. The graphs of learning rate per group (Figure 2) suggest that the control group has a higher initial learning rate and a lower later learning rate. If this were actually the case, you would expect to see it reflected in the choice data (the control group should show higher lose-shift behavior earlier on, with this then declining over time, and the TMD group should show no change). This behavior is not apparent. The absence of a clear effect on behavior suggests that the model results are more likely to be spurious.</p>
<p>(2) As far as I could see, the actual parameters of the model are not reported. The results (Figure 2) illustrate the trial-level model estimated uncertainty/learning rate, etc, but these differ because the fitted model parameters differ. The graphs look like there are substantial differences in v0 (which was not well recovered), but presumably lambda, at least, also differs. The mean(SD) group values for these parameters should be reported, as should the correlations between them (it looks very much like they will be correlated).</p>
<p>(3) The task used seems ill-suited to measuring the reported process. The authors report the performance of a restless bandit task and find an effect on uncertainty adaptation. The task does not manipulate uncertainty (there are no periods of high/low uncertainty) and so the only adaptation that occurs in the task is the change from what appears to be the participants' prior beliefs about uncertainty (which appear to be very different between groups - i.e. the lines in Figure 2a,b,c are very different at trial 0). If the authors are interested in measuring adaptation to uncertainty, it would clearly be more useful to present participants with periods of higher or lower uncertainty.</p>
<p>(4) The main factor driving the better fit of the authors' preferred model over listed alternatives seems to be the inclusion of an additive uncertainty term in the softmax-this differentiates the chosen model from the other two Kalman filter-based models that perform less well. But a similar term is not included in the RW models-given the uncertainty of a binary outcome can be estimated as p(1-p), and the RW models are estimating p, this would seem relatively straightforward to do. It would be useful to know if the factor that actually drives better model fit is indeed in the decision stage (rather than the learning stage).</p>

<p>This paper applies a computational model to behavior in a probabilistic operant reward learning task (a 3-armed bandit) to uncover differences between individuals with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) compared with healthy controls. Integrating computational principles and models into pain research is an important direction, and the findings here suggest that TMD is associated with subtle changes in how uncertainty is represented over time as individuals learn to make choices that maximize reward. There are a number of strengths, including the comparison of a volatile Kalman filter (vKF) model to some standard base models (Rescorla Wagner with 1 or 2 learning rates) and parameter recovery analyses suggesting that the combination of task and vKF model may be able to capture some properties of learning and decision-making under uncertainty that may be altered in those suffering from chronic pain-related conditions.</p>
<p>I've focused my comments in four areas: (1) Questions about the patient population, (2) Questions about what the findings here mean in terms of underlying cognitive/motivational processes, (3) Questions about the broader implications for understanding individuals with TMD and other chronic pain-related disorders, and (4) Technical questions about the models and results.</p>
<p>(1) Patient population</p>
<p>This is a computational modelling study, so it is light on characterization of the population, but the patient characteristics could matter. The paper suggests they were hospitalized, but this is not a condition that requires hospitalization per se. It would be helpful to connect and compare the patient characteristics with large-scale studies of TMD, such as the OPPERA study led by Maixner, Fillingim, and Slade.</p>
<p>(2) What cognitive/motivational processes are altered in TMD</p>
<p>The study finds a pattern of alterations in TMD patients that seems clear in Figure 2. Healthy controls (HC) start the task with high estimates of volatility, uncertainty, and learning rate, which drop over the course of the task session. This is consistent with a learner that is initially uncertain about the structure of the environment (i.e., which options are rewarded and how the contingencies change over time) but learns that there is a fixed or slowly changing mean and stationary variance. The TMD patients start off with much lower volatility, uncertainty, and learning rate - which are actually all near 0 - and they remain stable over the course of learning. This is consistent with a learner who believes they know the structure of the environment and ignores new information.</p>
<p>What is surprising is that this pattern of changes over time was found in spite of null group differences in a number of aspects of performance: (1) stay rate, (2) switch rate, (3) win-stay/lose-switch behaviors, (4) overall performance (corrected for chance level), (5) response times, (6) autocorrelation, (7) correlations between participants' choice probability and each option's average reward rate, (7) choice consistency (though how operationalized is not described?), (8) win-stay-lose-shift patterns over time. I'm curious about how the patterns in Figure 2 would emerge if standard aspects of performance are essentially similar across groups (though the study cannot provide evidence in favor of the null). It will be important to replicate these patterns in larger, independent samples with preregistered analyses.</p>
<p>The authors believe that this pattern of findings reveals that TMD patients &quot;maintain a chronically heightened sensitivity to environmental changes&quot; and relate the findings to predictive processing, a hallmark of which (in its simplest form) is precision-weighted updating of priors. They also state that the findings are not related to reduced overall attentiveness or failure to understand the task, but describe them as deficits or impairments in calibrating uncertainty.</p>
<p>The pattern of differences could, in fact, result from differences in prior beliefs, conceptualization of the task, or learning. Unpacking these will be important steps for future work, along with direct measures of priors, cognitive processes during learning, and precision-weighted updating.</p>
<p>(3) Implications for understanding chronic pain</p>
<p>If the findings and conclusions of the paper are correct, individuals with TMD and perhaps other pain-related disorders may have fundamental alterations in the ways in which they make decisions about even simple monetary rewards. The broader questions for the field concern (1) how generalizable such alterations are across tasks, (2) how generalizable they are across patient groups and, conversely, how specific they are to TMD or chronic pain, (3) whether they are the result of neurological dysfunction, as opposed to (e.g.) adaptive strategies or assumptions about the environment/task structure.</p>
<p>It will be important to understand which features of patients' and/or controls' cognition are driving the changes. For example, could the performance differences observed here be attributable to a reduced or altered understanding of the task instructions, more uncertainty about the rules of the game, different assumptions about environments (i.e., that they are more volatile/uncertain or less so), or reduced attention or interest in optimizing performance? Are the controls OVERconfident in their understanding of the environment?</p>
<p>This set of questions will not be easy to answer and will be the work of many groups for many years to come. It is a judgment call how far any one paper must go to address them, but my view is that it is a collaborative effort. Start with a finding, replicate it across labs, take the replicable phenomena and work to unpack the underlying questions. The field must determine whether it is this particular task with this model that produces case-control differences (and why), or whether the findings generalize broadly. Would we see the same findings for monetary losses, sounds, and social rewards? Tasks with painful stimuli instead of rewards?</p>
<p>Another set of questions concerns the space of computational models tested, and whether their parameters are identifiable. An alteration in estimated volatility or learning rate, for example, can come from multiple sources. In one model, it might appear as a learning rate change and in another as a confirmation bias. It would be interesting in this regard to compare the &quot;mechanisms&quot; (parameters) of other models used in pain neuroscience, e.g., models by Seymour, Mancini, Jepma, Petzschner, Smith, Chen, and others (just to name a few).</p>
<p>One immediate next step here could be to formally compare the performance of both patients and controls to normatively optimal models of performance (e.g., Bayes optimal models under different assumptions). This could also help us understand whether the differences in patients reflect deficits and what further experiments we would need to pin that down.</p>
<p>
In addition, the volatility parameter in the computational model correlated with apathy. This is interesting. Is there a way to distinguish apathy as a particular clinical characteristic and feature of TMD from apathy in the sense of general disinterest in optimal performance that may characterize many groups?</p>
<p>If we know this, what actionable steps does it lead us to take? Could we take steps to reduce apathy and thus help TMD patients better calibrate to environmental uncertainty in their lives? Or take steps to recalibrate uncertainty (i.e., increase uncertainty adaptation), with benefits on apathy? A hallmark of a finding that the field can build off of is the questions it raises.</p>
<p>(4) Technical questions about the models and results</p>
<p>Clarification of some technical points would help interpret the paper and findings further:</p>
<p>(a) Was the reward probability truly random? Was the random walk different for each person, or constrained?</p>
<p>(b) When were self-report measures administered, and how?</p>
<p>(c) Pain assessments: What types of pain? Was a body map assessed? Widespreadness? Pain at the time of the test, or pain in general?</p>
<p>(d) Parameter recovery: As you point out, r = 0.47 seems very low for recovery of the true quantity, but this depends on noise levels and on how the parameter space is sampled. Is this noise-free recovery, and is it robust to noise? Are the examples of true parameters drawn from the space of participants, or do they otherwise systematically sample the space of true parameters?</p>
<p>(e) What are the covariances across parameter estimates and resultant confusability of parameter estimates (e.g., confusion matrix)?</p>
<p>(f) It would be helpful to have a direct statistical comparison of controls and TMD on model parameter estimates.</p>
<p>(g) Null statistical findings on differences in correlations should not be interpreted as a lack of a true effect. Bayes Factors could help, but an analysis of them will show that hundreds of people are needed before it is possible to say there are no differences with reasonable certainty. Some journals enforce rules around the kinds of language used to describe null statistical findings, and I think it would be helpful to adopt them more broadly.</p>
<p>(h) What is normatively optimal in this task? Are TMD patients less so, or not? The paper states &quot;aberrant precision (uncertainty) weighting and misestimation of environmental volatility&quot;. But: are they misestimates?</p>
<p>(i) It's not clear how well the choice of prior variance for all parameters (6.25) is informed by previous research, as sensible values may be task- and context-dependent. Are the main findings robust to how priors are specified in the HBI model?</p>
