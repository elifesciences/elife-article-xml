<title>Abstract</title><p>Soil salinity is one of the major threats to agricultural productivity worldwide. Salt stress exposure alters root and shoot growth rates, thereby affecting overall plant performance. While past studies have extensively documented the effect of salt stress on root elongation and shoot development separately, here we take an innovative approach by examining the coordination of root and shoot growth under salt stress conditions. Utilizing a newly developed tool for quantifying the root:shoot ratio in agar-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, we found that salt stress results in a loss of coordination between root and shoot growth rates. We identify a specific gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), and characterize one of these genes as <underline>S</underline>alt <underline>R</underline>oot:shoot <underline>R</underline>atio <underline>R</underline>egulator <underline>G</underline>ene (SR3G). Further analysis elucidates the role of SR3G as a negative regulator of salt stress tolerance, revealing its function in regulating shoot growth, root suberization, and sodium accumulation. We further characterize that <italic>SR3G</italic> expression is modulated by <italic>WRKY75</italic> transcription factor, known as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance. Finally, we show that the salt stress sensitivity of <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant is completely diminished when it is combined with <italic>sr3g</italic> mutation. Together, our results demonstrate that utilizing root:shoot ratio as an architectural feature leads to the discovery of new stress resilience gene. The study’s innovative approach and findings not only contribute to our understanding of plant stress tolerance mechanisms but also open new avenues for genetic and agronomic strategies to enhance crop environmental resilience.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Salt stress is predominant in the dryland areas where evaporation rate exceeds water input. As all water contains dissolved ions, the prolonged exposure to drought stress results in increased accumulation of salts in the upper soil layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Abrol et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fischer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Richards, 1969</xref>). Dryland areas of South America, southern and western Australia, Mexico, southwest United States, and South Africa were previously identified as primary hotspots for soil salinization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hassani et al., 2021</xref>). As fresh water becomes scarcer, understanding the mechanisms of salt stress resilience becomes of paramount importance in the context of global agricultural productivity and sustainability.</p>
<p>Salt stress detrimentally affects plant growth and development, decreasing the activity of the meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">West et al., 2004</xref>). Studies utilizing main root elongation as an indicator of salt tolerance have led to identification of many crucial components of salt stress signaling and tolerance, including genes involved in salt-overly sensitive signaling (SOS) pathway, jasmonate, ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glycophytes and halophytes alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Şekerci et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Valenzuela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wu et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, negative halotropism response, that describes a directional growth of main root away from the salt gradient, was used to identify a wide range of molecular components regulating the auxin redistribution and cell-wall remodeling, to actively avoid high salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Deolu-Ajayi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Galvan-Ampudia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Korver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yu et al., 2022</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zou et al., 2022</xref>). The development of lateral roots is affected by salinity, and the differential effect on main and lateral roots within specific genotype can result in substantial reprogramming of root system architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">2014</xref>). The shoot development is impacted by salt stress, as the salt impacts the plant transpiration and photosynthetic efficiency instantaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awlia et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Julkowska et al., 2016</xref>). Many forward genetic studies were highly successful in associating natural variation in root and shoot growth with allelic variation in gene coding and promoter regions, thereby identifying potential new target traits for improved stress resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awlia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">2016</xref>). However, these studies typically focus on either above or below ground tissue.</p>
<p>The coordination of root and shoot growth rate is an important aspect of seedling establishment, and becomes even more critical under abiotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bacher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Karcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The importance of increased root:shoot ratio, maximizing water scavenging while limiting transpiration, is well studied under drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Karcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Uga et al., 2013</xref>). However, the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio is yet to be described, and its contribution to salt stress remains unknown. Here, we developed a tool to quantify root:shoot ratio from agar-grown Arabidopsis seedlings, and re-analyzed the natural diversity panel of Arabidopsis exposed to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>). We have observed that while salt stress does not elicit a clear response in root:shoot ratio, it results in loss of coordination of root and shoot growth rates. The locus associated with salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio consisted of a gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with majority of SNPs clustering into one specific gene (At3g50160), that we named as Salt Root:shoot Ratio Regulator Gene (SR3G). Further characterization of SR3G revealed its function as a negative regulator of salt stress resilience, through regulation of root suberization, shoot growth, and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation. We found WRKY75 transcription factor, a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance, acts upstream of SR3G, binding directly to the SR3G promoter in yeast. While <italic>sr3g</italic> and <italic>wrky75</italic> mutants showed contrasting salt stress response, the double mutants of <italic>sr3g/wrky75</italic> displayed reduced sensitivity to salt stress.</p>

<title>Screening HapMap population for the increase in root and shoot size</title>
<p>The images collected within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>) were re-analyzed in this manuscript to examine salt-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio for the data presented here. 360 accessions of the Arabidopsis HapMap population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Weigel and Mott, 2009</xref>) were screened over 7 experimental batches, using 4 biological replicates per genotype per condition. The seeds were surface sterilized, incubated in sterile MQ water at 4°C for 48 h, and germinated on media containing ½ Murashige-Skoog, 0.5% sucrose, 0.1% MES buffer, pH 5.8 (KOH) and 1% Dashin agar. The 4-day-old seedlings were subsequently transferred to media additionally supplemented with 0, 75 or 125 mM NaCl. The plates were scanned every 2nd day using a flat-bed scanner for 8 consecutive days.</p>
<p>The collected images were analyzed for green and white pixels, corresponding to the projected surface of the shoot and root, respectively (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ronellsicat/PlantSeg">https://github.com/ronellsicat/PlantSeg</ext-link>). A Matlab-based tool was developed to simplify and speed up the segmentation and analysis pipeline. For automatic segmentation, the tool uses a combination of image operations (histogram equalization), thresholding on different color spaces (e.g., RGB, YCbCr, Lab, HSV), and binary image processing (boundary and islands removal). As the tool is digitalizing various color scales and classifies pixels into either white (root), green (shoot) or blue (background) categories, the adjustment for white balance is obsolete. For analysis, the tool uses connected components analysis to extract the plants (combined roots and shoots) and can guide the user to find possible mistakes which can be manually corrected via the user interface.

<p>The tool’s precision was evaluated by growing the Col-0 seedlings on agar plates, analyzing their root and shoot projected area on the final day using the tool, and correlating it with the recorded fresh and dry weight of the seedlings (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). The collected data from the HapMap panel was analyzed using R for potential outliers (samples identified to be more than 3x standard deviation from the mean of each genotype within each condition), and the genotype-specific mean was calculated using the stats package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Team et al., 2018</xref>). The overall increase in root and shoot area was investigated for differences between control and salt stress conditions (<bold>Fig. S2</bold>). The root and shoot growth were estimated by fitting a linear function for a log-transformed projected root or shoot area over the non-transformed timeline of the experiment (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rpubs.com/mjulkowska/HapMap-root-shoot-data">https://rpubs.com/mjulkowska/HapMap-root-shoot-data</ext-link>). The data were subsequently used to explore differences between the experimental batches and the standard deviations within individual accessions. The genotypes above 3 standard deviations from the population’s mean were excluded from further analysis. The salt tolerance index (STI) was calculated for root and shoot growth by dividing the average trait value at salt stress by the genotype-specific average at control conditions (<bold>Fig. S3</bold>). The correlations between individual traits were examined using the genotypic mean (<bold>Fig. S4</bold>). All quantitative data for root and shoot growth was visualized using ggplot2, corrplot and ggpubr packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kassambara, n.d.</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wei and Simko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wilke, 2016</xref>).

<p>For the most promising candidate loci (<bold>Table S4</bold>), we have identified the gene open reading frames that were located within the genome-wide linkage-disequilibrium (LD) of the associated SNPs. The LD was expanded if multiple SNPs were identified within the region, and the region of interest was expanded based on the number of coding genes within the LD window. The protein-coding genes were subsequently used for haplotype analysis. All the SNPs located within the gene coding region were used to perform a haplotype analysis.

<title>Phylogenetic and positive selection analysis of SR3G orthologs</title>
<p>Identified orthologs were translated into amino acid, then aligned by MUSCLE. Alignments were carefully validated by manual correction. Briefly, diverged insertions were trimmed, shifted frames were adjusted, and conserved regions after translation were retained for phylogeny reconstruction. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed using the RAxML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>) plug-in within Geneious (Geneious Prime 2022.1.1) with the GAMMA-GTR nucleotide model, rapid bootstrapping with a parsimony search, and 100 bootstraps.

<p>To characterize any potential positive selection that might exist along certain branches of the inferred phylogeny, including SR3G and its orthologs, we performed a branch-site model A test on branches leading to SR3G, and branches leading to the clade containing SR3G and its closet orthologs using PAML4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang, 2007</xref>) as performed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Beilstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>).

In the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>): we assigned a substitution rate (ω = dN/dS) along with 0 &lt; ω &lt; 1 or ω = 1 to all branches (represented by H<sub>0</sub>: ω0 = ω1 = ω2 = ω3 = ω-rest). The alternative hypotheses (HAs) here allow for differential selection to be applied to respective branch(es). Specifically, the five alternative hypotheses are listed here: H<sub>1</sub>: ω –rest branches = ω0 = ω3 = ω1 ≠ ω2, H<sub>2</sub>: ω –rest branches = ω0 = ω1 = ω2 ≠ ω3, H<sub>3</sub>: ω –rest branches = ω0 ≠ ω1 ≠ ω2 ≠ ω3, H<sub>4</sub>: ω –rest branches ≠ ω0 ≠ ω1 ≠ ω2 ≠ ω3, H<sub>sep</sub>: each branch has its unique ω value. To test these hypotheses, we further validate or reject alternative hypotheses by conducting a Chi-square test based on likelihood scores (Ln-L score) derived from the respective branch-site model A tests (Chi-square test cutoff: P &lt; 0.05).</p>

The samples were then subjected to 80 <sup>◦</sup>C for 2 h to release the total electrolyte, and cooled at room temperature for 24 h. Final electrolyte leakage was measured the following day. The electrolyte leakage percentage was calculated by dividing initial conductivity by final conductivity * 100 and followed by data analysis in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rpubs.com/mri23/913288">https://rpubs.com/mri23/913288</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rpubs.com/mri23/1102053">https://rpubs.com/mri23/1102053</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Natural variation in salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio</title>
<p>To investigate salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we developed a custom tool that quantifies green and white pixels, corresponding to shoot and root of Arabidopsis seedlings grown on agar plates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The projected area of root and shoot showed high correlation with root and shoot fresh weight (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>), indicating that projected root and shoot area can be used as an accurate proxy to non-destructively measure the increase in root and shoot biomass from the images of seedlings grown on agar plates.</p>

<p>Using our custom tool, we re-analyzed the data consisting of 360 Arabidopsis accessions grown on plates supplemented with 0, 75, and 125 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), for salt stress-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref><bold>, Fig. S2</bold>). The growth of root and shoot for each plant was estimated using the exponential function. Salt stress-induced reduction in growth rate was observed to be dose-dependent for both root and shoot (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). In general, the root growth was more sensitive to salt stress compared to shoot growth, with the population-wide relative growth rates reduced to a fraction of 0.67 and 0.41 of the growth rates observed at control for 75 and 125 mM NaCl, respectively. In comparison, the growth rates of the shoot were significantly reduced to 0.71 and 0.43 of the control in 75 and 125 mM NaCl treatments, respectively (<bold>Fig. S3</bold>). While the mean value of root:shoot growth rate did not change upon salt stress treatment, the variance in the root:shoot ratio significantly expanded with the increasing concentrations of salt (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results suggest that while root and shoot growth are well coordinated under non-stress conditions, salt stress exposure results in loss of coordination of organ growth across Arabidopsis accessions. To test whether there is a clear directional correlation between the change in root:shoot ratio and overall salt stress tolerance, we have used the overall seedling size as a proxy for plant salt tolerance (<bold>Fig. S4, S5</bold>). No significant correlation was found between the root:shoot growth ratio and total seedling size (<bold>Fig. S4, S5</bold>), indicating that the relationship between coordination of root and shoot growth and salt tolerance during the early seedling establishment is complex.</p>

<title>Identification of genetic components underlying salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio</title>
<p>To identify genetic components underlying salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we used the collected data as an input for GWAS. The associations were evaluated based on the p-value, the number of SNPs within the locus, and the number of traits associated with individual loci. As Bonferroni threshold differs depending on the minor allele count (MAC) considered, we identified significant associations based on a Bonferroni threshold for each subpopulation of SNPs based on MAC (<bold>Table S3</bold>). While we conducted a GWAS on directly measured traits, as well as their Salt Tolerance Index (STI) values, however the amount of associations with STI was much lower compared to directly measured traits (<bold>Table S3</bold>). This observation aligns with the understanding that plastic responses to environmental conditions tend to be genetically more complex. This complexity likely stems from the involvement of more genetic regulators compared to low-plasticity phenotypes.</p>
<p>The initial GWAS was performed using 250 k SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Horton et al., 2012</xref>), and led to the identification of 14 significantly associated loci, of which 3 and 7 loci were associated with traits measured at 75 or 125 mM NaCl treatments, respectively. We identified one salt specific association on chromosome 2 (<bold>Fig. S6</bold>), where two SNPs were identified within AT2G27300 encoding NAC-domain containing transcription factor (NTL8). Additionally, salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio and shoot:total seedling area were associated with SNPs on chromosome 3, where 2 significantly associated SNPs were flanking AT3G22430, encoding an unknown gene encoding a domain of unknown function (<bold>Fig. S7</bold>).</p>
<p>To refine our analysis and further prioritize candidate genes for validation, we repeated the GWAS using a higher-density 4M SNP panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1001 Genomes Consortium, 2016</xref>). This increased SNP density provided more associations and highlighted loci with greater confidence due to the higher resolution. The higher-density panel also allowed us to capture different linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks across the genome. One locus on chromosome 2, detected by both the 250K and 4M SNP panels, appeared to be in a region of strong LD or possibly under selection, consistently identified by both panels. However, most loci were not detected by the lower-density 250K panel, likely due to differences in the panels’ resolution and statistical power.</p>
<p>The new GWAS with the 4M SNP panel revealed 32 additional loci, with only one locus (locus 30, <bold>Table S3</bold>). being detected by both the 250K and 4M SNP panels. We prioritized the identified loci based on several factors, including the number of significantly associated SNPs, MAC, and the number of traits associated with each locus. This led to the identification of three loci of major interest (<bold>Table S4</bold>). We further examined the regions in LD with the significantly associated SNPs for sequence divergence and open reading frames (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref><bold>, Fig. S8, Fig. S9</bold>).</p>

<p>Out of identified associations, locus 30 stood out as it consisted of nine SNPs associated with p-value above the Bonferroni threshold, and was associated with both root:shoot and shoot:total seedling area at 6 and 8 days after transfer of the seedling to 125 mM NaCl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref><bold>, Fig. S8, Table S4</bold>). The significantly associated SNPs were located in and around the gene coding region of AT3G50160, which encodes a domain of unknown function 247 (DUF247). We investigated the region for sequence divergence, and found that the region contained not only a high degree of sequence diversity but also potential structural variants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). To identify allelic variation underlying the initial associations, we performed haplotype analysis, where accessions with shared SNP pattern within the protein-coding part of AT3G50160 were grouped into individual haplotype-groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Each unique haplotype, represented by at least three accessions, was subsequently studied for differences in observed phenotypes. We observed that Haplotype 1, represented by 46 accessions including Col-0, was significantly different from Haplotype 11, represented by 11 accessions including Blh-1, in shoot-per-total seedling area at 6 days after transfer to 125 mM NaCl (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), as well as shoot growth rate and relative shoot growth rate at 125 mM NaCl (<bold>Fig. S9</bold>). Upon further investigation and sequencing of AT3G50160 in both Col-0 and Blh-1 accessions, we discovered that the Blh-1 allele carries a large insertion at 644 nucleotides downstream from the ATG of AT3G50160, followed by multiple other sequence variations (<bold>Fig. S10</bold>). The first insertion leads to a premature STOP-codon within the DUF247 domain after Gly-215 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref><bold>, Fig. S11</bold>), resulting in a truncated protein that still carries a nuclear localization signal and coiled-coil domain, but is missing a major part of the calcium-binding domain and a predicted transmembrane domain (<bold>Fig. S12</bold>). As there are other DUF247s within the locus associated with salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we decided to name the gene containing majority of the associated SNPs (At3g50160) as Salt Root:shoot Ratio Regulator Gene (SR3G). Together, these results suggest that the allelic variation in SR3G protein sequence might underlie the observed differences in root:shoot ratio under salt stress conditions.</p>

<title>Evolutionary context of SR3G locus reveals its origin in local genome duplication</title>
<p>SR3G sits in what appears to be a tandemly duplicated array of DUF247s along Arabidopsis chromosome 3. The genome-wide identification of SR3G included eight DUF247 paralogs, AT3G50120, AT3G50130, AT3G50140, AT3G50150, AT3G50170, AT3G50180, AT3G50190, and AT3G50200. Reciprocal best BLAST within CoGe’s BLAST tool of these nine DUF247 paralogs against the genomes of seven other Brassicaceae (see <bold>Table S5</bold>) revealed a total of 50 potential orthologs used for downstream analysis. While the copy number of DUF247 loci are similar across the examined species, the noted exceptions are those with recent whole genome duplication events (<italic>Brassica rapa</italic> and <italic>Camelina sativa</italic>). Given these data, it appears that DUF247 loci are commonly tandemly duplicated, although the eight paralogs observed in Arabidopsis represents an extreme case for this gene family.</p>
<p>To examine conservation within the predicted DUF247 functional domains, we generated an amino-acid based multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE. All of the identified DUF247 proteins contained the DUF247 domain near the center of the translated sequence. While partial deletions were identified outside of the DUF247 domain at the C-terminus of a few DUF247s, such as <italic>CARHR159180</italic>, <italic>Csa09g052970</italic>, and <italic>Bra01902</italic>, in general the DUF247 domains were highly conserved across Brassicaceae. The amino acid sequences spanning the “coiled-coil domain” (Amino acid position: Met153-Lys173), putative Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding domain (Amino acid position: Gly210-Phe372), and super polar fragment (Amino acid position: Ser301-Ile320) were further selected for phylogenetic reconstruction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The resulting phylogeny demonstrated that SR3G is sister to a clade containing AT3G50150 and representatives from <italic>C. sativa</italic>, <italic>Capsella rubella,</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, with representative DUF247s from <italic>B. rapa</italic> and <italic>Eutrema salsugineum</italic> serving as a monophyletic outgroup. These data support a hypothesis where SR3G is a recent duplicate (likely A/C Clade specific; Forsythe et al., 2020) of AT3G50150 and that representative SR3G sequences in <italic>C. sativa</italic>, <italic>C. rubella</italic>, and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> have been lost.</p>

Lastly, the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) was performed to test the probability of sites along with ω &gt; 1 over the DUF247 (AT3G50160).

<p>Given the specific retention of AT3G50150 in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, we next tested whether this locus is experiencing directional selection. To test this assumption, we grouped the branches leading to SR3G into four groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>: ω0, ω1, ω2, and ω-rest) and then performed a branch-site model A hypothesis test. In our null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>), we hypothesized that all branches have the same selection pressure (H<sub>0</sub>: ω –rest branches = ω0 = ω3 = ω1 = ω2; see <bold>Table S6</bold> for omega values for each hypothesis). For our alternative hypothesis, we created five different ω groups to cover scenarios where specific branches may be experiencing directional selection (See Methods). Based on our analysis, the branch leading to SR3G is experiencing directional selection (likelihood score = 20625.5, Chi-square derived P value; P = 0.00418). Interestingly, no other branches appeared to be experiencing the same selection. To pinpoint specific amino acids within SR3G under selection, we performed the Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) test, identifying three sites with a posterior probability &gt; 0.90, including 124C (P = 0.992), 206A (P = 0.951), and 209A (P = 0.988).

<p>SR3G protein is predicted to contain a nuclear localization signal (Lys15-Ala19), a coiled-coil domain (Met153-Lys173), a Ca2<sup>+</sup> binding pocket (Gly210-Phe372), and a trans-membrane domain (Pro469-Thr503) (<bold>Fig. S15</bold>). We generated constitutive expression constructs of full-length <italic>SR3G</italic> gene CDS, and a combination of individual domains (refer to as A, B, and AB domains) to identify their subcellular localization (<bold>Fig. S15</bold>). Fragment A comprised a nuclear localization signal, a coiled-coil domain, and the initial segment of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding pocket, encompassing seven amino acids. Fragment B encompassed the remaining segment of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding pocket. Fragment C only included the transmembrane domain. All constructs contained N-terminal fusion of mVenus. The individual constructs were used in transient expression assay in tobacco leaves. Our result showed that full-length SR3G localizes to the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>) as its signal overlapped with FM4-64, the plasma membrane marker (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The SR3G fragments from which the transmembrane domain was excluded—namely fragments A, B, and AB— exhibited localization in both the nucleus and cytosol, resembling the pattern observed with free-GFP localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-F</xref>). It is noteworthy that while the signal from fragment A was directed to both the cytosol and nucleus, its intensity was notably stronger in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), aligning with the prediction that it contains the nuclear localization signal. Together, these findings indicate that the positioning of SR3G within the plasma membrane is due to the transmembrane domain encoded within the fragment C, and its removal could potentially release the protein into both the nucleus and cytosol.</p>

<title>Lower expression of <italic>SR3G</italic> results in reduced lateral root development under salt stress</title>
<p>To investigate role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in salt-induced changes in root growth and development, we studied the root system architecture of two T-DNA insertion lines: <italic>sr3g-4</italic> (SAIL_690_E12) and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> (SAIL_608_C06) localized in second exon and first intron region of the <italic>SR3G</italic> gene, respectively (<bold>Fig. S16A</bold>). Among these two mutant lines, <italic>SR3G</italic> expression was reduced in the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant compared to Col-0 (<bold>Fig. S16B</bold>), indicating the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> is a knockdown mutant. We did not observe any differences in <italic>SR3G</italic> transcript abundance between <italic>sr3g-4</italic> and Col-0 (<bold>Fig. S16B</bold>). Moreover, we examined the transcript abundance of the closely related gene (i.e., <italic>DUF247-150, At3g50150</italic>) in the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant, and found no significant difference. In the case that <italic>DUF247-150</italic> would act redundantly to <italic>SR3G</italic>, we would expect that the expression of <italic>DUF247-150</italic> would be increased in <italic>SR3G</italic> knockdown mutant. As this is not the case, these results further contribute to the evidence that <italic>SR3G</italic> and <italic>DUF247-150</italic> are not acting redundantly (<bold>Fig. S16C</bold>).</p>
<p>Two T-DNA insertion lines were subsequently studied for salt-induced alterations in root architecture (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref><bold> and Fig. S17 and S18</bold>). Among the various features of the root system architecture that we investigated (<bold>Fig. S17</bold>), <italic>sr3g-5</italic> exhibited a significantly reduced growth rate of lateral roots under 75 mM NaCl, but not under 125 mM NaCl, when compared to Col-0 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant displayed a significant reduction in the Stress Tolerance Index (STI), calculated as the ratio of growth rate under salt to growth rate under control conditions, for lateral root length under 75 mM NaCl (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). No significant difference was observed between <italic>sr3g-4</italic> and Col-0 (<bold>Fig. S18</bold>), except for Stress Tolerance Index (STI) calculated using growth rates of lateral root length and number, consistent with the observations made for the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant line (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Based on the RT-qPCR results (<bold>Fig. S16</bold>), we proceeded to further investigate the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in salt stress, focusing on the sr3g-5 mutant in our subsequent investigations. As Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion from the shoot is one of the main mechanisms of salt tolerance (Julkowska et al.,</p>

We used root and shoot samples collected for Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant to examine Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> accumulation using ICP-AES at 14 days after exposure to salt stress. We observed no significant differences between Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> accumulations and their corresponding ratio upon salt stress exposure (<bold>Fig. S17</bold>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>SR3G</italic> plays a role in root development under the salt, but does not affect ion accumulation at early developmental stages.</p>
<p>To evaluate the effects of other closely related DUF247 genes on root development, we have investigated the T-DNA insertion lines targeting the neighboring DUF247 genes (AT3G50120, AT3G50130, AT3G50140, AT3G50150, AT3G50170, AT3G50180, AT3G50190, AT3G50200), and RNAi lines targeting one or more DUF247s within the interval (<bold>Table S4, Fig. S19-S23</bold>). For the screened T-DNA insertion lines (<bold>Fig. S19-20</bold>), we have not observed consistent changes in main or lateral root development in either control or salt stress conditions across alleles targeting the same gene. The only exception was <italic>DUF247-200</italic> encoded by AT3G50200, where two out of three studied T-DNA insertion alleles exhibited increased salt tolerance index for main root growth rate (<bold>Fig. S20</bold>).</p>
<p>For the screened RNAi lines (<bold>Table S4, Fig. S21-S23</bold>), we observed the most interesting root architecture phenotypes in lines targeting the neighboring genes of the <italic>SR3G</italic> (RNAi line #04, targeting AT3G50150, RNAi line #16 targeting AT3G50130, <italic>SR3G</italic>, and AT3G50170, and RNAi line #19 targeting AT3G50130, AT3G50140, AT3G50150, <italic>SR3G</italic>, AT3G50170, AT3G50180, and AT3G50190). Three out of five screened independent transformation lines from RNAi line #04 showed a decreased relative main root length (Salt / Control, CSHL #4 B2a, D4a, and G1d), whereas two lines showed a decrease in relative lateral root number (CSHL #4 D4a and F1b), and one line showed decreased lateral root length at 75 mM NaCl (CSHL #4 D4a <bold>Fig. S21-23</bold>). Two out of two independent transformants for RNAi line #16 showed a decreased relative main root length and increased lateral root number at 75 mM NaCl (CSHL #16 A2c and B1a, <bold>Fig. S21-23</bold>). In three of the four screened independent transformants of line #19 we observed an increased lateral root length at 75 mM NaCl (CSHL #19 F1a, I3c, and L1c <bold>Fig. S21-23</bold>). We did not observe strong reduction in lateral root development across RNAi lines targeting two closely related DUF247 genes (i.e., RNAi line #22, targeting AT3G50150 and <italic>SR3G</italic>), as in the single mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref><bold>, Fig. S21</bold>). The above results further support that these two genes do not act redundantly in the context of lateral root development.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>SR3G</italic> results in increased salt tolerance in soil</title>
<p>To investigate <italic>SR3G’s</italic> contribution to salt stress tolerance beyond seedling stage and agar plate conditions, we evaluated the performance of Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant in soil. We exposed the soil-grown plants to salt stress and imaged the rosette size every 30 minutes for two weeks using the automated imaging platform (Yu et al., 2023). As salt-induced changes depend on the developmental stage at which the stress is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), we examined the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> exposed to salt stress at 2 or 3 weeks after germination, corresponding to early and late vegetative stages. We calculated a daily growth rate for each plant, using the projected rosette area. No significant difference was observed between Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> under control conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>), indicating that <italic>SR3G</italic> does not play a role in plant development under non-stress conditions. Significant difference was observed between Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> for plants exposed to early salt treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>), where <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant displayed an increased rosette growth rate as compared to Col-0 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Late stress exposure resulted in significantly higher <italic>sr3g-5</italic> growth rate at two and three days after exposure to salt stress (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant showed a significantly higher rosette area compared to Col-0 exclusively when plants were exposed to salt stress at an earlier stage of their development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). No significant difference was observed between Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant in terms of water content under either of conditions tested, providing no substantial evidence for SR3G to to regulate water content (<bold>Fig. S24</bold>).</p>

<p>To investigate the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in the maintenance of cellular integrity during salt stress, we evaluated the salt-induced changes in cell membrane integrity by measuring ion leakage in the leaf discs at the end of the experiment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). While ion leakage increased in Col-0 under early salt stress conditions, no noticeable salt-induced change was observed for <italic>sr3g-5</italic> compared to control condition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Although the <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant exhibited significant increase in ion leakage in response to late salt stress, this phenomenon may be more closely associated with the onset of senescence rather than direct exposure to salt stress (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>We further explored the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> in ion exclusion by quantifying the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions in the rosette at the end of the experiment (4-weeks-old plants). We observed a reduced accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> in <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutants compared to Col-0 for plants exposed to salt stress at an earlier timepoint (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). No significant differences in Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation was observed between the Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> at the late salt stress regime (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). A subtle, non-significant, reduction in K<sup>+</sup> content was observed in <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutant compared to Col-0 across all three conditions studied (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>).

<title><italic>sr3g</italic> mutant displays enhanced root suberization</title>
<p>As <italic>SR3G</italic> limits shoot growth, promotes cell damage and sodium translocation into shoot (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), and is expressed in the most inner layers of the root (i.e., stele, <bold>Fig. S13</bold>), we hypothesized that <italic>SR3G</italic> plays a role in the regulation of suberization within the Casparian strips located in the endodermis, the layer adjacent to the stele. Salt stress exposure increases root suberization, thereby limiting Na<sup>+</sup> loading into the transpiration stream and accumulation in the shoot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Baxter et al., 2009</xref>). We examined root suberization patterns in Col-0 and <italic>sr3g-5</italic> under non-stress and salt stress conditions. Root suberization was visualized using lipophilic stain Fluorol Yellow (FY), and staining intensity was examined under a confocal microscope. Additionally, we examined the developmental transition in root suberization through imaging four regions along the main root (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Visually, we observed that roots of <italic>sr3g-5</italic> were more suberized compared to Col-0 under both control and salt stress conditions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). The quantification of FY signal intensity revealed non-significant, but substantially higher levels of root suberization in <italic>sr3g-5</italic> compared to Col-0 in sections one to three of the root under control condition (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). Only in root section four, the level of suberization significantly decreased in <italic>sr3g-5</italic> compared to Col-0 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). In plants exposed to salt stress, we observed a non-significant difference between <italic>sr3g-5</italic> and Col-0 throughout the four sections, although, in section one which is the root tip proximal, <italic>sr3g-5</italic> showed more suberization compared to Col-0 (section 1, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>).

<p>To further examine the functional consequences of the relationship between SR3G and WRKY75, we generated <italic>wrky75-3/sr3g-5</italic> double mutants, and examined their root system architecture alongside the single mutants and Col-0.

Regarding lateral root number (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>) and length (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C</xref>), we observed significant reduction in lateral root number and length for the two single mutants, <italic>sr3g-5</italic> and <italic>wrky75-3</italic>, compared to other genotypes only under control condition (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B-C</xref>). We further investigated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> accumulations as well as Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio in plate grown seedlings (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10D</xref><bold>, Fig. S25, S26</bold>). At 75 mM salt concentration, a subtle reduction in root Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio was observed in the <italic>wrky75</italic> single mutant compared to the other genotypes tested. Conversely, shoot Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio exhibited a slight decrease in the two double mutants compared to the other three genotypes at 75 mM salt concentration. At 125 mM salt concentration, root Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio decreased in the two double mutants compared to Col-0 and the two single mutants. Similarly, the two double mutants maintained lower Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratios compared to Col-0 and the two single mutants in shoot at 125 mM salt concentration (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10D</xref>), indicating that the <italic>SR3G</italic> mutation indeed compensated for the increased Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation observed in the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant under salt stress.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Exposure to abiotic stress alters plant architecture by affecting biomass distribution between individual organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julkowska and Testerink, 2015</xref>). Exposure to drought alters the distribution of the biomass between root and shoot, to optimize water uptake, while limiting transpiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Karcher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Uga et al., 2013</xref>). While the processes underlying salt-induced changes in shoot and root growth dynamics and architecture have been systematically described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ariel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Awlia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Deolu-Ajayi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Duan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Geng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>; Yutao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zou et al., 2022</xref>), the methodological exploration of biomass distribution between root and shoot for plants exposed to salt stress is underexplored in the current body of research. Here, we developed a tool that allows a non-destructive quantification of root and shoot projected area of the seedlings grown on agar plates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This new tool allows us to efficiently describe changes in biomass accumulation and stress-induced alterations in root and shoot growth. Although the method is restricted to small plants and early developmental stages, it provides valuable insight into stress responses. The application of this tool to an Arabidopsis natural diversity panel revealed that salt stress exposure results in loss of coordination between root and shoot growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), rather than a clear directional change, as in the case of drought. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of changes in root:shoot ratio. The developed tool for quantifying root and shoot size in plate-grown Arabidopsis has the potential to significantly advance research by enabling developmental and stress studies, focusing on coordination of root and shoot development during seedling establishment. Facilitating detailed comparisons of root:shoot ratios, this tool can aid in formulating new hypotheses about the mechanisms contributing to seedling vigor and stress tolerance.</p>
<p>The natural variation in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio revealed a clear association with SNPs on chromosome 3 within <italic>SR3G</italic>, that is situated within a region containing eight other <italic>DUF247</italic> genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). SR3G was previously associated with self-incompatibility in grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Crain et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lian et al., 2021</xref>), as well as with lesions and dwarfism in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kondou et al., 2013</xref>) through constitutive activation of defense responses. However, the <italic>SR3G</italic> associated with constitutive defense response was AT3G60470 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kondou et al., 2013</xref>), which is located outside the interval associated with salt stress-induced changes in root:shoot ratio (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Because we did not observe any consistent phenotypes in the T-DNA insertion lines of <italic>DUF247s</italic> neighboring the <italic>SR3G</italic> (<bold>Fig. S19-20</bold>), we examined the RNAi lines targeting multiple <italic>DUF247s</italic> including <italic>SR3G</italic> (<bold>Fig. S21-23</bold>). Our root system architecture analyses revealed no redundancy between <italic>SR3G</italic> and other DUF247s, and the reduced lateral root development in double mutants of RNAi lines simply mimics the phenotype of <italic>sr3g-5</italic> single mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref><bold>, Fig. S21</bold>). Further, we demonstrated that only <italic>SR3G</italic> is regulated by <italic>WRKY75</italic> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B-E</xref>). As these genes are result of tandem duplication, they are expected to accumulate a lot of variation in the cis-regulatory regions. Therefore, differential regulation of two closely related genes can be expected by the accumulated variation within the promoter region.</p>
<p>The results acquired in this study provide multiple layers of evidence that support the role of <italic>SR3G</italic> as a negative regulator of salt stress response in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function <italic>SR3G</italic> maintained higher shoot growth rate and larger rosette area when exposed to salt stress in the soil (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>), probably due to reduced Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>), which in turn resulted in lower rates of cellular damage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). This increased salt tolerance feature can be explained by the increased root suberization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) as suberin-deficient mutants show susceptibility to salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barberon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shukla et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ursache et al., 2021</xref>). For example, Arabidopsis <italic>CYP86A1/HORST</italic> (At5g58860) encodes a cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme that is responsible for catalyzing fatty acid ω-hydroxylation. It plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of aliphatic suberin, particularly expressed in the root endodermis. Knock-out mutations of <italic>CYP86A1/HORST</italic> result in a substantial decrease of approximately 60% in total root suberin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Höfer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Consequently, the diminished aliphatic suberin content in the roots of <italic>cyp86a1</italic> mutants leads to increased permeability to water and solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ranathunge and Schreiber, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>SR3G</italic> expression is enhanced by salt stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4</xref><bold>, Fig. S13</bold>), specifically in the root stele (<bold>Fig. S13B</bold>). The root stele encompasses vascular bundles, procambium and pericycle, which gives rise to the secondary growth and lateral root primordia respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Birnbaum et al., 2003</xref>). The stele is central to the systemic transport of water, minerals, and nutrients within the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ramachandran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zarebanadkouki et al., 2019</xref>), and to the exclusion of salt ions from the transpiration stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Møller et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The deposition of hydrophobic residues of lignin and suberin in the Casparian strips poses a significant barrier to apoplastic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Foster and Miklavcic, 2017</xref>). Previously, silencing genes involved in Casparian strips formation resulted in increased lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). As the suberization of the Casparian strips increases upon salt stress, it limits the accumulation of Na<sup>+</sup> and loss of K<sup>+</sup> ions from the root stele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barberon et al., 2016</xref>). However, the effects of increased root suberization under salt stress have thus far not been described to affect lateral root development. Here, we have identified <italic>SR3G</italic> as a negative regulator of root suberization under salt stress (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), which provides an additional layer of protection against sodium accumulation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), but negatively impacts lateral root development (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-B</xref>).</p>
<p>As SR3G was previously not described in the context of salt stress, we attempted to identify its molecular context through its transcriptional regulation. Through our <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis, we have identified <italic>WRKY75</italic> as a putative regulator of <italic>SR3G</italic> expression, and confirmed it using RT-qPCR and Y1H assay (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). WRKY75 was previously described to act as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance through activation of <italic>SOS1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lu et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to previous study, we also observed <italic>wrky75</italic> mutants to be more sensitive to salt stress within our experiments (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A-C</xref>). Nevertheless, when the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutation was coupled with <italic>sr3g-5</italic>, the roots displayed a phenotype identical to Col-0 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>), implying that the salt sensitivity of the <italic>wrky75</italic> mutant was counteracted by the <italic>SR3G</italic> mutation. Considering <italic>WRKY75’s</italic> role in positively regulating <italic>SOS1</italic> expression during salt stress, it is plausible that its binding to the <italic>SR3G</italic> promoter inhibits its expression, thereby enhancing salt tolerance on a larger scale.</p>
<p>One of the main players in Na<sup>+</sup> transport is High-affinity K<sup>+</sup> Transporter (HKT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Laurie et al., 2002</xref>). HKT1 is expressed in root stele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mäser et al., 2002</xref>), where it retrieves Na<sup>+</sup> from the transpiration stream and limits ion accumulation in the shoot, resulting in higher salt stress tolerance at later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Møller et al., 2009</xref>). At early developmental stages, <italic>HKT1</italic> overexpression reduces the development of lateral root primordia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), thus creating less Na<sup>+</sup> entry gate into the main root, resulting in less Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation in shoot. Similarly, <italic>sr3g-5</italic> mutants developed fewer lateral roots that are consistent with the lower Na<sup>+</sup> levels in the root upon salt stress (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The effects of HKT1 and SR3G differ in the magnitude of repression of lateral root development, with HKT1 mutants resulting in almost complete cessation of lateral root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Julkowska et al., 2017</xref>), whereas repression of SR3G function has much more subtle phenotype. Whereas the effect of cell-type specific overexpression of HKT1 on plant performance was negative during the early developmental stage, due to impairing lateral root development, the <italic>sr3g</italic> mutants showed increased salt tolerance when exposed to salt stress treatment during their early vegetative growth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These results suggest that reduced lateral root development under salt stress can have a gradient of responses leading to increased and decreased salt tolerance, and the effect is highly dependent on the wider physiological mechanisms, and their contributions to ion exclusion and maintained plant development throughout salt stress exposure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the study of salt-induced changes in the root:shoot ratio, alongside the development of new tools to quantify these changes during the seedling establishment stage, represents an important new perspective into mechanisms underlying salt stress tolerance. Identification of SR3G as a novel regulator of root suberization, shoot growth, and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulation provides better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to salt stress, but also offers a new avenue to explore more nuanced and tissue-specific strategies for enhancing salt stress tolerance.</p>

<p><bold>Figure S24. Plant water content comparison shows no significant differences between sr3g mutant and Col-0 wild-type plants.</bold> Plant water content was calculated by subtracting rosette dry weight from fresh weight for the 2-week-old (referred to as “early salt stress”) or 3-week-old (referred to as “late salt stress”) soil-grown Col-0 and sr3g-5 plants that were exposed to a final concentration of 100 mM NaCl. “early salt stress” group experienced two weeks of salt stress while the “late salt stress” group experienced one week. Statistical analysis was done by comparison of the means for all pairs using Tukey–Kramer HSD test. Levels not connected by the same letter are significantly different (P &lt; 0.05).</p>

<p><bold>Figure S26. <italic>wrky75/sr3g</italic> double mutants exhibit no noticeable differences in rosette area compared to their individual single mutants when grown in saline soil</bold>. The salt stress responses of 2-week-old soil-grown plants that were exposed to a final concentration of 100 mM NaCl were examined here. Rosette area <bold>(A)</bold> and growth rate for each individual day were shown <bold>(B-M)</bold>. Growth rate is shown for 1 <bold>(B)</bold>, 2 <bold>(C)</bold>, and 3 <bold>(D)</bold> days before the stress, respectively.

Na+/K+ <bold>(N)</bold> ratio in shoot were measured in 4-week-old plants. Each line in (A) represents the trajectory per genotype through time. The effect of the genotype within individual treatment in (B-M) was tested using ANOVA, and the significantly different genotypes were additionally determined using Tukey HSD test (pvalue &lt; 0.05). Statistical analysis in (N) was done by comparison of the means for all pairs using Tukey–Kramer HSD test.

<p><bold>Table S1. The individual traits recorded and calculated from the HapMap accessions exposed to the three different levels of salt stress.</bold> The root and shoot projected area were quantified using a custom developed tool. The change in the root and shoot area over time was used to calculate Growth Factor (GF) by fitting an exponential function. The broad sense heritability (H2) was calculated for each trait over individual days and conditions using MVApp.</p>
<p><bold>Table S2. Genotypic mean data used as an input for GWAS.</bold> The genotypic mean data was calculated from at least 4 biological replicates per genotype per condition. The root and shoot area were extracted using a custom developed tool. The Growth Factors (GF) for root and shoot were calculated using exponential growth function. Total seedling slze (Tot) was calculated by adding root and shoot area for individual day. Shoot per Total (SpT) ratio was calculated for individual days by dividing genotype specific shoot area by the total seedling area for that day and condition. Root per Shoot ratio (RpS) was calculated by dividing genotype specific root area by the shoot area for that day and condition.</p>
<p><bold>Table S3. Significant associations identified with GWAS of all used traits.</bold> The location of individual SNPs is listed according to its location on Chromosome (Chr) and position (Pos). The individual SNP Minor Allele Count (MAC) and Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) is calculated based on specific SNP set used (4 Million or 250 Thousand – listed in “Mapping” column). The traits associated with individual SNPs are abbreviated as RpS for Root-per-Shoot, SpT for Shoot-per-Total seedling area, Tot for Total seedling area, GR for growth rate and SHIIT for Shoot Ion Independent Tolerance index (Salt / Control).</p>
<p><bold>Table S4. Most important GWAS associations.</bold> The most important associations identified through GWAS (Table S3) were inspected further for their functions using either T-DNA or RNAi mutant lines. List of oligoes used for genotyping, RT-qPCR, cloning, and Y1H assay are provided.</p>

<body>
<p>Through cellular, developmental, and physiological analysis, this <bold>valuable</bold> study identifies a gene that regulates the relative growth of roots and shoots under salt stress. The holistic approach taken provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence that this member of a larger tandemly duplicated gene family together with an upstream regulator contributes to salt tolerance, although the statistical or biological support for some conclusions could be more robust. The manuscript will be of interest to plant biologists studying mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance and gene family evolution.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to assess the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio, identify the underlying genetic mechanisms, and evaluate their contribution to salt tolerance. To this end, the authors systematically quantified natural variations in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio. This innovative approach considers the coordination of root and shoot growth rather than exploring biomass and the development of each organ separately. Using this approach, the authors identified a gene cluster encoding eight paralog genes with a domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with the majority of SNPs clustering into SR3G (At3g50160). In the manuscript, the authors utilized an integrative approach that includes genomic, genetic, evolutionary, histological, and physiological assays to functionally assess the contribution of their genes of interest to salt tolerance and root development.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>As the authors correctly noted, variations across samples, genotypes, or experiments make achieving statistical significance challenging. Should the authors choose to emphasize trends across experiments to draw biological conclusions, careful revisions of the text, including titles and figure legends, will be necessary to address some of the inconsistencies between figures (see examples below). However, I would caution that this approach may dilute the overall impact of the work on SR3G function and regulation. Therefore, I strongly recommend pursuing additional experimental evidence wherever possible to strengthen the conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) Given the phenotypic differences shown in Figures S17A-B, 10A-C, and 6A, the statement that &quot;SR3G does not play a role in plant development under non-stress conditions&quot; (lines 680-681) requires revision to better reflect the observed data.</p>
<p>
(2) I agree with the authors that detecting expression differences in lowly expressed genes can be challenging. However, as demonstrated in the reference provided (Lu et al., 2023), a significant reduction in WRKY75 expression is observed in T-DNA insertion mutant alleles of WRKY75. In contrast, Fig. 9B in the current manuscript shows no reduction in WRKY75 expression in the two mutant alleles selected by the authors, which suggests that these alleles cannot be classified as loss-of-function mutants (line 745). Additionally, the authors note that the wrky75 mutant exhibits reduced main root length under salt stress, consistent with the phenotype reported by Lu et al. (2023). However, other phenotypic discrepancies exist between the two studies. For example, 1) Lu et al. (2023) report that w¬rky75 root length is comparable to WT under control conditions, whereas the current manuscript shows that wrky75 root growth is significantly lower than WT; 2) under salt stress, Lu et al. (2023) show that wrky75 accumulates higher levels of Na+, whereas the current study finds Na+ levels in wrky75 indistinguishable from WT. To confirm the loss of WRKY75 function in these T-DNA insertion alleles the authors should provide additional evidence (e.g., Western blot analysis).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Salt stress is a significant and growing concern for agriculture in some parts of the world. While the effects of sodium excess have been studied in Arabidopsis and (many) crop species, most studies have focused on Na uptake, toxicity and overall effects on yield, rather than on developmental responses to excess Na, per se. The work by Ishka and colleagues aims to fill this gap.</p>
<p>Working from an existing dataset that exposed a diverse panel of A. thaliana accessions to control, moderate, and severe salt stress, the authors identify candidate loci associated with altering the root:shoot ratio under salt stress. Following a series of molecular assays, they characterize a DUF247 protein which they dub SR3G, which appears to be a negative regulator of root growth under salt stress.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-executed study which demonstrates the functional role played by a single gene in plant response to salt stress in Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>Review of revised manuscript:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my point-by-point comments to my satisfaction. In the cases where they have changed their manuscript language, clarified figures, or added analyses I have no further comment. In some cases, there is a fruitful back-and-forth discussion of methodology which I think will be of interest to readers.</p>
<p>I have nothing to add during this round of review. I think that the paper and associated discussion will make a nice contribution to the field</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to assess the effect of salt stress on root:shoot ratio, identify the underlying genetic mechanisms, and evaluate their contribution to salt tolerance. To this end, the authors systematically quantified natural variations in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio. This innovative approach considers the coordination of root and shoot growth rather than exploring biomass and the development of each organ separately. Using this approach, the authors identified a gene cluster encoding eight paralog genes with a domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), with the majority of SNPs clustering into SR3G (At3g50160). In the manuscript, the authors utilized an integrative approach that includes genomic, genetic, evolutionary, histological, and physiological assays to functionally assess the contribution of their genes of interest to salt tolerance and root development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The holistic approach and integrative methodologies presented in the manuscript are essential for gaining a mechanistic understanding of a complex trait such as salt tolerance. The authors focused on At3g50160 but included in their analyses additional DUF247 paralogs, which further contributes to the strength of their approach. In addition, the authors considered the developmental stage (young seedlings, early or late vegetative stages) and growth conditions of the plants (agar plates or soil) when investigating the role of SR3G in salt tolerance and root or shoot development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors' claims and interpretation of the results are not fully supported by the data and analyses. In several cases, the authors report differences that are not statistically significant (e.g., Figures 4A, 7C, 8B, S14, S16B, S17C), use inappropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test instead of Dunnett Test/ANOVA as in Figures 10B-C, S19-23), present standard errors that do not seem to be consistent with the post-hoc Tukey HSD Test (e.g., Figures 4, 9B-C, S16B), or lack controls (e.g., Figure 5C-E, staining of the truncated versions with FM4-64 is missing).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their critical thoughts on the presented data. We have revised our data interpretation in the main text to more accurately reflect the results. Given the nature of our experimental setup, where we trace the roots of individual Arabidopsis seedlings grown on plates, there is considerable biological variation, which makes achieving strong statistical significance between samples or genotypes challenging. However, we think that the representation of the data as transparently as possible is necessary to provide the readers and reviewers a true picture of the variability that we are observing.  Consequently, we have centered our data interpretation around observable trends that facilitate drawing conclusions.</p>
<p>The choice of statistical test is closely tied to the specific biological question being addressed. In Figures 10A-C, as in Figures 6A-B, we compared all genotypes to the wild-type Col-0 within each condition, and thus ANOVA analysis, testing the general effect of the genotype across both mutants and Col-0 wild-type is not appropriate. Similarly, in Figures S19-S23, we compared each mutant line to the wild-type Col-0 under each condition.</p>
<p>We repeated the post-hoc Tukey HSD Test for Figures 4, 9B-C, and S16B and made adjustments where necessary (see tracked changes manuscript).</p>
<p>The truncated versions do not localize to the plasma membrane; instead, they are targeted to the nucleus and cytosol, mimicking the localization pattern of free GFP, which was used as a control in Panel F. Therefore, we believe that having FM4-64 as a control for these specific images is not informative, but instead using free GFP is serving as a better control in that particular construct.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In other cases, traits of root system architecture and expression patterns are inconsistent between different assays despite similar growth conditions (e.g., Figures S17A-B vs. 10A-C vs. 6A, and Figures S16B vs. 4A/9B), or T-DNA insertion alleles of WRKY75 that are claimed to be loss-of-function show comparable expression of WRKY75 as WT plants. Additionally, several supplemental figures are mislabeled (Figures S6-9), and some figure panels are missing (e.g., Figures S16C and S17E).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these points and noticing the inconsistency between different assays (e.g., Figures S17A-B vs. 10A-C vs. 6A, and Figures S16B vs. 4A/9B). As mentioned above, considerable biological variation makes achieving strong statistical significance between samples, genotypes, or experiments challenging. Thus, we have centered our data interpretation around observable “trends” between experiments to facilitate drawing conclusions. Considering Figures S17A-B, 10A-C, and 6A, we acknowledge the reviewer's concern about inconsistencies in root system architecture across experiments. Initially, we observed that the sr3g mutant had reduced lateral root length compared to Col-0 under salt stress. This led us to focus on this specific phenotypic trait rather than the overall root system architecture. Despite some variation, the sr3g mutant consistently showed a similar trend/phenotype when compared to Col-0 under salt stress. We believe the variation in main root length and lateral root number between experiments is due to inherent differences between biological replicates.</p>
<p>Regarding gene expression patterns between Figures S16B and 4A/9B, we included part of Figure 9B (SR3G gene expression in Col-0) in Figure 4A. Figure S16B represents a completely different assay. Despite variations between assays, the overall message remains consistent: SR3G gene expression is induced under salt stress in the root but not in the shoot.</p>
<p>Both SR3G and WRKY75 are expressed at very low levels, even under the 75 mM salt stress condition we tested. When gene expression is so low, detecting changes is challenging due to inherent variations. Nonetheless, we observed a reduction in WRKY75 expression in the mutant lines compared to wild-type Col-0, though this reduction was not statistically significant. More importantly, we observed a similar phenotype in the wrky75 mutant, specifically reduced main root length under salt stress, consistent with the findings of the published paper in The Plant Cell by Lu et al. (2023) “Lu, K.K., Song, R.F., Guo, J.X., Zhang, Y., Zuo, J.X., Chen, H.H., Liao, C.Y., Hu, X.Y., Ren, F., Lu, Y.T. and Liu, W.C., 2023. CycC1; 1–WRKY75 complex-mediated transcriptional regulation of SOS1 controls salt stress tolerance in Arabidopsis. The Plant Cell, 35(7), pp.2570-2591”.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for spotting the missing labels for Figures S6-9. We corrected them at the main text, figures, and legends. We added panel C to Figure S16 and removed panel E from Figure S17 legend,  now they match to actual figures and legends.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Consequently, the authors' decisions regarding subsequent functional assays, as well as major conclusions about gene function, including SR3G function in root system architecture, involvement in root suberization, and regulation of cellular damage are incomplete.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer's thorough review of our manuscript and their critical comments. We have carefully addressed all comments and concerns.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Salt stress is a significant and growing concern for agriculture in some parts of the world. While the effects of sodium excess have been studied in Arabidopsis and (many) crop species, most studies have focused on Na uptake, toxicity, and overall effects on yield, rather than on developmental responses to excess Na, per se. The work by Ishka and colleagues aims to fill this gap.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a well-executed study that demonstrates the functional role played by a single gene in plant response to salt stress in Arabidopsis.</p>
<p>The abstract and beginning of the Discussion section highlight the &quot;new tool&quot; developed here for measuring biomass accumulation. I feel that this distracts from the central aims of the study, which is really about the role of a specific gene in root development under salt stress. I would suggest moving the tool description to less prominent parts of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. We believe that the innovative tool used to extract shoot-to-root ratio data from previous experiments underscores the value of reutilizing previously acquired data for new discoveries and demonstrates how reanalyzing the same data can provide fresh insights, such as identification of new allelic variation. Therefore, we decided to retain this section, as our discovery of the SR3G gene originated from this innovative tool.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Line 58 (opening sentence) - salt accumulation in the soil is not caused by evaporation exceeding input; that scenario results in soil water deficit. The issue is when the input water has dissolved ions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. While this point is theoretically true, all of the water that is found in natural environments contains some dissolved ions. Therefore, drought conditions will lead, over time, to increased soil salinization. We have amended this sentence to represent our point better.</p>
<p>“Salt stress is predominant in the dryland areas where evaporation rate exceeds water input. As all water contains dissolved ions, the prolonged exposure to drought stress results in increased accumulation of salts in the upper soil layers <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/CKPhL2/jY9pL+YwLnS+zbVS0">1–3</ext-link>.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I feel that it would be helpful, for replication and for interpretation, if the authors could provide water potentials for the growing media used throughout. What water potentials are the plants experiencing when grown in 1/2 MS + agar at 0, 75, and 150mM NaCl? Juenger and Verslues present a great recent discussion of the importance of reporting these values (Juenger, T. E. and P. E. Verslues (2023). &quot;Time for a drought experiment: Do you know your plants' water status?&quot; Plant Cell 35(1): 10-23.)</p>
<p>Critically, how do the water potentials experienced by agar-grown plants compare to those experienced in soil-grown plants? As a stated aim of this study is to allow translation to crops these data are very important to convince physiologists of the relevance of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We completely agree that growing plants on agar plates is an artificial setup and knowing the water potential of the plants within this setup would be highly informative. However, as indicated in review by Juenger and Verslues 2023, the agar plate setup is much more reproducible compared to various soil conditions, and we report the media composition in sufficient detail for it to be reproduced in other laboratory conditions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while investigating the water status of plants and soil is indeed intriguing, it is beyond the scope of this study and would require us to redo the experiments with specific tools listed within the Juennger and Verslues review, which are currently not within our laboratory equipment list.</p>
<p>Importantly, any changes reported in this manuscript apply equally to both wild-type and mutant lines under all conditions. We provide extensive report on the soil type used, as well as soil quantity. We are using the gravimetric method to determine the water content, and salt stress application, as described in previous works from our lab (Yu and Sussman et al., 2024 Plant Physiology and Awlia et al., 2016 Frontiers in Plant Science).</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we have now included water content measurements for soil-grown plants under different conditions, calculated by subtracting dry weight from fresh weight (new Fig. S24). Although plant water content may not fully capture the water status of the media or soil, our measurements did not reveal any significant differences in water content between genotypes across the various conditions tested.</p>

<p>Line 69- missing an &quot;and&quot; after &quot;(ABA).&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks. We added the missing “and”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 79 - I think the association being made is between natural variation in root and shoot growth and genetic variants, not &quot;underlying genes.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The cause for the identified association indeed relies on allelic variation within the genetic region. We have re-phrased this sentence within the manuscript.</p>
<p>“Many forward genetic studies were highly successful in associating natural variation in root and shoot growth with allelic variation in gene coding and promoter regions, thereby identifying potential new target traits for improved stress resilience 18,20,21.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 1 - what do &quot;seGF&quot; and &quot;reGF&quot; stand for? Shoot and root growth rate, respectively, but there are extra letters in there…</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The abbreviations stand for shoot exponential Growth Factor and root exponential Growth factor. An explanation of the acronym has been added to the text.</p>
<p>“The increase in the projected area of shoot and root (Fig. S2) was used to estimate (A) shoot and (B) root exponential growth rate (seGR and reGR respectively).”</p>

<p>Figure 1 legend - there's an &quot;s&quot; missing in &quot;across.&quot; And two &quot;additionally&quot; in the penultimate sentence.</p>

<p>Thanks for spotting the errors. We fixed these errors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 109 - how was the white balance estimated for the images on the flatbed scanner?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Within the developed tool, we have not adjusted or controlled for white balance in any way, as the white balance from the flatbed scanner is kept at one value. The tool transforms the imaged pixels into bins consisting of white (root), green (shoot), and blue (place) pixels based on the closest distance in the RGB scale to the particular color, which makes correcting for white balance obsolete. We have provided an additional explanation for this within the M&amp;M section.</p>
<p>“A Matlab-based tool was developed to simplify and speed up the segmentation and analysis pipeline. For automatic segmentation, the tool uses a combination of image operations (histogram equalization), thresholding on different color spaces (e.g., RGB, YCbCr, Lab, HSV), and binary image processing (boundary and islands removal). As the tool is digitalizing various color scales and classifies pixels into either white (root), green (shoot) or blue (background) categories, the adjustment for white balance is obsolete. ”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>GWAS was performed separately on traits measured at control, 75mM, and 150mM NaCl treatments. Would it also be informative to map the STI measurement (i.e. plasticity) introduced here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. We have performed GWAS on both “raw” and STI traits, however, we found that the identified associations were not as abundant as the ones identified with “raw traits”. This makes sense, as we are compounding the root or shoot growth under both conditions, and plastic responses to the environment are expected to be genetically more complex, as they involve more genetic regulators compared to phenotypes that have low plasticity. We have added this as a part of the result description, as we acknowledge that this might be an interesting observation for the field to build upon, and might provide fodder for new methods to deconvolute the complexity in mapping the plastic traits.</p>
<p>“To identify genetic components underlying salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio, we used the collected data as an input for GWAS. The associations were evaluated based on the p-value, the number of SNPs within the locus, and the number of traits associated with individual loci. As Bonferroni threshold differs depending on the minor allele count (MAC) considered, we identified significant associations based on a Bonferroni threshold for each subpopulation of SNPs based on MAC (Table S3). While we conducted a GWAS on directly measured traits, as well as their Salt Tolerance Index (STI) values, however the amount of associations with STI was much lower compared to directly measured traits (Table S3). This observation aligns with the understanding that plastic responses to environmental conditions tend to be genetically more complex. This complexity likely stems from the involvement of more genetic regulators compared to low-plasticity phenotypes.”</p>

<p>Line 167 - how was LD incorporated into this analysis? Did you use a genome average? Or was LD allowed to vary (as it does) across the genome?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Initially, we have used genome average LD for this purpose (10 kbp for Arabidopsis), and extended the region of interest based on the number of coding genes within the window. We have added this as a part of description to our manuscript.</p>
<p>“For the most promising candidate loci (Table S4), we have identified the gene open reading frames that were located within the genome-wide linkage-disequilibrium (LD) of the associated SNPs. The LD was expanded if multiple SNPs were identified within the region, and the region of interest was expanded based on the number of coding genes within the LD window. ”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 291 - I think the water potentials are essential, here. What does 50% of soil water holding capacity equal in these soils? In the substrate that we use in our lab, that would represent a considerable soil water deficit even without any salts in the soil.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As Arabidopsis is occurring naturally in low soil water holding capacity soils (i.e. sandy soils), it is typically growing better in soils that are not very saturated with the water. Throughout many experiments, performed within this study, and other studies performed in our lab (results reported in Awlia et al., 2016 Frontiers in Plant Science and Yu &amp; Sussman et al., 2024 Plant Physiology), we have not observed any drought like symptoms at 50% soil water holding capacity. The fact that this is reproducible across similar soil types across two laboratories (one in Saudi Arabia and one in the USA) is not to be dismissed. Again - we are currently not equipped to measure water potentials for these plants, as this is not a standard practice (yet) for stress experiments, but we are taking these comments on board for all of our future experiments.</p>
<p>Moreover, our control plants are also “dried down” to 50% of SWHC, and soaked in non-saline water during the “salt stress treatment” to make sure that the soil water saturation is accounted for within the experimental setup. This “dry down” of soil is necessary to ensure equal and effective salt penetration into the soil particles. More details on this method can be found in Awlia et al., 2016.</p>
<p>Again - We have added a new dataset measuring water content in individually soil-grown plants under different conditions as a proxy for soil water status (see new Fig. S24). While we did not observe any significant differences in water content between genotypes under the various conditions, the sr3g mutant showed a slightly higher, though non-significant, water content compared to wild-type Col-0 under control conditions.</p>
<p>We have provided additional information and comments to warn the readers about this method:</p>
<p>“The seeds were germinated in ½ MS media for one week, as described for the agar-based plate experiments. One week after germination, the seedlings were transplanted to the pot (12 x 4 cm insert) containing the Cornell Mix soil (per batch combine: 0.16 m3 of peat moss, 20.84 kg of vermiculite, 0.59 kg of Uni-Mix fertilizer, and 2.27 kg of lime) watered to 100% water holding capacity and placed in the walk-in growth chamber with the 16 h light / 8 h dark period, 22°C and 60% relative humidity throughout the growth period. When all of the pots dried down to the weight corresponding to 50% of their water holding capacity, they were soaked for 1 h in tap water or a 200 mM NaCl solution, resulting in an effective concentration of 100 mM NaCl based on the 50% soil water holding capacity, which corresponded to a moderate level of salt stress (Awlia et al., 2016). The control pots were soaked for the same length of time in 0 mM NaCl solution, to account for the soil saturation effect. We then allowed the pots to be drained for 2-3 h to eliminate excess moisture. The pots were placed under phenotyping rigs equipped with an automated imaging system (Yu et al., 2023) and the pot weight was measured daily to maintain the reference weight corresponding to 50% of the soil water holding capacity throughout the experiment. We would like to note that this gravimetric based method for application of salt stress has been developed for soils typically used for pot-grown plants, with relatively high water holding capacity (Awlia et al. 2016). Within these specific conditions, no drought stress symptoms were observed.”</p>

<p>Lines 415-416 - are these contrasts significant? Figure S3 likewise does not have any notation for significant differences in the means.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have previously not tested the stronger effect of 125 mM vs 75 mM on relative root and shoot growth, and thus these test results were initially not included in Fig. S3. We have now added the tests and included them within Fig. S3, and added description of their significance into the main body of the manuscript:</p>
<p>“In comparison, the growth rates of the shoot were significantly reduced to 0.71 and 0.43 of the control in 75 and 125 mM NaCl treatments, respectively (Fig. S3). While the mean value of root:shoot growth rate did not change upon salt stress treatment, the variance in the root:shoot ratio significantly expanded with the increasing concentrations of salt (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that while root and shoot growth are well coordinated under non-stress conditions, salt stress exposure results in loss of coordination of organ growth across Arabidopsis accessions.”</p>

<p>We have previously not tested this. We have now added the ANOVA tests and included them within each figure, and added description of their significance into the main body of the manuscript. (see text above)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 421 - why would we expect there to be a correlation between root:shoot growth ratio and seedling size?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We were trying to use the seedling size as a proxy for “fitness” - or how well the plants can survive under these specific conditions. We were testing here whether any simple and directional strategy - such as increase or decrease in root:shoot ratio under salt stress - is resulting in better salt tolerance - which would translate into larger overall seedlings. We have rephrased this within the manuscript, to better explain the hypothesis being tested within this specific figure:</p>
<p>“To test whether there is a clear directional correlation between the change in root:shoot ratio and overall salt stress tolerance, we have used the overall seedling size as a proxy for plant salt tolerance (Fig. S4, S5). No significant correlation was found between the root:shoot growth ratio and total seedling size (Fig. S4, S5), indicating that the relationship between coordination of root and shoot growth and salt tolerance during the early seedling establishment is complex.”</p>

<p>Line 439 - I expect that many of your readers may not be experienced with GWAS. Can you provide an explanation as to why only one locus was detected with both the 250K SNP panel and the 4M SNP panel?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have added additional explanation to this observation:</p>
<p>“Increased SNP density can provide more potential associations, highlighting the associated loci with more confidence, due to more SNPs being detected within specific region. The different panels could capture different LD blocks across the genome. If the locus detected by both panels is in a region of strong LD or under selection, it could be detected consistently. In contrast, other loci may not be captured well by the lower-density 250K SNP panel. The new GWAS revealed 32 additional loci, with only one significantly associated locus being picked up by both 250k and 4M SNPs GWAS (locus 30, Table S3). The detection of only one common locus between the two SNP panels is likely due to differences in resolution, statistical power, and how well each panel captures the genomic regions associated with the trait. ”</p>

<p>Figure 2A and B - I suggest adding the p-value cutoff to the y-axis of the Manhattan Plots</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, however this is not appropriate. The genome wide p-value cutoffs for GWAS studies are arbitrary, and we have not used a genome-wide cutoff for our SNPs, but rather used cutoffs depending on the minor allele frequency. Therefore, we think adding a straight line to the graphs in Fig. 2A-B representing the overall cutoff, would be misleading. Please see below the text where we explain how the threshold was calculated for individual groups of SNPs with varying MAF:</p>
<p>“The GWAS associations were evaluated for minor allele count (MAC) and association strength above the Bonferroni threshold with -log10(p-value/#SNPs), calculated for each sub-population of SNPs above threshold MAC (Table S3, Bonf.threshold.MAC.specific)”</p>

<p>Line 490-492 - Presents the results of the gene tree to support a model in which SR3G diverged from AT3G50150 prior to the speciation events leading to Capsella and Arabidopsis. But this topology requires at least two independent losses of SR3G - can you rule out the hypothesis that the position of SR3G on the gene tree is a result of long branch attraction? Given the syntenic orientation of AT3G50150 and SR3G, and apparent directional selection experienced by the latter lineage, it seems more parsimonious that AT3G50150 and SR3G arose from a very recent duplication event.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that it seemed most parsimonious for AT3G50160 (SR3G) to be a recent tandem duplication of AT3G50150 – and this was certainly our expectation given the other tandem duplications that have occurred in this genomic region. However, irrespective of the type of alignment from which we built the phylogeny (nucleotide vs AA; sometimes nucleotide is noisier but provides more information) we were never able to recapitulate a tree where AT3G50160 was immediately sister to AT3G50150 – even with a long branch for AT3G50160 indicating a rapid pace of nucleotide/AA change relative to AT3G50150. In regards to long branch attraction, it is our interpretation that long branch attraction typically requires multiple long branches that get placed together at a poorly supported node where sampling is sparse (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-020-0233-0">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-020-0233-0</ext-link>), whereas we have the single long branch for AT3G50160, and all other A/C clade (Arabidopsis/Camelina/Capsella) members forming a lineage with a much shorter branch. To test the possibility of long branch attraction we subtracted out individual members of the AT3G50150/160 clade to see if there was algorithmic uncertainty in the placement of AT3G50160. We did not observe this in any of the branch subtractions that we performed (see below). Thus, it appears that we must stick with our original interpretation. If the reviewer would like us to soften this interpretation, we would be more than happy to do so, as it does not impact the overall conclusions for AT3G50160 being a rapidly evolving member of this clade.</p>

<p>Line 511 and Line 673 - Inspection of Figure S13B suggests that SR3G is not &quot;predominantly&quot; expressed nor does it have the &quot;highest enrichment&quot; in the root stele.

<p>We appreciate the reviewer for recognizing that SR3G is not a highly expressed gene. In root cell types, its expression is enriched in the root stele. Overall, SR3G is expressed at both early and later developmental stages. Our investigation of later developmental stages related to seed production did not reveal any significant phenotypic differences in fertility.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. Our study primarily focused on characterizing the main GWAS candidate, SR3G. Since SR3G is located within a cluster of other DUF247 genes on chromosome 3, we believe that screening the neighboring DUF247 genes could provide further insights into SR3G’s role in root development. Additionally, we believe that the generated data and lines will serve as a valuable resource for other researchers interested in studying these genes. For these reasons, we have decided to retain these datasets in the manuscript.</p>
