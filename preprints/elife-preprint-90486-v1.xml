<title>Abstract</title><p>Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology, rapidly increasing the number of available molecular structures. Because of this, as well as advances in structure prediction, the focus of structural biology has begun to shift to studying macromolecular structures in their native cellular environment. A dominant feature of cryo-EM images is shot noise, making the identification of small particles of interest difficult. This is further compounded by structural noise if these particles are imaged against a background of other molecules, such as inside a cell. 2D template matching (2DTM) can be used to localize complexes with high precision, even in the presence of cellular background. Once localized, these particles may be averaged together in 3D reconstructions; however, regions included in the template may suffer from template bias, leading to inflated resolution estimates and making the interpretation of high-resolution features unreliable. We evaluate conditions that minimize template bias and show that molecular features <italic>not</italic> present in the template can be reconstructed at high resolution from targets found by 2DTM, extending prior work at low-resolution. Moreover, we present a quantitative metric for template bias to aid the interpretation of 3D reconstructions calculated using particles localized by 2DTM.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last decade, single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a high- resolution technique to study molecules and their assemblies in a near-native state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Guaita et al., 2022</xref>). In the most favorable cases, close to 1 Å resolution can be achieved, rivaling results obtained by protein crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Nakane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Yip et al., 2020</xref>). The resolution obtained from a single-particle dataset depends on the quality of the images, the accuracy of particle alignment and imaging parameters, the structural integrity of the sample, and the number of particles contributing to a reconstruction. For a high-quality dataset, between 20,000 and 70,000 asymmetric units of well-aligned and homogeneous particles have to be averaged to reach sub 2 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Nakane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Yip et al., 2020</xref>). Methods development in a related cryo-EM technique has also enabled imaging particles <italic>in situ</italic> at high resolution using tomography and subtomogram averaging. These <italic>in situ</italic> subtomogram averages now approach 3 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Tegunov et al., 2021</xref>), a resolution obtained routinely for single-particle reconstructions <italic>in vitro</italic>. Data collection for tomography requires more time compared to the single-particle technique due to the need for acquiring a tilt series, and processing tends to be computationally more expensive due to the additional degrees of freedom, compared to 2D images used in the single-particle technique. An additional complication of subtomogram averaging for <italic>in situ</italic> imaging is the selection of valid targets, which have to be identified against a background of other molecules inside the cell or tissue being imaged. This is in contrast to a typical single-particle dataset, in which the particles have undergone a purification step that enriches the particle of interest, and imaged in solvent which makes particle selection more reliable.</p>
<p>2D template matching (2DTM) is an approach that can be used to identify target molecules and complexes in cryo-EM images of cells and cell sections, using single images of nominally untilted specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lucas et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Rickgauer et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2017</xref>). This approach can be used in combination with 3D template matching (3DTM) to identify targets in tomograms collected from the same areas imaged for 2DTM to achieve improved overall precision and sensitivity of target detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lucas et al., 2021</xref>). In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that the targets detected using 2DTM can be used to calculate 3D reconstructions showing novel details not present in the template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lucas et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>). 3D reconstruction is straightforward because for every detected target, 2DTM also determines their x,y location in the image, three Euler angles and image defocus, i.e., all the parameters needed to calculate a single-particle reconstruction. Using this approach, we revealed non-modeled density for the viral polymerase (VP1) bound to a rotavirus capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>), for the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) and tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lucas et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2021</xref>), as well as structural differences between <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> large ribosomal subunits (LSUs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lucas et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Interpretation of reconstructions obtained from 2DTM targets can be hindered by template bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lucas et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2021</xref>), i.e., the reproduction of modeled features included in the template, that are reproduced in the reconstructions, even though they do not correspond to structural features in the detected particles. This could result from inclusion of pure noise particles and/or local overfitting of particle parameters in the presence of signal. Our previous studies showed that template bias does not prevent the discovery of new structural features at low resolution that were not represented by the template, but it has yet to be determined if this is true for high- resolution features, which are more susceptible to noise overfitting. 2DTM could in principle be used to study the structure of targets at high-resolution, that would otherwise be too small to identify on their own, as long as they bind or are otherwise rigidly attached to a larger target that can be located by 2DTM. However, due to limitations in the number and heterogeneity of particles in previous studies, it was unclear whether this approach could indeed recover reliable high-resolution information.</p>
<p>In the present study, we explore this possibility further to assess the resolution that can be obtained in unmodeled regions omitted from the template. We analyze a published single particle dataset of β-galactosidase using 2DTM, and 60S LSUs detected in images of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lamellae. In both cases, we show high resolution in areas of the reconstruction that were omitted in the template, demonstrating the utility of 2DTM for structure discovery. We present a new metric to quantify template bias in a template-based 3D reconstruction, making reconstruction from 2DTM targets a more broadly useful tool.</p>

<title>Reconstruction of the beta-galactosidase ligand binding pocket</title>
<p>To show the potential of 2DTM to reveal new structural details at high resolution, we analyzed a published single-particle cryo-EM dataset of <italic>E. coli</italic> β-galactosidase (Bgal) bound to phenylethyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (PETG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Saur et al., 2020</xref>). The dataset was used previously to calculate a 2.2 Å single-particle reconstruction (EMDB-10574) that displays density for a number of specifically bound water molecules in the structure, including in the PETG binding pocket. The authors also built an atomic model into the high-resolution map (PDB: 6TTE). For our template, however, we used an atomic model of ligand-free Bgal determined by X-ray crystallography at 1.7 Å (PDB: 1DP0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Juers et al., 2000</xref>). Using a model that was built into a map that is independent from the data analyzed by 2DTM aids our demonstration of 2DTM as a tool that can make use of atomic models experimentally unrelated to the data being analyzed.</p>
<p>To demonstrate high resolution in areas omitted in the template, we removed atoms in the vicinity of all D2 symmetry-related ligand binding pockets, within a 10 Å radius centered on the side chain amide nitrogen atom of asparagine 102 (in PDB: 1DP0). The truncated atomic model was used to generate a template with <italic>cis</italic>TEM’s simulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Himes and Grigorieff, 2021</xref>) (see Methods). We searched 558 micrographs downloaded from the EMPIAR database (EMPIAR- 10644) and obtained 59,259 targets with 2DTM SNRs above a threshold of 7.3 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>), the standard threshold calculated to limit the average number of false positives to one per micrograph based on the given search parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>). To reduce the particles to a number closer to the final dataset used to calculate the 2.2 Å cryo-EM map in (49,895), and to enrich for the particles most similar to the template (similar to selecting the best classes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Saur et al., 2020</xref>), we limited our targets to those with 2DTM SNRs above 9.0 and obtained a final dataset of 55,627 particles.</p>

<p>The identified 55,627 targets were extracted together with their template-matched x,y positions, Euler angles and CTFFIND4-derived defocus values using prepare_stack_matchtemplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lucas et al., 2021</xref>), and the particle stack and alignment parameters were imported into <italic>cis</italic>TEM as a refinement package for further single particle processing. The Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Harauz and Heel, 1986</xref>) for the initial reconstruction calculated from the template-matched alignment parameters indicated a resolution of 2.4 Å (FSC = 0.143) (Rosenthal and Henderson,</p>
<p>2003). We performed further refinement against the template while keeping the refinement resolution limit of 3.0 Å – one cycle of defocus and beam tilt refinement, followed by a refinement of alignment parameters and another cycle of defocus and beam tilt parameters. The final reconstruction (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) displayed a resolution according to the FSC of 2.2 Å (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). As mentioned above and previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lucas et al., 2021</xref>), resolution estimates based on the FSC can be affected by template bias. Therefore, the present estimate has to be considered unreliable, and has to be supported by additional evidence, such as inspection of features visible in the density map.</p>
<p>Peaks corresponding to detected targets are clearly visible (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). The average 2DTM SNR for this dataset was 11.6, and a maximum of 16.3, which is in the range of what is expected for a 465-kDa target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Rickgauer et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">2017</xref>). The refined reconstruction shows clear density for PETG and water molecules in the ligand binding pocket that were omitted in the template (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Comparison of this reconstruction with the published map (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>) suggests that they are virtually identical and that there is little or no evidence of template bias in the 2DTM reconstruction. An assessment of the local resolution using Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Liebschner et al., 2019</xref>) further indicates a resolution of about 1.8 Å in the binding pocket, consistent with the clear density for water.</p>

<title>Baited reconstruction visualizes ribosomes at near atomic resolution in FIB-milled lamellae</title>
<p>To investigate whether 2DTM can be used to generate reliable high-resolution reconstructions from images derived from cellular samples, we used a previously published dataset of 37 images of 4 FIB-milled lamellae generated from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) to enrich the ribosome population in a single state (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lucas and Grigorieff, 2023</xref>). We identified 12210 large ribosomal subunits with 2DTM in the cytoplasm using a threshold of 7.85 which corresponds to an expectation of one false positive per image across the data set, or ∼0.3% of the particles (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Local positional and orientational refinement was performed using the <italic>cis</italic>TEM program refine_template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lucas et al., 2021</xref>) and the original template as a reference. The refined 2DTM coordinates were used to calculate an initial reconstruction with a nominal resolution of 3.15 Å (FSC = 0.143) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). One cycle of defocus and beam tilt alignment improved the resolution to 3.1 Å (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref></bold>). Unlike for the <italic>in vitro</italic> Bgal reconstruction, further refinement of the alignment parameters using the reconstruction as a reference caused the resolution to decrease to 8 Å. The reconstruction has reduced signal at high spatial frequencies relative to the template as indicated by the half-map FSC (<bold><xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). This, combined with the higher background and lack of low-resolution contrast of the ribosomes in the cellular lamella relative to a purified sample, may reduce the alignment accuracy relative to the high-resolution 2DTM template. This highlights the importance of high spatial frequencies for alignment of particles in images with strong background.</p>

</fig>
<p>As previously reported, we found density consistent with the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) and tRNAs, that did not derive from the template. In the present case, local resolution estimation shows that parts of the SSU are resolved at &lt; 4 Å resolution (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). The SSU is conformationally variable and shows considerable positional heterogeneity relative to the LSU. Therefore, this value is likely an underestimate of the potential attainable resolution in reconstructions from 2DTM targets in cells. Although the map represents an average of all states identified, we observed clear density for tRNAs in the A/A and P/P state with apparent density for the polypeptide on the A site tRNA (<bold><xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref></bold>) and no clear density for E-site tRNAs. This allowed us to conclude that CHX stalls ribosomes in the classical PRE translocation state <italic>in vivo</italic>, likely by preventing transition of the P/P tRNA to the P/E state consistent with an <italic>in vitro</italic> structure of the translating <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shen et al., 2021</xref>) and inference from ribosome profiling data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lareau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). The relatively low resolution of the tRNAs likely reflects the mixed pool of tRNA depending on the codons on which the ribosome stalled as well as a mixture of states.</p>

<title>Visualization of drug-target interactions in cells</title>
<p>Drug-target interactions can be visualized at high-resolution <italic>in vitro</italic> with cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography. However, it is unclear whether this recapitulates the binding site <italic>in vivo,</italic> possibly missing weak interactions that are disrupted during purification. Visualizing drug target interactions in cells is therefore an important goal. We observed additional density near the ribosomal E site not present in the template that is consistent with the position of CHX in a previously published crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Loubresse et al., 2014</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). The density was sufficiently well resolved to dock CHX and provide <italic>in vivo</italic> confirmation for the position and orientation of CHX binding in the E site.</p>
<p>We noted several key differences between the model built from the <italic>in vitro</italic> CHX-bound structure and the <italic>in situ</italic> CHX-bound structure. Firstly, we did not observe density for eIF5A but did observe density consistent with binding of spermidine (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>), as has been observed previously for the <italic>in vitro</italic> CHX-bound <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> ribosome (PDB: 7R81) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shen et al., 2021</xref>). This demonstrates that spermidine can bind to ribosomes within cells, however, whether spermidine binds as part of the translation cycle or whether stalling of translation with CHX allowed for spermidine to bind is unclear. Baited reconstruction with 2DTM could be used to further probe the function of polyamides to regulate translation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Baited reconstruction using the large ribosomal subunit as a template model allowed us to visualize the binding of small molecules such as drugs and polyamides to the ribosome within cells. This demonstrates the power of baited reconstruction to reveal biologically relevant features that would only be evident at high resolution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Omit templates reveal high resolution features without template bias</title>
<p>The local resolution of parts of the LSU were measured at ∼3 Å, however, this region overlapped with the template and therefore the resolution measure using standard tools may be unreliable.</p>
<p>To assess the resolution in this region we repeated this experiment with a template that lacked the ribosomal protein L7A. Since this protein was not present in the template, any density in this region cannot be due to template bias. We found that the local resolution of L7A was indistinguishable from the surrounding density and showed varying local resolution from 3.2 to 4.5 Å (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref></bold>). The density was sufficiently well resolved to observe side chains in regions that were lacking from the template (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). This suggests that baited reconstruction with 2DTM coordinates can be used to generate high-resolution reconstructions from cellular samples, free from template bias, and demonstrates an approach to verify local resolution estimates.</p>

<p>To examine the recovery of high-resolution information with single residue precision, we generated another truncated template by removing every 20<sup>th</sup> residue from each chain. This resulted in a total reduction of 51 kDa or ∼3% of the template mass. We then localized 12090 targets using the same 2DTM protocol as for the full-length template. The small difference in template mass minimally affected target detection, only 120 targets (&lt;1%) were missed, and there were minimal deviations in the locations and orientations for the remaining targets. The 3D reconstruction generated from the detected targets showed clear density corresponding to nucleotides (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,E</xref></bold>) and various amino acids (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-K</xref></bold>) that were missing from the template and therefore cannot derive from template bias. This demonstrates that omitting small randomly scattered regions from a 2DTM template can be used to assess template bias throughout the reconstruction.</p>

<title>Quantifying template bias</title>
<p>The calculation of reconstructions from targets identified by 2DTM, which relies on <italic>a priori</italic> structural models, bears the danger of generating results that reproduce features of the template even when these features are absent from the targets to be detected. In the field of cryo-EM, this is often referred to as the “Einstein from noise” problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Henderson, 2013</xref>). The risk of template bias increases with dataset size (number of images), as well as the ratio of false positives vs true positives. Template bias in reconstructions generated from 2DTM targets is generally avoided because the scoring function (SNR threshold) is set to reject most false positives. To quantify template bias in reconstructions at various 2DTM SNR thresholds, we generated a series of reconstructions at different thresholds using targets identified with a full-length LSU template (“full” template) and the template lacking 3% of the residues (“omit” template) covering different areas of the model, while retaining most detections relative to the full template as described above (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). We wrote a new <italic>cis</italic>TEM program measure_template_bias (see Methods) that calculates the difference between map densities <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>full</italic></sub> and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>omit</italic></sub> in these reconstructions, in the omitted regions:

</fig>
<p>As expected, for high 2DTM SNR thresholds (few or no false positives), the template bias Ω was only a few percent, while for lower thresholds, it approached 100% (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). This was consistent with increased density in the reconstructions using the full template relative to the omit template (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). The observed lower limit of Ω of ∼8% (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>) is likely due to some overfitting of noise when template-matching true particles, rather than inclusion of false positives. Further work to quantify Ω at different spatial frequencies will be informative to assess the contribution of local overfitting to template bias.</p>
<p>If we assume that the template bias is proportional to the rate of false positive detection, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub>, we can plot the expected false positive rate, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>f</italic>,<italic>model</italic></sub>, against the observed template bias Ω (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). The expected false positive rate is given by the complementary error function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>) as
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="547552v1_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>SNR<sub>t</sub></italic> is the 2DTM SNR threshold applied to the template search results. The plot shows that the template bias is not proportional to the expected false positive rate (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). This is likely due to the variable background found in images of lamellae, which means that the spectral whitening that is applied to the images before the search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>) does not whiten all areas of the images evenly. This results in local deviations of the background (noise) distribution from the Gaussian noise model implied in Eq. (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>), leading to higher-than-expected false positive ratios at low SNR thresholds.</p>
<p>If we estimate the number of true targets at 13456 (the number of targets identified by both templates at a threshold of 7.85) and recalculate the number of false positives as the overall number of detected targets in excess of this number, the template bias is approximately proportional to the false positive rate (red line in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). Further work is required to develop an improved noise model that predicts the correct number of false positives in images of variable contrast, such as images of cellular lamellae.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We show here that baited reconstruction with 2DTM can reveal high resolution detail in regions not modeled in the template. Using a previously published single particle dataset we observe interactions between specific sidechains with water and a ligand. Using particles localized in FIB-milled yeast lamellae, we observe specific binding of the drug CHX and polyamides to the ribosome in cells. We show that baited reconstruction can be used to recover high-resolution features in cells without template bias in regions omitted from the template, and quantify template bias in regions overlapping the template. The use of 2D images to generate high resolution reconstructions makes this process significantly faster and less computationally expensive relative to tomography. Baited reconstruction is analogous to a “pull down” assay in molecular biology, wherein a “bait” molecule is used to capture and identify novel interacting “prey”. This strategy is distinct from prior structure determination strategies because it makes use of a high-resolution template, traditionally avoided to prevent introducing template bias artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Henderson, 2013</xref>). Baited reconstruction leverages the advantages of precise targeting with a high-resolution template, while avoiding the template bias by focusing on regions omitted from, or external to the template. Baited reconstruction can therefore leverage the wealth of existing structural data, as well as molecular models generated by the newly available structure prediction tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Baek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>), to approach biological and pharmacological questions <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Implications for drug discovery</title>
<p>One of the most direct applications of this approach is to drug discovery. During the drug development pipeline, potentially thousands of variants of a lead compound are tested relative to a single protein target. Determining the structures of each in complex with its protein partner using the traditional single-particle cryo-EM workflow can be time-consuming and laborious, and often requires image processing expertise. The strategy presented here could be used to streamline this process substantially.</p>
<p>The ribosome is a major target of antibiotic and anticancer drugs. We have demonstrated that baited reconstruction with 2DTM can reveal drug-ribosome interactions directly in cells. The reconstructions are at comparable resolution relative to the state-of-the-art from tomography, while using a more streamlined data collection and processing pipeline that could be easily automated. This approach could therefore be used to more efficiently characterize the mechanism of action of antibiotic drugs directly in cells. Since 2DTM does not require purification, the interactions with other cellular complexes can also be investigated.</p>

<title>2DTM accelerates high-resolution in situ structure determination</title>
<p>Baited reconstruction is substantially faster and a more streamlined pipeline for <italic>in situ</italic> structure determination compared to cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging. Current pipelines for <italic>in situ</italic> structure determination using cryo-ET and sub-tomogram averaging are time-consuming and require expert knowledge to curate an effective pipeline. We expect focused classification to identify sub-populations to further improve the resolution of <italic>in situ</italic> reconstructions from 2DTM targets. This shows that it is not necessary to use tomography to generate high-resolution reconstructions of macromolecular complexes in cells, vastly reducing the time and expense for structure determination in cells.</p>
<p>Our approach also differs from the recently published isSPA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cheng et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">2021</xref>). isSPA follows the traditional single-particle workflow, applied to particles in their native environment. Particles are selected using a template that is limited to an intermediate resolution of 8 Å, resulting in an initial particle stack that contains many false positives. Selection of the top scores, followed by standard single-particle classification and alignment protocols then yields reconstructions of the detected targets. This approach is particularly successful in situations where there is a high concentration of the particle of interest, such as Rubisco inside the carboxysome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>), capsid proteins in viral capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>), and phycobilisome and photosystem II in the thylakoid membranes inside <italic>Pennisetum purpureum</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cheng et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, using 2DTM, we select targets with high fidelity, avoid false positives, and determine the molecule pose to high accuracy without the need for an intermediate reconstruction from the detected targets to act as reference for further refinement.</p>
<p>By using the full resolution of the signal present in the images, 2DTM is also more sensitive than isSPA. These differences mean that 2DTM requires fewer, and potentially smaller particles to achieve high-resolution structures compared to isSPA and other techniques following the canonical single-particle averaging workflow. As demonstrated here, the detection criterion used in 2DTM largely avoids overfitting artifacts in reconstructions by eliminating images that are not statistically distinguishable from noise. This makes 2DTM particularly useful for <italic>in situ</italic> structure determination, which is often limited by the low abundance of the target complexes inside the cell. By reducing the number of particles needed to achieve high-resolution reconstructions in cells, baited reconstruction with 2DTM will make it possible to determine the structures of less abundant complexes in cells.</p>

<title>Application to in vitro single particle analysis</title>
<p>Our results of a single particle dataset of purified Bgal demonstrates another use case for 2DTM. In the original analysis of this dataset using the traditional single-particle workflow, 136013 particles were initially selected using template-based particle picking (Gautomatch 0.56, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/">http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Saur et al., 2020</xref>). 2D classification, ab-initio reconstruction, and further 3D classification eventually yielded a 2.2 Å reconstruction showing the bound ligand (PETG). The same result was achieved with a simple run of 2DTM, without requiring manual intervention or expert knowledge. In a separate 2DTM search using the first 277 images of the dataset and a crystal structure of GroEL (PDB: 1GRL) as a template— a particle of comparable size to Bgal— we detected only 53 targets above the default SNR threshold (excluding two images that had sharp black lines across them), and none above a threshold of 9.0. This further demonstrates the high level of discrimination of 2DTM between true and false positives, as shown earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rickgauer et al., 2017</xref>). Besides the streamlined workflow, 2DTM can therefore also be used in the presence of impurities to reliably select the particles of interest. Using multiple templates, particles could be classified to arrive at quantitative estimates of particles occupying defined conformational states. The reduced need for sample purity and dataset size to perform such analyses may further accelerate the 2DTM workflow, compared to the traditional single particle workflow, provided appropriate templates are available.</p>
<p>Furthermore, validation of map and model quality is a major challenge in cryo-EM. Current methods use low-pass filtered templates to avoid template bias at high-spatial frequencies. We here present a quantitative estimate of local and global template bias in sequence space. This will allow the full resolution of the template to be used to localize particles more specifically and avoid false positives. This may assist in identification of particle classes in the localization stage and can streamline the reconstruction process. Estimating template bias with baited reconstruction can provide a quantitative metric of map and model quality that may find broad utility in single particle and in situ workflows.</p>

<title>Future applications</title>
<p>We have shown that it is possible to recover single residue detail, and even the location of water molecules in the most favorable cases, using baited reconstruction with cryo-EM. This approach is analogous to the use of OMIT maps in X-ray crystallography to avoid model bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bhat and Cohen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hodel et al., 1992</xref>) and the M-free used to estimate reference bias in subtomogram averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Yu and Frangakis, 2014</xref>). Our approach differs by sampling random residues throughout the sequence and consequently provides higher precision in the estimation of template bias at high resolution. By further analogy to X-ray crystallography, the strategy we presented here could be extended by tiling through the template model, omitting overlapping features and combining the densities in each omitted region to form a continuous 3D map in which the density for each residue was omitted from the template, comparable in principle to a composite OMIT map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Terwilliger et al., 2008</xref>). While currently computationally expensive and therefore not feasible in most cases, this strategy could yield a reconstruction that is devoid of template bias while retaining the benefits of precise localization and identification of the targets.</p>

<title>Quantifying template bias</title>
<p>We wrote a program, measure_template_bias, which is part of the <italic>cis</italic>TEM software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Grant et al., 2018</xref>), to assess the degree of template bias present in a reconstruction, calculated from detected 2DTM targets. The program requires two templates on input, one template representing the full structure of the targets to be found (full template), and one containing omitted elements of the structure that serve as test regions to assess template bias (omit template). The program also requires the two reconstructions that were calculated form targets detected by these two templates (full reconstruction and omit reconstruction). The two templates and the two reconstructions have to be identically density-scaled, respectively. Using the two templates, measure_template_bias calculates a difference map that leaves only non-zero densities in areas omitted in the omit template. The difference map is then used as a mask to identify the test regions used to assess template bias. The densities in the test regions are summed for the two input reconstructions, yielding <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>full</italic></sub> and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>omit</italic></sub>, respectively. The average degree of template bias (Ω) is then defined as the difference between <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>full</italic></sub> and <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>omit</italic></sub>, relative to <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>full</italic></sub> (Eq. (<xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>)). Ω can assume values between 0 and 1 (100%), with 0 representing the least degree of template bias, and 1 representing the highest degree of template bias. If the degree of template bias has to be evaluated more locally, measure_template_bias also accepts a difference map, instead of the two templates, that will be used to identify the areas to be used for measuring template bias.</p>

<p>This study provides an <bold>important</bold> demonstration of how the false-positive rate of high-resolution 2D template matching to find particles of a given target structure in 2D cryo-EM images (2DTM) relates to overfitting the data towards the template. The authors present new methods to measure the amount of model bias that gets introduced in high-resolution features of such maps, with <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that high-resolution features that are not present in the template can still be reconstructed in 3D from images obtained by 2DTM. The paper could be strengthened by the inclusion of a more elaborate discussion (and possibly additional experiments) to describe the limitations of 2DTM for smaller target structures.</p>

<p>This work continues a series of recent publications from the Grigorieff lab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25648">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25648</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68946">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68946</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79272">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.79272</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2301852120">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2301852120</ext-link>) showcasing the development of high-resolution 2D template matching (2DTM) for detection and reconstruction of macromolecules in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images of crowded cellular environments. It is well known in the field of cryo-EM that searching noisy images with a template can result in retrieval of the template itself when averaging the candidate particles detected, an effect known as &quot;Einstein-from-noise&quot; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1314449110">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1314449110</ext-link>). Briefly, this occurs because it is statistically likely to find a match to an arbitrary motif over a large noisy dataset just by chance. The effect can be mitigated for example by limiting the resolution of the template, but this prevents the accurate detection of macromolecules in a crowded environment, as their &quot;fingerprint&quot; lies in the high-resolution range (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25648">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25648</ext-link>). Here, the authors show through several experiments on in vitro and in situ data that features as small as drug compounds and water molecules can be reliably retrieved by 2DTM if they are searched by a template (the &quot;bait&quot;) that contains expected neighboring features but not the targets themselves.</p>
<p>The ideas are generally clearly presented with appropriate references to related work, and claims are well supported by the data. In particular, the experiments for verifying the density of the ribosomal protein L7A as well as the systematic removal of residuals from the template model to assess bias are particularly clever.</p>
<p>One key point that could use further clarification is how to interpret densities in the reconstruction that do overlap with the template. If the omitted regions can be reliably reconstructed, and the density is smooth throughout, it implies the detected particles are not only (mostly) true positives but also their poses must be essentially correct. Therefore, why cannot the entire reconstruction be trusted, including portions overlapping with the template? In the &quot;Future applications&quot; section, the authors state that in order to obtain a reconstruction that is entirely devoid of template bias, it would be necessary to successively omit parts of the template structure through its entirety. I wonder if that is really necessary and if the presented approach of omitting template portions could be better framed as a &quot;gold-standard&quot; validation procedure.</p>
<p>In other words, given the compelling evidence provided by the reconstructions in the omitted areas, I find it hard to imagine how the procedure would be &quot;hallucinating&quot; features in the rest of the structure, as the entire reconstruction depends on the same pose and defocus parameters. A possible experiment to test this hypothesis would be to go the opposite way, deliberately adding an unrealistic feature to the bait and checking whether it comes up in the reconstruction, while at the same time checking how it behaves in omitted parts.</p>
<p>When assessing their approach to in situ data (the yeast ribosome), it is intriguing to see that the resolution downgraded from 3.1 to 8 Å when refinement of the particle poses against the current reconstruction was attempted. The authors do provide some possible explanations, such as the reduced signal of the reconstruction at high resolution and the crowded background, but it leaves one to wonder if this means that a 3.1 Å reconstruction could never be obtained from these data by conventional single-particle analysis procedures.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the section &quot;Quantifying template bias&quot;, the authors make the intriguing statement that there can still be some overfitting of noise even in true positives. I understand this overfitting would occur in the form of errors in the pose and defocus estimation, but a clarification would be helpful.</p>
<p>In the Discussion, the claim that &quot;it is not necessary to use tomography to generate high-resolution reconstructions of macromolecular complexes in cells&quot; is a misconception, at least in part. As demonstrated in works by the same group and others (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100166">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xinn.2021.100166</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36175-y">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36175-y</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05831-0">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05831-0</ext-link>), 2D imaging of native cellular environments does offer a faster and better way to obtain high-resolution reconstructions compared to tomography. However, tomography provides the entire 3D context of the macromolecules, such as their localization to membranes and the cellular architecture, which can be readily visualized in a tomogram even at low resolution, so methods for structure determination from tilt series data such as subtomogram averaging remain of paramount importance. Most likely, a combination of 2D and 3D imaging approaches will be necessary to retrieve both the highest structural resolution and their cellular context to address biological questions.</p>
<p>The &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; section lacks a description of transmission electron microscopy data collection.</p>
<p>Finally, the preprint version of this work posted on bioRxiv (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.03.547552">https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.03.547552</ext-link>) contains the following competing interests statement, which is missing from the submitted version:</p>

<p>This paper by Lucas et al follows on from earlier work by the same group. They use high-resolution 2D template matching (2DTM) to find particles of a given target structure in 2D cryo-EM images, either of in vitro single-particle samples or of more complicated samples, such as FIB-milled cells (which would otherwise perhaps be used for 3D electron tomography). One major concern for high-resolution template matching has been the amount of model bias that gets introduced into a reconstruction that is calculated straight from the orientations and positions identified by the projection matching algorithm. This paper assesses the amount of model bias that gets introduced in high-resolution features of such maps.</p>
<p>For a high-signal-to-noise in vitro single-particle cryo-EM data set, the authors show that their approach does not yield much model bias. This is probably not very surprising, as their method is basically a low false-positive particle picker, which works very well on such data. Still, I guess that is the whole point of it, and it is good to see that they can reconstruct density for a small-molecule compound that was not present in the original template.</p>
<p>For FIB-milled lamella of yeast cells with stalled ribosomes, the SNR is much lower and the dangers of model bias will be higher. This is also evidenced by the observation that further refinement of initial 2DTM-identified orientations and positions worsens the map. This is obviously a more relevant SNR regime to assess their method. Still, they show convincing density for the GHX compound that was not present in the template but was there in the reconstruction from the identified particles.</p>
<p>Quantification of the amount of model bias is then performed using omit maps, where every 20th residue is removed from the template and corresponding reconstructions are compared (for those residues) with the full-template reconstructions. As expected, model bias increases with lower thresholds for the picking. Some model bias (Omega=8%) remains even for very high thresholds. The authors state this may be due to overfitting of noise when template-matching true particles, instead of introducing false positives. Probably, that still represents some sort of problem. Especially because the authors then go on to show that their expectation of the number of false positives does not always match the correct number of false positives, probably due to inaccuracies in the noise model for more complicated images. This may warrant further in-depth discussion in a revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Overall, I think this paper is well written and it has made me think differently (again) about the 2DTM technique and its usefulness in various applications, as outlined in the Discussion. Therefore, it will be a constructive contribution to the field.</p>

<p>The authors evaluate the effect of high-resolution 2D template matching on template bias in reconstructions, and provide a quantitative metric for overfitting. It is an interesting manuscript that made me reevaluate and correct some mistakes in my understanding of overfitting and template bias, and I'm sure it will be of great use to others in the field. However, its main point is to promote high-resolution 2D template matching (2DTM) as a more universal analysis method for in vitro and, more importantly, in situ data. While the experiments performed to that end are sound and well-executed in principle, I fail to make that specific conclusion from their results.</p>
<p>The authors correctly point out that overfitting is largely enabled by the presence of false-positives in the data set. They go on to perform their in situ experiments with ribosomes, which provide an extremely favorable amount of signal that is unrealistic for the vast majority of the proteome. This seems cherry-picked to keep the number of false-positives and false-negatives low. The relationship between overfitting/false-positive rate and the picking threshold will remain the same for smaller proteins (which is a very useful piece of knowledge from this study). However, the false-negative rate will increase a lot compared to ribosomes if the same high picking threshold is maintained. This will limit the applicability of 2DTM, especially for less-abundant proteins.</p>
<p>I would like to see an ablation study: Take significantly smaller segments of the ribosome (for which the authors already have particle positions from full-template matching, which are reasonably close to the ground-truth), e.g. 50 kDa, 100 kDa, 200 kDa etc., and calculate the false-negative rate for the same picking threshold. If the resulting number of particles does plummet, it would be very helpful to discuss how that affects the utility of 2DTM for non-ribosomes in situ.</p>
<p>Another point of concern is the dramatic resolution decrease to 8 A after multiple iterations of refinement against experimental reconstructions described in line 159. Was this a local search from the poses provided by 2DTM, or something more global? While this is not a manifestation of overfitting as the authors have conclusively shown, I think it adds an important point to the ongoing &quot;But do we really need tomograms, or can we just 2D everything?&quot; debate in the field, which is also central to the 2D part of 2DTM. Reaching 8 A with 12k ribosome particles would be considered a rather poor subtomogram averaging result these days. Being in the &quot;we need tilt series to be less affected by non-Gaussian noise&quot; camp myself, I wonder if this indicates 2D images are inherently worse for in situ samples. If they are, the same limitations would extend to template matching. In that case, shouldn't the authors advocate for 3DTM instead of 2DTM? It may not be needed for ribosomes, but could give smaller proteins the necessary edge.</p>
<p>Right now, this study is also an invitation to practitioners who do not understand the picking threshold used here and cannot relate it to other template-matching programs to do a lot of questionable template matching and claim that the results are true because templates are &quot;unoverfittable&quot;. I think such undesirable consequences should be discussed prominently.</p>
