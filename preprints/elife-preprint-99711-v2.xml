<title>Abstract</title><p>Glutamate and GABA co-transmitting neurons exist in several brain regions; however, the mechanism by which these two neurotransmitters are co-released from the same synaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, we show that the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) to dentate granule cell synapses, which co-release glutamate and GABA, exhibit differences between glutamate and GABA release properties in paired-pulse ratio, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, presynaptic receptor modulation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-vesicle coupling configuration. Moreover, uniquantal synaptic responses show independent glutamatergic and GABAergic responses. Morphological analysis reveals that most SuM terminals form distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in proximity, each characterized by GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 labeling, respectively. Notably, glutamate/GABA co-transmission exhibits distinct short-term plasticities, with frequency-dependent depression of glutamate and frequency-independent stable depression of GABA. Our findings suggest that glutamate and GABA are co-released from different synaptic vesicles within the SuM terminals, and reveal that distinct transmission modes of glutamate/GABA co-release serve as frequency-dependent filters of SuM inputs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the classical view of Dale’s Principle known as “one neuron, one transmitter” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Eccles et al., 1954</xref>), a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that many types of neurons in several brain regions co-release multiple neurotransmitters including classical neurotransmitters (glutamate, GABA, glycine, and acetylcholine), monoamines, purines, and neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Vaaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Trudeau and El Mestikawy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wallace and Sabatini, 2023</xref>). While this co-release is thought to contribute to several brain functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Nusbaum et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Trudeau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tritsch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim and Sabatini, 2023</xref>), little is known about the functional implications of the co-release of two or more neurotransmitters into neural circuits and the molecular mechanisms of how multiple neurotransmitters are co-transmitted. Here, we define co-release as the release of multiple neurotransmitters from a single neuron, regardless of whether the neurotransmitters are packaged in the same or different synaptic vesicles, and co-transmission as synaptic transmission occurring by multiple neurotransmitters and detected by distinct postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wallace and Sabatini, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The cellular and molecular mechanisms of co-release are diverse across brain areas. In particular, the transmission modes of co-release, whether two neurotransmitters are released from the same vesicles or separate vesicles, and whether they are released from the same release sites or spatially segregated release sites, depend on the cell type in a given circuit. Co-packaging of GABA/glycine or glutamate/acetylcholine is found in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jonas et al., 1998</xref>) and brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nabekura et al., 2004</xref>), and in the axon terminals of the medial habenula in the interpeduncular nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ren et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Frahm et al., 2015</xref>), respectively. In contrast, the co-release of GABA and acetylcholine from different synaptic vesicles has been reported in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>), and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Takacs et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the spatially segregated co-release of glutamate/glycine or glutamate/dopamine has been reported in a subset of retinal amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), as well as in the axon terminals from a subset of midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fortin et al., 2019</xref>), respectively. Importantly, dual-transmitter co-release from distinct vesicle populations or release sites can result in different release properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Takacs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Silm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zych and Ford, 2022</xref>) and induce diverse effects to spatially different postsynaptic target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sengupta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Granger et al., 2020</xref>). These divergent transmission properties of co-release can regulate the circuit functions underlying distinct physiological and behavioral roles.</p>
<p>The co-release of glutamate and GABA, both fast-acting and functionally opposing neurotransmitters, has recently been identified in several brain regions of the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Trudeau and El Mestikawy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim and Sabatini, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wallace and Sabatini, 2023</xref>). In particular, the lateral habenula and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus have been extensively studied for the co-release of glutamate and GABA. The lateral habenula neurons receive glutamate/GABA co-releasing synaptic inputs from the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Root et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>). Hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) neurons projecting to the DG also co-release glutamate and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Billwiller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ajibola et al., 2021</xref>). To understand how synaptic inputs mediated by the co-release of the excitatory action of glutamate and the inhibitory action of GABA are integrated and impact postsynaptic cells, it is necessary to elucidate how glutamate and GABA are co-released from the synaptic terminals. Mechanistically, if glutamate and GABA are co-released from distinct vesicle populations, each release could be differently regulated by distinct release mechanisms. Such distinct co-release modes of glutamate and GABA are expected to implement different presynaptic plasticity, which will have diverse effects on postsynaptic neurons in response to different activity patterns. By contrast, if two neurotransmitters are co-released from the same synaptic vesicles, both glutamate and GABA release are expected to be under the same regulation.</p>
<p>Whether glutamate and GABA are packaged in the same or separate vesicles remains controversial. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated the co-packaging of glutamate and GABA in the same synaptic vesicles at EP-lateral habenular synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, an immunoelectron microscopy (immuno-EM) study demonstrated that glutamatergic and GABAergic vesicle populations are segregated in the axon terminals of the EP and VTA projections in the lateral habenula, and that single terminals form both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>). The same study also reported that glutamate and GABA are segregated into distinct vesicle populations within the axon terminals of the SuM projections in the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>). However, the mode of co-release of glutamate and GABA from the SuM terminals has never been functionally addressed.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the release properties of glutamate/GABA co-transmission at SuM-dentate granule cell (GC) synapses. We demonstrate that glutamate/GABA co-transmission shows independent synaptic responses and differential short-term plasticity and that their postsynaptic targets are segregated. Our results suggest that the segregation of two different populations of transmitters makes it possible to exert short-term dynamic changes in the co-transmission balance of glutamate and GABA and modulate GC activity in a frequency-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Glutamate/GABA co-transmission shows different release probabilities and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivities</title>
<p>To optogenetically stimulate SuM inputs in the DG, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was expressed in SuM neurons by injecting a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding ChR2-eYFP (AAV-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP) into the lateral SuM of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2)-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hirai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tabuchi et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boulland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Billwiller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ajibola et al., 2021</xref>), the vast majority of ChR2-eYFP-expressing SuM boutons in the DG co-expressed VGluT2 and vesicular GABA transporter (vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter, VIAAT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from GCs in acute hippocampal slices and recorded optically evoked excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs or IPSCs) at SuM-GC synapses in the presence of picrotoxin or NBQX/D-AP5, respectively. To examine whether the co-release of glutamate and GABA exhibits the same or different release properties, we first monitored the paired-pulse ratio (PPR), an index of the change in presynaptic transmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>), of glutamate/GABA co-transmission by paired stimulation (inter-stimulus interval: 100 ms). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tabuchi et al., 2022</xref>), both EPSCs and IPSCs at SuM-GC synapses exhibited paired-pulse depression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, we found that PPR was significantly different between EPSCs and IPSCs; EPSCs were more depressed than IPSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) (EPSC: 0.46 ± 0.03, n = 8; IPSC: 0.6 ± 0.03, n = 8, p &lt; 0.01, unpaired t test). It is possible that direct illumination of presynaptic terminals could increase transmitter release due to the broadening of the presynaptic waveform or direct influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through ChR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jackman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rost et al., 2022</xref>). To avoid this possibility, we stimulated SuM axons instead of SuM terminals (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), and obtained similar results to terminal illumination (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1C-F</xref>). ChR2 desensitization could depress the second synaptic responses evoked by the paired-pulse stimulation due to the participation of fewer SuM fibers in mediating synaptic transmission. To test this possibility, the fiber volley evoked by light illumination was extracellularly recorded from supragranular layer. We found that the amplitudes of the second fiber volley was comparable to that of the first fiber volley (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that ChR2-expressing SuM fibers were activated to the same extent by paired-pulse light illumination. Altogether, these results suggest that the release probability differs between the co-released glutamate and GABA from SuM terminals in the DG.</p>

<p>Since vesicular exocytosis depends on the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, we next examined whether reducing the release probability by lowering the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration could have different effects on glutamate/GABA co-transmission. Reducing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 2.5 to 1 mM decreased the amplitudes of EPSCs and IPSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>) (EPSC: n = 14, p &lt; 0.001, paired t test; IPSC: n = 15, p &lt; 0.001, paired t test). Remarkably, IPSCs decreased to a greater extent than EPSCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>) (EPSC: 45.1 ± 4.1% of reduction, n = 14; IPSC: 58.2 ± 2.7% of reduction, n = 15, p &lt; 0.01, unpaired t test), suggesting different Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivities for glutamate and GABA release.</p>

<title>Co-release of glutamate and GABA differs in presynaptic modulation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-vesicle coupling configuration</title>
<p>To further investigate whether the release properties of glutamate and GABA at SuM-GC synapses are different, we next examined whether glutamate and GABA co-release are mediated by different types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. We found that the application of μ-conotoxin-GVIA (μ-CgTx), an N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, had no effect on EPSCs or IPSCs at SuM-GC synapses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) (EPSC: 92.5 ± 13.8% of baseline, n = 6, p = 0.53, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; IPSC: 101.7 ± 11% of baseline, n = 6, p = 0.89, paired t test). We confirmed that μ-CgTx inhibited CA3-CA1 transmission (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wu and Saggau, 1994</xref>), suggesting that μ-CgTx we used is effective. In contrast, the application of μ-agatoxin-IVA (μ-Aga-IVA), a P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, suppressed both EPSCs and IPSCs to the same extent at SuM-GC synapses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) (EPSC: 23.5 ± 4.6% of baseline, n = 5, p &lt; 0.001, paired t test; IPSC: 23.9 ± 1.9% of baseline, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; EPSC vs IPSC: p = 0.92, unpaired t test), suggesting that both glutamate and GABA release rely on P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at SuM-GC synapses.</p>

<p>If the synaptic vesicle pools for glutamate and GABA are identical, the effects of presynaptic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) modulation on both transmissions are expected to be the same. We therefore examined how glutamate/GABA co-transmission is regulated by presynaptic GPCRs. We previously demonstrated that the co-transmission of glutamate and GABA at SuM-GC synapses is presynaptically suppressed by group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>). In agreement with this, application of the group II mGluR agonist DCG-IV suppressed both EPSCs and IPSCs at SuM-GC synapses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably, DCG-IV inhibited EPSCs (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.11 μM) to a greater extent than it did IPSCs (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.27 μM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) (two-way ANOVA, F<sub>1,51</sub> = 8.1, p &lt; 0.01). Similar results were found with the application of 5 μM GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist baclofen, which suppressed EPSCs more than IPSCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) (EPSC: 51.6 ± 2.4% inhibition, n = 8; IPSC: 38.6 ± 4.3% inhibition, n = 8, p &lt; 0.05, unpaired t test). These differential inhibitory effects of GPCRs on glutamatergic and GABAergic co-transmission are contrary to the expected idea of identical vesicle pools for glutamate and GABA but favor the hypothesis of separate vesicles for glutamate and GABA.</p>
<p>Spatial coupling between presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors of exocytosis is an essential feature in determining the properties of neurotransmitter release, and tight or loose coupling is distinguished by using two different binding rate Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators BAPTA and EGTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>). We examined the effects of these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators on the co-transmission of glutamate and GABA. We found that the bath application of BAPTA-AM suppressed both EPSCs and IPSCs to the same extent (EPSC: 63.4 ± 12.2% of baseline, n = 7, p &lt; 0.01, paired t test; IPSC: 63.4 ± 7.8% of baseline, n = 8, p &lt; 0.001, paired t test; EPSC vs. IPSC: p = 0.96, unpaired t test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, EGTA-AM suppressed EPSCs, whereas it did not affect IPSCs (EPSC: 67.4 ± 7.2% of baseline, n = 6, p &lt; 0.01, paired t test; IPSC: 93.1 ± 9.2% of baseline, n = 6, p = 0.40, Wilcoxon signed rank test; EPSC vs. IPSC: p &lt; 0.05, unpaired t test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These results indicate tighter coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles for GABA release than for glutamate release.</p>

<title>Minimal light stimulation of SuM inputs elicits independent EPSCs and IPSCs in GCs</title>
<p>Given that light stimulation at normal intensity elicits synchronized release of neurotransmitters from several SuM terminals, it is difficult to evoke a synaptic response mediated by a single vesicle release. For this purpose, we next performed minimal light stimulation to detect stochastic synaptic responses of independent EPSCs and IPSCs, or compound EPSC/IPSC responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). In this experiment, optical stimulation (over-bouton illumination) was delivered in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) to exclude SuM inputs-mediated polysynaptic responses, together with D-AP5 to block NMDA receptors. We also decreased the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration to 1 mM to reduce the release probability. At intermediate holding membrane potentials (–20 to – 30 mV), maximum light power illumination elicited biphasic responses (EPSC-IPSC sequence), enabling simultaneous recordings of glutamate/GABA co-transmission in GCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, left). After confirming the existence of biphasic PSCs, the light power intensity was decreased to detect small synaptic events, that were stochastically observed among the 100 times stimulations (success rate = ∼15%) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A, 3B</xref>, and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this method, we analyzed 1700 trials from 17 cells and detected 86 EPSC-only, 67 IPSC-only, and 19 biphasic events (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>). These results indicate that independent EPSCs and IPSCs are the majority of synaptic responses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) (EPSC: 5.1 ± 0.5% probability; IPSC: 3.9 ± 0.4% probability; biphasic: 1.1 ± 0.3% probability, n = 17, EPSC vs biphasic, p &lt; 0.001; IPSC vs biphasic, p &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test). To exclude the possibility that the independent EPSCs and IPSCs detected by minimal light stimulation might have masked the putative tiny synaptic responses of their counterpart currents mediated by the associated transmitters, the amplitudes and kinetics of minimal stimulation-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were compared with or without blockers of their counterpart receptors. We found that the amplitudes and decay of minimal light stimulation-evoked EPSCs were not changed by the application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blocker picrotoxin (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, the amplitudes and rise time of minimal light stimulation-evoked IPSCs were not altered by application of the AMPA/kainate receptor blocker NBQX (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>). These results validate that EPSCs and IPSCs evoked by minimal optical stimulation are mediated by the stochastic release of glutamate and GABA, respectively, from single vesicles. Furthermore, by comparing minimal stimulation-evoked PSCs with strontium-induced asynchronous PSCs (see below), we found that the amplitudes of EPSCs and IPSCs evoked by minimal stimulation were identical to those of strontium-induced asynchronous EPSCs and IPSCs, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting that PSCs evoked by minimal stimulation were mediated by a single vesicle release.</p>

<title>Asynchronous release from SuM terminals exhibits independent EPSCs and IPSCs in GCs</title>
<p>It should be noted that minimal light stimulation of SuM inputs may occasionally elicit synchronized release of glutamate and GABA from different vesicle pools, possibly due to the simultaneous opening of several Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which could account for the substantial biphasic responses we detected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). To minimize the likelihood of synchronized release, we recorded asynchronous quantal PSCs by substitution of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Sr<sup>2+</sup>. At intermediate holding membrane potentials (–20 to –30 mV), light pulses elicited synchronized biphasic responses in the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). By replacing extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> with Sr<sup>2+</sup>, asynchronous quantal synaptic responses were recorded following light stimulation of the SuM inputs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). By repeating the light stimulation of the SuM inputs 30 times (every 10 sec), we found that the majority of asynchronous synaptic events were EPSC-only or IPSC-only, whereas biphasic PSCs represented only a minor population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F</xref>) (EPSC: 27.9 ± 4.7 events; IPSC: 23.4 ± 4.2 events; biphasic: 2.5 ± 0.5 events, n = 11, EPSC vs biphasic, p &lt; 0.001; IPSC vs biphasic, p &lt; 0.001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test).

<title>Segregated glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic sites at SuM-GC synapses</title>
<p>We then investigated whether SuM-GC synapses exhibit distinct postsynaptic sites for each neurotransmitter using immunohistochemistry. To enhance spatial resolution, we used ultrathin sections (100-nm-thick) for analysis. As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Uchigashima et al., 2011</xref>), double immunofluorescence revealed that almost all VGluT2-positive terminals in the GC layer co-expressed VIAAT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Further post-embedding immunogold EM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>) showed that these terminals formed asymmetric and symmetric synapses, characteristic of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>), confirming previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boulland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Billwiller et al., 2020</xref>). Conventional EM using serial ultrathin sections also revealed that a single nerve terminal formed both asymmetric and symmetric synapses on a GC soma (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The formation of asymmetric and symmetric synapses by a single SuM terminal was further confirmed by pre-embedding immunogold EM for eYFP, which was expressed in the SuM neurons by injection of AAV-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP into the SuM of VGluT2-Cre mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). It has been reported that VTA neurons also project to the GC layer of the DG and co-release glutamate and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ntamati and Luscher, 2016</xref>). However, our retrograde tracing with fluorescent microspheres injected into the dorsal DG did not reveal any retrogradely labeled neurons in the VTA, while labeled neurons were successfully observed in the SuM and entorhinal cortex (EC) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that most of the VGluT2-positive terminals (co-expressed with VIAAT, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) in the GC layer most likely originated from the SuM. To examine the spatial association of SuM terminals with glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic sites, we performed triple immunofluorescence for VGluT2, the NMDA receptor subunit GluN1, and GABAergic postsynaptic sites by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit GABA<sub>A</sub>α1. In the GC layer, almost all VGluT2-positive terminals were associated with GluN1 and/or GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Specifically, the majority of VGluT2-positive terminals were associated with both GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 (52.5%), and the remainder were associated with GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 (22.1%) alone or GluN1 (25.4%) alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). To investigate the spatial relationship between glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, we quantified the distance between GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 cluster adjacent to the same VGluT2-positive terminal. On average, the distance was 397.5 ± 8.75 nm, and most VGluT2-positive terminals (79.2%, 191 out of 241) form glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses within 500 nm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that a single SuM terminal forms GluN1-containing excitatory synapse and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1-containing inhibitory synapse in separate locations, yet they remain closely proximal.</p>

<title>Glutamate/GABA co-transmission balance of SuM inputs is dynamically changed in a frequency-dependent manner</title>
<p>The results described thus far indicate that the co-transmission of glutamate and GABA is spatially segregated at SuM-GC synapses, thereby making it possible to independently regulate the co-release of glutamate and GABA from the same SuM terminals. Due to the different release properties of glutamate and GABA in the SuM terminals, glutamate/GABA co-transmission could exhibit different patterns of short-term plasticity at SuM-GC synapses. To test this possibility, we delivered a train of 10 light stimuli at 5-20 Hz, physiologically relevant frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kirk and McNaughton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Farrell et al., 2021</xref>), to ChR2-expressing SuM inputs, and compared the short-term depression of EPSCs with that of IPSCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). To exclude the putative involvement of pre- and/or postsynaptic modulations by mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors during a train of stimulation, pharmacologically isolated EPSCs or IPSCs were recorded in the presence of the broad-spectrum mGluR antagonist LY341495 (100 μM) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonist CGP55845 (3 μM). We found that trains of 10 light stimuli at 5, 10, and 20 Hz elicited pronounced short-term synaptic depression of EPSCs during train with stronger depression at higher frequencies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). We further performed the same experiments under recording conditions with a low release probability by reducing the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 2.5 to 1 mM. While train stimulation elicited a weaker depression than 2.5 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, frequency-dependent depression was still observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In marked contrast to EPSCs, while IPSCs also exhibited short-term synaptic depression across all tested frequencies, GABAergic co-transmission showed a similar magnitude of depression across all frequencies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Similarly, short-term depression of IPSCs did not show a frequency-dependent depression with 1 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), leading to a sustained inhibitory effect at any frequency. Given that EPSCs show strong frequency-dependent depression, whereas IPSCs exhibit frequency-independent sustained depression, it is likely that the EPSC/IPSC ratio can decrease during high-frequency train stimulation. Indeed, comparing the amplitudes of the 10th EPSCs with those of the 10th IPSCs indicated that the depression of EPSCs was stronger than that of IPSCs at 10 Hz and 20 Hz (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). We further addressed whether short-term dynamic changes in the EPSC/IPSC ratio could be observed in the same cell by recording the biphasic synaptic responses at intermediate membrane potentials that enabled simultaneous monitoring of the compound EPSC/IPSC. We found that 10 Hz train light illumination induced a stronger depression of EPSCs than of IPSCs (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>), thereby decreasing the EPSC/IPSC ratio during the high-frequency train stimulation. We confirmed that the fiber volley induced by trains of 10 light stimuli was comparable across all tested frequencies (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that a similar number of SuM fibers were activated with each light pulse during trains.</p>

<p>Despite the differential properties of the co-release of glutamate and GABA from SuM terminals, the difference in the magnitude of short-term depression between glutamatergic and GABAergic co-transmission could be mediated by postsynaptic mechanisms, such as AMPA receptor saturation and desensitization during burst high-frequency stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Trussell et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brenowitz and Trussell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Heine et al., 2008</xref>). To test this possibility, we recorded EPSC trains in the presence of ψ-D-glutamylglycine (ψDGG), a low-affinity AMPA receptor antagonist that relieves AMPA receptor saturation and desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Wadiche and Jahr, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Foster and Regehr, 2004</xref>). As expected, 2 mM ψDGG reduced the amplitude of EPSCs (60.1 ± 4.3% reduction, n = 16, p &lt; 0.001, paired t test). Under these conditions, short-term depression with high-frequency light stimulation (10 Hz and 20 Hz) was not affected (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). This rules out a postsynaptic contribution to the strong depression of EPSCs and suggests that presynaptic mechanisms mediate this short-term depression. Similarly, to determine whether postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor saturation is involved in short-term depression during train stimulation, we used the low-affinity competitive GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist TPMPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sakaba, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Markwardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Turecek et al., 2016</xref>). We found that 300 μM TPMPA reduced the amplitude of IPSCs (47.1 ± 3.8% reduction, n = 11, p &lt; 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test), while short-term depression of IPSCs in response to 10 light pulses at 10 Hz and 20 Hz did not differ before and after the application of TPMPA (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3C, D</xref>), excluding the involvement of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor saturation in the short-term depression of IPSCs at SuM-GC synapses, suggesting a presynaptic origin of this short-term plasticity.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that SuM-GC synapses exhibit short-term dynamic changes in the glutamate/GABA co-transmission ratio during repetitive high-frequency SuM activity due to the different properties of frequency-dependent depression between glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission, favoring inhibition over excitation. Furthermore, the different properties of short-term depression of EPSCs and IPSCs also support the segregated co-transmission of glutamate and GABA at SuM-GC synapses.</p>

To mimic excitatory EC synaptic inputs onto GCs, a sinusoidal current was injected into the soma of GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kamondi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ajibola et al., 2021</xref>), which can bypass direct synaptic stimulation of the perforant path (main excitatory inputs originating from EC) and, consequently, circumvent the recruitment of inhibitory circuitry. We found that a sinusoidal current at 5 Hz generated action potentials at the peak of the depolarizing phase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The injected current was adjusted to generate action potentials with fewer than five spikes in each trial (10 cycles), and the optogenetically activated SuM inputs were paired at the depolarizing phase of each cycle. Paired light illumination significantly enhanced GC firing compared to sinusoidal current injections without light stimulation throughout the trial (10 stimuli) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Notably, the probability of spikes further increased when GABAergic transmission was blocked by picrotoxin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). These results suggest that SuM inputs enhance GC firing and that GABAergic co-transmission negatively regulates the net excitatory effect of SuM inputs at 5 Hz, similar to the effects of a single associational activation of SuM and EC inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>). In striking contrast, at higher frequencies (10 Hz and 20 Hz), the enhancement of spike probability by SuM activation was attenuated and disappeared in the last few stimulations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B, 6C, 6E</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). Importantly, in the presence of picrotoxin, SuM activation by light stimulation enhanced GC firing, even in the last few stimulations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B, 6C</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6E, 6F</xref>), suggesting that SuM glutamatergic co-transmission still exerted excitatory effects in the later cycle, even during the short-term depression of glutamate release. Thus, the excitatory action of SuM inputs was filtered by the co-released GABA during repetitive high-frequency stimulation due to frequency-independent sustained depression. These results indicate that SuM inputs modulate GC output in a frequency-dependent manner due to the different short-term plasticities of glutamate/GABA co-transmission.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite evidence that glutamate and GABA are co-released from the synaptic terminals of a subset of neurons in the adult brain, whether glutamate and GABA are released from the same or distinct synaptic vesicle populations remains a debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we demonstrate that the transmission properties of glutamate and GABA at SuM-GC synapses differ in PPR, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, presynaptic GPCR regulation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-synaptic vesicle coupling configuration. We further found that uniquantal synaptic responses exhibit independent EPSCs and IPSCs. The anatomical results show that a single SuM terminal forms both asymmetric and symmetric synapses with a GC soma. The postsynaptic excitatory site (marked by GluN1) and inhibitory site (marked by GABA<sub>A</sub>α1), facing the same SuM terminal, are closely positioned but distinct. These findings provide evidence that glutamatergic and GABAergic co-transmission occurs at functionally distinct release sites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Owing to the functional and spatial segregation of the co-transmission of glutamate and GABA, each transmission exhibits distinct short-term plasticities, leading to different frequency-dependent effects of SuM inputs on the GC activity.</p>

<p>A single SuM terminal contains distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic vesicles, which are regulated by P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and also modulated by group II mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Glutamatergic and GABAergic vesicles are loosely and tightly coupled with Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, respectively. At the postsynaptic site of GCs, AMPA/NMDA and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are distributed separately. Based on their molecular composition, glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses are established independently, achieving the distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission.</p></caption>

<p>Different release properties of dual-neurotransmitter neurons have been reported in other synaptic circuits. Different PPRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Silm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zych and Ford, 2022</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zych and Ford, 2022</xref>) between co-transmission of dual-neurotransmitters are found in the retina (acetylcholine and GABA) and striatum (dopamine and glutamate or GABA). Different reliance on Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels for distinct neurotransmitters have been reported in the retina (acetylcholine and GABA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), striatum (dopamine and glutamate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Silm et al., 2019</xref>), and hippocampus (acetylcholine and GABA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Takacs et al., 2018</xref>). These differential release properties of the two neurotransmitters indicate a separate release from distinct vesicle pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Takacs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Silm et al., 2019</xref>). Our study also demonstrated that glutamate and GABA co-release from SuM terminals shows differences in PPR and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity. Glutamatergic transmission exhibited a stronger depression than GABAergic transmission, suggesting that release probability of glutamate is higher than that of GABA. A higher reduction in IPSCs than EPSCs by decreasing the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 2.5 to 1 mM indicates that GABA release requires higher extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> than glutamate release. Furthermore, using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelators BAPTA and EGTA, we found that the spatial coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic vesicles of GABA is tighter than that of glutamate. These differences in release properties can be attributed to the different compositions of the release machinery and different spatial organizations between the release machinery and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels for glutamate and GABA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sudhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Neher and Brose, 2018</xref>). Given that GABAergic co-transmission exhibits a lower release probability and a higher requirement for extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, together with tight coupling between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and vesicles, synaptic vesicles for GABA release could be surrounded by a few Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in close proximity. In contrast, the synaptic vesicles for glutamate release could be surrounded by a large number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at longer distances than those for GABA release. As with other possible mechanisms, the different expression of transporters in the vesicles with their interacting proteins may contribute to different release probabilities. Given that VGluT1 and endophilin interaction exhibits different release probabilities compared to VGluT2-expressing synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weston et al., 2011</xref>), it is postulated that different interactions of VGluT2 and VIAAT with their different binding proteins could determine distinct release probabilities.</p>
<p>How are VGluT2 and VIAAT sorted into the distinct synaptic vesicles, and how are glutamate vesicles and GABA vesicles sorted to different places within the same SuM terminal? With synaptic vesicles containing 410 different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>), even slight differences in molecular composition or incorporation of specific molecules on the vesicles could influence their functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chamberland and Toth, 2016</xref>). These differences may determine the selective sorting of neurotransmitter transporters into vesicles and the precise arrangement of glutamate and GABA vesicles at the distinct active zones within the same terminal. Especially, VGluT2 and VIAAT contain sorting motifs in their C-terminus, which interacts with clathrin adaptor proteins (APs). Several studies demonstrated that the interaction between neurotransmitter transporters and APs is important for endocytosis and recycling of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Nakatsu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Voglmaier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Santos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Silm et al., 2019</xref>). Distinct APs-dependent recycling pathway may contribute to formation of precise spatial localization of glutamate and GABA vesicles in the same SuM terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asmerian et al., 2024</xref>). Our immuno-EM analysis showed that VGluT2 and VIAAT appear to be randomly distributed in the terminal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). However, it is important to acknowledge that due to low labeling efficiency, our immuno-EM images may not capture the full spectrum of synaptic vesicles for glutamate and GABA. It is known that synaptic vesicles are divided into three categories: the readily releasable pool (RRP), recycling pool, and resting pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alabi and Tsien, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Miki et al., 2022</xref>). Among them, the vast majority of synaptic vesicles (∼85% of the total vesicles) belongs to the resting pool. Therefore, it is likely that most of the VGluT2 and VIAAT labeling corresponds to the synaptic vesicles in the resting pool. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether VGluT2-containing vesicles and VIAAT-containing vesicles in the RRP and recycling pools, both of which are closely linked to exocytosis, are clearly segregated near their respective active zones.</p>
<p>Our data showed that both glutamate and GABA release rely on P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels at SuM-GC synapses. Interestingly, the excitatory transmission of SuM-CA2 pyramidal neuron synapses, an exclusive glutamatergic synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), is also mediated by P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Robert et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, neurotransmitter release from SuM neurons depends on P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, irrespective of the target neurons. We found that the activation of group II mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors inhibited glutamatergic co-transmission more strongly than GABAergic co-transmission. Given that these GPCRs suppress presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels via G<sub>i/o</sub>-protein, and that both transmitter releases are mediated by the same type of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, the different extents of inhibition of the co-release of glutamate/GABA by group II mGluRs and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors may be attributed to differential expression levels of receptors or signaling efficacy between glutamate and GABA release. Additionally, the spatial coupling between GPCRs and active zones for glutamate and GABA in the same SuM terminals may be different, which may give rise to differential modulation of glutamate and GABA release.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous EM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boulland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Billwiller et al., 2020</xref>), we found that a single SuM terminal forms symmetric and asymmetric synapses in the DG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>). However, confirming whether these synapses function as glutamatergic or GABAergic relies on the identification of their postsynaptic receptors, which remains unresolved. In our study, we demonstrated that both GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 were associated with common SuM terminals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>), suggesting that these synapses represent distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. Furthermore, our analysis showed that approximately 50% of SuM terminals was associated with both GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). It should be noted, however, this percentage can be an underestimate due to the utilization of 100-nm-thick ultrathin sections, which limits the detection of co-localization events within this confined spatial range. Consequently, the actual percentage is expected to be significantly higher. Hence, the predominant synapse type of SuM terminals consists of dual glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses, with additional individual glutamatergic or GABAergic synapses.</p>
<p>Previous electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that both glutamate and GABA are co-packaged in the same synaptic vesicles in the lateral habenula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). Minimal optogenetic stimulation of EP terminals evoked a high proportion of biphasic PSCs over independent EPSCs and IPSCs in lateral habenular neurons, suggesting the co-release of glutamate and GABA from the same synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). While these findings appear to contradict anatomical data showing distinct populations of glutamate- and GABA-containing synaptic vesicles in the lateral habenula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>), technical limitations of immuno-EM may affect the ability to accurately assess the spatial distributions of proteins within the vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim and Sabatini, 2023</xref>). Such limitations include antibody interference on small vesicles, restricted access to target molecules, and the stochastic nature of labeling two molecules in a single vesicle. In addition, the existence of VTA terminals, other glutamate/GABA co-release inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Root et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Yoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Root et al., 2018</xref>), may complicate the interpretation of the co-release mechanisms in the lateral habenula. In contrast, in the DG, we found that the majority of synaptic responses evoked by both minimal light stimulation and asynchronous release at SuM-GC synapses showed independent EPSCs and IPSCs. A previous biochemical study detected VGluT2 and VIAAT in distinct purified synaptic vesicles from the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boulland et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, differences in transport mechanisms between glutamatergic and GABAergic vesicles have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Farsi et al., 2016</xref>). Based on this evidence, our results most likely support the hypothesis that glutamate and GABA are packaged in distinct synaptic vesicles (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, glutamate/GABA co-transmission is diverse, in that both transmitters are co-released from the same or different synaptic vesicles, depending on brain regions and synapse types. It is important to note that transmitter release is detected by postsynaptic receptors; therefore, even if two neurotransmitters are co-released from the same vesicles, they will not be detected unless the postsynaptic targets express receptors for both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dugue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Granger et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, while our results strongly suggest that glutamate/GABA co-transmission occurs independently at segregated excitatory and inhibitory SuM-GC synapses, it remains possible that glutamate and GABA are co-released from the same vesicles, with one transmitter undetected due to the absence of its postsynaptic receptor. Further study will be necessary to determine the packaging mechanisms of glutamate and GABA within SuM terminals.</p>
<p>The distinct co-transmission modes of the two transmitters have the ability to exert independent synaptic regulation compared with their co-release from identical vesicles. At SuM-GC synapses, we demonstrated that glutamatergic and GABAergic co-transmission exhibited different short-term plasticities. While glutamatergic co-transmission showed strong frequency-dependent depression, GABAergic co-transmission exhibited stable frequency-independent depression. By this frequency-specific dynamic change of the glutamate/GABA co-transmission balance, at low-frequency burst SuM inputs, they operated as excitatory inputs, whereas at high frequency, the excitatory effects of SuM inputs on GCs were inhibited by co-transmitted GABA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Accordingly, GCs respond differently to SuM inputs in a frequency-dependent manner, due to the low-pass filtering of SuM-GC synapses. The fact that the theta-rhythm in the hippocampus is associated with synchronized SuM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kirk and McNaughton, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ito et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Farrell et al., 2021</xref>) has important implications for the low-pass filtering of this synapse. As SuM inputs act as excitatory at 5 Hz (theta) train stimulation, but not at higher frequencies, SuM inputs may transfer their train information exclusively at the theta frequency, which could contribute to theta-mediated information processing in SuM-hippocampal circuits and their relevant brain functions, including cognitive, sleep, and navigation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Billwiller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Farrell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kesner et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to SuM inputs, GCs receive EC inputs as the main excitatory inputs for discharge, and other excitatory inputs from hilar mossy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hashimotodani et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, low-pass filtering of SuM inputs could prevent the over-excitation of GCs, leading to anti-seizure effects. In contrast to the presynaptic origin of short-term plasticity at SuM-GC synapses, we previously demonstrated the postsynaptically induced long-term potentiation at SuM-GC synapses, which selectively occurs of glutamatergic co-transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hirai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tabuchi et al., 2022</xref>). Our findings suggest that SuM inputs play diverse roles in modulating GC output via short- and long-term plasticity with pre- and postsynaptic distinct mechanisms, respectively.</p>

<p>Whole-cell recordings using an EPC10 (HEKA Electronik) or IPA amplifier (Sutter Instruments) were made from GCs using an infrared differential interference contrast microscopy (IR-DIC, Olympus, BX51WI). We recorded from GCs with an input resistance of &lt; 300 MΩ for mature GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schmidt-Hieber et al., 2004</xref>). The data were filtered at 2.9 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. For voltage-clamp recordings, we used patch pipettes (3−6 MΩ) filled with an intracellular solution with the following composition (in mM): 131 Cs-gluconate, 4 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, pH 7.3 adjusted with CsOH (the calculated E<sub>Cl-</sub> = −90 mV) (292–300 mOsm). In some experiments, biocytin (0.5 %) was included in the intracellular solution for morphological visualization of GCs after recording using Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated streptavidin (1:500, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For recordings of synaptic currents at intermediate membrane potentials, 5 mM QX314 was included in the intracellular solution. ChR2-expresing SuM fibers were activated at 0.05 Hz by a pulse of 470 nm blue light (1–5 ms duration, 5.0–10.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) delivered through a ξ40 objective attached to a microscope using an LED (Mightex or ThorLabs). The light intensity was adjusted to yield less than 80% of the maximum response during the baseline period. The illumination field was centered over the recorded cell, unless otherwise stated. Series resistance (8−20 MΩ) was uncompensated and monitored throughout experiments with a −5 mV, 50 ms voltage step, and cells that exhibited a significant change in the series resistance more than 20% were excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>For minimal light stimulation experiments, we first recorded biphasic synaptic responses from GCs by maximum light stimulation of SuM inputs at intermediate membrane potentials from –20 to –30 mV in the presence of 1 μM TTX, 1 mM 4-AP, 50 μM D-AP5, and 1 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The exact membrane potentials were set to the potential at which the amplitudes of EPSCs and IPSCs were similar. Then, light power intensity was decreased to detect small stochastic synaptic events. We adjusted the light power (&lt;1 ms duration, &lt;1.0 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) to evoke synaptic responses, with a success rate of 15%. A total of 100 trials were recorded every 10 s. EPSC-only responses were determined as the synaptic current with the onset of a downward deflection within 6 ms of light illumination that returned to the baseline without an outward current within 20 ms of light illumination. IPSC-only responses were determined as the synaptic current with the onset of an upward deflection within 6 ms of light illumination, without an inward current immediately after light illumination. Biphasic responses were defined as an EPSC-IPSC sequence, only if an outward peak current following an inward current appeared within 20 ms of light illumination. The amplitude threshold was set to three times the SD of the baseline noise. Based on these criteria, we confirmed that the detection rate of false-positive events (without light illumination) was 0.6 ± 0.4% (3/500 trials, n = 5).</p>
<p>For recordings of asynchronous synaptic events, we initially recorded light stimulation-evoked biphasic synaptic responses at intermediate membrane potentials (–20 to –30 mV) in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

Asynchronous synaptic responses were evoked by light pulses at 0.1 Hz for 30 times, measured during a 450 ms period beginning 30 ms after the stimulus to exclude the initial synchronous synaptic responses, and analyzed using the Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft). D-AP5 (50 μM) was included in the extracellular ACSF throughout the experiment to eliminate NMDA receptor-mediated currents.</p>
<p>For train stimulation, EPSCs were recorded from GCs at a holding potential of –70 mV in the presence of 100 μM picrotoxin, while IPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of 0 mV in the presence of 10 μM NBQX and 50 μM D-AP5. Biphasic PSCs were recorded at a holding potential of –30 mV in the presence of 1 μM TTX, 500 μM 4-AP, and 50 μM D-AP5. In all train-stimulation experiments, 100 μM LY341495 and 3 μM CGP55845 were also added to the ACSF throughout the experiments. 10 light pulses at 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 20 Hz were delivered every 20 sec, and 10−20 sweeps were recorded.</p>
<p>For field potential recordings in the CA1 region, a recording pipette filled with 1 M NaCl and a patch pipette with broken tip (with diameter of ∼20−30 μm) filled with the ACSF were placed in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region. For recordings of the fiber volley originating from ChR2-epressing SuM fibers, a recording pipette was placed in the supragranular layer where ChR2-epressing SuM fibers were densely distributed. Light-evoked field potentials were recorded in the presence of 10 μM NBQX, 50 μM D-AP5, and 100 μM picrotoxin to block the synaptic responses.</p>
<p>For current-clamp recordings, we used an intracellular solution with the following composition (in mM): 135 KMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 2 MgATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 10 phosphocreatine, pH 7.3 adjusted with NaOH (the calculated E<sub>Cl-</sub> = −82 mV) (297−299 mOsm).</p>
<p>A sinusoidal current was delivered to the soma of GCs at 5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 20 Hz (10 cycles), while the membrane potential was held at −70 mV to −80 mV. The injected current (100−240 pA) was adjusted to generate action potentials with fewer than five spikes in each trial. After obtaining control, a sinusoidal current injection was paired with light stimulation of SuM inputs at the depolarizing phase of each cycle. Subsequently, 100 μM picrotoxin was bath applied, and the same pairing of sinusoidal current with light stimulation were delivered. In each experiment, 10 trials were recorded every 20 sec.</p>
<p>All experiments were performed at 30−33°C in the recording chamber perfused (2 mL/min) with oxygenated ACSF.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry for ChR2-expressing SuM terminals</title>
<p>Under deep pentobarbital anesthesia (100 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally), AAV-DIO-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP injected VGluT2-Cre mice were perfused with 4% PFA. Brains were removed and stored in 4% PFA for 4 h at room temperature, then transferred to PBS and left overnight at 4°C. Coronal brain slices containing the SuM or the hippocampus were sectioned at 100 μm using a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica microsystems). After permeabilization in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, the sections were blocked in PBS with 5% donkey serum for 1h. After washing three times with PBS for 10 min each, the sections were incubated in PBS containing primary antibodies and 0.5% Triton X-100 overnight at room temperature. Primary antibodies against GFP (goat, 1:200), VGluT2 (rabbit, 1:200), and VIAAT (guinea pig, 1:200) were used. The sections were then rinsed with PBS three times, and incubated in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and secondary donkey antibodies (1:500, anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody, abcam, ab150129; anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated antibody, abcam, ab175470; anti-guinea pig Cy5-conjugated antibody, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 706-175-148) for 2h at room temperature. Sections were rinsed three times in PBS and mounted on glass slides with DAPI. To analyze colocalization of ChR2-eYFP-labeled axonal boutons with VGluT2 and VIAAT, z stack images were captured (0.4 µm optical sections) using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X800, Keyence). Swellings of ChR2-YFP labeled axons were considered as axonal boutons, and their colocalization with VGluT2 and VIAAT immunofluorescence was examined in 3D planes as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The PPR was defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the second PSCs to the amplitude of the first PSCs (100 ms inter-stimulus interval). The reduction in PSCs by a decrease in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was determined by comparing 10 min baseline responses (2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>) with responses 20−25 min after replacement of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM). The inhibition of PSCs by DCG-IV, baclofen, μ-CgTx, μ-Aga-IVA, BAPTA-AM, and EGTA-AM was determined by comparing the 10 min baseline responses with responses at 15−20 min (or 25−30 min for BAPTA-AM, and EGTA-AM) after each drug application. The PSCs probability was calculated as the percentage of the number of synaptic responses among 100 sweeps. Train stimulation-induced depression was calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the second to 10th PSCs to the amplitude of the first PSCs. Each stimulus point had an averaged of 10−20 sweeps. Spike probability was calculated as the percentage of the number of spikes among 10 trials.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using OriginPro software (OriginLab, USA). Normality of the distributions was assessed using the Shapiro−Wilk test. For samples with normal distributions, Student’s unpaired and paired two-tailed t tests were used to assess the between-group and within-group differences, respectively. For samples that were not normally distributed, a non-parametric paired sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. The Kolmogorov−Smirnov test was used for cumulative distributions. Differences among two or multiple samples were assessed by using one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 (***, **, and * indicates p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). All values are reported as the mean ± SEM.</p>

<caption><title>PPRs of glutamatergic and GABAergic co-transmission show no difference between over-axon and over-bouton illumination</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Diagram of the experimental setup. Fluorescence image of hippocampal slice shows ChR2-eYFP expressing SuM fibers (green) and a biocytin-filled GC (red). The dotted circles indicate the estimated LED illumination area at each location. We recorded from GCs located in the most edge of upper blade of GC layer (∼150 μm). Once synaptic responses were observed by over-bouton illumination (over-the recorded cell soma, position b), then the objective lens was moved to ∼600 μm vertically away in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region (position a). The light power was adjusted to evoke no response at position a, indicating that SuM-GC synapses on the recorded GCs were out of the illumination field. The objective lens was then returned to position b, and PSCs of SuM-GC synapses were recorded with paired stimulation. Then, the objective lens was moved ∼600 μm along the GC layer (position c) to achieve over-axon illumination. Scale bar: 200 μm. <bold>(B)</bold> Representative traces of SuM-GC EPSCs evoked with over-CA1 (a), over-bouton (b), and over-axon (c) illumination. <bold>(C, D)</bold> Representative traces (left) and summary plots of PPRs (right) of SuM-GC EPSCs (C) or IPSCs (D) indicating no significant difference between over-bouton and over-axon illumination of SuM inputs (EPSC: bouton: 0.45 ± 0.03; axon: 0.44 ± 0.04, n = 6, p = 0.72, paired t-test; IPSC: bouton: 0.58 ± 0.04; axon: 0.59 ± 0.04, n = 6, p = 0.32, paired t-test). EPSCs or IPSCs were recorded with over-bouton (top) or over-axon (middle) illumination, respectively. Bottom traces show that a trace by over-axon stimulation was scaled to the peak of a trace by over-bouton stimulation. Magnified traces of the dotted circle show a delayed onset latency of a trace by over-axon stimulation relative to a trace by over-bouton stimulation. <bold>(E)</bold> Summary plot of PPR indicating a significant difference between EPSC and IPSC evoked by over-axon illumination (EPSC: 0.44 ± 0.04; IPSC: 0.59 ± 0.04, n = 6, p &lt; 0.05, unpaired t-test). <bold>(F)</bold> Summary plots of latency to the onset of the synaptic response. The delayed latency of the synaptic responses by over-axon illumination indicates that synaptic transmission was mediated by light-evoked action potential propagation toward SuM terminals (EPSC: bouton: 2.0 ± 0.1 ms; axon: 3.8 ± 0.2 ms, n = 7, p &lt; 0.001, paired t-test; IPSC: bouton: 2.3 ± 0.1 ms; axon: 3.7 ± 0.2 ms, n = 6, p &lt; 0.001, paired t-test).

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> work provides evidence that glutamate and GABA are released from different synaptic vesicles at supramammillary axon terminals onto granule cells of the dentate gyrus. The study uses complementary electrophysiological and anatomical experimental approaches. Together, these provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that the co-release of glutamate and GABA from different vesicles within the same terminal could modulate granule cell firing in a frequency-dependent manner, although thorough elimination of alternative mechanisms would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to neuroscientists investigating co-release of neurotransmitters in various synapses in the brain and those interested in subcortical control of hippocampal function.</p>

<p>This study of mixed glutamate/GABA transmission from axons of the supramammillary nucleus to dentate gyrus seeks to sort out whether the two transmitters are released from the same or different synaptic vesicles. This conundrum has been examined in other dual-transmission cases and even in this particular pathway there are different views.

While the strength of the conclusion rests on the abundance of data (approaches) rather than the decisiveness of any one approach, I came away believing that the boutons may indeed produce and release distinct types of vesicles. Accepting the conclusion, one is now left with another conundrum: how can a single bouton sort out VGLUTs and VIAATs to different vesicles, position them in distinct locations with nm precision and recycle them without mixing? And why do it this way instead of with single vesicles having mixed chemical content? For example, could a quantitative argument be made that separate vesicles allow for higher transmitter concentrations? Hopefully, future studies will probe these issues.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors investigated the release properties of glutamate/GABA co-transmission at the supramammillary nucleus (SuM)-dentate granule cell (DGC) synapses using state -of-the-arts in vitro electrophysiology and anatomical approaches at the light and electron microscopy level. They found that SuM to dentate granule cell synapses, which co-release glutamate and GABA, exhibit distinct differences in paired-pulse ratio, Ca2+ sensitivity, presynaptic receptor modulation, and Ca2+ channel-vesicle coupling configuration for each neurotransmitter. The study shows that glutamate/GABA co-release produces independent glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic responses, with postsynaptic targets segregated. They show that most SuM boutons form distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses at proximity, characterized by GluN1 and GABAAα1 receptor labeling respectively. Furthermore, they demonstrate that glutamate/GABA co-transmission exhibits distinct short-term plasticity, with glutamate showing frequency-dependent depression and GABA showing frequency-independent stable depression. The authors provide compelling evidence at the anatomical and physiological levels that glutamate and GABA are co-release by different synaptic vesicles within the same synaptic terminal at the SuM-DGC synapses and that the distinct transmission modes of the glutamate and GABA release serve as a frequency-dependent filters of SuM inputs on GC outputs.</p>
<p>
This is a fundamental work, that significantly advances our understanding of the mechanism by which the two fast-acting and functionally opposing neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA are co-transmitted at the SuM-DGC synapses and the functional role of this type of Glutamate/GABA co-transmission.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are provided by a large number of compelling data</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Hirai et al investigated the release properties of glutamate/GABA co-transmission at SuM-GC synapses and reported that glutamate/GABA co-transmission exhibits distinct short-term plasticity with segregated postsynaptic targets. Using optogenetics, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, and immunohistochemistry, the authors reveal distinct transmission modes of glutamate/GABA co-release as frequency-dependent filters of incoming SuM inputs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this study is well-designed and executed; conclusions are supported by the results. This study addressed a long-standing question of whether GABA and glutamate are packaged in the same vesicles and co-released in response to the same stimuli in the SuM-GC synapses (Pedersen et al., 2017; Hashimotodani et al., 2018; Billwiller et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Ajibola et al., 2021). Knowledge gained from this study advances our understanding of neurotransmitter co-release mechanisms and their functional roles in the hippocampal circuits.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>This study of mixed glutamate/GABA transmission from axons of the supramammillary nucleus to dentate gyrus seeks to sort out whether the two transmitters are released from the same or different synaptic vesicles. This conundrum has been examined in other dual-transmission cases and even in this particular pathway, there are different views. The authors use a variety of electrophysiological and immunohistochemical methods to reach the surprising (to me) conclusion that glutamate and GABA- filled vesicles are distinct yet released from the same nerve terminals. The strength of the conclusion rests on the abundance of data (approaches) rather than the decisiveness of any one approach, and I came away believing that the boutons may indeed produce and release distinct types of vesicles, but have reservations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for his/her evaluation of our work. At present, several studies reported that a variety of combinations of two transmitters are co-released from different synaptic vesicles in the central nervous system. In this regard, we think the cotransmission of glutamate/GABA from different synaptic vesicles is not surprising. To better explain to the reader how much we know about co-release of dual transmitters in the brain, we have now added new sentences describing segregated co-release of two neurotransmitters in other synapses in the Introduction (line 63-80).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Accepting the conclusion, one is now left with another conundrum, not addressed even in the discussion: how can a single bouton sort out VGLUTs and VIAATs to different vesicles, position them in distinct locations with nm precision, and recycle them without mixing? And why do it this way instead of with single vesicles having mixed chemical content? For example, could a quantitative argument be made that separate vesicles allow for higher transmitter concentrations? I feel the paper needs to address these problems with some coherent discussion, at minimum.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although these questions are very important and interesting to address, little is known about molecular mechanisms how VGluT2 and VIAAT are sorted to different vesicles and each synaptic vesicle is segregated. That is why we had not mentioned the sorting mechanisms in the original manuscript. Nevertheless, in response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now added new sentences describing possible mechanisms for the sorting and segregation of VGluT2 and VIAAT in the Discussion (line 439-462).</p>
<p>As for the question regarding why glutamate and GABA are released from different synaptic vesicles, we mentioned the functional roles of separate release of two transmitters over release from single vesicles several times in the Introduction (line 94100), Results (line 300-302), and Discussion (line 406-408, 521-522). Although it seems to be an interesting point to think about transmitter concentrations in the vesicles, we think this issue is beyond the scope of the present study. Given that manipulation of vesicular transmitter contents is technically possible (Hori and Takamori, 2021), this issue awaits further investigation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Throughout the paper, the authors use repetitive optogenetic stimulation to activate SuM fibers and co-release glutamate and GABA. There are several issues here: first, can the authors definitively assure the reader that all the short-term plasticity is presynaptic and not due to ChR2 desensitization? This has not been addressed. Second, can the authors also say that all the activated fibers release both transmitters? If for example 20% of the fibers retained a onetransmitter identity and had distinct physiological properties, could that account for some of the physiological findings?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this important point. To examine whether repetitive light illumination induces ChR2 desensitization, the fiber volley was extracellularly recorded. We found that paired-pulse or 10 stimuli at 5, 10, and 20 Hz reliably evoked similar amplitudes of fiber volley during light stimulation. These results clearly indicate that repetitive light stimulation can reliably activate ChR2 and elicit action potentials in the SuM axons. These new findings are now included in Figure 1-figure supplement 2 and Figure 5-figure supplement 2. We also previously demonstrated that by direct patch-clamp recordings from ChR2-expressing hippocampal mossy fiber terminals, 125 times light stimulation at 25 Hz reliably elicited action potentials (Fig. S1: Fukaya et al., 2023). Therefore, we believe that if expression level of ChR2 is high, activation of ChR2 induces action potentials in response to repetitive light stimulation and mediates synaptic transmission with high efficiency.</p>
<p>We found that most of the SuM terminals (95%) have both VGluT2 and VIAAT (Figure 1E). This anatomical evidence strongly indicates that most of the SuM terminals have the ability to release both glutamate and GABA, and the SuM fibers having one transmitter identity should be minor populations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) PPR differences in Figures 1F-I are statistically significant but still quite small. You could say they are more similar than different in fact, and residual differences are accounted for by secondary factors like differential receptor saturation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this experiment, the light intensity was adjusted to yield less than 80% of the maximum response as described in the method section of original and revised manuscript, minimizing the possibility of receptor saturation. We also excluded the possibility that PPR differences could be attributed to differential receptor saturation and desensitization by using a low-affinity AMPA receptor antagonist and a low-affinity GABAA receptor antagonist (Figure 5-figure supplement 3). These results indicate that PPR differences are mediated by the presynaptic origin.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The logic of the GPCR experiments needs a better setup. I could imagine different fibers released different transmitters and had different numbers of mGluRs, so that one would get different modulations. On the assumption that all the release is from a single population of boutons, then either the mGluRs are differentially segregated within the bouton, or the vesicles have differential responsiveness to the same modulatory signal (presumably a reduced Ca current). This is not developed in the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on our minimal stimulation results and anatomical analysis, we believe that many SuM terminals contain both glutamate and GABA. Therefore, both transmissions are able to be modulated by mGluRs and GABAB receptors within the same terminals. As the reviewer pointed out, differential responsiveness of glutamate-containing and GABA-containing vesicles to the GPCR signal could be one of the molecular mechanisms for differential effects of GPCRs on EPSCs and IPSCs. In addition, the spatial coupling between GPCRs and active zones for glutamate and GABA in the same SuM terminals may be different, which may give rise to differential modulation of glutamate and GABA release. These possible mechanisms are now described in the Discussion (line 469-476).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The biphasic events of Figures 3 and S3: I find these (unaveraged) events a bit ambiguous. Another way to look at them is that they are not biphasic per se but rather are not categorizable. Moreover, these events are really tiny, perhaps generated by only a few receptors whose open probability is variable, thus introducing noise into the small currents.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that some events are tiny and some small currents could be masked by background noise. We understand that detecting the biphasic events by minimal stimulation has technical limitations. Because we automatically detected biphasic events, which were defined as an EPSC-IPSC sequence, only if an outward peak current following an inward current appeared within 20 ms of light illumination as described in the method section, we cannot exclude the possibility that the biphasic events we detected might include false biphasic responses. To compensate these technical issues, we also performed strontium-induced asynchronous release as another approach and found similar results as minimal stimulation experiments (Figures 3E and 3F). Furthermore, we confirmed that the amplitudes and kinetics of minimal light stimulation-evoked EPSCs or IPSCs were not altered by blockade of their counterpart currents (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). Even if false biphasic responses were accidentally included in the analysis, eventually biphasic events are a minor population and we successfully detected discernible independent EPSCs and IPSCs, which were the major population of uniquantal release-mediated synaptic responses. Thus, multiple pieces of evidence support distinct release of glutamate and GABA from SuM terminals.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 4 indicates that the immunohistochemical analysis is done on SuM terminals, but I do not see how the authors know that these terminals come from SuM vs other inputs that converge in DG.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising an important point. As shown in Figure 4A, B, almost all VGluT2-positive terminals in the GC layer co-expressed with VIAAT. We are aware that VTA neurons reportedly project to the GC layer of the DG and co-release glutamate and GABA (Ntamati and Luscher, 2016). Contrary to this report, our retrograde tracing analysis did not reveal direct projections from the VTA to the DG. This new data is now included in Figure 4-figure supplement 1. We also added pre-embedding immunogold EM analysis, in which SuM terminals were virally labeled with eYFP, confirming that they form both asymmetric and symmetric synapses (revised Figure 4F). Together with these new data, our results clearly demonstrate that SuM terminals in the GC layer form both asymmetric and symmetric synapses. While our results strongly suggest that VGluT2positive terminals and SuM terminals in the GC layer are nearly identical, we cannot fully exclude the possibility that other inputs originating from unidentified brain regions may co-express VGluT2 and VIAAT in the GC layer. Therefore, in Figure 4 of the revised manuscript, we described “VGluT2-positive terminals” instead of “SuM terminals”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figure 4E also shows many GluN1 terminals not associated with anything, not even Vglut, and the apparent numbers do not mesh with the statistics. Why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In triple immunofluorescence for VGluT2, VIAAT, and GluN1, free GluN1 puncta were predominantly observed in the molecular layer. Given that VGluT2-positive terminals are sparse in the molecular layer, these GluN1 puncta are primarily associated with VGluT1, the dominant subtype. In this study, we focused the analysis of GluN1 puncta specifically on the GC layer, excluding the molecular layer. To avoid miscommunication, we changed the original Figure 4E to the new Figure 4G, which focuses on the GC layer and aligns with the quantitative analysis. Additionally, we used ultrathin sections (100-nm-thick) to enhance spatial resolution, which limits the detection of co-localization events within this confined spatial range, as noted in the Discussion (line 485-488).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Do the conclusions based on the fluorescence immuno mesh with the apparent dimensions of the EM active zones and the apparent intermixing of labeled vesicles in immuno EM?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To further support our immunofluorescence results, we performed EM study and found that a single SuM terminal formed both asymmetric and symmetric synapses on a GC soma (revised Figures 4E and 4F). These new data and our immunofluorescence results clearly indicate that a single SuM terminal forms both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses on a GC and co-release glutamate and GABA.</p>
<p>As the reviewer pointed out, our immuno EM shows that VGluT2 and VIAAT labeled vesicles appear to intermix in asymmetric and symmetric synapses. Accordingly, in the revised manuscript, Figure 7 has been modified to show the intermixing of glutamate and GABA-containing vesicles in the SuM terminal. It should be noted that because of low labeling efficiency, our immuno-EM images don’t represent the whole picture of synaptic vesicles for glutamate and GABA. There could be biased distribution of vesicles close to their release site (more VGluT2-containing vesicles close to asymmetric synapses and more VIAAT-containing vesicles close to symmetric synapses) as reported previously (Root et al., 2018). Additionally, our results could be explained by other mechanisms: co-release of glutamate and GABA from the same vesicles, with one transmitter undetected due to the absence of its postsynaptic receptor. This possibility is now mentioned in the Discussion (line 512-520). More detailed vesicle configuration in a single SuM terminal will have to be investigated in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Figure 6 is not so interesting to me and could be removed. It seems to test the obvious: EPSPs promote firing and IPSPs oppose it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe these results are necessary for the following two reasons. First, we showed that glutamate/GABA co-transmission balance is dynamically changed in a frequency-dependent manner (Figure 5). In terms of physiological significance, it is important to demonstrate how these frequency-dependent dynamic changes affect GC firing. Therefore, we believe that figure 6, which shows how SuM inputs modulate GC firing by repetitive SuM stimulation, is necessary for this paper. Second, we previously reported the excitatory effects of the SuM inputs on GC firing, suggesting the important roles of glutamatergic transmission of the SuM inputs in synaptic plasticity (Hashimotodani et al., 2018; Hirai et al., 2022; Tabuchi et al., 2022). In contrast, how GABAergic cotransmission contributes to SuM-GC synaptic plasticity and DG information processing was not well understood. Our results in figure 6, which demonstrate the inhibitory effects of GABAergic co-transmission on GC firing by high frequency repetitive SuM input activity, clearly show the contribution of GABAergic co-transmission to short-term plasticity at SuM-GC synapses. For these reasons, we would like to keep Figure 6. We hope that our explanations convince the reviewer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors investigated the release properties of glutamate/GABA co-transmission at the supramammillary nucleus (SuM)-granule cell (GC) synapses using in vitro electrophysiology and anatomical approaches at the light and electron microscopy level. They found that SuM to dentate granule cell synapses, which co-release glutamate and GABA, exhibit distinct differences in paired-pulse ratio, Ca2+ sensitivity, presynaptic receptor modulation, and Ca2+ channel-vesicle coupling configuration for each neurotransmitter. The study shows that glutamate/GABA co-release produces independent glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic responses, with postsynaptic targets segregated. They show that most SuM boutons form distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in close proximity, characterized by GluN1 and GABAAα1 receptor labeling, respectively. Furthermore, they demonstrate that glutamate/GABA co-transmission exhibits distinct short-term plasticity, with glutamate showing frequencydependent depression and GABA showing frequency-independent stable depression.</p>
<p>Their findings suggest that these distinct modes of glutamate/GABA co-release by SuM terminals serve as frequency-dependent filters of SuM inputs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by the data.</p>

<p>Some aspects of Supplementary Figure 1A and the table need clarification. Specifically, the claim that the authors have stimulated an axon fiber rather than axon terminals is not convincingly supported by the diagram of the experimental setup.

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s careful attention. In the revised manuscript, we corrected this misword.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>To convincingly demonstrate that the authors stimulated SuM axon fiber instead of SuM terminals (Supplementary Figures 1A), they should provide an image showing the distribution of SuMlabeled fibers and axon terminals reaching the dentate gyrus (DG) and the trace of the optic fiber, rather than providing a diagram of the experimental setup.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. We have now provided a new experimental setup image (Figure 1-figure supplement 1A) showing a single GC, the distribution of SuM fibers in the GC layer, and the illumination area at each location. As SuM inputs make synapses onto the GC soma and dendrite close to the GC cell body, SuM-GC synapses in the recording GCs exist in a very limited area. This characteristic synaptic localization allowed us to control the illumination area without applying light to the SuM terminals in the recording GCs. Delayed onsets of EPSCs/IPSCs by over-axon stimulation (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C, D) also support that SuM terminals in the recording GCs were out of illumination area.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the authors should clarify the discrepancy between the antibody mentioned in the list of primary antibodies, which recognizes the gamma2 subunit of the GABAA receptor, and the alpha1 subunit of the GABAA receptor mentioned in the results and Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this mistake. As described in the main text and figure, we used the antibody for a1 subunit of the GABAA receptor. Table S1 has been corrected in the revised version of the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1, the authors used two [Ca2+]o concentrations to study the EPSC and IPSC amplitudes. How does the Ca2+ concentration affect the PPR in the EPSC and IPSC, respectively?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given that lowering the extracellular Ca2+ concentration reduces the release probability, it is expected that 1 mM extracellular Ca2+ concentration increases PPR compared to 2.5 mM. Actually, we observed that lowering the extracellular Ca2+ concentration increased the synaptic responses from 2nd to 10th (both EPSC and IPSC) by train stimulation (Figure 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Figure 2D, does baclofen also have a dose-dependent effect on the inhibition of the EPSC and IPSC similar to the DCG-IV in Figure 2C?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. Because we aimed to demonstrate the differential inhibitory effects of baclofen at a certain concentration on glutamatergic and GABAergic co-transmission, we did not go into detail regarding a dose-dependent effect. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we performed the effects of higher concentration of baclofen on EPSCs and IPSCs. As shown in the figure below, 50 µM baclofen inhibited EPSCs and IPSCs to the similar extent. Therefore, by comparing inhibitory effect of two different concentrations of baclofen (5 and 50 µM), we believe that baclofen also has a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on both EPSCs and IPSCs similar to the DCGIV.</p>

<p>(5) The use of minimal light stimulation in optogenetic experiments is not appropriately justified or described. More detailed information should be provided, such as whether the optogenetic stimulation is performed on the axon or the terminals of the SuM.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. To effectively detect stochastic synaptic responses, the light stimulation was applied on the terminals of the SuM. We have now stated this information (line 212). We also further described the justification of use of minimal light stimulation in the revised manuscript (line 207-209).</p>
