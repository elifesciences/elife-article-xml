<title>Abstract</title><p>Rhythmic and sequential segmentation of the growing vertebrate body relies on the segmentation clock, a multi-cellular oscillating genetic network. The clock is visible as tissue-level kinematic waves of gene expression that travel through the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) and arrest at the position of each forming segment. Here we test how this hallmark wave pattern is driven by culturing single maturing PSM cells. We compare their cell-autonomous oscillatory and arrest dynamics to those we observe in the embryo at cellular resolution, finding remarkable agreement. This suggests that cell-extrinsic signals are not used by the cells to instruct the developmental program underlying the wave pattern. In contrast, we show that a cell-autonomous timing activity initiates during cell exit from the tailbud, then runs down in the anterior-ward cell flow in the PSM, thereby using elapsed time to provide positional information to the clock. Exogenous FGF lengthens the duration of the cell-intrinsic timer, indicating extrinsic factors in the embryo may regulate the segmentation clock via the timer. In sum, our work suggests that a noisy cell-autonomous, intrinsic timer drives the slowing and arrest of oscillations underlying the wave pattern, while extrinsic factors in the embryo tune this timer’s duration and precision. This is a new insight into the balance of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms driving tissue patterning in development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the vertebrate embryo develops, a multi-cellular patterning system called the segmentation clock translates the rhythm of genetic oscillations into the successive and periodic formation of tissue segments (A. C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Oates, Morelli, and Ares 2012</xref>). These segments, called somites, give rise to the metameric backbone, ribs and associated muscles of the adult body. The segmentation clock’s dynamics are visible in the embryo as tissue-level waves of gene expression that travel anteriorly through the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) until they arrest at the position of the newly forming somite (Alexander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Aulehla et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Delaune et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Masamizu et al. 2006</xref>; I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Palmeirim et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Soroldoni et al. 2014</xref>). Waves are produced by the slowing of oscillations in cells as they mature and flow anteriorly through the spatial reference frame of the PSM; this slowing creates a phase shift along the anteroposterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Delaune et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Morelli et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shih et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yoshioka-Kobayashi et al. 2020</xref>). Here we investigate what drives the cellular-level slowing of oscillations and clock arrest; in particular, we wish to determine the balance of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors in this patterning process.</p>
<p>Previous work has implicated both cell-intrinsic mechanisms and extrinsic signals in driving the slowing of oscillations and clock arrest concurrent with differentiation. These mechanisms include morphogen signaling gradients across the PSM (Ishimatsu et al. 2010, Diaz 2020, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Moreno and Kintner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sawada et al., 2001</xref>; Simsek and Özbudak, 2018), the decay of signaling factors carried anteriorly by PSM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aulehla et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dubrulle and Pourquié, 2004</xref>), the counting of oscillations (I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Palmeirim et al. 1997</xref>; Zákány et al. 2001), the comparison of oscillators’ phases within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sonnen et al. 2018</xref>), and neighboring cells comparing their oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boareto, Tomka, and Iber 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Murray, Maini, and Baker 2011</xref>). However, definitive evidence with respect to the slowing and stopping of oscillations in the embryo is lacking due to the experimental challenges of deconstructing the segmentation clock. The relative balance of cell-intrinsic versus-extrinsic information therefore remains an open question.</p>
<p>The classical test for intrinsic properties is to isolate cells from their neighbors and the tissue environment, then observe their autonomous behavior in culture. Cell culture systems derived from explanted primary material and induced stem cells have been developed with the aim to recapitulate clock dynamics and segmentation (Diaz Cuadros and Pourquie 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pourquié 2022</xref>). Isolated PSM cells have been shown to autonomously oscillate in various permissive culture conditions (Andrew C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oates 2020</xref>). Isolated human and mouse PSM cells derived from stem cells showed autonomous, sustained oscillations upon inhibition of YAP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diaz-Cuadros et al. 2020</xref>; Matsuda, Hayashi, et al. 2020). Similarly, primary PSM cells from mouse showed sustained oscillations upon either YAP signaling inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hubaud et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yoshioka-Kobayashi et al. 2020</xref>) or use of a BSA-coated substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hubaud et al. 2017</xref>), and zebrafish primary PSM cells exhibited sustained noisy oscillations upon addition of FGF8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Webb et al. 2016</xref>). In none of these cases, however, was an oscillatory pattern observed for isolated cells that resembled the slowing frequency profile expected to underlie the <italic>in vivo</italic> wave pattern. Recently, we reported transient (non-steady-state) oscillations in zebrafish primary PSM cells cultured without signaling molecules, small molecule inhibitors, serum, or BSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Negrete JR et al. 2021</xref>), yet it remains unclear how these oscillations relate to the wave pattern in the embryo. Here, by quantitative comparison of cell behavior in culture and in the intact zebrafish embryo, we show that isolated PSM cells have a cell-autonomous, intrinsic program capable of producing the wave pattern.</p>

<title>Cell-autonomous transient dynamics in concert with PSM differentiation</title>
<p>To analyze transient dynamics from cells originating within a defined anteroposterior region of the PSM, we dissected out the posterior-most quarter of the PSM (PSM4) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Each PSM4 explant was separately dissociated manually in DPBS (-CaCl2, -MgCl2) and cultured at low-density on protein A-coated glass in L15 medium without added signaling molecules, small molecule inhibitors, serum, or BSA (N = 11 embryos). Oscillation and arrest dynamics were followed using Her1-YFP, a fluorescently-tagged core clock component, previously used to define the zebrafish clock’s tissue-level wave pattern in <italic>Tg(her1:her1-YFP)</italic> embryos, called <italic>Tg(her1-YFP)</italic> here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Soroldoni et al., 2014</xref>), and a novel Mesp-ba-mKate2 transgene <italic>Tg(mesp-ba:mesp-ba-mKate2),</italic> called <italic>Tg(mesp-ba-mKate2)</italic> here, which marks the rostral half of the forming somite in the anterior PSM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>; Figure 1 – figure supplement 1), as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cutty et al. 2012</xref>). Mesp expression has been used in multi-cellular segmentation clock cultures as a marker of differentiation upon clock arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Diaz-Cuadros et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lauschke et al. 2013</xref>; Matsuda, Yamanaka, et al. 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Matsumiya et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tsiairis and Aulehla 2016</xref>). Analysis of Her1-YFP and Mesp-ba-mKate2 intensity was carried out in single <italic>Tg(her1-YFP;mesp-ba-mKate2)</italic> cells that survived over 5 hours post-dissociation, remained the only cell in the field of view, did not divide, and showed transient Her1-YFP dynamics (Figure 1 – figure supplement 2).</p>

<p>Single PSM4 cells in culture produced Her1-YFP oscillations with 1 to 8 peaks before arresting (N = 11 embryos, n = 174 cells; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,E</xref>). These oscillations typically slowed then abruptly arrested (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,F</xref>; Figure 1 – figure supplement 3). Oscillation arrest, marked by the last Her1-YFP peak, was also associated with Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,D</xref><bold>)</bold>, suggesting that arrest occurs in concert with differentiation as expected from the tissue-level pattern. These transient dynamics were independent of cell-survival time in culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> – figure supplement 4), reproduced in cells isolated one-per-well (Figure 1 – figure supplement 5) and did not require <italic>Tg(mesp-ba-mKate2)</italic> (Figure 1 – figure supplement 6). Overall variation in arrest timing was not due to differences between individual embryos or experiments (Figure 1 – figure supplement 7), limiting its source to heterogeneity within the starting PSM4 cell population and/or to the noise in an intrinsic process. Taken together, our data show that PSM4 cells autonomously slow oscillations and arrest the clock in concert with expression of a segmental differentiation marker.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cell-Autonomous PSM transient dynamics mirror those in the embryo</title>
<p>To see whether the PSM4 cell-autonomous clock dynamics in culture recapitulated those produced in the embryo, we tracked cells that originated from PSM4 then flowed anteriorly until somite formation using light-sheet imaging of freely-growing <italic>Tg(her1-YFP;h2b-mCherry</italic>) embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Retaining their initial local anteroposterior arrangement, cells from the PSM4 region predominantly contributed to two of four somites and differed by at most one Her1-YFP peak within a somite (N = 2 embryos, n = 128 cells; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G,H</xref>; Figure 1 – supplement figure 8). To normalize for a general slowing of developmental time observed in zebrafish culture, as well as the overall longer periods of PSM4 cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Langenberg, Brand, and Cooper 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Webb et al. 2016</xref>; Matsuda, Hayashi, et al. 2020); Figure 1 – supplement figure 9), we used the number of peaks generated and the ratio of successive periods and peak intensities to compare cell dynamics, rather than absolute time. Cells in culture produced on average more peaks and showed increased variability in the number of peaks compared to cells in the embryo (mean ± SD = 4.4 ± 1.6 peaks in culture, COV 0.36; 3.4 ± 1.0 peaks in the embryo, COV 0.29; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E,I</xref>; Figure 1 – supplement figure 9), indicating a longer and more variable duration of the cell-autonomous transient dynamics. Because the cells tracked in the embryo originated from the same starting population as those in culture, these results indicate that the variability in culture is not due to a difference in initial heterogeneity within that cell population, but reflects an increase in the noise of the cell-autonomous dynamics.</p>
<p>The key dynamic of successive period slowing was shared between PSM4 cells in culture and in the embryo (81% of successive cycles slowed in culture vs 79% in the embryo; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F,J</xref>; Figure 1 – supplement figure 10C,E). However, a rise in intensity from one peak to the next was seen less often in culture (72% successive cycles in culture and 92% in the embryo; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F,J</xref>; Figure 1 – supplement figure 10B,D), and there was less of a correlation between intensity rise and slowing in the culture than in the embryo (57% of successive cycles both slow and rise in culture vs 73% in the embryo; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F,J</xref>). These differences in accompanying intensity rise show that although the cell-autonomous program generates slowing oscillations, the amplitude of the oscillations is noisier, suggesting that this feature may be tuned by extrinsic factors in the tissue.</p>
<p>We next asked whether Her1-YFP arrest and Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset in the culture reflected the spatiotemporal pattern of these events in a forming somite in the embryo. To systematically address this question, we backtracked all the cells in the recently formed somite (S1) in a <italic>Tg(her1-YFP;h2b-mCherry</italic>) embryo and <italic>Tg(mesp-ba-mKate2;h2a-GFP</italic>) embryo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,B</xref>). All cells in the somite expressed Her1-YFP and most produced a last peak in the prospective somite (S -1), creating a phase profile across the future rostral-caudal somite axis that reflected the tissue-level wave’s arrival (n = 233 cells, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Thus, in the embryo, clock arrest of all the cells that form a single somite does not occur simultaneously, but is nevertheless spatiotemporally limited within S-1. Similar to the embryo, most PSM4 cells in culture that survived past 5 h and remained undivided were found to oscillate and arrest Her1-YFP (Figure 1 – supplement figure 2).</p>

<p>Mesp-ba-mKate2 was first detected within the forming somite (S0), with higher levels rostrally. We defined Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset times in intensity traces from cells in the embryo and in culture that had a clear intensity rise (Figure 2 – supplement figure 1A). The distribution of Mesp-ba-mKate2 intensity rise and proportion of cells with a clear signal-onset time in the embryo was comparable to that seen within the PSM4 cells in culture (N = 2; Figure 2 – supplement figure 1A,B), suggesting that there is no cell-autonomous default state, i.e. Mesp “on” or “off”.</p>
<p>To directly compare the temporal relationship of Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset and Her1-YFP arrest in individual cells, we backtracked from the most recently formed somite (S1) in <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>her1-YFP;mesp-mKate2</italic>) dual-transgenic embryos. We found that Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset mostly occurred after the last Her1-YFP peak in the embryo. However, this relationship was not as precise in culture, with Mesp-ba-mKate signal-onset spanning the last peak (Figure 2 – supplement figure 1C,D), indicating a loss of coordination in the transition between clock arrest and segment polarization.</p>
<p>We next asked whether the cell-autonomous clock slowing and arrest, and the differentiation of cells, relied on oscillations of the clock, potentially by using the accumulating cycles as a timer. To test this, we examined the timing of cell-autonomous Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset in cells isolated from embryos with a genetic background lacking both <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> genes, a condition that disables the clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lleras Forero et al. 2018</xref>). We detected a similar proportion of Mesp signal-onset in control <italic>Tg(mesp-ba-mKate2)</italic> and <italic>her1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>; <italic>her7<sup>-/-</sup></italic>; <italic>Tg(mesp-ba-mKate2)</italic> cells (Figure 2 – supplement figure 2A,B), and observed comparable timing (281 ± 62 min in control cells, 305 ± 70 min in <italic>her1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>; <italic>her7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells; Figure 2 – supplement figure 2C). Thus, the global Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset and its timing appear independent of the segmentation clock’s dynamics.</p>
<p>Together, our data suggests that the slowing and arrest of oscillations underlying the wave pattern in embryos is driven cell-autonomously in differentiating PSM cells. However, the noisier dynamics of the cell-autonomous program suggest that extrinsic signals present in the embryo may adjust the time of clock arrest in concert with differentiation, and sharpen clock oscillatory dynamics.</p>

<title>FGF extends the cell-autonomous clock and differentiation program in cultured posterior PSM cells</title>
<p>We next explored whether FGF, an extrinsic signal known to affect segmentation, interacts with the cell-autonomous program by culturing PSM4 cells in the presence of FGF8 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A,B</xref>; Figure 3 – supplement figure 1). A gradient of FGF signaling has been shown to extend from the tailbud across the PSM and has been postulated to provide spatiotemporal information to the segmentation clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dubrulle and Pourquié 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sawada et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akiyama et al. 2014</xref>; Sari et al. 2018). Previous experiments implanting FGF8-soaked beads adjacent to posterior PSM in the embryo resulted in an extension of clock/PSM activity such that somite boundary formation was delayed, yielding shorter segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dubrulle, McGrew, and Pourquié 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sawada et al. 2001</xref>). Consistent with this delay in the embryo, we found that addition of FGF8 to the culture medium extended the cell-autonomous program in PSM4 cells, doubling the mean number of oscillations generated per cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) and shifting the Her1-YFP last peak to later times (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, exogenous FGF did not reduce noise in the cell-autonomous program (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C,D</xref>; Figure 3 – supplement 2).</p>

</fig>
<p>Despite the Her1-YFP last peak occurring later on average, it retained a temporal association with Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset in the presence of FGF (Figure 3 – supplement figure 3A) and the distribution of Mesp-ba-mKate2 intensity traces was not altered (Figure 3 – supplement figure 3B). Interestingly, a small subset of cells (5 out of 54 cells) produced multiple Her1-YFP oscillations after the Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset (Figure 3 – supplement figure 1), suggesting that these events can be uncoupled. Together, these results indicate that the PSM4 cell-autonomous program can extend the timing of clock arrest and segmental differentiation in response to FGF.</p>
<p>We found that successive oscillations continued to slow overall in the presence of FGF, although in fewer successive cycles (65% in FGF-treated cells vs 81% in control; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,F</xref>), suggesting some disorganization of the dynamics in the FGF-extended cell-autonomous program. Successive increase in peak intensity was also observed (66% of FGF-treated cells vs 73% of control; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,G</xref>), mostly in conjunction with slowing oscillations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Despite this increased noise in the cell-autonomous program, we did not observe a systematic alteration of the period and intensity in response to FGF (Figure F,G).</p>
<p>Together, our data shows that FGF extends the duration of the cell-autonomous program transient dynamics in a manner that could explain reported effects of FGF activity on segment boundary position in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dubrulle, McGrew, and Pourquié 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sawada et al. 2001</xref>) and supports a hypothesis that extrinsic signals act upon the clock through the cell-autonomous program.</p>

<title>Cell-autonomous, intrinsic timer initiates as cells exit the tailbud</title>
<p>We hypothesize that the cell-autonomous program of slowing oscillations and arrest is controlled by a timer that, in the embryo, encodes positional information as cells flow anteriorly. If an intrinsic timer provides positional information to the clock in the embryo, we predicted that cells located more anteriorly in the PSM will have less time remaining before arrest and differentiation. To test this, we followed oscillation and arrest dynamics in single isolated cells originating from different anteroposterior quarters of PSM tissue in the embryo, and used PSM4 dissected from the same embryos as an internal reference (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; Figure 4 – supplement 1A). Consistent with a timer running down in the embryo, isolated PSM cells originating more anteriorly successively slowed oscillations, but tended to produced fewer peaks than PSM4 cells and arrested Her1-YFP earlier in concert with Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>; Figure 4 -supplement figure 1A-E; Figure 4 – supplement figures 2 and 3).</p>

</fig>
<p>To explore when this timer starts, we cultured cells from the tailbud (TB) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), where Her1-YFP oscillations are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Soroldoni et al. 2014</xref>) and progenitor cells are thought to be maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Martin 2016</xref>). Single TB cells in culture also oscillated with successive slowing, then arrested concurrent with Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>; Figure 4 - supplement figure 1C-E; Figure 4 – supplement 4). Moreover, TB and PSM4 dissected from the same embryos were found to arrest oscillations with similar timing, despite the more posterior origin of the TB cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>; Figure 4 - supplement figure 1A, B). These results suggest that experimental removal from the TB starts the intrinsic timer such that its duration is equivalent to that of cells which have recently entered the PSM. We thus propose that TB cells have already expressed the cell-autonomous timing mechanism, but require a trigger associated with exit from the TB to start the timing activity.</p>
<p>If the timer starts upon TB exit, then we expected that cells in the embryo initiate slowing oscillations and amplitude rise when they transition into the PSM. Cells within the TB are known to mix and remain for a range of times before joining the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mara et al. 2007</xref>). To compare the start of slowing oscillation in TB cells that join the PSM at different times, we backtracked individual cells located either within PSM4 or the most recently formed somite at the end of a 450 min time-lapse movie (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). We observed that while in the TB, individual cells from both groups showed low-intensity, noisy Her1-YFP oscillations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F,G</xref>). As the embryo developed, the group of cells backtracked from the recently formed somite were the first to join the PSM, at which time their oscillations slowed successively and increased in peak intensity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H,I</xref>). These dynamics continued as cells flowed anteriorly then arrested during somite formation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F,H</xref>,I). In contrast, the group of cells backtracked from PSM4 exited the TB later and showed a corresponding delay in slowing, and intensity rise (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G-I</xref>). This tight correlation of the initiation of slowing oscillations in cells with their exit from the TB in the embryo supports the idea that exit from the TB starts the intrinsic timer.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The population-level behavior of the oscillators of the segmentation clock is the hallmark wave pattern. The role of short-range cell-cell signaling through the Delta-Notch pathway in the local synchronization of the oscillators is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Venzin and Oates 2020</xref>), providing local coherence to the wave pattern. However, the mechanism for the gradual slowing and stopping of the oscillators that creates the phase off-set required for waves at the tissue-level remains a topic of debate. Our results clearly implicate a cell-autonomous program of slowing and stopping as the basis for the tissue-level wave-pattern in the zebrafish, and show that a universal picture of the vertebrate segmentation clock that is centered on persistent cellular oscillators instructed by extrinsic signals is inadequate. Rather, our work highlights the importance of transient dynamics driven by a cell-autonomous timing mechanism.</p>
<p>How the balance of cell-intrinsic dynamics and extrinsic signaling plays out in other segmentation clock systems remains to be tested. However, the concept of a cell-intrinsic timer explains the long-known intrinsic properties of explanted PSM tissue from several species to segment with periodicity and AP directionality (Alexander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aulehla and Pourquié 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dubrulle, McGrew, and Pourquié 2001</xref>; Clarissa A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Henry et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lauschke et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Maroto et al. 2005</xref>; I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Palmeirim et al. 1997</xref>; Isabel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Palmeirim et al. 1998</xref>). Indeed, the long-standing “Clock and Wavefront” model of the segmentation clock originally postulated an intracellular timing gradient as the mechanism behind the wavefront of cellular change interacting with the clock to determine somite position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cooke and Zeeman 1976</xref>). Here we show that the clock and wavefront are both captured in a single cell running an autonomous program.</p>
<p>The difference in duration and precision between cellular dynamics in the embryo and those in culture conditions distinguishes important roles of extrinsic signaling in the zebrafish segmentation clock. These roles are to regulate the length of the autonomous program and to increase the precision of the exit time in the population, so that all cells contributing to a single somite in the embryo stop oscillating and express a differentiation marker together within the period of somite formation. If the variability of the cultured cells were to be mapped on to the embryonic axis, the program exit would be spread across more somites than normally occurs, with potentially disruptive results for segmentation. The ability of FGF to extend the duration of the program of cultured cells fits well with data from embryo experiments on changing segment lengths (Dubruelle et al., 2001, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sawada et al., 2001</xref>), but the variability observed implies that additional signals, or the temporal dynamics of the signals, are important for precision at the tissue level. The signal starting the timer upon the exit of a cell from the tailbud to the PSM is likewise not known, but our experiments suggest that the rapid decrease of a signal normally restricted to the tailbud would explain the observed dynamics. Whether other candidate signals such as Wnt and RA (A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aulehla and Pourquié 2010</xref>), or signal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sonnen et al. 2018</xref>), integrate into the control of intrinsic cell behavior to explain the timing and precision of embryonic segmentation can now be explored.</p>
<p>The intrinsic timer’s identity and how it is tuned by extrinsic signals during development remain intriguing questions. The molecular details of the timer are not constrained by our data here, and could involve a number of plausible intermediates such as transcription factor or microRNA cascades similar to those in timing of neuroblast differentiation or <italic>C. elegans</italic> molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ambros 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brody and Odenwald 2000</xref>) or phospho-timers as found in the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Diernfellner and Brunner 2020</xref>). The latter mechanism would provide an attractive link to extrinsic signalling by FGF gradients in the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sawada et al. 2001</xref>; Simsek and Özbudak 2018). A model for slowing and then stopping oscillations via the rise and fall of Her1 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Negrete JR et al. 2021</xref>) implies that molecules controlling <italic>her1</italic> transcription, such as Tbx proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brend and Holley 2009</xref>) and/or Her1 translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dill and Amacher 2005</xref>) are involved as time-keeping factors. In this light, the activity of the Tbx-degrading factor Ripply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wanglar et al. 2014</xref>) may play a role in the threshold at which production falls, thereby rapidly stopping the oscillations. Other models posit that the slowing of Her oscillations arise due to an increase of time-delays in the negative feedback loop of the core clock circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yabe, Uriu, and Takada 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ay et al. 2014</xref>), suggesting that factors influencing the duration of pre-mRNA splicing, translation, or nuclear transport may be relevant. Whatever the identity, our results indicate the timer ought to exert control over differentiation independent of the clock.</p>
<p>Organizing animal and plant tissues and microbial assemblies with oscillatory mechanisms in naturally occurring and synthetic systems is a rapidly evolving field of interest. This includes the investigation of the segmentation clock through innovative 3D culture models (van den Brink et al. 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sanaki-Matsumiya et al. 2022</xref>). Although patterns in multicellular contexts can emerge from extrinsic signaling processes alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Danino et al. 2010</xref>), understanding the cell-intrinsic potential within these various systems is vital to interpreting and directing population level behavior. Our work combining isolated primary cell culture and single-cell resolution imaging of the corresponding developing tissue, reveals that cell-autonomous timing directs the tissue-level patterning of the clock, and offers new opportunities to study the balance of extrinsic and intrinsic control in oscillatory patterning systems.</p>

<p>Using the segmented notochord as a spatial reference in the preliminary data set, the spatial coordinates of the cells were projected to the nearest point in the notochord using Euclidean distance. This produced a new coordinate system, where cells have a reference frame in the moving and growing embryo. Each notochord segment, corresponding to the area of projected tracked cells, was then aligned over time to create a kymograph (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Using the X and Y coordinates in the projected notochord, a matrix was built where the rows are each notochord segment over time going from posterior to anterior. The columns correspond to a binned spatial region of the cell projection. The color code used for the Her1-YFP Kymograph was the time and position of the last peak of the cells (green). For Mesp-ba-mKate2, the signal-onset time and position (magenta) was used.</p>

<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Individual 15 somite-staged embryos were dechorionated in E3 then transferred into DPBS(-CaCl2, -MgCl2), where cells of interest were dissected out within 5 minutes. Using forceps (Dumont #5SF Forceps, straight, superfine, Fine Science Tools Item 11252-00) and a microknife (Needle Blade Microsurgical Knife Straight, Sharpoint, ref 78-6810), the skin and yolk were removed, leaving the trunk and tail intact. Holding the embryo in a lateral view, the TB was cut off posterior to the end of the notochord and the remaining AP axis up to the last formed somite boundary was quartered. PSM quarters from the desired AP level were then oriented in cross-section view so that PSM could be cut free of lateral tissue, neural tube and notochord. Dissected tissue was moved with F-127 Pluronics-coated pipette tips into coated tubes containing 50 μl DPBS(-CaCl2, -MgCl2). After a 5 min incubation in DPBS, the pieces were manually dissociated into single cells by brief pipetting and then transferred into wells of a 24-well glass bottom plate (Greiner Bio-One, 662896) that had been pre-coated with Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (Sigma P6031; 100 ng/μl PA) and contained 800 μl culture media (Leibovitz’s L15 Medium, no phenol red, Thermo Fisher 21083027; 50 ng/μl Protein A; 0.01% Methyl Cellulose, Sigma 274429). Surface conditions were critical to successful cultures. For example, glass surfaces should not be acid-treated, and Protein A batches and strains exhibited substantial differences. Any undissociated clusters of cells were aspirated out of the culture well using a glass needle attached to a syringe. Embryos and cells were maintained around 28.5°C throughout dissection and dissociation. In experiments involving FGF, we added FGF8 (423-F8b R&amp;D System) at 100ng/ml to the culture media just prior to adding the dissociated cells.</p>
<p>Cells were allowed to settle in the well plate on the microscope stage at 28.5°C and imaging positions were selected and focused in a 50 – 90 min window before imaging started. The time post-dissociation that imaging started was noted for each experiment in order for Her1-YFP last peak and Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset timing to be compared relative to the time of dissociation rather than to the start of imaging.</p>
<p>To compare cells of different anteroposterior origins, PSM4 was dissected from each embryo alongside another PSM quarter of interest or TB, then cultured in an adjacent well and imaged at the same time. This provided an internal reference for arrest timing differences along the anteroposterior axis. In experiments comparing control and FGF-treated results, a starting pool of dissociated cells was split into two wells (±FGF).</p>
<p>Comparison of cell-autonomous Mesp-ba-mKate2 signal-onset timing in PSM4 cells from embryos that have a disabled clock (<italic>her1-/-; her7-/-;Tg(mesp-ba-mKate2)</italic>, with PSM4 cells from control (<italic>Tg(mesp-ba-mKate2</italic>) embryos was also carried out in parallel. We selected the <italic>her1-/-; her7-/-</italic> line because multiple studies have shown that the segmentation clock is critically crippled by the removal of two or more Hes family members from the core clock mechanism (C A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Henry 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lleras Forero et al. 2018</xref>; Andrew C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oates and Ho 2002</xref>; Sari et al. 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schröter et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zinani et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Our criteria for continued analysis of cells in culture was as follows: 1) alive &gt; 5 hours post-dissociation; 2) one cell in the field of view; 3) undivided; and 4) expressed and arrested Her1-YFP.</p>

<title>Cell culture imaging</title>
<p>Cells were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti (inverted) equipped with a 40x NA0.95 objective, Andor iXon897 Ultra EMCCD (512 x 512 with 16 μm pixels), Lumencor SpectraX, and hardware autofocus. Her1-YFP was detected using a Chroma 49003 filter, and Mesp-ba-mKate2 with Chroma 49008. Imaging parameters were as follows: YFP at 400 ms exposure, 4x4 binning, 1 MHz (16-bit) read-out mode, EM Gain =50, Conversion Gain=1, 510 nm LED at 20% intensity; mKate2 at 1000 ms exposure, 4x4 binning, 1 MHz (16-bit) read-out mode, EM Gain=50, Conversion Gain=1, 586 nm LED at 3% intensity; Bright field at arbitrary exposure time, no binning, 1 MHz (16-bit) read-out mode, EM Gain=50, Conversion Gain =1. Up to 120 positions with only one cell in the field of view were selected at the start of imaging per experiment. A single plane of bright field, YFP and mKate2 was captured at 10 min intervals for over 16 h using the perfect focus system. Cells remained in the center of the field of view without re-positioning throughout the movie. Temperature was controlled at 28.5 (± 0.3°C) using a stage-top incubator (Bold line, Okolab), and a light-blocking incubation chamber (Solent Scientific).</p>

<title>Cell culture image processing</title>
<p>Bright field images were passed through a custom MATLAB code for segmenting single cells. Contrast of the grayscale image of the first frame was enhanced using the adapthisteq built-in algorithm, then filtered using a guided filter (imguidedfilter, neighbourhood=3 by 3 pixels and degree of smoothing=0.001) to preserve cell edges (regions of high variance in pixel intensity) while filtering out noise. Next, a gradient image was generated by subtracting an eroded image (imerode, disk structuring element=2 pixels) from a dilated (imdilate, disk structuring element=2 pixels) image, providing a rough outline of potential cells. Otsu’s thresholding was applied to this, resulting in a binary image with several white regions (termed blobs) that represented potential cells. Given that cells were positioned approximately at the center of each image, the largest blob at the center of the image was segmented and pixel intensities in the rest of the image were set to zero (black). This served as a mask for further processing. The built-in activecontour algorithm (300 iterations, Chan-Vese method, smooth factor=1, contraction bias=0.1) was then applied on the gradient image with the mask serving as the initial state of the algorithm. The boundaries of the object region in the mask (in white) define the initial contour position used for contour evolution that ultimately segments the cell. Output from the algorithm represented the segmented cell. Fluorescent intensities from the segmented region were then determined for further analysis. Segmentation of each frame was confirmed manually and corrected when necessary.</p>
<p>Mesp-ba-Kate signal in her1<sub>-/-</sub>;her7<sub>-/-</sub> and control PSM4 cells in culture was detected as Maximum Intensity within a manually placed ROI around the cell in Fiji.</p>

<title>Her1-YFP intensity trace peaks and period</title>
<sec id="s4k1">
<title>Cells in culture</title>
<p>The high signal to noise of the intensity traces allowed the oscillatory region to be determined by visual inspection. To find the position of the peaks within this region, we used the MATLAB findpeaks function. A second order polynominal fit was performed using the intensity at the maximum, and right before/after it in order to optimise the peak positions.</p>
<p>Oscillatory cycles were defined between peaks. Intensity at peaks (I+) and troughs (I-) was also found.</p>

<title>Cells in the embryo</title>
<p>Peaks and troughs were defined using the entire intensity trace of Her1-YFP. The peaks and troughs of these oscillations were then calculated using the Scientific Python library’s peak finder (scipy.signal.find_peaks) (SciPy 1.0 Contributors et al. 2020). A single set of parameters (width, distance and prominence) were chosen for peak identification in all intensity traces. Oscillatory cycles were calculated following the same method used for the cells in culture.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, Rohde et al. discuss how single cells isolated from the presomitic mesoderm of the zebrafish embryo follow a cell-autonomous differentiation &quot;programme&quot;, which is dependent on the initial anteroposterior position in the embryo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This work and in particular the comparison to cellular behaviour in vivo presents a detailed description of the oscillatory system that brings the developmental biology forward in their understanding of somitogenesis.</p>
<p>
The main novelty lies in the direct comparison of these isolated single cells to single cells tracked within the developing embryo. This allows them to show that isolated cells follow a similar path of differentiation without direct contact to neighbours or the presence of external morphogen gradients. Based on this, the authors propose an internal timer that starts ticking as cells traverse the presomitic mesoderm, while external signals modify this behaviour.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There are a few things that would clarify the current statement or might be added in a reasonable amount of time to further increase the relevance of this study:</p>
<p>
- My main point of concern is the precision of dissection. The authors distinguish cells isolated from the tailbud and different areas in the PSM. They suggest that the cell-autonomous timer is initiated, as cells exit the tailbud.</p>
<p>
This is also relevant for the comparison of single cells isolated from the embryo and cells within the embryo. The dissection will always be less precise and cells within the PSM4 region could contain tailbud cells (as also indicated in Figure 1A), while in the analysis of live imaging data cells can be selected more precisely based on their location. This could therefore contribute to the difference in noise between isolated single cells and cells in the embryo. This could also explain why there are &quot;on average more peaks&quot; in isolated cells (p. 6, l. 7).</p>
<p>
This aspect should be considered in the interpretation of the data and mentioned at least in the discussion.</p>
<p>
(It does not contradict their finding that more anterior cells oscillate less often and differentiate earlier than more posterior ones.)</p>
<p>- Here, the authors focus on the question of how cells differentiate. The reverse question is not addressed at all. How do cells maintain their oscillatory state in the tailbud? One possibility is that cells need external signals to maintain that as indicated in Hubaud et al. 2014. In this regard, the definition of tailbud is also very vague. What is the role of neuromesodermal progenitors? The proposal that the timer is started when cells exit the tailbud is at this point a correlation and there is no functional proof, as long as we do not understand how cells maintain the tailbud state. These are points that should be considered in the discussion.</p>
<p>- The authors observe that the number of oscillations in single cells ex vivo is more variable than in the embryo. This is presumably due to synchronization between neighbouring cells via Notch signalling in the embryo. Would it be possible to add low doses of Notch inhibitor to interfere with efficient synchronization, while at the same time keeping single cell oscillations high enough to be able to quantify them?</p>
<p>In the same direction, it would be interesting to test if variation is decreased, when the number of isolated cells is increased, i.e. if cells are cultured in groups of 2,3 or 4 cells, for instance.</p>
<p>- It seems that the initiation of Mesp2 expression is rather reproducible and less noisy (+/- 2 oscillation cycles), while the number of oscillations varies considerably (and the number of cells continuing to oscillate after Mesp2 expression is too low to account for that). How can the authors explain this apparent discrepancy?</p>
<p>- The observation that some cells continue oscillating despite the upregulation of Mesp2 should be discussed further and potential mechanism described, such as incomplete differentiation.</p>

<p>The authors demonstrate convincingly the potential of single mesodermal cells, removed from zebrafish embryos, to show cell-autonomous oscillatory signaling dynamics and differentiation. Their main conclusion is that a cell-autonomous timer operates in these cells and that additional external signals are integrated to tune cellular dynamics. Combined, this is underlying the precision required for proper embryonic segmentation, in vivo. I think this work stands out for its very thorough, quantitative, single-cell real-time imaging approach, both in vitro and also in vivo. A very significant progress and investment in method development, at the level of the imaging setup and also image analysis, was required to achieve this highly demanding task. This work provides new insight into the biology underlying embryo axis segmentation.</p>
<p>
The work is very well presented and accessible. I think most of the conclusions are well supported. Here a my comments and suggestions:</p>
<p>1. The authors state that &quot;We compare their cell-autonomous oscillatory and arrest dynamics to those we observe in the embryo at cellular resolution, finding remarkable agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>I think this statement needs to be better placed in context. In absolute terms, the period of oscillations and the timing of differentiation are actually very different in vitro, compared to in vitro. While oscillations have a period of ~30 minutes in vivo, oscillations take twice as long in vitro. Likewise, while the last oscillation is seen after 143 minutes in vivo, the timing of differentiation is very significantly prolonged, i.e.more than doubled, to 373min in vitro (Supplementary Figure 1-9). I understand what the authors mean with 'remarkable agreement', but this statement is at the risk of being misleading. I think the in vitro to in vivo differences (in absolute time scales) needs to be stated more explicitly. In fact, the drastic change in absolute timescales, while preserving the relative ones,i.e. the number of oscillations a cell is showing before onset of differentiation remains relatively invariant, is a remarkable finding that I think merits more consideration (see below).</p>
<p>1. One timer vs. many timers</p>
<p>Currently, these are discussed somewhat interchangeably, for instance here: &quot;Other models posit that the slowing of Her oscillations arise due to an increase of time-delays in the negative feedback loop of the core clock circuit (Yabe, Uriu, and Takada 2023; Ay et al. 2014), suggesting that factors influencing the duration of pre-mRNA splicing, translation, or nuclear transport may be relevant. Whatever the identity, our results indicate the timer ought to exert control over differentiation independent of the clock.&quot;(page 14). In the first part, the slowing down of oscillations is discussed and then the authors conclude on 'the timer', which however is the one timing differentiation, not the slowing down. I think this could be somewhat misleading.</p>
<p>1. From this and previous studies, we learn/know that without clock oscillations, the onset of differentiation still occurs. For instance in clock mutant embryos (mouse, zebrafish), mesp onset is still occurring, albeit slightly delayed and not in a periodic but smooth progression. This timing of differentiation can occur without a clock and it is this timer the authors refer to &quot;Whatever the identity, our results indicate the timer ought to exert control over differentiation independent of the clock.&quot; (page 14). This 'timer' is related to what has been previously termed 'the wavefront' in the classic Clock and Wavefront model from 1976, i.e. a &quot;timing gradient' and smooth progression of cellular change. The experimental evidence showing it is cell-autonomous by the time it has been laid down,, using single cell measurements, is an important finding, and I would suggest to connect it more clearly to the concept of a wavefront, as per model from 1976.</p>
<p>2. Regarding question a., clearly, the timer for the slowing down of oscillations is operating in single cells, an important finding of this study. It is remarkable to note in this context that while the overall, absolute timescale of slowing down is entirely changed by going from in vivo to in vitro, the relative slowing down of oscillations, per cycle, is very much comparable, both in vivo and in vivo. To me, while this study does not address the nature of this timer directly, the findings imply that the cell-autonomous timer that controls slowing down is, in fact, linked to the oscillations themselves. We have previously discussed such a timer, i.e. a 'self-referential oscillator' mechanism (in mouse embryos, see Lauschke et al., 2013) and it seems the new exciting findings shown here in zebrafish provide important additional evidence in this direction. I would suggest commenting on this potential conceptual link, especially for those readers interested to see general patterns.</p>
<p>3. Regarding question c., i.e. how the two timing mechanisms are functionally linked, I think concluding that &quot;Whatever the identity, our results indicate the timer ought to exert control over differentiation independent of the clock.&quot; (page 14), might be a bit of an oversimplification. It is correct that the timer of differentiation is operating without a clock, however, physiologically, the link to the clock (and hence the dependence of the timescale of clock slowing down), is also evident. As the author states, without clock input, the precision of when and where differentiation occurs is impacted. I would hence emphasize the need to answer question c., more clearly, not to give the impression that the timing of differentiation does not integrate the clock, which above statement could be interpreted to say.</p>
<p>4. A very interesting finding presented here is that in some rare examples, the arrest of oscillations and onset of differentiation (i.e. mesp) can become dissociated. Again, this shows we deal here with interacting, but independent modules. Just as a comment, there is an interesting medaka mutant, called doppelkorn (Elmasri et al. 2004), which shows a reminiscent phenotype &quot;the Medaka dpk mutant shows an expansion of the her7 expression domain, with apparently normal mesp expression levels in the anterior PSM.&quot;. The authors might want to refer to this potential in vivo analogue to their single cell phenotype.</p>
<p>5. One strength of the presented in vitro system is that it enables precise control and experimental perturbations. A very informative set of experiments would be to test the dependence of the cell-autonomous timing mechanisms (plural) seen in isolated cells on ongoing signalling cues, for instance via Fgf and Wnt signaling. The inhibition of these pathways with well-characterised inhibitors, in single cells, would provide important additional insight into the nature of the timing mechanisms, their dependence on signaling and potentially even into how these timers are functionally interdependent.</p>
