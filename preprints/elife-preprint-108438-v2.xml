<abstract><p>The ability to learn and form memories is critical for animals to make choices that promote their survival. The biological processes underlying learning and memory are mediated by a variety of genes in the nervous system, acting at specific times during memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Many studies have utilised candidate gene approaches or random mutagenesis screens in model animals to explore the key molecular drivers for learning and memory. We propose a complementary approach to identify this network of learning regulators: the proximity-labelling tool TurboID, which promiscuously biotinylates neighbouring proteins, to snapshot the proteomic profile of neurons during learning. To do this, we expressed the TurboID enzyme in the entire nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and exposed animals to biotin only during the training step of an appetitive gustatory learning paradigm. Our approach revealed hundreds of proteins specific to ‘trained’ worms, including components of molecular pathways previously implicated in memory in multiple species such as insulin signalling, G protein-coupled receptor signalling, and MAP kinase signalling. Most (87-95%) of the proteins identified are neuronal, with relatively high representation for neuron classes involved in locomotion and learning. We validated several novel regulators of learning, including cholinergic receptors (ACC-1, ACC-3, LGC-46) and putative arginine kinase F46H5.3. These previously uncharacterised learning regulators all showed a clear impact on appetitive gustatory learning, with F46H5.3 showing an additional effect on aversive gustatory memory. Overall, we show that proximity labelling can be used in the brain of a small animal as a feasible and effective method to advance our knowledge on the biology of learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All animals with a brain have the capacity to change their behaviour in response to changes in the environment. This capacity – to learn and remember – is essential for survival. There are numerous structural and molecular changes in the brain that modulate learning and memory in specific brain regions, occurring in a time and context-dependent manner (examples in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Huckleberry et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Lin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Peixoto et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">Watteyne et al., 2020</xref>); reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>)). Research using model organisms has been essential towards understanding the key regulatory mechanisms underlying learning, many of which involve neurotransmitter signalling, neuromodulator signalling, signal transduction pathways, and cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Peng et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Lamprecht, 2014</xref>). Importantly, many of these mechanisms appear to be conserved across diverse species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Matsumoto et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Multiple studies have demonstrated that changes in the neuronal proteome are required for learning and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Inberg et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Barzilai et al., 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Rosenberg et al., 2014</xref>). New protein synthesis appears to be critical in several contexts, as the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor (e.g. cycloheximide) has been shown to abolish long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Pedreira et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hernandez and Abel, 2008</xref>). Moreover, protein degradation together with new protein synthesis has been strongly implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Lee et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fazeli et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Park and Kaang, 2019</xref>). There is also evidence that local translation in neurons, specifically the synthesis of specific proteins in dendritic regions (thereby altering local proteome composition), plays a key role in learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Bradshaw et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Das et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Smith et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>). Additionally, several key regulatory proteins have been shown to be required at specific timepoints, such as during the training/learning step, to trigger memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Stefanoska et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">Watteyne et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that the spatiotemporal regulation of protein composition within neurons is critical for learning and memory formation.</p>
<p>The molecular requirements for learning have primarily been identified by combining genetic approaches with behavioural paradigms to test learnt associations, typically through assaying candidate genetic mutants or performing a forward genetics screen. These strategies have been extremely insightful; however, they have some limitations. The first being that candidate genetic screens are time-consuming and labour intensive, and require subjective selection of which candidate genes to test (for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Hukema, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Stein and Murphy, 2014</xref>)). The second is that large-scale screens tend to only reveal genes that have the strongest phenotypes, so genes that have more subtle phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hiroki and Iino, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Lindsay et al., 2022</xref>), or act in redundant pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Feng et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Gyurkó et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Shahmoradi, 2015</xref>), may not be identified using these approaches despite their contributions to learning.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, and to gain a holistic view of the molecular pathways that contribute to learning, we used an objective proteomics approach to snapshot the protein-level changes that occur specifically during learning. To do this, we expressed the proximity-labelling tool TurboID in the entire <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system, and used this to identify the proteins present in neurons during the training step of an associative learning paradigm we call ‘salt associative learning’. TurboID is an enzyme based on the BirA* biotin ligase, engineered to provide greater catalytic efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Branon et al., 2018</xref>) compared with the original BirA* enzyme used in BioID experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). TurboID catalyses a reaction where biotin is covalently added onto lysine residues – as this process requires biotin, its timing can be controlled by depleting tissues of biotin, then adding it exogenously only at specific time points. Additionally, spatial control can be provided by regulating the site of TurboID expression using cell-specific transgenes. TurboID has been used in multiple studies for identification of protein-protein interactions, usually by tagging a ‘bait’ protein N- or C-terminally with the TurboID enzyme, allowing for rapid biotinylation of bait interactors. Through this approach, TurboID has been used for protein-tagging experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Artan et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Holzer et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>). For example, this approach identified cytoskeletal proteins in <italic>C. elegans</italic> proximal to the microtubule-binding protein PTRN-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>), and detected interactors for ELKS-1, which localises other proteins to the presynaptic active zone in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Artan et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, rather than focussing on specific protein-protein interactions, we expressed TurboID that was not tagged with any bait protein in the entire nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, to identify as many proteins as possible within the cytoplasm. Using this approach, we identified hundreds of proteins specific to ‘trained’ worms, which we refer to here as the <italic>learning proteome</italic>, including those in molecular pathways previously shown to contribute to learning and memory formation in worms and other organisms. In addition, we validated several novel regulators of gustatory learning, including cholinergic receptors (ACC-1, ACC-3, and LGC-46), Protein kinase A regulator KIN-2, and putative arginine kinase F46H5.3. These proteins all show a clear impact on appetitive gustatory learning. F46H5.3 showed an additional effect on aversive gustatory learning, suggesting a more general role for this kinase in memory encoding. In summary, we have demonstrated that our approach to use proximity labelling to snapshot the brain of a small animal during training is a feasible and effective method to further our understanding of the biology of learning.</p>

<title>TurboID expression in the nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic> successfully labels proteins during learning</title>
<p>To model learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we used a simple yet robust associative learning paradigm called salt associative learning. Briefly, this assay involves training worms to associate the absence of salt (NaCl) with the presence of food. <italic>C. elegans</italic> are typically grown in the presence of salt (usually ∼ 50 mM) and display an attraction toward this concentration when assayed for chemotaxis behaviour on a salt gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Luo et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Training/conditioning with ‘no salt + food’ partially attenuates this attraction (group referred to ‘trained’). This is because the presence of abundant food (unconditioned stimulus) is a strong innate attractive cue, and pairing this with ‘no salt’ (the conditioned stimulus) leads to the animals showing the same behaviour towards the conditioned stimulus as they do to the unconditioned stimulus, i.e., attraction towards no salt, reflected as a preference for lower salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>). Similar behavioural paradigms involving pairings between salt/no salt and food/no food have been previously described in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>). Here, learning experiments were performed by conditioning worms with either ‘no salt + food’ (referred to as ‘salt associative learning’) or ‘salt + no food’ (called ‘salt aversive learning’).</p>
<p>To identify the learning proteome, we adapted this learning paradigm to incorporate TurboID-catalysed biotinylation of proteins specifically during the learning/conditioning step. We did this by (1) performing the salt associative learning assay on transgenic animals expressing TurboID in the entire nervous system (P<italic>rab-3</italic>::<italic>TurboID</italic>) and (2) adding biotin only when the worms are being trained (i.e., exposed to both food and ‘no salt’ in the ‘trained’ group, or to food and ‘high salt’ concentrations in the ‘high-salt control’ group). As an additional control, we performed the same assay on non-transgenic (non-Tg) animals that do not express TurboID (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). We then isolated proteins from &gt;3000 whole worms per group for both ‘high-salt control’ and ‘trained’ groups, most of which were subjected to a sample preparation pipeline for mass spectrometry, and some of which were probed via western blotting to confirm the presence of biotinylated proteins. The same pipeline was used to generate five biological replicates.</p>

</fig>
<p>Validation of TurboID-catalysed biotinylation was performed in two ways: First, we compared total protein from naïve/untrained animals that are non-Tg versus TurboID-encoding by western blot and probed for V5-tagged TurboID: as expected, we observed expression in transgenic worms only at the predicted size (39 kDa) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Secondly, we tested if exposure to biotin increased the biotinylation signal in a TurboID-dependent manner. To do this, we quantified the biotinylation signal in (1) naïve non-Tg worms not exposed to biotin (2) non-Tg <italic>C. elegans</italic> exposed to biotin for 6 h, (3) naïve TurboID worms not exposed to biotin, and (4) TurboID animals exposed to biotin for 6 h. Although background biotinylation was present in worms not treated with biotin, we found that biotin exposure increased the signal 1.3-fold for non-Tg and 1.7-fold for TurboID <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that there is increased biotinylation of proteins in the presence of both biotin and the TurboID enzyme. Mass spectrometry experiments were performed with the following experimental groups per replicate: (1) non-transgenic/non-Tg high-salt control, (2) non-Tg trained, (3) TurboID high-salt control, and (4) TurboID trained. We did not include no-biotin treatment controls due to the practical challenges of handling &gt;4 groups in the combined learning assay/mass spectrometry pipeline, for which &gt;3000 worms are required per group. Therefore, all groups were exposed to biotin during the 6 h-exposure period to food and either high salt (for control) or no salt (for trained) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that each experimental group displayed the expected phenotype after training, a portion of worms from all groups were tested using a chemotaxis assay. The chemotaxis index (CI) was used as a readout of learning performance: a positive CI reflects high salt preference, a CI close to 0 represents a more neutral response, and a negative CI represents low salt preference (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). We confirmed after each learning assay that naïve/untrained worms had a strongly positive CI (∼0.7-0.9), whereas trained animals showed a lower CI (∼0.0). We also performed a learning control (indicated as high-salt ‘control’) in which the presence of food (the US) is paired with high salt concentrations – worms in this group are attracted to high salt and showed a strongly positive CI (∼0.7-0.9) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), displaying a similar behaviour to naïve worms. This behavioural change seen in trained animals, versus the naïve and high-salt control groups, represented successful learning as seen in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>). This was observed in both non-Tg and transgenic animals, confirming that introducing the transgene did not perturb learning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We also confirmed by western blotting that biotinylated proteins could be observed in TurboID-expressing high-salt control and trained groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). As in other <italic>C. elegans</italic> studies utilising TurboID, we saw background biotinylation in non-Tg controls; however, this is visually lower compared with groups from TurboID transgenic worms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Artan et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>). Quantification of the signal within entire lanes showed a 1.1-fold increase in the ‘TurboID, control’ lane compared with the ‘non-Tg, control’ lane, and a 1.9-fold increase in the ‘TurboID, trained’ lane compared with the ‘non-Tg, trained’ lane. For all replicates, we determined that biotinylated proteins could be observed from total TurboID-positive worm lysate by western blotting before proceeding with downstream proteomic experiments (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref> &amp; Table S2).</p>
<p>Our sample preparation methodology for mass spectrometry is based on similar protocols used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Artan et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Prikas et al., 2020</xref>). We performed five biological replicates, in line with other <italic>C. elegans</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Artan et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Holzer et al., 2021</xref>). To examine the learning proteome, we first subtracted proteins from ‘TurboID, trained’ groups also present in ‘Non-Tg, trained’ samples to generate a protein list specific to ‘TurboID, trained’ animals for each biological replicate. We next subtracted from ‘TurboID, control’ lists any proteins that appeared in ‘Non-Tg, control’ samples to generate a revised ‘TurboID, control’ protein list specific to each replicate. We then compared revised protein lists for ‘trained’ and ‘control’ worms from all biological replicates and examined both unique and shared proteins between these two groups. We found 304 proteins that were shared between ‘trained’ and ‘control’ TurboID groups, 706 proteins unique to the ‘TurboID, trained’ group, and 388 proteins unique to the ‘TurboID, control’ group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We refer to the <italic>learning proteome</italic> as proteins unique to samples for ‘TurboID, trained’ worms. When generating the learning proteome, we categorised proteins as ‘assigned hits’ based on the criteria that at least one unique peptide was identified by the MASCOT search engine for the protein identity from at least one biological replicate. We also examined peptide sequences in our peak lists that were considered ‘unassigned’ by MASCOT, as these sequences were not detected as unique for any protein by the software, but specific protein identities could be found by performing a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) query (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi">https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</ext-link>; see <bold>Experimental Procedures</bold> for details). The Venn diagram in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> shows assigned hits only. Learning proteome lists for both assigned and unassigned hits are in Tables S3 &amp; S4.</p>

<title>Examination of the learning proteome reveals known regulators of learning and memory</title>
<p>Our initial analysis of the learning proteome sought to validate our TurboID-based approach by identifying components of biological pathways previously implicated in learning. We then performed a gene ontology (GO) term analysis of ‘cellular component’ to obtain a broad overview of the subcellular localisation of proteins identified in trained animals (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). To do this, we generated protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of assigned protein hits within the learning proteome for subcellular components of interest (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B-G</xref>), using data from STRING and curated with the Cytoscape ClueGO tool (Tables S5 &amp; S6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>). We found that a majority of proteins were categorised as ‘cytoplasmic’ (28.1%) as expected from our approach, which utilised the TurboID enzyme not tagged to any bait protein; this means that we would anticipate the enzyme to be present relatively evenly across the cell body and to catalyse biotinylation of proteins in this space. We saw that an unexpectedly high proportion of proteins were nuclear (18.1%), despite the presence of a nuclear export signal in our TurboID transgene, which should prevent TurboID from entering the nucleus and biotinylating nuclear proteins – this could be due to some ‘leaky’ entry of the enzyme or biotin reactive species into the nucleus, or that some proteins are categorised solely as ‘nuclear’ in the ClueGO database when they are also present in other cellular components. Importantly, we found that a proportion of proteins are categorised as present in neuronal compartments – the pre-synapse (0.5%), cilia/dendrites (2.7%), and in the axon/(synaptic) vesicles (4.0%) – as expected from transgenic expression of TurboID in the nervous system.</p>
<p>Learning and memory formation in organisms with brains of varying sizes have been shown to involve key regulatory pathways including signalling via neurotransmitters/neuromodulators, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and the insulin/insulin growth factor-like pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Matsumoto et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Myhrer, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Rahmani and Chew, 2021</xref>). We next categorised proteins within the learning proteome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) based on their known roles within these signalling pathways. This included (1) several GPCR components, including the G<sub>i/o</sub> protein subunit GOA-1 and G<sub>α</sub> protein subunit GPA-2, (2) regulators of insulin signalling including the DAF-2 insulin receptor, phosphoinositide 3-kinase AGE-1, and serine/threonine protein kinases AKT-1 and SGK-1, which were previously reported to modulate salt-based learning in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Tomioka et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Sakai et al., 2017</xref>), (3) MAPK signalling components including NSY-1/MAPKKK, MEK-2/MAPKK, and MPK-1/MAPK/ERK, (4) cAMP/PKA (protein kinase A) signalling regulators such as the regulatory PKA subunit KIN-2, and (5) multiple components that modulate synpatic vesicle release, including N-ethyl-maleimide sensitive fusion protein NSF1/NSF-1 and syntaxin/SYX-2. In addition, we identified several proteins relevant to glutamate, acetylcholine, and GABAergic signalling. Several components involved in protein synthesis and degradation were also detected in our learning proteome, in line with studies that suggest changes in total protein composition following memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Inberg et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Barzilai et al., 1989</xref>). These data are summarised in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>, and Table S6. In summary, the learning proteome includes both known learning regulators and potentially novel candidates that warrant further study. We focused on proteins functioning within these pathways of interest in our subsequent investigations (highlighted nodes in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5</xref>).</p>

<p>In addition, we consistently observed enrichment of two metabolic pathways, fatty acid metabolism via the TCA cycle and carbohydrate metabolism (gluconeogenesis and glycolysis), in multiple biological replicates of mass spectrometry data, uniquely in TurboID-trained animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). These metabolic pathways play essential roles, including in cellular energy production and macromolecule biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Krebs and Johnson, 1937</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Lu and Goetsch, 1993</xref>). Consequently, their disruption can severely impair animal health. For example, knock-down of mitochondrial components involved in the TCA cycle led to larval arrest and/or severely reduced lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Artan et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Liao et al., 2022</xref>). This limits the capacity to assess these processes in learning using single gene mutants or knockdown tools. Therefore, our TurboID approach reveals biological pathways potentially involved in memory formation that are not detectable through conventional forward or reverse genetic screens.</p>

<title>Exploring neuron class representation within the learning proteome</title>
<p>Aside from identifying relevant biological networks, we also used data from the learning proteome to identify potential neuron classes involved in memory formation, using four databases. This included the Wormbase Tissue Enrichment Analysis (TEA) Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Angeles-Albores et al., 2016</xref>), based on Anatomy Ontology (AO) terms, and single-cell transcriptomics data from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Neuronal Gene Expression Network (CeNGEN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
    <p>Firstly, we employed transcriptome databases to check representation of the nervous system within learning proteome data. The CeNGEN database confirmed that 87-95% of assigned hits and 89-92% of all hits (assigned and unassigned hits) from the learning proteome show neuronal expression, i.e. were found in at least one neuron in the database (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is important to note that CeNGEN was generated using L4 hermaphrodites, and not young adult hermaphrodites (as used here for TurboID), since transcriptomes differ between the two developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">St. Ange et al., 2024</xref>). The nervous system transcriptome has been characterised for young adult hermaphrodites, highlighting 7873 genes that are enriched in neurons (versus non-neuronal tissues). Neuron enriched genes were identified using single-nucleus and bulk neuron RNA-Seq techniques respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">St. Ange et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kaletsky et al. 2016</xref>). The nervous system is highly represented by our proteome data; 75-87% of assigned hits and 75-83% of all hits correspond to neuron enriched genes identified by St. Ange et al. and Kaletsky et al..</p>
<table-wrap id="tbl1" orientation="portrait" position="float">
<label>Table 1</label>
<caption><title>Neuron-specific expression within the learning proteome</title>
    <p>Mass spectrometry runs (n = 5) were performed with the ThermoFisher Scientific Q-Exactive Orbitrap (‘QE’) and/or ThermoFisher Scientific Orbitrap Exploris (‘Exploris’), for technical reasons. There are six lists because replicate #3 was run on both mass spectrometers: corresponding protein lists are annotated as ‘3a’ and ‘3b’ respectively. The total ‘#Assigned hits’ versus ‘#All hits’ (assigned + unassigned hits) are shown in rows are listed above. The CeNGEN database (threshold = 2) was used to determine corresponding percentages for assigned hits versus all hits as ‘% Neuronal for assigned hits’ versus ‘% Neuronal for all hits’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). The average percentages across all replicates were 91% for assigned hits only versus 89% for all hits.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="580416v4_tbl1.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Secondly, we assessed which tissues and neuron classes are most highly represented within the learning proteome. We used the Wormbase TEA tool to search for gene lists corresponding to proteins encoded by (1) assigned hits only and (2) both assigned and unassigned hits within the learning proteome. Anatomical terms were considered enriched when they had a q value &lt; 1. We observed enriched terms for pharyngeal neurons (M1, M2, M5, NSM, &amp; I4), sensory neurons (PVD), interneurons (ADA and RIG), ventral nerve cord (VNC) motor neurons (VB2, VB3, VB4, VB5, VB6, VB7, VB8, VB9, VB10, &amp; VB11), and CAN cells from both gene lists. RIS interneurons and DD motor neurons were also enriched when including unassigned hits. Several of these neurons have previously been implicated in learning: RIG interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>) and NSM neurons in butanone olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fadda et al., 2020</xref>), VNC neurons through changes in glutamate receptor GLR-1 expression during touch habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Rose et al., 2003</xref>) and diacetyl aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">Vukojevic et al., 2012</xref>), and RIS interneurons in salt aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Wang et al., 2025</xref>). Therefore, neurons enriched within the learning proteome include those known to be required for learning; other neurons not previously identified in this context, such as pharyngeal neurons, may warrant further study.</p>
<p>We complemented this analysis by using the CeNGEN database to search for gene lists encoding proteins (assigned hits only, minus non-transgenic controls) identified in control worms (388 genes) versus trained animals (706 genes) from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Using the bulk gene search function in CenGEN (threshold = 2), we determined the number of genes from each list that are expressed in a specific neuron type. Values for the trained gene list were normalized to account for the ∼1.8-fold increase in the number of proteins detected in trained samples compared to the high-salt control. For each neuron class that appeared in both datasets (128 in total), we calculated fold-change values between the number of genes from trained vs control gene lists. Neurons were ranked in descending order of fold-change. This ranked list is based on the relative enrichment of training-associated genes compared to control, with higher ranks suggesting neurons that may be more transcriptionally responsive or involved during training. These data are summarised in Table S7. Given that CeNGEN utilises transcriptomic data from L4 (juvenile) animals, neuron classes were also ranked using equivalent datasets for young adult hermaphrodites: Worm-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghaddar et al., 2023</xref>) and CeSTAAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Princeton University, 2025</xref>) (see <bold>Experimental Procedures</bold> for details). Importantly, CeSTAAN and Worm-Seq provide data for 79 and 104 neuron classes, respectively (vs 128 from CeNGEN); this section therefore focuses on CeNGEN data due to its greater coverage, with other datasets described in brackets. Moreover, as this analysis is descriptive and does not include statistical testing (e.g., bootstrapping), the rankings should be interpreted as indicative rather than definitive, and future work incorporating formal statistical approaches will be important to validate these observations.</p>
<p>Cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons constituted 15% and 55% of neurons ranked #1-20, respectively (45% and 30% for CeSTAAN; 40% and 20% for Worm-Seq). Glutamate signalling components previously have been implicated in <italic>C. elegans</italic> learning paradigms involving salt (e.g., NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunits <italic>nmr-1</italic> and <italic>nmr-2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kano et al., 2008</xref>). Acetylcholine has not been explored extensively in <italic>C. elegans</italic> for its involvement in learning, but has been described in other animal models and in humans (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Huang et al., 2022</xref>)). Other neuron classes identified have previously been implicated in salt-based associative learning (ranks in brackets): AVK interneurons (rank #7 for CenGEN; #37 for CeSTAAN; #76 for Worm-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Beets et al., 2012</xref>), RIS interneurons (rank #14 for CenGEN; #1 for CeSTAAN; #31 for Worm-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Wang et al., 2025</xref>), salt-sensing neuron ASEL (rank #18 for CenGEN; #16 for CeSTAAN; #34 for Worm-Seq as ‘ASE’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Beets et al., 2012</xref>), CEP and ADE dopaminergic sensory neurons (individually ranked #22 &amp; #39 respectively for CenGEN, vs ‘CEP_ADE_PDE’ ranked #20 and #80 for CeSTAAN and Worm-Seq respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">Voglis and Tavernarakis, 2008</xref>), and AIB interneurons (rank #21 for CenGEN; #11 for CeSTAAN; #67 for Worm-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Sato et al., 2021</xref>). In summary, although there are some exceptions that may be reflecting expression differences between adult and L4 animals, the same neuron classes are generally seen as highly represented for trained animals (vs control) for all three transcriptomic datasets.</p>
<p>Interestingly, unlike its counterpart ASEL (rank #18 for CenGEN), the salt-sensing neuron ASER was ranked only #104/128 (for CenGEN, Table S7). ASER becomes activated in response to a decrease in salt concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>) and its downstream targets likely function to redirect worms toward higher salt concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Appleby, 2012</xref>). This activation is suppressed after training that reduces attraction to high salt levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Sato et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Wang et al., 2025</xref>). It is possible that this learning-dependent suppression of ASER activity may explain its lower fold-change in trained versus control groups. Alternatively, given it is ranked #4 using the CeSTAAN database, potentially due to the use of adults and not L4, it is equally possible that additional proteomic changes may be required in ASER (vs ASEL, with rank #16) to trigger salt chemotaxis changes. Nevertheless, these findings imply a molecular and cellular switch facilitated by dual ASE neurons to express gustatory learning in the worm, which complements previous research.</p>
<p>Some neurons identified were not previously implicated in learning: IL1 polymodal head neuron class (rank #1 for CenGEN; #44 for CeSTAAN; #42 for Worm-Seq), motor neuron DA9 (rank #2 for CenGEN; #78 for CeSTAAN as ‘PDA_AS_DA_DB’; #95 for Worm-Seq as ‘DA_VA’), and interneuron DVC (rank #5 for CenGEN; #23 for CeSTAAN; #3 for Worm-Seq). IL1 releases glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>) and mainly functions in regulating foraging behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hart et al., 1995</xref>), potentially indicating a role in food-based responses. Separately, cholinergic neuron DA9 and glutamatergic neuron DVC are involved in backward locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Pereira et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ardiel and Rankin, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). Changes in locomotion are critical for learning-dependent modulation of chemotaxis: the incidence of sharp turns or ‘pirouette’ movements in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is influenced by prior experience in salt-based gustatory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). IL1 may influence salt-based learning by signalling through interneurons AVE (rank #24 for CenGEN; #10 for CeSTAAN; #87 for Worm-Seq) and PVR (rank #114 for CenGEN; neuron class not available in CeSTAAN; #44 for Worm-Seq) to the DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Bhatla, 2009</xref>), potentially modulating backward locomotion as part of the chemotaxis response. We also identified pharyngeal neurons I3 (rank #4 for CenGEN; data not available in CeSTAAN nor Worm-Seq) and I6 (rank #5; neuron class not available in CeSTAAN nor Worm-Seq), which have not previously been implicated in learning. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> provides a summary for the neural circuits implicated form these analyses, where neuron classes are highly connected to each other. Investigating the role of specific genes within these circuits opens new avenues for future research into gustatory learning.</p>

<title>Validating the requirement of learning proteome components in salt associative learning through single gene studies</title>
<p>Our initial analysis of learning proteome data indicates that there are multiple hits present in biological pathways important for neuron function, and that are potentially relevant to learning and memory formation. To test this directly, we performed salt associative learning experiments on selected learning proteome hits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref>). We used the following general rules to interpret our data: if the average chemotaxis indices (CIs) for ‘trained’ worms were <italic>higher</italic> in a particular strain compared with wild-type, this strain was considered learning-defective, as this reflects a reduced magnitude of the expected behaviour change (an increased preference for low salt demonstrated by CIs closer to 0 or negative CIs). If the average CI for ‘trained’ worms was <italic>lower</italic> in a strain compared with wild-type, then this strain was considered to display ‘better’ learning, as the lower CI reflects an increased magnitude of the expected behaviour change. In general, we observed no significant difference in CIs between naïve groups for all genotypes, reflecting no gross locomotor or chemotaxis defects in the strains tested (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref>).</p>
<p>We tested 26 candidates in total for this study. Although this represents a small subset of the 706 proteins identified in the learning proteome, several proteins in the full list are unsuitable for functional testing due to key constraints: (1) having essential roles, with corresponding single-gene mutants being lethal; (2) involvement in neurodevelopment rather than mature neuronal function; and (3) being required for locomotion, with severe locomotion defects precluding assessment using chemotaxis assays.</p>
<p>Candidates tested were classified as either strong (detected in biological replicates ≥ 3) or weak (replicates &lt; 3) based on the number of mass spectrometry replicates in which they were uniquely identified in TurboID-trained <italic>C. elegans</italic> (shown in brackets). We determined these numbers by considering both assigned and unassigned protein lists, which contained mostly neuron-expressed proteins (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) including known learning regulators (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> &amp; Table S8). The list of 26 candidates for further testing includes both weak and strong hits. In addition, although candidates tested were mostly detected in more replicates of trained versus control groups, we also assayed seven candidates for which this was not the case. <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarises the potential learning regulators explored in this study, including strong/weak classifications and replicate numbers between experimental groups.</p>

<p>We first tested the regulatory subunit of PKA, <italic>kin-2</italic> (1 replicate), since it is a known regulator of memory and was detected as a weak candidate by TurboID. Adenylyl cyclase is a key signalling effector for Gα<sub>s</sub> and Gα<sub>i</sub> proteins and regulates levels of the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) within the cell. cAMP binding to PKA regulates its activity, and therefore its downstream effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Sassone-Corsi, 2012</xref>). We tested worms with the <italic>ce179</italic> mutant allele in <italic>kin-2</italic>, in which a conserved residue in the inhibitory domain (which normally functions to keep PKA turned off in the absence of cAMP) is mutated to cause an R92C amino acid change – this results in increased PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Schade et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>kin-2</italic> has previously been shown to be required for intermediate-term memory in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Stein and Murphy, 2014</xref>), with cAMP/PKA signalling previously shown to be involved in memory in multiple systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kandel, 2012</xref>). We found that these <italic>kin-2</italic> mutant animals showed enhanced learning compared with wild-type (i.e., Non-Tg worms) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We next re-expressed KIN-2(R92C) in wild-type worms using a pan-neuronal promoter, these worms showed a similar phenotype to <italic>kin-2(ce179)</italic> worms, with enhanced learning compared with non-transgenic siblings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These data suggest that increased PKA activity in the nervous system drives salt associative learning.</p>

<p>F46H5.3 is a homolog for creatine kinase B (cytoplasmic) and mitochondrial creatine kinase 1B, but is considered an arginine kinase since <italic>C. elegans</italic> use arginine instead of creatine. Both creatine kinases are essential for energy metabolism via ATP modulation. Given notable representation of metabolic pathways from the learning proteome identified here (e.g., <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), this provided additional rationale for testing F46H5.3. Moreover, the depletion of creatine kinase B reportedly increases the latency needed for memory encoding of a spatial learning task in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jost et al., 2002</xref>). Since F46H5.3 is expressed in most neurons in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>), this putative arginine kinase may affect learning capacity though modulating ATP levels in neurons.</p>
<p>We also tested genetic mutants for candidates involved in neurotransmission, a key function for all neurons and a requirement for learning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Myhrer (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Rahmani and Chew (2021)</xref>). Two strong candidates, cationic acetylcholine-gated calcium ion channel ACR-2 (4 replicates) and cholinergic receptor interactor ELP-1 (3 replicates) were not observed to regulate learning (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7B</xref>). Interestingly, several acetylcholine receptors that were weak candidates showed differences in learning compared with wild-type controls. Those tested include ACC-1 (1 replicate), ACC-3 (2 replicates), and LGC-46 (1 replicate) in the subfamily of anionic “ACC” acetylcholine-gated ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Morud et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>lgc-46</italic> mutants demonstrate a reduced capacity for learning compared with wild-type, whereas <italic>acc-1</italic> and <italic>acc-3</italic> mutants appear to display better learning (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A, 4B</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). Although these ACC receptors are activated by acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Park et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Putrenko et al., 2005</xref>), or have been reported to possess the same protein domain/s as known acetylcholine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Takayanagi-Kiya et al., 2016</xref>), they vary substantially in expression pattern in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). We postulate that acetylcholine signalling in specific neurons may therefore contribute to learning in different directions, an interesting avenue for future research. We also tested other genes involved in neurotransmission, such as <italic>gbb-2</italic> (for GABAergic signalling, 2 replicates) and <italic>glr-1</italic> (for glutamatergic signalling, 1 replicate), neither showed a detectable change in learning capacity compared with wild-type (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figures S8A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8B</xref>). <italic>maco-1</italic> (1 replicate) encodes a macoilin family protein that functions broadly in neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arellano-Carbajal et al., 2011</xref>), and has previously been shown to regulate memory of olfactory adaptation in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Kitazono et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>maco-1</italic> mutant tested in our study (<italic>nj21</italic>) did not show a locomotor defect, but also did not show any obvious learning phenotypes (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8C</xref>). Our data therefore indicate that specific components of cholinergic signalling are required for salt associative learning.</p>
<p>We tested several components of GPCR signalling that were identified as learning proteome hits, including <italic>gap-1</italic> (1 replicate), <italic>gap-2</italic> (3 replicates), <italic>gpa-2</italic> (2 replicates), and <italic>rho-1</italic> (2 replicates) (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7C</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8D, S8E</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">S8F</xref>), but found that worms with single mutations for these genes, when compared to wild-type controls, did not show statistically significant differences in learning capacity. We postulate that although GPCR signalling is broadly important for learning (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Jong et al. (2018)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Rahmani and Chew (2021)</xref>), there may be high levels of redundancy built within this pathway such that single pathway components can be compensated for by other functionally similar genes.</p>
<p>Several components of MAPK signalling have been shown to be involved in different forms of learning (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Peng et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Ryu and Lee, 2016</xref>)), including NSY-1/MAPKKK, MEK-2/MAPKK, and MPK-1/ERK that were identified as part of the learning proteome in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Ohno et al., 2014</xref>). We tested the dual leucine zipper MAPKKK-encoding gene <italic>dlk-1</italic> (2 replicates), a mutant of this gene showed no difference in learning capacity compared to wild-type (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8G</xref>). The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant UEV-3 (4 replicates) has been shown to be a member of the DLK-1 pathway and a potential interactor of p38/MAPK PMK-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Trujillo et al., 2010</xref>); trained phenotypes between wild-type and <italic>uev-3</italic> mutants were not statistically significant (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7D</xref>). We also tested worms with a mutation in <italic>fsn-1</italic> (3 replicates), proposed to attenuate synapse growth in a DLK-1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Hung et al., 2013</xref>). These animals displayed learning capacity similar to wild-type animals (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7E</xref>). In summary, these data indicate that mutating single components of the MAPK pathway does not generally perturb salt associative learning.</p>
<p>Finally, we assessed additional hits that do not fit in the pathways above, but were considered strong candidates. These include neuronal adhesion/IGCAM gene <italic>rig-4</italic> (3 replicates) or putative guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor genes (<italic>aex-3</italic> or <italic>tag-52</italic>, both 3 replicates). Aversive associative learning in worms and mice both rely on IGCAM gene <italic>ncam-1/NCAM1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Cremer et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">Vukojevic et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Doyle et al., 1992</xref>). Additionally, guanine nucleotide exchange factors ‘ArhGEF4’ and ‘RapGEF2’ in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Jiang et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>), as well as <italic>unc-73</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Arey et al., 2018</xref>), have been linked to learning and memory previously. We found that <italic>aex-3</italic>(-), <italic>rig-4</italic>(-), and <italic>tag-52</italic>(-) single mutants did not show significant differences in salt associative learning compared to wild-type controls (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figures S7F, S7G</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7H</xref>). We also tested <italic>elo-6</italic> (3 replicates), which encodes a long chain fatty acid elongase that potentially functions together with another elongase encoded by <italic>elo-5</italic>, although only <italic>elo-6</italic> is expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Kniazeva et al., 2004</xref>). Fatty acid composition has previously been demonstrated to be important for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">Wallis et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Pershina et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akefe et al., 2024</xref>). Our data showed no significant learning defect or improvement in <italic>elo-6</italic> mutant animals (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7I</xref>), although as mentioned, its role may be masked by functional redundancy.</p>
<p>Other strong candidates tested that did not show a learning phenotype include: (1) <italic>ift-139</italic> (5 replicates), a ciliogenesis gene that was explored since hippocampal cilia structures have been seen to be important for memory in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Niwa, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Jovasevic et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Berbari et al., 2014</xref>). (2) <italic>tap-1</italic> (3 replicates), which encodes an ortholog for TGF-β activated kinase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Meneghini et al., 1999</xref>), (3) SAEG-1 (4 replicates), a suppressor for protein kinase G (PKG) ortholog EGL-4 activity, which has been implicated in behavioural changes induced by odour-sensory fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">L’Etoile et al., 2002</xref>); cGMP-dependent kinase PKG also promotes long-term memory in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Ota et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Paul et al., 2008</xref>), and (4) VER-3 (3 replicates), which encodes a predicted vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-like protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Popovici et al., 2002</xref>). VEGF/VEGFR was reported to be upregulated in rats following spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cao et al., 2004</xref>). These data are shown in <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>.</p>
<p>There are several potential reasons why many mutants tested did not display a learning phenotype. Firstly, as mentioned above, effects may be masked by redundant or compensatory pathways. For example, IGCAM genes in the worm have been reported to act redundantly in axon navigation, including <italic>rig-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Schwarz et al., 2009</xref>). It is also possible that these mutations do not fully knockout protein function. We generally assessed animals with deletion mutations predicted to disrupt protein function, but we did not confirm this through qualitative or quantitative means. Additionally, many mutants used here were not backcrossed as it was beyond the scope of this study, so these lines may have background mutations masking learning phenotypes of the mutations of interest. This was seen for <italic>C30G12.6</italic>(-) animals in this study, where an enhanced learning phenotype in non-backcrossed worms was lost after backcrossing (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Separately, although memory encoding (learning) and retention are interlinked biological processes, they are molecularly distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Arey et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>, Wattenye et al., 2020, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Rahmani &amp; Chew, 2021</xref>). Typically, learning is assayed for <italic>C. elegans</italic> immediately after training, whereas memory retention is assessed after a post-training rest period – this assessment usually relies on a behavioural change representing learning/memory formation. It is possible that some candidates detected in neurons during learning may correspond to those important for memory retention and not encoding, so it may be worth utilising this proteomic dataset as a resource to explore this concept in future. Finally, the population-wide chemotaxis assays we perform here to validate candidates may not be sensitive enough to capture subtle potential behavioural differences caused by these mutations. Pirouette and weathervane behaviours in <italic>C. elegans</italic> change based on previously experienced salt concentrations in the presence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>). These behaviours can be measured through more in-depth investigation of locomotor behaviour through live tracking and analysis, providing a more sensitive measure for learning responses compared to the chemotaxis assays used here. These factors are important considerations for future experiments utilising the learning proteome as rationale to assess novel mechanisms in learning.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Arginine kinase F46H5.3 regulates both appetitive and aversive gustatory learning</title>
<p>Next, we explored whether the learning regulators identified from our learning proteome functioned more broadly in other types of learning. To do this, we assayed salt aversive learning capacity (training with aversive cue i.e. starvation) for candidates seen to affect salt associative learning (training with an appetitive cue i.e. presence of food): PKA regulatory protein KIN-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), arginine kinase F46H5.3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), and acetylcholine receptor subunits ACC-1, ACC3, and LGC-46 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In the salt associative learning assay used thus far, ‘trained’ worms are exposed to a pairing of no salt + food (‘control’ worms with high salt + food), whereas in salt aversive learning, ‘conditioned’ worms are exposed to high salt + no food (and control ‘mock-conditioned’ worms with no salt + no food). In the salt aversive learning assay, ‘conditioned’ worms therefore learn to avoid high salt (as it is associated with starvation, a strongly negative cue), whereas ‘mock-conditioned’ worms and naïve worms retain a preference for high salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>). We found that only <italic>F46H5.3</italic>(-) mutant worms showed a significant change in learning capacity for salt aversive learning compared with wild-type (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>). Specifically, <italic>F46H5.3</italic>(-) mutants displayed a larger decrease in CI in trained animals compared to wild-type trained worms, demonstrating a potential learning improvement (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9A</xref>). <italic>F46H5.3</italic>(-) mutant phenotype also showed enhanced learning for the salt associative learning paradigm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Although <italic>kin-2(ce179)</italic> mutants were not shown to impact salt aversive learning, they have been reported previously to display impaired intermediate-term memory (but intact learning and short-term memory) for butanone appetitive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Stein and Murphy, 2014</xref>). These findings therefore suggest (1) a generalised effect for F46H5.3 in gustatory learning paradigms involving salt, (2) a specific role for KIN-2 in appetitive learning paradigms, and (3) a unique effect for ACC receptors ACC-1/2 and LGC-46 in salt associative learning only.</p>

<title>Using TurboID to predict potential molecular and cellular pathways for learning</title>
<p>Our TurboID approach provides a unique benefit as a systems-based tool, in that it can be used to map individual candidates onto broader molecular networks. F46H5.3 is mostly uncharacterised beyond its predicted homology to creatine kinase B and mitochondrial creatine kinase 1B. As its role within learning pathways is unknown, we tested for protein-protein interactions between F46H5.3 and other candidates in the learning proteome using the software STRING (version 12.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">Szklarczyk et al., 2023</xref>), aiming to infer its potential function within a molecular network. Mitochondrial creatine kinases regulate phosphocreatine synthesis using ATP, which requires calcium influx into mitochondria to induce ATP synthesis (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Schlattner et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Schlattner et al., 2006</xref>)). Voltage-dependent anion channel VDAC-1 (identified in 3 replicates of learning proteome data) plays a critical role in calcium homeostasis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Shoshan-Barmatz et al., 2017</xref>), and is predicted interactor of F46H5.3. Moreover, calcium influx into the mitochondria is regulated by calcium/calmodulin kinase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>), an established and highly-conserved regulator of learning (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ataei et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">Zalcman et al., 2018</xref>)). The sole calcium/calmodulin kinase II in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (UNC-43, 2 replicates) is predicted to interact with VDAC-1. Our learning proteome also includes proteins involved in calcium/calmodulin complex formation (e.g., calmodulin/CMD-1 in 4 replicates and cyclic nucleotide–gated ion channel TAX-4 in 1 replicate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Karabinos et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Komatsu et al., 1999</xref>). Calcium/calmodulin complexes can also modulate cAMP levels (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Sharma and Kalra, 1994</xref>)), which influences PKA/KIN-1 activity regulation by KIN-2 and A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP-1 (2 replicates) (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Sadeghian et al., 2022</xref>)). Therefore, cytoplasmic calcium homeostasis is one potential pathway through which both KIN-2 and F46H5.3, validated in our study as learning regulators, modulate learning and memory (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, we can combine the protein network analysis with analysis of neuron representation within the learning proteome, as described above and shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>. There are two neuron classes that express all five candidates shown here to affect salt associative learning (KIN-2, F46H5.3, ACC-1, ACC-3, LGC-46): RIM interneurons and DB motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>) (threshold = 2). These neurons are involved in reversals and forward locomotion, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Guo et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). It is possible that these learning regulators influence experience-based behaviour through modulating the function of these neurons to alter chemotaxis responses in the presence of gustatory cues.</p>
    <p>KIN-2 and F46H5.3 share the same expression pattern in many neuron classes, whereas neurons expressing the three ACC receptors are more diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). ACC-3 is expressed in salt-sensing ASE, mechanosensory and dopaminergic CEP neurons, polymodal sensory neuron IL1, and two interneuron classes (ADA and RIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). ADA’s function is not well-characterised but it is predicted to be involved in chemosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Sohn et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, ACC-1 and LGC-46 are expressed in several interneurons and motor neurons including those implicated in gustatory or olfactory learning paradigms (AIB, AVK, NSM, RIG, &amp; RIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Beets et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fadda et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Wang et al., 2025</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">Zhou et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Sato et al., 2021</xref>) and important for backward or forward locomotion (AVE, DA, DB, &amp; VB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>). There are also highly represented neuron classes which are not as well defined (ADA, I4, M1, M2, &amp; M5), which may present interesting directions for future research. Cholinergic signalling may therefore regulate gustatory learning through integration of sensory signals as well as direct modulation of the motor circuit. In contrast, KIN-2 and F46H5.3 may play more general functions within the nervous system, such as through modulate calcium homeostasis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). As mentioned above, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> utilises the CeNGEN database generated from L4 animals, so we cross-referenced this expression data with transcriptome studies using young adult hermaphrodites (as in this study). Our five candidates of interest (ACC-1/3, F46H5.3, KIN-2, and LGC-46) were reported in the same neuron classes as in CeNGEN, further suggesting that these neurons may be important for memory encoding in the worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghaddar et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kaletsky et al. 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Roux et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Smith et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">St. Ange et al., 2024</xref>). Overall, our TurboID dataset offers a valuable foundation for future investigations into individual proteins involved in learning, and provides a resource for systemic analyses at the level of tissues, neuron types, subcellular localisations, and molecular networks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of using the protein labelling-technique TurboID to explore <italic>C. elegans</italic> learning and memory. The expression of TurboID in the whole nervous system of the worm, and addition of biotin only during the training step of salt associative learning, allowed us to label proteins in neurons during this critical stage of memory encoding. We identified these proteins by mass spectrometry and revealed a putative ‘learning proteome’ including known learning regulators (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> &amp; Table S8). Moreover, we identified five novel regulators of appetitive gustatory learning, namely three acetylcholine receptors (ACC-1, ACC-3, &amp; LGC-46), PKA regulatory subunit KIN-2, and the arginine kinase F46H5.3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Finally, F46H5.3 was observed to modulate an aversive gustatory learning paradigm in <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>. These findings highlight that proximity labelling can be used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to elucidate novel learning regulators, which may function across learning paradigms characterised by different modalities or valences.</p>
<p>Learning and memory are key functions of the nervous system and are critical for survival. Forms of associative learning have been studied in invertebrate and vertebrate animals for decades, revealing many important insights on the behavioural, neuroanatomical, and molecular requirements for learning and memory formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hawkins and Byrne (2015)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Jong et al. (2018)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kandel (2012)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Matsumoto et al. (2018)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Peng et al. (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Peng et al. (2011)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Rahmani and Chew (2021)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Ryu and Lee (2016)</xref>). However, many studies focus on single genes of interest and are therefore unable to reveal the entire network of molecular players that drive (or inhibit) learning. We used a complementary approach to take a snapshot of the proteins present in the brain during learning, using the protein-labelling tool TurboID. Previously, microarray analysis has been done to characterise transcriptomic changes during long-term memory formation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Lakhina et al., 2015</xref>). While this provides useful insights into the mechanisms of memory formation, it does not capture proteomic information, which may differ from RNA levels. Separately, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hiroki et al. (2022)</xref> applied TurboID to map protein-protein interactions of PKC/PKC-1 in untrained <italic>C. elegans</italic>, providing insight into how PKC-1 affects gustatory appetitive learning. Our work builds on this by directly comparing trained and high-salt control conditions, offering new insights into the proteomic landscape of learning. Our strategy identified several components of molecular pathways previously shown to be generally required for learning, including neurotransmitter signalling, MAPK signalling, insulin signalling, synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and GPCR signalling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>, &amp; Table S8). We identified regulators of learning that may not have been obvious choices for a candidate screen, and that may have had phenotypes too subtle to be highlighted through a random mutagenesis screen. We therefore conclude that our approach is a useful and scalable method that can be used in multiple systems to delineate the molecular requirements for different forms of learning.</p>
<p>There are several interesting unanswered questions: Firstly, why did some candidates only seem to affect gustatory appetitive learning, as opposed to showing effects in both gustatory appetitive and aversive paradigms? Mutants of ACC-1, ACC-3, LGC-46, and KIN-2 show significantly different learning capacities for salt associative learning compared with wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) but did not show differences when tested for salt aversive learning (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref>). In contrast, only <italic>F46H5.3</italic>(-) mutants showed a significant learning difference in both salt associative learning and salt aversive learning (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> &amp; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">S9A</xref>). One possibility is that our method for selecting hits from our mass spectrometry data for downstream validation introduced an unintended bias: to identify the learning proteome, we subtracted proteins in the list for ‘high-salt control’ worms from the protein list for ‘trained’ worms, for each biological replicate. The main difference between high-salt control and trained worms was whether they were exposed to a pairing of ‘salt + food’ (control) or ‘no salt + food’ (trained). It is possible that proteins present in trained worms, but not high-salt control worms, during conditioning are those that are strongly regulated by changes in salt concentration (and therefore impact mainly appetitive gustatory learning with ‘no salt’, versus salt aversive learning induced in the presence of salt). Indeed, our ‘simple subtraction’ approach may be an overly conservative method for selecting learning regulators, as it is likely that many neuronal proteins generally important for learning (i.e., across multiple learning paradigms) are present in both groups, but at higher (or lower) levels in trained worms.</p>
<p>Secondly, why do the different acetylcholine receptors that we identified in our study impact learning differently? We showed that loss-of-function mutants of ACC-1 and ACC-3 show improved learning, whereas <italic>lgc-46</italic>(-) mutants displayed a learning defect compared with wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). One study suggested that ACC-1 and ACC-3 may function together: ACC-3 homomers do not respond robustly to acetylcholine, but ACC-1 and ACC-3 can form a functional heteromer, albeit with lower sensitivity to acetylcholine than ACC-1 homomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Putrenko et al., 2005</xref>). ACC-1 and ACC-3 functioning as heteromers may be why these proteins impact learning in the same direction. On the other hand, LGC-46 is also a member of the acetylcholine-gated chloride channel (ACC) family but impacts salt associative learning in the opposite direction to ACC-1 and ACC-3. LGC-46 (in 81 neurons) has a much broader expression pattern than ACC-1 (in 32 neurons) or ACC-3 (in 14 neurons), and is expressed in many more interneurons and motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). It is therefore possible that some of the LGC-46-expressing neurons function to regulate learning in a different manner to ACC-1- or ACC-3-expressing cells.</p>
<p>Our approach demonstrates a powerful method to uncover regulatory networks for a variety of behaviours; however, one factor we aim to improve in future is the amount of background ‘noise’ observed in the learning proteome. While the five biological replicates of learning proteome data did reveal genes and molecular pathways implicated in learning and memory, there was also potential background. For example, when assessing the overlap between all proteins (i.e., both assigned and unassigned proteins (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>)), a large proportion of genes identified were categorised as ribosomal (4-12%), mitochondrial (8-12%), or involved in reproduction (16-19%) (STRING database, accessed Feb 2024). Mass spectrometers detect peptides by abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bakalarski et al., 2008</xref>), so many of these highly abundant proteins may have preferentially been detected over less abundant neuronal proteins. There are several ways to reduce background and improve the signal-to-noise ratio: (1) using an integrated transgenic line that expresses TurboID with 100% transmission, as the line used in our study had a 70-80% transmission rate, (2) using a cell-sorting strategy (e.g., by flow cytometry) to isolate a tissue of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Beets et al., 2020</xref>); this is particularly useful if the tissue of interest is only a low proportion of the worm biomass (e.g., neurons are 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Froehlich et al. (2021)</xref>), as proteins from larger tissues, such the gut and germline, may interfere with detection, and (3) removing highly abundant background proteins during mass spectrometry sample preparation, such as mitochondrial carboxylases that are endogenously biotinylated, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Artan et al. (2022)</xref>.</p>
<p>There are also inherent limitations to using a qualitative approach. While our approach includes weak candidates and does not include a statistical framework for comparing protein abundance between experimental groups, this flexibility allows for the identification of potentially novel regulators that might otherwise be overlooked in more stringent analyses. Notably, we did observe relationships between weak candidates and learning. For example, ACC-1, which modulates salt associative learning in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, was detected in one replicate of mass spectrometry as a potential learning regulator (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To address the lack of quantitative comparison, we categorised each candidate with their occurrence per replicate of mass spectrometry data for TurboID trained versus high-salt control datasets (summary of this data for candidates tested shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the raw mass spectrometry data is provided for each biological replicate and experimental group via an open-access server (see <bold>‘Data Availability’</bold>), enabling transparency and further analysis by the research community. Future studies could benefit from implementing a quantitative approach to directly measure protein abundance differences between trained and control groups. While integrating such approaches with TurboID is challenging due to the requirement for biotinylated protein enrichment, overcoming these limitations, or using an alternative proteomic strategy, could uncover additional learning regulators.</p>
<p>Finally, while the learning regulators identified in this study support the validity of our proteomic approach, further functional validation is important. Testing for rescue of learning phenotypes in transgenic lines re-expressing learning regulators pan-neuronally, endogenously, or in single neurons would provide valuable insight into their functions within the nervous system. Our attempts to generate such rescue lines using standard microinjection techniques encountered several technical challenges, including difficulties with low transmission rate, potentially due to plasmid toxicity, and culturing issues potentially caused by transgene-dependent reproductive defects. To overcome these challenges, future work may utilise single-copy integration methods to reduce transgene dosage or use tissue- or cell-specific RNA interference to achieve targeted knockdown. These approaches could provide more precise insights into the roles of learning regulators within specific neuronal contexts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we present an effective and scalable approach to identify the network of molecular processes that drive learning and memory formation, using the compact <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system. Our data reveal proteins from established biological pathways linked to associative memory, and through which we have identified novel regulators of gustatory associative learning. Future studies using this approach to identify learning regulators in other contexts will advance our understanding of the complex spatiotemporal regulation of learning and memory. This may help to elucidate the principles through which different memory types arise from the combination of specific neuronal signals, individual brain regions/cells, and different sensory modalities, relevant to brains of many sizes.</p>

<title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strain maintenance</title>
<p>Young adult (day 1) hermaphrodite <italic>C. elegans</italic> were grown using standard conditions on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar in petri dishes at 22 °C for all experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Brenner, 1974</xref>). This was done for at least two generations for salt associative learning assays involving TurboID, as well as assays involving salt aversive learning involving <italic>kin-2(ce179)</italic> mutants, and all butanone appetitive learning assays (assays defined below). Animals were otherwise cultured at 22 °C for one generation, and at 15 °C prior to this. For TurboID-based labelling experiments, worms were cultured for at least two generations with the biotin-auxotrophic strain as their food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). For all other experiments, animals were fed <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) strain OP50. <italic>C. elegans</italic> lines used in this paper are listed in Table S1.</p>

<title>Biotin treatment</title>
<p>The biotin treatment strategy was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Artan et al. (2021)</xref>. Briefly, a solution of 100 mM biotin, 250 mM KOH, 5 mM K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 6.0), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> was diluted 1:100 in <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 <italic>bioB::kan</italic> washed with modified Luria Broth (LB; 25 mM NaCl, 5 mM K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 6.0), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.0% (w/v) Bacto<sup>TM</sup> Tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.05 mg/mL Kanamycin). Biotin-depleted worms were fed <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 on NGM agar during a 6 h conditioning period (see the ‘<bold>Salt associative learning</bold>’ section). The bacterial pH was increased by a negligible amount (i.e., 0.1) from the addition of KOH, thus it is expected it will not significantly impact worm physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Khanna et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cong et al., 2020</xref>). At least 3,000 worms per group were utilised for downstream proteomic experiments.</p>

<p>The following protocol was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Liang et al. (2014)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Artan et al. (2021)</xref>: After biotin treatment (end of learning assay), worms were washed twice using ‘washing buffer’ (50 mM NaCl, 5 mM K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 6.0), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) and then stored as pellets in a −80 °C freezer. Each pellet was suspended in 200 μL Radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 2 M urea (prepared as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Sanchez and Feldman (2021)</xref>), as well as 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM NaF, 2 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM NaPP, 1% (v/v) Nonidet-P40, 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) β-glycerophosphate, and 1× cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor (Merck). Worm pellets were sonicated (10× 4 sec total sonication time, 2 sec ‘on’ pulse, 3 sec ‘off’ pulse’, and 25% amplitude) with the Q125 Sonicator (Q Sonica) in a temperature-controlled room (∼2-8 °C) and allowed to rest on ice for &gt;20 sec between each sonication. All samples were vortexed for ∼5 sec at room temperature, and then centrifuged (14,000 rcf, 4 °C, 10 min) to separate carcasses/debris from supernatant containing proteins. The supernatant was then used for protein quantification by BCA assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, #23225).</p>

<title>SDS-PAGE, protein transfer, and western blotting</title>
<p>20-40 µL protein samples, containing 1× sample buffer (0.25 M Tris (pH 6.8), 10% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) SDS, 0.25% (w/v) bromophenol blue), were boiled at 95 °C for 3 min. Proteins were electrophoresed through 8% (v/v) polyacrylamide gels for 40-60 min at 80 V, before the voltage was increased to 100 V for an additional 40-60 min, and then increased to 120 V until completion of electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Stefanoska et al., 2022</xref>). The standard protocol was utilised for semi-dry protein transfer (constant 25 V, 40-45 min) onto nitrocellulose membranes and western blotting, using the following antibodies/probes (dilution in brackets, all made in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin): rabbit anti-α tubulin (1:1000) (Abcam, #ab4074), mouse anti-V5 (1:1000) (Cell Signalling Technology, #80076), goat anti-rabbit HRP (1:20,000) (Cell Signalling Technology, #7074P2), goat anti-mouse HRP (1:20,000) (ThermoFisher Scientific, #G-21040), and streptavidin-HRP (1:5000) (Cell Signalling Technology, #3999) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Jeong et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Stefanoska et al., 2022</xref>).

<p>Our protocol was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Artan et al. (2022)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Sanchez et al. (2021)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Prikas et al. (2020)</xref>: ∼1 mg of protein was desalted using 7 kDa molecular weight cut-off desalting spin column (ThermoFisher Scientific, #89883) by buffer exchange with RIPA buffer containing a lower SDS content (i.e., 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and no urea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Artan et al., 2022</xref>). Desalted protein samples were quantified by BCA assay so that ∼0.6-1.0 mg of total protein per sample could be used in subsequent pull-down experiments to enrich for biotinylated peptides using Streptavidin Magnetic Beads (NEB, #S1420S) equilibrated with TBS-T (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20). Total protein was gently agitated in a tube rotator in 1 mL of total volume (4.5 µL bead:8.0 µg total protein ratio) for 18 h at 4 °C. Magnetic beads were sequentially washed with the following solutions (number of washes in brackets): TBST (x3), 1 M KCl (1x), 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (1x), and PBS (5x; ThermoFisher Scientific, #10010023) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The beads were then incubated in a ThermoMixer (Eppendorf # 5384000063) at 800 rpm, 55 °C for 1 h in 200 µL per sample of reducing solution containing 4 M urea, 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) Protease-Max Surfactant (Promega, #V2071) in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Alkylation was promoted by adding 4 µL of 0.5 M iodoacetamide to each solution and re-incubating each sample at 800 rpm, 55 °C for 20 min in the dark. Finally, samples were incubated at 800 rpm, 37 °C, for 18 h) with the addition of 162 µL of digesting solution per sample (50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.1% (w/v) Protease-Max Surfactant (Promega, #V2071) in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.01 µg/µL of Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin (Promega #V5111)) to facilitate an on-bead protein digest.</p>
<p>This digest was stopped using a protocol modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Prikas et al. (2020)</xref>. Beads were placed on a magnetic rack (NEB, #S1506S) so the supernatant could be transferred to new 1.5 mL tubes without the beads; peptides from digested proteins in the supernatant will henceforth be referred to as ‘unbound’ samples, whereas peptides attached to beads will be called ‘bound’ samples. For ‘unbound samples’, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to each sample to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), centrifuged (20,000 rcf, 22 °C, 20 min), and the supernatant transferred to new 1.5 mL tubes. To ensure as much protein as possible was recovered, 0.1% (w/v) of TFA was then added to the previously centrifuged 1.5 mL tubes, re-centrifuged (20,000 rcf, 22 <sup>°</sup>C, 10 min), and the resulting supernatant pooled with the first supernatant sample. For ‘bound’ samples, magnetic beads were first gently agitated on a tube rotator in 250 µL of elution buffer (EB) solution (80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.2% (w/v) TFA, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid), magnetised so the supernatant could be transferred, and then boiled in 200 µL of EB solution at 800 rpm, 95 <sup>°</sup>C for 5 min. These beads were then magnetised again so that supernatant could be transferred for TFA treatment.</p>
<p>Peptides for both ‘unbound’ and ‘bound’ samples were desalted using tC18 cartridges (Waters, #WAT036810), vacuum-dried at ambient temperature for ∼3 h, and then resuspended in a compatible solution (0.2% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid in 1% (v/v) formic acid) for liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS).</p>

<label>2.</label><title>Mass spectrometry</title>
<p>For technical reasons, we used two mass spectrometers as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Prikas et al. (2020)</xref> – the ThermoFisher Scientific Q-Exactive Orbitrap (QE) and ThermoScientific Orbitrap Exploris (Exploris). Samples from biological replicates 1 and 2 were run on the QE, replicates 4 and 5 were run on the Exploris, and replicate 3 was run on both machines. We treated these as 6 separate experiments, although there were only 5 biological replicates, as considerably more proteins were identified using the Exploris compared with the QE – for this reason, the Exploris was used for subsequent experiments. The overlap between learning proteomes for each biological replicate (i.e., proteins unique to ‘TurboID, trained’) has been summarised in <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>, based on the mass spectrometer used. The resulting data was processed using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Swiss-Prot database (downloaded on 01/02/2021). An MS/MS ion search was performed with the following settings: ‘semi-trypsin’ enzyme, ‘monoisotopic’ mass values, ‘unrestricted’ protein mass, ‘± 5 ppm’ peptide tolerance, ‘± 0.05 Da’ fragment mass tolerance, and ‘3’ maximum missed cleavages. Biotin (K), Carbamidomethyl (C), Oxidation (M), Phospho (ST), and Phospho (Y) were selected as variable modifications. Data from the MASCOT search engine will be made accessible on the Dryad platform upon publication.</p>

<sec id="s4e3">
<label>3.</label><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>We designated protein identities from all mass spectrometry experiments as either ‘assigned’ or ‘unassigned’ hits (see Tables S3 &amp; S4 for full lists). ‘Assigned proteins/hits’ are defined as proteins identified by MASCOT, based on peptide sequences detected during mass spectrometry, with at least one unique peptide detected for that protein. This threshold was chosen based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Prikas et al. (2020)</xref>, to ensure sensitivity in detecting low-abundance neuronal proteins. We did not restrict our definition of ‘assigned hits’ to any peptide or protein score threshold. In contrast, ‘unassigned hits’ were determined using peptide sequences with a peptide score ≥ 15, but that were not assigned a protein identity by MASCOT, as the peptide was not detected as unique for a specific protein by MASCOT. Our criteria for ‘unassigned hits’ was the protein identity required (1) at least one peptide for the protein with a peptide score ≥ 15 calculated by MASCOT, (2) an 100% identity match between peptide sequences with a peptide score ≥ 15 and the protein determined by BLAST, and (3) an e value &lt; 0.05 for the identity match calculated by BLAST, such that a smaller number represents an increased probability that the identity is true and not given by random chance. To collect a list of unassigned hits, we used a custom Python script to perform bulk BLAST-p searches for these sequences using the ‘Reference proteins (refseq_protein)’ database and ‘<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (taxid:6239)’ organism. This Python code uses Anaconda 2023.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anaconda Software Distribution, 2016</xref>), BioPython 1.78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cock et al., 2009</xref>), and pandas software 1.5.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">The pandas development team, 2020</xref>). Our pipeline then assigned protein accession numbers to searched peptide sequences where the percent identity = 100% and e value &lt; 0.05. Finally, the Batch Entrez online software available on the NCBI website was used to convert accession numbers to protein identities. This generated lists of unassigned hits for samples in each biological replicate.</p>
<p>Proteins detected in TurboID, trained worms only were calculated as follows: (1) proteins detected from ‘non-transgenic, control’ and ‘non-transgenic, trained’ worms were subtracted from corresponding protein lists generated from TurboID worms, and then (2) proteins that overlap between lists for ‘TurboID, control’ and ‘TurboID, trained’ worms were subtracted from each other. Venn diagrams were generated using an online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/">https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>GO term analyses were achieved using STRING (version 12.0), Cytoscape (version 3.10.0), and the Cytoscape App ClueGO (version 2.5.10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>). All 1010 proteins from ‘TurboID, trained’ lists were entered into STRING as a single list, so k-means clustering could be utilised to separate proteins into 10 clusters, to parse data into more accessible clusters with enough proteins to output enriched GO terms. The ‘tabular text’ protein-protein interaction information exported from STRING for each cluster was then uploaded onto Cytoscape. GO term analyses were performed with ClueGO for the following categories per cluster using default settings (network specificity in brackets): (i) cellular component (medium), (ii) biological process (detailed), and (iii) molecular function (medium). The ClueGO results were exported to spreadsheets for each cluster, as Table S5 (cellular component) and Table S6 (biological process/molecular function), such that each row corresponds to a GO term based on gene/s within a specific cluster. Each list of genes in each row was consolidated with other gene lists with a matching or similar corresponding GO term, to generate the data shown in Tables S5-S6, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, &amp; <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>. Nodes that did not show protein-protein interactions with other nodes and/or were not categorised into any GO term by ClueGO were manually categorised through a literature search and added onto these figures through Cytoscape.</p>
<p>We assessed overlap between biological replicates for individual candidates (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6</xref>) using two mass spectrometry systems: Thermo-Fisher Q-Exactive Orbitrap (‘QE’) and Orbitrap Exploris (‘Exploris’). Candidates detected in multiple replicates comprised 17% of assigned hits in QE runs, 13% in Exploris, and 21–23% when including unassigned hits (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A–D</xref>). Of the 1,010 assigned QE hits, 17% were also identified with Exploris, increasing to 29% when including all 2,065 protein identities (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figures S6E–F</xref>). Despite modest overlap (&lt;25%), key learning-related pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Table S6) and other biological processes, including metabolic pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), were consistently represented, supporting the biological relevance of the identified learning proteome.</p>

<p>We adapted previously established methods to perform three behavioural paradigms that model associative learning: (1) salt associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Tang et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hiroki et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>), (2) salt aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Lim et al., 2018</xref>), and (3) butanone appetitive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kauffman et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s4f1">
<label>1.</label><title>Salt associative learning</title>
<p>This experiment had three groups: naïve worms that did not undergo training, ‘control’ worms that were paired with 100 mM NaCl and food, and ‘trained’ worms that were paired with no NaCl and food. Worms from all groups were washed off agar plates using washing buffer as in the ‘<bold>Protein extraction and quantification</bold>’ section above. The naïve group could be then immediately tested for their innate response to salt using the salt chemotaxis assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Rahmani et al., 2024</xref>). For experimental groups, worms were washed a third time with washing buffer (containing 50 mM NaCl; for ‘control’) or no-salt buffer (washing buffer without NaCl; for ‘trained’). These washing steps were completed within 10 min per group. Trained animals were placed on 9 cm ‘conditioning plates’ containing salt-deficient agar (5 mM K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (pH 6.0), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.0% (w/v) agar) and their bacterial food source <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 <italic>bioB::kan</italic>. Control worms were placed on conditioning plates containing salt-deficient agar supplemented with 100 mM NaCl. Worms were left on these plates for 6 h at 22 °C in the dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>). Following the training step, worms were washed twice with washing buffer and then transferred within 2 min to test their learning capacity using a salt chemotaxis assay (described below in <xref rid="s4f3" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The food source (<italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 <italic>bioB::kan</italic>) was prepared 3-4 d before each experiment, which involved (1) pelleting 1.5 mL of bacteria by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 30 sec in a 2 mL tube, (2) discarding the supernatant, and then (3) vortexing cells in 750 µL of modified LB. 750 µL of washed bacteria was transferred onto each conditioning plate, left to dry at room temperature overnight, and then left at 22 °C for 3-4 d before use. Notably, the salt-deficient agar in conditioning plates for training contains 0.728 mM of NaCl due to the use of modified LB, meaning that it is not completely lacking NaCl but has only a very small amount.</p>

<sec id="s4f2">
<label>2.</label><title>Salt aversive learning</title>
<p>This assay involves three groups: naïve (did not undergo training), mock-conditioned worms (paired with no salt and no food), and conditioned worms (paired with 50 mM NaCl and no food). All groups were first washed as described in the <bold>Salt associative learning</bold> section, except the third wash was performed with no-salt buffer (for ‘mock-conditioned’) or washing buffer (for ‘conditioned’). Naïve worms were placed on chemotaxis assay plates after two washes with washing buffer. Worms undergoing conditioning were incubated at room temperature for 3 h in 1.5 mL tubes, placed on a shaker at 175 rpm. These tubes contained no-salt buffer for ‘mock-conditioned’ groups or washing buffer (containing 50 mM NaCl) for ‘conditioned’ groups. Worms were pelleted by sedimentation for 1-2 min before use in salt chemotaxis assays as described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f3">
<label>3.</label><title>Salt chemotaxis assay</title>
<p>Salt chemotaxis assay (CTX) plates contain a salt gradient prepared by placing 5 mm cubes of salt-deficient agar on top of salt-deficient agar, with one cube containing 0 mM salt on one side and another cube containing 200 mM salt on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Jang et al., 2019</xref>) (see <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref> for a schematic). Worms were allowed to crawl freely on chemotaxis assay plates for 45 min in the dark at 22 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>), becoming immobilised when they encountered the paralytic agent sodium azide at the extremes of the salt gradient. These animals were then counted within the regions outlined in <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref> to calculate the salt chemotaxis index (CI) based on the below equation:
<disp-formula id="disp-eqn-1">
<graphic xlink:href="580416v4_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
CI values range from −1.0 (strong preference for low salt concentrations) to +1.0 (strong preference for high salt concentrations). We note several differences in our chemotaxis assay compared with other studies: in our study, (1) CTX plates contained 0 mM salt prior to the addition of salt cubes (containing 0 or 200 mM salt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Jang et al., 2019</xref>), while other studies use CTX plates containing 50 mM NaCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>), and (2) the food source used to induce learning is biotin-auxotrophic strain (<italic>E. coli bioB::kan</italic> MG1655), which is grown with 50 mM Kanamycin antibiotic, differing from other studies that used <italic>E. coli</italic> NA22 without antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Kunitomo et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Nagashima et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>TurboID worm populations exposed to biotin during training by salt associative learning were scored for the total percentage of transgenic animals on chemotaxis assay plates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). This is because TurboID worms expressed the enzyme from an extrachromosomal array, and this scoring confirmed the presence of TurboID-positive animals in worm pellets to be used for downstream proteomics. To do this, fluorescing worms only (identified by co-injection marker P<italic>unc-122::rfp</italic>) were counted in all zones excluding the origin and compared to the total number of worms (fluorescing and non-fluorescing worms) in these zones. The average percentage for TurboID-positive worms was 27-57% per biological replicate.</p>

<title>Neuron class analysis for learning proteome data</title>
<p>Analyses utilised protein lists (containing assigned hits only) from mass spectrometry experiments for the following groups: (1) non-Tg high-salt control, (2) non-Tg trained, (3) TurboID high-salt control, and (4) TurboID high-salt trained (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, protein identities from non-Tg high-salt control and non-Tg trained were subtracted from TurboID high-salt control and TurboID trained, respectively. Following subtractions, protein lists were then compared to identify those unique to TurboID high-salt control (388 proteins) versus TurboID trained (706 proteins) as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>Using CeNGEN:</italic> Protein lists unique to TurboID high-salt control and TurboID trained were separately input into the CeNGEN database (threshold = 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>), to identify gene expression profiles for each list. CeNGEN output 128 lists corresponding to individual neuron classes for each experimental group, and each list contained genes/proteins from one (of two) group/s that express in a specific neuron class. The number of proteins expressed in each neuron class was calculated for TurboID high-salt control and TurboID trained. For TurboID trained, these numbers were normalised by a factor of ∼1.8. Neuron-specific fold-differences in the number of proteins expressed in TurboID trained versus TurboID high-salt control was used to rank each neuron class. We interpreted a higher fold-difference value as a relatively greater enrichment (fold-change) of training-associated genes compared to control.</p>
<p><italic>Using Worm-Seq and CeSTAAN:</italic> Analysis of neuron class using transcriptomics data from Worm-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ghaddar et al., 2023</xref>) and CeSTAAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Princeton University, 2025</xref>) was performed by (1) downloading gene lists for each neuron class (threshold = 2 for CeSTAAN, no threshold for Worm-Seq as this option was not available), (2) determining the overlap between each neuron class list and assigned hits unique to high-salt control vs trained (from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), and then (3) calculating the fold-change to rank neuron classes as described with CeNGEN (with normalised values for trained as above).</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Statistica analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism (version 8.0). The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used to assess chemotaxis assay data. Following confirmation of normality, an ordinary two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons post-test (α = 0.05) was performed to compare differences between mean CI values for each group. This statistical analysis was chosen given that it aligns with recent publications that employ similar experimental designs and data structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Beets et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Jang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Kitazono et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Lim et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Lin et al., 2010</xref>).

Animals were grown for at least two generations via their diet (i.e., <italic>E. coli</italic> bioB::kan MG1655), and then their biotin-depleted progeny (young hermaphrodite adults) were lysed by sonication for protein extraction. Whole worms were lysed immediately (-) or fed MG1655 supplemented with 1 mM biotin for 6 h (+) before lysis (+). Biotin-tagged proteins were probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (40 μg of total protein /lane). Here, the sum of areas containing biotin-tagged protein in each lane is interpreted as signal intensity for these proteins. By comparing this signal for untreated and treated lanes within each worm line, treatment was seen to increase signal (1.3-fold for non-Tg and 1.7-fold for transgenic <italic>C. elegans</italic>).

Peptide samples generated for biological replicate 3 were run in both mass spectrometers used in this study, the Q Exactive or the Exploris, and the corresponding protein list is named ‘3a’ and ‘3b’ respectively.</p>
        <p>Table S5: Cellular component GO terms associated with assigned hits in the learning proteome. All (1010) assigned protein hits detected in TurboID, trained worms were separated into 10 clusters by k-means clustering on STRING (version 12.0) and GO term analysis was conducted for each cluster using ClueGO (version 2.5.10) on Cytoscape (version 3.10.0). GO terms were then sorted into ‘plasma membrane &amp; extracellular matrix (ECM)’, ‘cilia &amp; dendrites’, ‘cell body &amp; cytoplasm’, ‘nucleus’, ‘Golgi apparatus’, ‘cytoskeleton’, ‘mitochondria’, ‘axon &amp; vesicles’, ‘pre-synapse’, and ‘other’ (i.e., non-informative terms) categories due to recurring and/or similar terms. Colour-coding is based on the GO Group. Each category is separated by underlined and bolded titles corresponding to the cellular component in rows 1-285. Consolidated lists of genes/proteins are detailed from rows 287-465.</p>
        <p>Table S6: Biological process and molecular function GO terms associated with assigned hits in the learning proteome. All (1010) assigned protein hits detected in TurboID, trained worms were separated into 10 clusters by k-means clustering on STRING (version 12.0) and GO term analysis was conducted for each cluster using ClueGO (version 2.5.10) on Cytoscape (version 3.10.0). GO terms were then sorted into ‘protein synthesis’, ‘protein degradation’, ‘insulin &amp; protein kinases’, ‘G protein signalling’, and ‘neurotransmission’ categories due to recurring and/or similar terms. Colour-coding is based on the GO Group. Each category is separated by underlined and bolded titles corresponding to the biological processes listed above in rows 1-109. Consolidated lists of genes/proteins are detailed from rows 111-162.</p>
        <p>Table S7: Identifying neuron classes represented within the learning proteome in this study. This table presents neurons that express ≥ 1 gene encoding proteins found in either the trained or control lists. For neurons present in both datasets, fold-change values were calculated as the ratio of the number of genes expressed in the trained condition to those in the control. Neurons are ranked in descending order of fold-change. Values under the ‘#Proteins from trained (normalised)’ column are normalised based on the fold-difference between the number of proteins in the trained vs control protein lists (normalisation factor = ∼1.8). Classifications for neuron type are assigned to each neuron class based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Pereira et al. (2015)</xref>. The CeNGEN database was used to identify gene expression patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Taylor et al. (2021)</xref> and includes all 302 neurons in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite nervous system. Only 128 neuron classes are listed here since neurons that do not express any proteins from trained or control groups are not shown.</p>
        <p>Table S8: Molecular pathways for proteins detected in TurboID, trained <italic>C. elegans</italic> only. Proteins unique to trained animals that express TurboID were identified by subtracting those also in ‘TurboID, control’ and/or ‘non-transgenic, trained’ protein lists. Gene names are listed with assigned hits in bold. Each gene/protein has been grouped based on ‘Biological Process’ GO term annotations provided by STRING (version 12.0) and information available on WormBase (version WS290) based on data accessed during September-November 2023.</p>
        <p>Table S9: Statistical analyses for learning assays performed in this study. Data from statistical analyses are separated by figure with appropriate underlined and bolded titles, including <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> (red, rows 1-7), <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> (yellow, rows 9-31), <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> (green, rows 33-55), <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> (blue, rows 57-87), <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref> (purple, rows 89-191), <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref> (pink, rows 193-247), and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9</xref> (red, rows 249-287). Statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad PRISM 8 using two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests (alpha value = p &lt; 0.05). Columns left-to-right list the groups being compared, the mean difference (Diff.), the 95% confidence interval of diff., whether the difference is significant, the degree of significance (**** ≤ 0.0001; *** ≤ 0.001; ** ≤ 0.01; * ≤ 0.05; ns = non-significant), and the adjusted p value.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Rahmani et al. utilize the TurboID method to characterize global proteome changes in the worm's nervous system induced by a salt-based associative learning paradigm. Altogether, they uncover 706 proteins tagged by the TurboID method in worms that underwent the memory-inducing protocol. Next, the authors conduct a gene enrichment analysis that implicates specific molecular pathways in salt-associative learning, such as MAP kinase and cAMP-mediated pathways, as well as specific neuronal classes including pharyngeal neurons, and specific sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. The authors then screen a representative group of hits from the proteome analysis. They find that mutants of candidate genes from the MAP kinase pathway, namely dlk-1 and uev-3, do not affect performance in the learning paradigm. Instead, multiple acetylcholine signaling mutants, as well as a protein-kinase-A mutant, significantly affected performance in the associative memory assay (e.g., acc-1, acc-3, lgc-46, and kin-2). Finally, the authors demonstrate that protein-kinase-A mutants, as well as acetylcholine signaling mutants, do not exhibit a phenotype in a related but distinct conditioning paradigm-aversive salt conditioning-suggesting their effect is specific to appetitive salt conditioning.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors addressed the concerns raised in the previous review round, including the statistics of the chemotaxis experiments and the systems-level analysis of the neuron class expression patterns of their hits. I also appreciate the further attempt to equalize the sample size of the chemotaxis experiments and the transparent reporting of the sample size and statistics in the figure captions and Table S9. The new results from the panneuronal overexpression of the kin-2 gain-of-function allele also contribute to the manuscript. Together, these make the paper more compelling.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study by Rahmani in colleagues, the authors sought to define the &quot;learning proteome&quot; for a gustatory associative learning paradigm in C. elegans. Using a cytoplasmic TurboID expressed under the control of a pan-neuronal promoter, the authors labeled proteins during the training portion of the paradigm, followed by proteomics analysis. This approach revealed hundreds of proteins potentially involved in learning, which the authors describe using gene ontology and pathway analysis. The authors performed functional characterization of over two dozen of these genes for their requirement in learning using the same paradigm. They also compared the requirement for these genes across various learning paradigms and found that most hits they characterized appear to be specifically required for the training paradigm used for generating the &quot;learning proteome&quot;.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The authors have thoughtfully and transparently designed and reported the results of their study. Controls are carefully thought-out, and hits are ranked as strong and weak. By combining their proteomics with behavioral analysis, the authors also highlight the biological significance of their proteomics findings, and support that even weak hits are meaningful.</p>
<p>- The authors display a high degree of statistical rigor, incorporating normality tests into their behavioral data which is beyond the field standard.</p>
<p>- The authors include pathway analysis that generates interesting hypotheses about processes involved learning and memory</p>
<p>-The authors generally provide thoughtful interpretations for all of their results, both positive and negative, as well as any unexpected outcomes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, authors used a learning paradigm in C. elegans; when worms were fed in a saltless plate, its chemotaxis to salt is greatly reduced. To identify learning-related proteins, authors employed nervous system-specific transcriptome analysis to compare whole proteins in neurons between high-salt-fed animals and saltless-fed animals. Authors identified &quot;learning-specific proteins&quot; which are observed only after saltless feeding. They categorized these proteins by GO analyses, pathway analyses and expression site analyses, and further stepped forward to test mutants in selected genes identified by the proteome analysis. They find several mutants that are defective or hyper-proficient for learning, including acc-1/3 and lgc-46 acetylcholine receptors, F46H5.3 putative arginine kinase, and kin-2, a cAMP pathway gene. These mutants were not previously reported to have abnormality in the learning paradigm.</p>
<p>Concerns:</p>
<p>Upon revision, authors addressed all concerns of this reviewer, and the results are now presented in a way that facilitates objective evaluation. Authors' conclusions are supported by the results presented, and the strength of the proteomics approach is persuasively demonstrated.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>(1) Total neural proteome analysis has not been conducted before for learning-induced changes, though transcriptome analysis has been performed for odor learning (Lakhina et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.029</ext-link>). This warrants the novelty of this manuscript, because for some genes, protein levels may change even though mRNA levels remain the same. Although in a few reports TurboID has been used in C. elegans, this is the first report of a systematic analysis of tissue-specific differential proteomics.</p>
<p>(2) Authors found five mutants that have abnormality in the salt learning. These genes have not been described to have the abnormality, providing novel knowledge to the readers, especially those who work on C. elegans behavioural plasticity. Especially, involvement of acetylcholine neurotransmission has not been addressed before. Although transgenic rescue experiments have not been performed except kin-2, and the site of action (neurons involved) has not been tested in this manuscript, it will open the venue to further determine the way in which acetylcholine receptors, cAMP pathway etc. influences the learning process.</p>

I also appreciate the further attempt to equalize the sample size of the chemotaxis experiments and the transparent reporting of the sample size and statistics in the figure captions and Table S9. The new results from the panneuronal overexpression of the kin-2 gain-of-function allele also contribute to the manuscript. Together, these make the paper more compelling. The additional tested hits provide a comprehensive analysis of the main molecular pathways that could have affected learning. However, the revised manuscript includes more information and analysis, raising additional concerns.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>As reviewer 4 noted, and as also shown to be relevant for C30G12.6 presented in Figure 6, the backcrossing of the mutants is important, as background mutations may lead to the observed effects. Could the authors add to Table 1, sheet 1, the outcrossing status of the tested mutants?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this important point. A column has now been added to Table S1 to indicate the outcross status of all strains used in this study. Additionally, we have updated the table legend on page 77 to clarify how to interpret the information provided in this column.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is important to validate that the results of the positive hits (where learning was affected), such as acc-1, acc-3, and lgc-46, do not stem from background mutations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree that confirming the absence of background mutations is important, we have taken alternative steps to address this concern:</p>
<p>- The outcross status of each strain is now clearly indicated in Table S1.</p>
<p>- Observed phenotypes were consistent across multiple biological replicates over extended periods (months, sometimes years), reducing the likelihood that results stem from background mutations.</p>
<p>We believe these measures provide confidence in the validity of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The fold change in the number of hits for different neurons in the CENGEN-based rank analysis requires a statistical test (discussed on pages 17-19 and summarized in Table S7). Similar to the other gene enrichment analyses presented in the manuscript, the new rank analysis also requires a statistical test. Since the authors extensively elaborate on the results from this analysis, I think a statistical analysis is especially important for its interpretation. For example, if considering the IL1 neurons, which ranked highest, and assuming random groups of genes-each having the same size as those of the ranked neurons (209 genes in total for IL1 in Table S7)-how common would it be to get the calculated fold change of 1.38 or higher? Such bootstrapping analysis is common for enrichment analysis. Perhaps the authors could consult with an institutional expert (Dr. Pawel Skuza, Flinders University) for the statistical aspects of this analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion and agree that statistical testing can be valuable for enrichment analyses. However, implementing additional tests such as bootstrapping is beyond the scope of this study. Our aim was to provide a descriptive overview rather than inferential statistics. To ensure transparency and interpretability, we have:</p>
<p>- Clearly reported fold changes and rankings in Table S7.</p>
<p>- Discussed the limitations of this approach in the manuscript text (page 18, lines 17–20).</p>
<p>- Clearly outlined the methods used to perform this analysis (pages 53–54).</p>
<p>We believe this descriptive analysis provides sufficient context for interpreting these results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The learning phenotypes from Figure S8, concerning acc-1, acc-3, and lgc-46 mutants, are summarized in a scheme in Figure 4; however, the chemotaxis results are found in the supplemental Figure S8. Perhaps I missed the reasoning, but for transparency, I think the relevant Figure S8 results should be shown together with their summary scheme in Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion to improve clarity. We have now moved the panels corresponding to cholinergic signalling components from Figure S8 into Figure 4 on page 21, so that the summary scheme and underlying data are presented together. The figure legends and main text have been updated accordingly to reflect the correct figure numbers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study by Rahmani in colleagues, the authors sought to define the &quot;learning proteome&quot; for a gustatory associative learning paradigm in C. elegans. Using a cytoplasmic TurboID expressed under the control of a pan-neuronal promoter, the authors labeled proteins during the training portion of the paradigm, followed by proteomics analysis. This approach revealed hundreds of proteins potentially involved in learning, which the authors describe using gene ontology and pathway analysis. The authors performed functional characterization of over two dozen of these genes for their requirement in learning using the same paradigm. They also compared the requirement for these genes across various learning paradigms and found that most hits they characterized appear to be specifically required for the training paradigm used for generating the &quot;learning proteome&quot;.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have thoughtfully and transparently designed and reported the results of their study. Controls are carefully thought-out, and hits are ranked as strong and weak. By combining their proteomics with behavioral analysis, the authors also highlight the biological significance of their proteomics findings, and support that even weak hits are meaningful.</p>
<p>The authors display a high degree of statistical rigor, incorporating normality tests into their behavioral data which is beyond the field standard.</p>
<p>The authors include pathway analysis that generates interesting hypotheses about processes involved learning and memory</p>
<p>The authors generally provide thoughtful interpretations for all of their results, both positive and negative, as well as any unexpected outcomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The authors use the Cengen single cell-transcriptomic atlas to predict where the proteins in the &quot;learning proteome&quot; are likely to be expressed and use this data to identify neurons that are likely significant to learning, and building hypothetical circuit. This is an excellent idea; however, the Cengen dataset only contains transcriptomic data from juvenile L4 animals, while the authors performed their proteome experiments in Day 1 Adult animals. It is well documented that the C. elegans nervous system transcriptome is significant different between these two stages (Kaletsky et al., 2016, St. Ange et al., 2024), so the authors might be missing important expression data, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete networks. The adult neuronal single-cell atlas data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cestaan.princeton.edu/">https://cestaan.princeton.edu/</ext-link>) would be better suited to incorporate into neuronal expression analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for highlighting this important point. We have now incorporated transcriptomic data from young adult animals to complement the L4-based CeNGEN dataset. Specifically, we integrated data from CeSTAAN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cestaan.princeton.edu/">https://cestaan.princeton.edu/</ext-link>, including St. Ange et al., 2024) and WormSeq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wormseq.org/">https://wormseq.org/</ext-link>, including Ghaddar et al., 2023), as outlined below. Importantly, CeSTAAN and WormSeq provide data for 79 and 104 neuron classes, respectively (compared to 128 from CeNGEN); for this reason, the main analysis focuses on CeNGEN due to its broader coverage, with additional datasets noted in brackets for completeness. This is stated on page 18, lines 15–17 to ensure transparency regarding our rationale.</p>
<p>The main text has been updated to describe these datasets and their integration into our analysis (pages 18–20), and further details on how these resources were used have been added to the Experimental Procedures (pages 53–54).</p>
<p>We also incorporated data from Kaletsky et al. (2016) and St. Ange et al. (2024) into our neuron identity checks for all assigned and unassigned hits (page 16, lines 8–19). This analysis shows that the nervous system is highly represented in our proteome data: 75–87% of assigned hits and 75–83% of all hits correspond to neuron-enriched genes identified by St. Ange et al. and Kaletsky et al.</p>
<p>In addition, we used several transcriptomic databases to confirm that learning regulators identified in this study through TurboID and validation experiments are expressed in the same neuron classes as suggested by CenGEN (page 36).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors offer many interpretations for why mutants in &quot;learning proteome&quot; hits have no detectable phenotype, which is commendable. They are however overlooking another important interpretation, it is possible that these changes to the proteome are important for memory, which is dependent upon translation and protein level changes, and is molecularly distinct from learning. It is well established in the field mutating or knocking down memory regulators in other paradigms will often have no detectable effect on learning. Incorporating this interpretation into the discussion and highlighting it as an area for future exploration would strengthen the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have incorporated this interpretation into the Results section (page 31, lines 17–23), specifying the potential role of these proteomic changes in memory encoding and retention, which are molecularly distinct from learning.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- A minor weakness - In the discussion, the authors state that the Lakhina, et al 2015 used RNA-seq to assess memory transcriptome changes. This study used microarray analysis.</p>

<p>Significance:</p>
<p>The approach used in this study is interesting and has the potential to further our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of associative behaviors. There have been multiple transcriptomic studies in the worm looking at gene expression changes in the context of behavioral training. This study compliments and extends those studies, by examining how the proteome changes in a different training paradigm. This approach here could be employed for multiple different training paradigms, presenting a new technical advance for the field. This paper would be of interest to the broader field of behavioral and molecular neuroscience. Though it uses an invertebrate system, many findings in the worm regarding learning and memory translate to higher organisms, making this paper of interest and significant to the broader field of behavioral neuroscience.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, authors used a learning paradigm in C. elegans; when worms were fed in a saltless plate, its chemotaxis to salt is greatly reduced. To identify learning-related proteins, authors employed nervous system-specific transcriptome analysis to compare whole proteins in neurons between high-salt-fed animals and saltless-fed animals. Authors identified &quot;learning-specific proteins&quot; which are observed only after saltless feeding. They categorized these proteins by GO analyses, pathway analyses and expression site analyses, and further stepped forward to test mutants in selected genes identified by the proteome analysis. They find several mutants that are defective or hyper-proficient for learning, including acc-1/3 and lgc-46 acetylcholine receptors, F46H5.3 putative arginine kinase, and kin-2, a cAMP pathway gene. These mutants were not previously reported to have abnormality in the learning paradigm.</p>
<p>Concerns:</p>
<p>Upon revision, authors addressed all concerns of this reviewer, and the results are now presented in a way that facilitates objective evaluation. Authors' conclusions are supported by the results presented, and the strength of the proteomics approach is persuasively demonstrated.</p>

<p>Significance:</p>
<p>(1) Total neural proteome analysis has not been conducted before for learning-induced changes, though transcriptome analysis has been performed for odor learning (Lakhina et al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.029">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.029</ext-link>). This warrants the novelty of this manuscript, because for some genes, protein levels may change even though mRNA levels remain the same. Although in a few reports TurboID has been used in C. elegans, this is the first report of a systematic analysis of tissue-specific differential proteomics.</p>
<p>(2) Authors found five mutants that have abnormality in the salt learning. These genes have not been described to have the abnormality, providing novel knowledge to the readers, especially those who work on C. elegans behavioural plasticity. Especially, involvement of acetylcholine neurotransmission has not been addressed before. Although transgenic rescue experiments have not been performed except kin-2, and the site of action (neurons involved) has not been tested in this manuscript, it will open the venue to further determine the way in which acetylcholine receptors, cAMP pathway etc. influences the learning process.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors stated in their response to reviewers that &quot;referring to a phenotype as both a trend and non-significant may confuse readers, which was originally stated in the manuscript in two locations,&quot; and that such sentences were removed. Unfortunately, in the new text (page 28, lines 18-19), the authors write: &quot;uev-3 mutants showed a lower average CI after training compared with wild-type, but this did not reach statistical significance.&quot; As stated before, I find such sentences confusing and not interpretable. If the changes are not significant, then the lower average CI is not informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. This has been corrected to improve clarity – we say instead that “trained phenotypes between wild-type and <italic>uev-3</italic> mutants were not statistically significant” (page 29, lines 21–22).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In response to reviewers' comments, the authors added more information about the biotinylation efficiency of the experiment, which is also described in the text:</p>
<p>Page 8, line 27: &quot;we found that biotin exposure increased the signal 1.3-fold for non-Tg and 1.7-fold for TurboID C. elegans.&quot;</p>
<p>Page 10, line 4: &quot;Quantification of the signal within entire lanes showed a 1.1-fold increase in the 'TurboID, control' lane compared with the 'non-Tg, control' lane, and a 1.9-fold increase in the 'TurboID, trained' lane compared with the 'non-Tg, trained' lane.&quot;</p>
<p>Is it common in this field not to show the actual raw quantified numbers? I was expecting either a bar graph or instead that the measured values would appear in the text alongside the fold-change information.</p>

<p>The results describing the absence of a learning phenotype in backcrossed C30G12.6 are presented in the main figure. If the authors believe this is an important result, I understand keeping it in the main figure; however, I find this uncommon.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment. We consider the absence of a learning phenotype in backcrossed C30G12.6 to be an important control for interpreting the original findings, which is why we have retained it in the main figure.</p>

<p>I noted a few typos.</p>
<p>(1) In Fig 5B, the transgene is depicted kin-2(ce139) but it is probably kin-2(ce179).</p>

<p>The typo has been corrected on page 25.</p>

<p>(2) In text, R97C and ce179 are used interchangeably, but in fact there is no description that they are identical.</p>

<p>We now state the following in the manuscript: “We tested worms with the <italic>ce179</italic> mutant allele in <italic>kin-2</italic>, in which a conserved residue in the inhibitory domain (which normally functions to keep PKA turned off in the absence of cAMP) is mutated to cause an R92C amino acid change – this results in increased PKA activity (Schade et al., 2005).” (page 25, lines 1–3),</p>

<p>We apologise for this typographical error. This figure number is meant to correspond to salt associative learning assay data (Fig. S8), not salt aversive learning (Fig. S9). Since the data from Fig. S8 was moved to Fig. 4, the figure citation has been changed from Fig. S7 (which was incorrect) to Fig. 4 (page 32, line 17).</p>
