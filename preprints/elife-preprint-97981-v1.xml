<title>Abstract</title><p>Single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), an alternative to single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), encounters technical challenges in obtaining high-quality nuclei and RNA, persistently hindering its applications. Here, we present a robust technique for isolating nuclei across various tissue types, remarkably enhancing snRNA-seq data quality. Employing this approach, we comprehensively characterize the depot-dependent cellular dynamics of various cell types underlying adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. By integrating bulk nuclear RNA-seq from adipocyte nuclei of different sizes, we identify distinct adipocyte subpopulations categorized by size and functionality. These subpopulations follow two divergent trajectories, adaptive and pathological, with their prevalence varying by depot. Specifically, we identify a key molecular feature of dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes, a global shutdown in gene expression, along with elevated stress and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, our differential gene expression analysis reveals distinct contributions of adipocyte subpopulations to the overall pathophysiology of adipose tissue. Our study establishes a robust snRNA-seq method, providing novel insights into the mechanisms orchestrating adipose tissue remodeling during obesity, with broader applicability across diverse biological systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized various fields of biology by enabling high-resolution profiling of single-cell heterogeneity within complex tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. It has not only facilitated the identification of new cell types and subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, but also uncovered alterations in cellular composition and gene expression across diverse biological contexts during development, disease progression and responses to environmental stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, experimental methods for scRNA-seq still present limitations and challenges. First, these methods require the use of fresh tissues, which can be difficult to obtain and thus lead to logistic complexities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Even when fresh tissues are available, the process of obtaining single cell suspension through enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation can introduce unwanted artifacts. Different types of cells can be digested to varying degrees and rates, resulting in biased cell recovery. Also, the tissue dissociation process can cause cellular stress, leading to reduced cell viability and altered transcriptional profiles. Lastly, certain cell types are unsuitable for scRNA-seq due to their unique cellular properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Adipocytes are one example; their large size and excess lipid content render them incompatible with the microfluidic platforms used in the majority of scRNA-seq technologies.</p>
<p>To overcome these issues, single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) has been developed as an alternative strategy. While generating transcriptional profiles with high similarity to those by scRNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, snRNA-seq offers advantages. First, this method utilizes nuclei that are promptly released from tissues during homogenization, obviating the need for an extended digestion process and thereby minimizing cell type biases and artifactual transcriptional alteration. Second, its compatibility with cryopreserved samples allows for greater flexibility in experimental designs and enables the utilization of samples stored in biobanks. Furthermore, snRNA-seq can be employed to study cell types that are less amenable to scRNA-seq, such as adipocytes and cardiomyocytes, as isolated nuclei no longer retain limiting cellular characteristics and can be loaded on to various platforms. Nevertheless, snRNA-seq also poses challenges to be considered. Once released from cells, nuclei are highly fragile and susceptible to mechanical stress, resulting in leakage or aggregation. Moreover, their enclosed RNA becomes increasingly vulnerable to RNases, leading to rapid RNA degradation. Nuclei isolated from <italic>in vivo</italic> tissues are typically more delicate than those from cells cultured <italic>in vitro</italic>, with potential variation depending on cell type. Hence, meticulous preparation of high-quality nuclei is crucial for successful snRNA-seq experiments.</p>
<p>Adipose tissue plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism, serving as a dynamic energy reservoir within the body. It exhibits remarkable plasticity in response to nutritional fluctuations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In obesity, adipose tissue undergoes a significant remodeling process, expanding substantially to enhance its storage capacity. This process is orchestrated through coordinated actions among diverse cell types, including adipocytes, preadipocytes, endothelial cells, and various immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, prolonged obesity leads to pathological changes and dysfunction in adipose tissue, characterized by disrupted lipid metabolism, impaired insulin signaling, inflammation and cell death. These changes are critical precursors to the onset of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The distribution of body fat in obesity is closely correlated with metabolic health. The expansion of visceral fat depots increases risks for metabolic disorders, whereas subcutaneous fat depots pose lesser risks or can even offer protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. This is likely due to varying responses of different adipose tissue depots to obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In obesity, visceral adipose tissues display enlarged hypertrophic adipocytes, along with hypoxia, elevated fibrosis and inflammation from increased immune cell infiltration. In contrast, subcutaneous adipose tissues have smaller adipocytes with lower levels of inflammation and hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. scRNA-seq has been used to characterize the dynamics of cell populations underlying adipose tissue remodeling, with a focus on the cell types within stromal vascular fractions, particularly preadipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Yet adipocytes have been excluded from these studies due to technical limitations. More recently, snRNA-seq has been employed, revealing evidence of the cellular heterogeneity within adipocyte populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Despite this progress, acquiring high-quality snRNA-seq data from adipose tissues remains highly challenging. Technical difficulties have posed a major hurdle to achieving accuracy, sensitivity, and efficacy in understanding adipose tissue remodeling, especially regarding mature adipocyte populations during obesity.</p>
<p>Here, we present a robust method for isolating nuclei for snRNA-seq, which enhances the quality of nuclear RNA and preserves nucleus integrity across various tissue types. Using this method, we have generated snRNA-seq data of superior quality compared to existing datasets, offering novel and precise insights into the specific changes within cell populations across different fat depots in response to obesity. By integrating bulk nuclear RNA-seq with adipocyte nuclei of different sizes, we have identified multiple subpopulations of adipocytes primarily categorized by size and functionality, which are influenced by obesity. Specifically, we have characterized dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes prevalent in visceral adipose tissues during obesity, exhibiting hallmark features of cellular stress and inflammation. All these adipocyte subpopulations contributed differentially to a range of biological pathways involved in the pathophysiology of adipose tissue during obesity.</p>

<title>Robust nucleus isolation protocols protect RNA quality and nucleus integrity</title>
<p>To systemically address the issue of nuclear RNA degradation, we first assessed RNA quality in isolated nuclei from a range of mouse tissues. During nucleus isolation, no RNase inhibitors were added to evaluate intrinsic RNase activity in each tissue type. We observed a wide spectrum of RNA quality among the tissues examined (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). The brain exhibited highly intact RNA, followed by the heart showing relatively good RNA quality. The liver displayed moderate RNA degradation. Among the adipose tissues, including brown adipose tissue (BAT), subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), and visceral epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), significant RNA degradation was detected, with eWAT showing the highest level of degradation. RNA was completely degraded in the pancreas (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). These results indicate significant variation in the quality of RNA extracted from nuclei depending on tissue types. To limit RNA degradation, we incorporated recombinant RNase inhibitors during nucleus isolation and examined additional tissue types, including the spleen, the lung, and the kidney. Surprisingly, the addition of recombinant RNase inhibitors at a concentration of 0.4 U/µl had no discernible effect on RNA quality of any of those tissues (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). Even when the concentration of RNase inhibitors was increased to 4 U/µl, it failed to yield any substantial enhancement in RNA quality (data not shown). Therefore, we screened various conditions and molecules known for their ability to inhibit RNase activity. Among these, the vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (VRC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> was identified as having a significant impact on RNA quality. High-quality RNA with minimal degradation was obtained in all the tested tissues except for the pancreas and its connecting tissue, the spleen (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>). Finally, we optimized the protocol by combining VRC with recombinant RNase inhibitors for further improvements, albeit to a modest extent (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>). In addition to RNA quality, achieving a single nucleus suspension is an important requirement for snRNA-seq sample preparation. Using VRC, the optimized protocol successfully retrieved a well-dispersed nucleus population without clumps in all tissue types (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). Further analysis of nucleus morphology at a higher resolution revealed a smoother membrane surface and larger nucleus size when using the optimized protocol, as compared to the standard protocol (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>). Consistent with the preservative function of VRC proven in maintaining tissue morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, these findings show that our nucleus isolation protocol effectively maintains nucleus structure without shrinkage. Given that current snRNAseq methods require prompt sample processing due to the rapid degradation of RNA in isolated nuclei, we further tested the temporal stability of RNA in nuclei isolated using our optimized protocol. After isolating nuclei from eWAT, we stored them at 4°C for different durations (2, 6 and 24 hours) before RNA extraction and quality analysis. In the standard protocol, nuclear RNA exhibited severe degradation within 2 hours post-homogenization, worsening over 24 hours. In contrast, nuclear RNA isolated using the optimized protocol remained intact at 2 and 6 hours, maintaining good quality even after 24 hours (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>). To determine whether RNA could remain intact with additional handling procedures, we conducted the same time-course RNA extraction with nuclei sorted through flow cytometry. The RNA remained stable, comparable to that of unsorted nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>). Taken together, our optimized protocol, employing both VRC and recombinant RNase inhibitors, yields high-quality nuclei while preserving RNA integrity and nuclear structure for extended procedures up to 24 hours.</p>

<title>The optimized protocol improves the data quality of snRNA-seq</title>
<p>Considering the previous report on the inhibitory activity of VRC on reverse transcriptases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, we investigated whether the inclusion of VRC could confound the accurate representation of RNA expression profiles within nuclei. By utilizing the Nuclear tagging and Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (NuTRAP) mice designed to label nuclei from specific cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, we sorted nuclei from adipocytes and non-adipocytes to conduct a comparative analysis of their gene expression profiles through cDNA synthesis followed by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). We observed strong PCR amplification and highly specific expression of adipocyte markers in adipocyte nuclei and immune/endothelial cell markers in non-adipocyte nuclei (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref></bold>). These results indicate that the use of VRC during nucleus isolation does not pose an issue in gene expression profiling.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we applied the optimized nucleus isolation protocol for snRNA-seq of mouse adipose tissues using the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3’ Gene Expression system. We employed a two-step tissue homogenization process involving pulverization and Dounce homogenizers to ensure complete liberation of nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Additionally, we included a fluorescence-activated nucleus sorting (FANS) step in the workflow to eliminate tissue debris and ambient RNA (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref></bold>). From eWAT and iWAT samples collected from mice fed either a chow or high fat diet (HFD), we generated high-quality cDNA with long fragment sizes and constructed robust sequencing libraries (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref></bold>). To evaluate our data quality, we benchmarked them against two published snRNA-seq datasets from mouse adipose tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, based on the quality metrics determined by the standard Cell Ranger pipeline. With comparable sequencing depths (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>), our datasets displayed significantly higher counts of Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) and genes per nucleus, exceeding counts from the other datasets by almost two-fold (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref></bold>). Also, the proportions of mitochondrial reads in our datasets represented less than 1% (mean 0.37%), which was significantly lower than in the other datasets (mean 38.7 and 2.31%; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). Importantly, our method produced substantially higher fractions of reads in nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>), suggesting low ambient RNA contamination. This was consistent with the Barcode Rank Plot for our data, which exhibited a sudden drop of UMI counts (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref></bold>), indicating a clear distinction between intact nuclei and background barcodes during cell calling. Analysis using CellBender<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> also contrasted the minimal number of cells in the narrow transition zone in our datasets with the greater number of cells within the broader transition zone observed in the published samples (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref></bold>). These results indicate that our method reduces the contribution of ambient RNA to the expression profiles of single cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that our optimized protocol produces high-quality snRNA-seq data that outperforms other existing methods.</p>

<title>A single nucleus atlas of different adipose tissues from lean and obese mice</title>
<p>To characterize the cellular dynamics within mouse adipose tissues during obesity, we integrated data from both eWAT and iWAT of chow- or HFD-fed wild-type male mice. After filtering nuclei based on the detected numbers of UMIs and genes, and subsequently removing doublets and ambient RNA, a total of 53,395 cells/nuclei were identified, distributed across 10 distinct cell types (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref></bold>). The major cell types present in adipose tissues included adipocytes, adipocyte progenitor cells (APC), macrophages/monocytes, and endothelial cells. Additionally, we identified less abundant cell types, such as pericytes (PC)/smooth muscle cells (SMC), mesothelial cells, dendritic cells, mast cells, T cells, and B cells. We determined distinct marker gene sets for each cell type, including both established and novel markers (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref></bold>). The proportions of these cell types in our data largely matched those reported in previous studies, except for the notable improvement in recovering vascular cells (endothelial cells and PC/SMC) (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref></bold>). This is likely due to our robust two-step tissue homogenization, which effectively releases nuclei from vasculature that would otherwise be mechanically resistant.</p>
<p>The cellular composition altered substantially in response to HFD feeding, with variations depending on the fat depot (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref></bold>). HFD resulted in a reduction in adipocytes and an increase in macrophage/monocyte fractions in both eWAT and iWAT, with more prominent changes in eWAT (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2C</xref></bold>). APC fractions were smaller in eWAT compared to iWAT under chow diet, with marginal effects under HFD. The population size of endothelial cells did not show notable differences between the conditions (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref></bold>). Most of the minor cell populations exhibited minimal differences across the conditions, except for dendritic cells which increased in eWAT in response to HFD, and mast cells which were more abundant in iWAT than eWAT (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Obesity induces the transition of APC from an early state to a committed state in specifically eWAT</title>
<p>We next performed subclustering of each cell type found in mouse adipose tissues to gain insight into the cellular states and dynamics of cell subtypes during obesity, focusing on their unique gene expression profiles and proportional changes during obesity in different depots. Analysis of APCs revealed four different subpopulations (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref></bold>), which generally aligned with prior studies.

We found two minor macrophage subpopulations, MC6 and MC7, which resembled previously described regulatory macrophages (RegM) and collagen-expressing macrophages (CEM), respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref></bold>). Their prevalence showed depot-dependent differences, with eWAT demonstrating a higher abundance of RegM and iWAT containing more CEM (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). MC4 and MC5, accounting for approximately 20% of the myelocyte populations, were identified as classical monocytes (CMO) and non-classical monocytes (NCMO), respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4A</xref></bold>).

<p>Lymphocytes were clustered into four T cell subpopulations – regulatory (Treg), CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer T cells (NKT) – along with two B cell subpopulations (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3H</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4E</xref>)</bold>.

<title>Obesity-induced changes in vascular cell subpopulations represent depot-dependent dynamics of adipose tissue remodeling</title>
<p>The higher recovery of vascular cells in our snRNA-seq data provided comprehensive insights into the vasculature of adipose tissues. We identified nine subpopulations of vascular cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3K</xref></bold>), grouped into three major types: blood endothelial cells (blood EC), mural cells, and lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref></bold>). Blood EC included venous (VenEC), arterial (ArtEC), and capillary endothelial cells (CapEC). CapEC was further divided into arterial capillary endothelial cells (AcapEC) and venous capillary endothelial cells (VcapEC) (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>)</bold>, with the latter being the largest vascular cell type in adipose tissues (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref></bold>). We additionally recognized angiogenic endothelial cells (AngEC), comprising migratory tip cells expressing extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, and proliferative stalk cells with elevated expression of cell cycle genes (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref></bold>). Furthermore, we discovered an endothelial cell type characterized by high expression of lipid metabolism genes (LipEC) (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref></bold>). Following HFD feeding, an expansion of AngEC and LipEC was observed in both fat depots (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref></bold>), suggesting increased vascularization and lipid transport during obesity-induced adipose tissue expansion. Intriguingly, we noted that the VcapEC population drastically decreased specifically within eWAT during HFD feeding (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref></bold>), indicating impaired metabolite transport into the venous circulation, which may potentially contribute to the pathology of visceral adipose tissue.</p>
<p>In mural cells, pericytes (PC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) were identified (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref></bold>), with the PC population notably larger than that of SMC (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref></bold>), consistent with their respective association with capillaries and larger vessels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Lastly, we identified LEC (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D</xref></bold>), comprising 1-3% of the vascular cell population, which interestingly diminished following HFD feeding in both eWAT and iWAT (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref></bold>). The HFD-induced reduction of LEC, along with the aforementioned decline in VcapEC, implies that metabolic drainage into lymphatic vessels and the venous circulation could be a key pathological feature of visceral adipose tissues during obesity.</p>

<title>Adipocyte subpopulations embody diverse functional and cellular states influenced by obesity</title>
<p>snRNA-seq has recently begun to reveal the heterogeneity of adipocytes within white adipose tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In our dataset, we identified six subpopulations of adipocytes, characterized by a gradient of unique gene expression signatures among them rather than distinct cell types (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref></bold>). Ad1-Ad3 represented a profile of functional mature adipocytes with high expression of insulin signaling genes and lipid metabolism genes, with Ad2 demonstrating particularly robust expression of lipid metabolism genes (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref></bold>). Ad3, along with Ad4, also showed elevated expression of genes associated with cell junction, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and calcium homeostasis (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref></bold>). Ad6 was distinguished by its pronounced expression of genes involved in unfolded protein binding, oxidative stress, cytoskeleton, antigen presentation, and adipokines such as <italic>Lep</italic>, <italic>Retn</italic> and <italic>Rbp4</italic> (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref></bold>).

<p>Adipocytes undergo hypertrophy, an increase in cell size, during obesity, accompanied by significant cytoskeletal rearrangement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, we questioned whether the classification of adipocyte subpopulations aligns with the spectrum of adipocytes during HFD-induced expansion, particularly regarding their size. To address this question, we sought to compare gene expression profiles between large and small adipocytes. Interestingly, we observed enlarged nuclei in hypertrophic adipocytes isolated from HFD-fed mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>), which correlated positively with adipocyte cell size in both fat depots (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></bold>). Leveraging this finding, we profiled the size distribution of adipocyte nuclei, labeled with mCherry and GFP, isolated from NuTRAP mice under different nutritional states using flow cytometry. As indicated by the intensity of mCherry and GFP, eWAT and iWAT from chow-fed mice primarily displayed smaller adipocyte nuclei. In HFD-fed mice, eWAT predominantly contained larger adipocyte nuclei, while iWAT showed a heterogeneous size range from small to large nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref></bold>). Next, we sorted and separately collected adipocyte nuclei by size from the same iWAT of HFD-fed mice for RNA-seq analysis (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6D</xref></bold>) to define the genuine gene expression signature associated with cell/nucleus size, minimizing potential confounding factors such as diet or depot dependency. We identified adipocyte hypertrophy signature genes based on their enrichment in large adipocyte nuclei compared to smaller adipocyte nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></bold>). They also exhibited higher overall expression levels in adipocyte nuclei in iWAT from HFD-fed mice compared to those from chow-fed mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></bold>). When overlaying the expression of these hypertrophy signature genes across adipocyte subpopulations, we observed high expression in Ad3-Ad4 and Ad5-Ad6 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref></bold>), suggesting that they may represent hypertrophic adipocytes. However, certain genes differentiated between Ad3-Ad4 and Ad5-Ad6. For example, <italic>Hdac9</italic> was more enriched in Ad3, while <italic>Pde2a</italic> was in more enriched in Ad5-Ad6 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref></bold>). Importantly, there were marked distinctions in the expression of insulin signaling- and lipid metabolism-related genes between Ad3 and Ad6, with Ad6 having substantially lower gene expression levels (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref></bold>). This implies that Ad3 represents ‘metabolically healthy hypertrophic (MHH)’ adipocytes, while Ad6 represents ‘metabolically unhealthy hypertrophic (MUH)’ adipocytes.</p>
<p>To further discern the obesity-driven dynamics of adipocyte subpopulations, we performed pseudotime trajectory analysis, starting with the Ad1-Ad2 subpopulations that were prevalent under chow conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref></bold>). Two divergent trajectories were revealed: One trajectory moves toward Ad3 and Ad4, which may depict an ‘adaptive healthy transition.’ Conversely, the alternate trajectory progresses towards Ad5 and ultimately to Ad6, indicating a potential ‘maladaptive dysfunctional transition.’ In addition, the farthest position of Ad6 along the pseudotime scale (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref></bold>) indicates prolonged pathological conditions. Importantly, eWAT and iWAT displayed contrasting preferences in adipocyte trajectories during HFD feeding: the dysfunctional trajectory leading to Ad6 was dominant in eWAT while the adaptive trajectory toward Ad3 remained more prevalent in iWAT (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). This supports the depot-dependent dynamics of adipocytes that contribute to distinct metabolic outcomes during obesity.</p>

<title>Adipocyte subpopulations differentially contribute to tissue-level changes during obesity</title>
<p>We next aimed to evaluate the functional role of individual adipocyte subpopulations on tissue-level alterations during obesity. First, we identified genes that were differentially expressed in response to HFD within each subpopulation in eWAT or iWAT. Subsequently, we classified these genes into four clusters based on their pattern of HFD-induced changes across adipocyte subpopulations (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, Table S1</bold>). Gene cluster 1 represented a group of genes generally upregulated by HFD across all subpopulations, with the most significant induction observed in Ad3, followed by Ad4 and Ad2 to a lesser extent. The genes associated with cell junctions, ECM and the cytoskeleton included in this cluster (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>) may describe biological responses during HFD-induced adipose tissue remodeling, which were featured in the aforementioned adaptive transition, among Ad2-Ad4 subpopulations. On the other hand, Gene clusters 2 and 3 comprised genes up- and down-regulated, respectively, with changes most pronounced in Ad6 and to a lesser extent in Ad5, during HFD feeding. The induction of genes in cluster 2, as well as the repression of genes in cluster 3, reflect stress response, inflammation, and cell death in adipose tissues, along with impaired machinery regulating gene expression (e.g., chromatin remodeling and mRNA metabolic process) during HFD-induced adipose pathology (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). Genes in cluster 4, commonly down-regulated by HFD across all adipocyte subpopulations, had enriched metabolic processes such as lipid metabolism, thermogenesis, and insulin phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>), indicating a general decline in metabolic activity and insulin sensitivity across the entire adipocyte population rather than specific subpopulations. Collectively, these results suggest that tissue-level biological changes in adipose tissues during obesity result from a combination of alterations within specific subpopulations and throughout the entire adipocyte population.</p>

<title>Ad6 may represent stressed and dying adipocytes with transcriptional shutdown</title>
<p>Our snRNA-seq data unveiled a previously unrecognized adipocyte subpopulation, Ad6, predominantly present in eWAT during HFD feeding. This subpopulation represented a dysfunctional state of adipocytes, characterized by elevated expression of stress response and inflammation genes, coupled with the loss of metabolic genes. Using the identified profile as a basis, we sought to confirm the presence of the Ad6 adipocyte subpopulation at the tissue level through adipocyte or whole-mount immunostaining. We first visualized reactive oxygen species (ROS) within adipocytes isolated from adipose tissues of chow- or HFD-fed mice using the chemical ROS reporter H2DCFDA. Under HFD conditions, a significantly larger fraction of adipocytes exhibiting ROS was observed, with effects more prominent in eWAT than in iWAT, together with significantly higher intensity (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref></bold>). This provides evidence of Ad6 adipocytes experiencing oxidative stress. Next, we inspected Ad6 adipocytes by employing whole-mount immunostaining of adipose tissues for beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), a marker highly enriched in this subpopulation (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref></bold>). B2M was primarily detected in eWAT under HFD feeding, particularly within crown-like structures (CLS), as well as in the cytoplasm of adipocytes neighboring these CLS (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref></bold>). As dead adipocytes are detected within CLS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, this result suggests Ad6 as stressed and dying cells due to inflammation, both within and outside the CLS. Another hallmark of Ad6 adipocytes was the depletion of genes crucial for lipid metabolism, including PPARγ (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref></bold>). To mitigate the potential for artifacts derived from ambient RNA, we directly visualized PPARγ proteins within adipocytes in adipose tissues through whole-mount immunostaining utilizing NuTRAP mice. While most GFP-labeled adipocyte nuclei robustly expressed PPARγ proteins under typical conditions, a significant proportion of adipocyte nuclei from eWAT in HFD-fed mice lacked PPARγ proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref></bold>), confirming the presence of PPARγ-deficient Ad6 adipocytes in eWAT during obesity. Furthermore, the substantially fewer transcripts, represented by UMIs or genes, detected in the Ad6 subpopulation (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref></bold>), suggests a global loss of gene expression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>snRNA-seq has emerged as an alternative approach to overcome the limitations of scRNA-seq. Nevertheless, technical challenges in obtaining high-quality nuclei and RNA have remained as significant hurdles in the standard protocol. In this study, we present a robust protocol for nucleus isolation that effectively addresses these issues across various tissue types. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we applied it to characterize one of the most challenging tissue types to investigate, adipose tissue. Our snRNA-seq data demonstrates its superior quality compared to previously published datasets, as well as provides novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of mouse adipose tissue remodeling during obesity.</p>
<p>We observed that significant variations in RNase abundance among various tissue types affect the quality of RNA obtained from isolated nuclei using standard protocols. Notably, brain tissue, which has been primarily used in prior snRNA-seq studies, exhibited the lowest RNase activity. This implies that the standard nucleus isolation protocols employed in those studies may not readily translate to other tissues, particularly those with high RNase activities. Recombinant RNase inhibitor proteins are commonly used to control RNA quality during nucleus isolation. However, these inhibitors marginally improved RNA quality, likely due to their specific targeting of certain RNase types, such as RNase A, 1, and T1. Instead, through experiments, we discovered that VRC, a potent inhibitor capable of targeting a wide range of RNases, significantly enhanced RNA quality in isolated nuclei. VRC functions as a transition state analog, binding to the active sites of RNases and inhibiting their enzymatic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Despite its demonstrated versatility in RNA experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, the application of VRC in gene expression studies has been limited due to its inhibitory effects on other RNA enzymes, including reverse transcriptase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Our method addressed this issue by reducing VRC from nucleus isolation buffer prior to loading onto microfluidic devices, as confirmed by the robust qRT-PCR and snRNA-seq results we obtained. Recently, we encountered a few protocols that have been introduced to enhance RNA quality by employing VRC or acidic buffers during nucleus isolation for snRNA-seq, particularly for kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> and pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> samples. However, their applicability to other tissue types remains untested. In contrast, our optimized protocol successfully preserved not only nuclear RNA quality in various tissue types, but also the integrity of the nuclear structure. We noted that VRC has preservative effects on isolated nuclei, resulting in smoother and more intact membranes in larger nuclei when compared to standard protocols not using VRC. This observation aligns with a recent study that demonstrated the preservative properties of VRC, protecting tissue morphology, as well as RNA, protein, and genomic DNA quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. More importantly, we demonstrated the capability of our protocol to retain nuclear RNA quality for up to 24 hours post-tissue processing, even after undergoing additional steps such as FANS. This advancement holds the potential to greatly improve experimental logistics. Considering that snRNA-seq experiments typically require completion of nucleus isolation and loading onto microfluidic devices (e.g., 10X Genomics Chromium controller) within a narrow time window on the same day, our protocol offers greater flexibility for these critical steps, allowing them to be performed on different days if necessary. This adaptability has the potential to unlock a wide array of applications for snRNA-seq techniques. In the clinical setting, for example, this will enable patient biopsies to be collected for diagnostic tests and then be analyzed via snRNA-seq at a different facility.</p>
<p>Our single nucleus atlas of mouse white adipose tissues generally aligns with previous studies while offering deeper insights into depot specificity and cellular composition dynamics during obesity. An important advancement in our dataset was the improved recovery of vascular cell populations, which were underrepresented in prior studies, likely due to our protocol’s effective tissue homogenization and the high quality of RNA preserved in isolated nuclei. This enabled precise characterization of diverse endothelial and related vascular cell types. We observed a marked decrease in capillary endothelial cells in eWAT specifically during HFD feeding, consistent with the previously documented capillary rarefaction and elevated hypoxia associated with adipose tissue expansion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. We further noticed that the VcapEC population, which is responsible for transporting metabolites into the venous circulation, was primarily affected. Additionally, we observed a HFD-induced decline in the LEC population, which plays a role in removing fluid and macromolecules from the interstitial space. These findings suggest that defective drainage of metabolites and molecules into the venous circulation may be another key feature of dysfunctional adipose tissue in obesity, warranting further investigation.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy discovery from our snRNA-seq data was gaining deep insights into the spectrum of adipocyte subpopulations and their dynamics during obesity. Based on our observation of a strong correlation between adipocyte cell size and nucleus size, we developed a novel approach to profile the size distribution of adipocyte subpopulations using nuclei as surrogates, which yielded intriguing findings. Adipocyte cell size appeared small and relatively uniform under chow conditions in both eWAT and iWAT. During HFD feeding, adipocytes notably enlarged, particularly in eWAT, whereas iWAT exhibited a broader distribution with a mixture of small and large adipocytes. Therefore, by isolating adipocyte nuclei of various sizes from iWAT, we identified gene signatures that determine adipocyte hypertrophy. Overlaying this data with snRNA-seq data revealed that cell size is a key determinant of adipocyte clustering in mice. This finding contrasts with the heterogeneity of human adipocytes, where insulin sensitivity is shown to be a primary factor in adipocyte classification rather than cell size, as demonstrated by spatial transcriptomics mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>ex vivo</italic> differentiated human adipocytes derived from various donors displayed distinct cellular phenotypes, consistent with the heterogeneity in adipocyte subpopulations identified by snRNA-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. This suggests that the significant genetic variation among humans, potentially serving as a major driver of adipocyte clustering, overrides the size-dependent differences found in inbred mouse strains with homogeneous genetic backgrounds. Nevertheless, our findings integrate various characteristics of adipocytes reported from diverse biological contexts, broadening our understanding of distinct adipocyte subpopulations. For instance, despite both Ad1 and Ad2 subpopulations having small cell size and abundance under chow conditions, they exhibited distinct expression levels of lipid metabolism genes. This finding may be consistent with previous studies demonstrating mosaic lipid transport activity among small white adipocytes from <italic>Rhesus Macaques</italic> monkeys<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Also, the unique enrichment of genes involved in calcium transport and ossification in hypertrophic Ad4 adipocytes may account for the frequent occurrence of calcium deposits observed in obese adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We further noted two distinct types of hypertrophic adipocytes developed by HFD feeding: MHH adipocytes (Ad3) abundant in iWAT, and MUH adipocytes (Ad6) prevalent in eWAT. We not only validated the presence of MUH adipocytes, primarily around CLS in obese eWAT with oxidative stress and inflammation markers, but discovered their potential association with prolonged obesity through pseudotime analysis. Interestingly, MUH adipocytes showed deficient expression of the master transcriptional regulator PPARγ as well as a substantial decline in metabolic gene expression. The significant decrease in transcript counts in Ad6 suggests that these cells may represent stressed or dying cells, akin to the ‘stressed lipid-scavenging’ adipocytes described by Sávári et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. This also aligns with our earlier findings, which demonstrated the failure of adipocytes to maintain their identity during obesity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Note that these cells may pose challenges for reliable detection due to severely compromised RNA contents. This highlights the effectiveness and precision of our robust snRNA-seq methodology, which could be valuable for profiling other disease states with impaired cell viability and gene expression.</p>
<p>Lastly, we elucidated the contribution of distinct adipocyte subpopulations to various established signatures of obese adipose tissue. For instance, Ad2-Ad4 adipocytes appeared to undergo tissue remodeling for enhanced adipose functionality, such as storage capacity. In contrast, the traditional features of dysfunctional adipose tissue, including inflammation, cell death, and stress response, were predominantly derived from Ad5-Ad6 adipocytes. They were also responsible for chromatin alterations and defective gene expression. On the other hand, the core functions of adipocytes, including lipid metabolism and insulin signaling, were generally impaired in all adipocyte subpopulations. The distinctions between obesity-induced features occurring in the entire adipocyte population versus specific adipocyte subpopulations may explain the outstanding effectiveness of PPARγ agonists, such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), in improving adipose function and glucose homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, surpassing the effects of other anti-inflammatory or anti-stress reagents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Our discovery emphasizes the need to tailor therapeutic approaches based on the specific biological processes to be targeted to improve adipose tissue function during obesity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study introduces a robust nucleus isolation method for snRNA-seq, leading to enhanced data quality. This advancement has enabled the discovery of novel insights into the dynamics of adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. In addition, this method holds great promise for widespread applications across various research fields and clinical diagnoses, involving numerous types of biological samples.</p>

<title>Animal studies</title>
<p>All animal experiments were performed according to a protocol approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The mice were housed under a 12h light-dark cycle at 22 °C with free access to food and water. To label adipocyte nuclei, NuTRAP mice (Jackson Laboratory, 029899) were crossed with Adipoq-Cre mice (Jackson Laboratory, 010803). In experiments assessing nuclear RNA quality, male C57BL/6J mice at 8-10 weeks of age were used for tissue collection. To generate dietinduced obesity models, male mice were subjected to either a HFD (60% kcal from fat, Research Diets D12492i) or a standard chow diet (control) from eight weeks of age for a duration of 10 weeks. Upon dissection, tissues were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. During the dissection of eWAT, we carefully removed epididymal ducts from the adipose tissues, minimizing the risk of contamination. For iWAT, the lymph nodes were removed to avoid over-representation of lymphocytes.</p>

<title>Nucleus isolation</title>
<p>For each experiment, the nucleus preparation buffer (NPB) was freshly prepared at room temperature with the following components: 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 250 mM sucrose, 0.1% NP-40, and 1 mM DTT. Next, vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (VRC; New England Biolabs) was added to the NPB at a concentration of 10 mM. The mixture was vigorously vortexed until the VRC was completely dissolved in the NPB. The NPB with VRC was then chilled on ice, and 0.4 U/µl of NxGen RNase inhibitor (Biosearch Technologies) and 1X Halt protease inhibitor (Thermo Fisher) were added. Once the NPB was ready, frozen tissue samples were pulverized using mortars and pestles in liquid nitrogen. The resulting tissue powders were immediately transferred to and homogenized in chilled Douncers placed on ice, using 5-7 ml of the NPB. The tissue homogenates were filtered through 100 µm cell strainers and centrifuged at 200 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. After removing the supernatant, the nucleus pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of PBS-N-VRC, which is calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% NP-40 and 5 mM VRC. Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher) was added to the tissue homogenates at a concentration of 1 µg/ml to label nuclei. The mixture was then centrifuged at 200 g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Subsequently, the nucleus pellets were resuspended in PBS-N-VRC buffer and filtered through 40 µm cell strainers. The protocol for nucleus isolation is currently under the provisional patent application process.</p>

<title>Nuclear RNA extraction for quality analysis</title>
<p>The nucleus resuspension in PBS-N-VRC was centrifuged at 200 g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was discarded. To reduce VRC amount, the nucleus pellet was resuspended in PBS-N (PBS with 0.1% NP-40), and then centrifuged again at 200 g for 10 minutes. After removing the supernatant, the nucleus pellet was subjected to RNA extraction using TRIzol as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the nucleus pellet was thoroughly resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen) by vigorous vortexing and subsequently mixed with chloroform. Following centrifugation at 13,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C, the aqueous phase was collected and combined with isopropanol and 1.5 µg of GlycoBlue coprecipitant (Invitrogen). After a 10-minute incubation at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and then dried. Subsequently, the pellet was resuspended in nuclease-free water, and the RNA concentration was measured using a Qubit Fluorometer with the Qubit RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Invitrogen). The quality of the RNA was assessed using a high sensitivity electrophoresis system, the Agilent Bioanalyzer. Since the automatically generated RNA integrity number (RIN) provided by the system did not accurately reflect the quality of nuclear RNA due to the presence of a substantial amount of small RNA molecules, we opted for a qualitative analysis of the RNA quality. For time-course experiments to assess RNA quality over time, the nuclear suspension in PBS-N-VRC was kept at 4 °C for the indicated duration prior to RNA extraction.</p>
<p>For visual inspection of nucleus quality, the nucleus resuspension was mounted on hemacytometer and visualized using a Zeiss Observer.Z1 fluorescence microscope using bright field and DAPI filters.</p>

<title>snRNA-seq with nucleus sorting</title>
<p>The nucleus resuspension in PBS-N-VRC was subjected to nucleus sorting using a BD FACSAria Fusion system. We set gating based on forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), and Hoechst fluorescence to eliminate debris and nucleus doublets/multiplets. Sorted nuclei were collected in PBS-N-VRC, then centrifuged at 200 g for 10 minutes at 4°C using a swing bucket rotator. After removing the supernatant, the nucleus pellet was resuspended in PBS-N, filtered through 20 µm cell strainers, and centrifuged at 200 g for 5 minutes at 4°C in a swing bucket rotator. Subsequent to removing the supernatant, the nucleus pellet was resuspended in PBS-N in volumes aimed at achieving a nucleus density of approximately 1000 nuclei/µl. The nuclei in the resuspension were counted using a hematocytometer or automated cell counters. Following the counting, 16,000 nuclei (with a target of 10,000) were loaded onto the 10x Genomics Chromium controller. Libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v3.3 (10x Genomics), indexed using sample barcodes, and subsequently sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer with paired-end dual indexing.</p>

<title>Bulk nuclear RNA-seq with nucleus sorting</title>
<p>For bulk nuclear RNA-seq, nuclei were sorted based on the aforementioned gating criteria following isolation. Sorted nuclei were washed in PBS-N as for snRNA-seq but skipping additional filtration. Nuclear RNA was extraction using TRIzol as stated above. Additionally, the extracted RNA was purified by on-column DNA digestion using TURBO DNase kit (Invitrogen). For library construction, 20-50 ng of purified RNA was processed by NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (New England BioLabs, Inc.) for removing ribosomal RNA, Next the RNA was converted to cDNA using Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and NEBNext mRNA Second Strand Synthesis kit. Following purification based on size selection using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), sequencing libraries were generated through tagmentation using Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit and subsequent PCR amplification. The quantity and quality of the resulting libraries were assessed using Qubit and Agilent Bioanalyzer, respectively. Finally, the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500.</p>

<p>Fresh adipose tissues were minced and digested in PBS containing collagenase D (1.5 U/ml) and dispase II (2.4 U/ml) with shaking for 30-40 min at 37°C. After digestion, the tissue homogenates were filtered through 250 µm cell strainers and left to settle for 10 min. Floating adipocytes were collected, washed in PBS containing 1% fat-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubated with H2DCFDA (Invitrogen, 20 uM) and Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The cells were washed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 and 0.1% fat-free BSA twice, placed on a chamber made on slides using 90% glycerol, and covered with coverslips.

<p>Data was processed using Cell Ranger (10x Genomics, v7.1.0) to demultiplex raw sequencing reads to FASTQ format files, align them to the mm10 reference genome, and perform filtering, barcode counting, and UMI counting. CellBender v0.3.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> was applied to remove counts from ambient/background RNA. The CellBender output files (.h5 format) were read into R (version 4.3.1) using Seurat 4.3.0, and each sample was further filtered prior to downstream analyses based on the number of UMIs (ζ 500) and genes (ζ 250), mitochondrial ratio (&lt; 15%), and the number of genes detected per UMI (&gt; 0.8). At the gene level, genes detected less than 10 nuclei and mitochondrial genes were filtered.

<title>Integration, clustering, annotation, and subclustering</title>
<p>Gene counts were first normalized using <italic>SCTransform</italic>, and regressed on mitochondrial read ratio and cell cycle score by Seurat.

As a result, clusters were annotated as adipocytes, APC, mesothelial cells, endothelial cells, PC/SMC, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, T cells, and B cells using their marker genes. For further investigation, the integrated data was subdivided into separate objects by cell type and reclustered to achieve higher resolutions, with minimal additional filtering applied to potential doublets. To understand distinct functionality of subclusters, if needed pathway analysis was performed on the marker genes using clusterProfiler v4.8.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.

<p>This study employs a modified protocol for single-nuclei RNA sequencing of adipose tissue that preserves RNA quality and nuclei integrity. Using this protocol, the study provides <bold>valuable</bold> insights into the cellular heterogeneity and molecular landscape of murine adipose tissue from lean mice and mice with diet-induced obesity. The study is <bold>solid</bold> in its approach and analysis, providing a comprehensive description of a dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocyte subpopulation that emerges in association with obesity.</p>

<p>This manuscript from So et al. describes what is suggested to be an improved protocol for single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of adipose tissue. The authors provide evidence that modifications to the existing protocols result in better RNA quality and nuclei integrity than previously observed, with ultimately greater coverage of the transcriptome upon sequencing. Using the modified protocol, the authors compare the cellular landscape of murine inguinal and perigonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) depots harvested from animals fed a standard chow diet (lean mice) or those fed a high-fat diet (mice with obesity).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is well-written, and the data are clearly presented. The strengths of the manuscript rest in the description of an improved protocol for snRNA-seq analysis. This should be valuable for the growing number of investigators in the field of adipose tissue biology that are utilizing snRNA-seq technology, as well as those other fields attempting similar experiments with tissues possessing high levels of RNAse activity.</p>
<p>Moreover, the study makes some notable observations that provide the foundation for future investigation. One observation is the correlation between nuclei size and cell size, allowing for the transcriptomes of relatively hypertrophic adipocytes in perigonadal WAT to be examined. Another notable observation is the identification of an adipocyte subcluster (Ad6) that appears &quot;stressed&quot; or dysfunctional and likely localizes to crown-like inflammatory structures where pro-inflammatory immune cells reside.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Analogous studies have been reported in the literature, including a notable study from Savari et al. (Cell Metabolism). This somewhat diminishes the novelty of some of the biological findings presented here. Moreover, a direct comparison of the transcriptomic data derived from the new vs. existing protocols (i.e. fully executed side by side) was not presented. As such, the true benefit of the protocol modifications cannot be fully understood.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present manuscript So et al utilize single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize cell populations in lean and obese adipose tissues.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors utilize a modified nuclear isolation protocol incorporating VRC that results in higher-quality sequencing reads compared with previous studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The use of VRC to enhance snRNA-seq has been previously published in other tissues. The snRNA-seq snRNA-seq data sets presented in this manuscript, when compared with numerous previously published single-cell analyses of adipose tissue, do not represent a significant scientific advance.</p>
<p>Figure 1-3: The snRNA-seq data obtained by the authors using their enhanced protocol does not represent a significant improvement in cell profiling for the majority of the highlighted cell types including APCs, macrophages, and lymphocytes. These cell populations have been extensively characterized by cytoplasmic scRNA-seq which can achieve sufficient sequencing depth, and thus this study does not contribute meaningful additional insight into these cell types. The authors note an increase in the number of rare endothelial cell types recovered, however this is not translated into any kind of functional analysis of these populations.</p>
<p>Figure 4: The authors did not provide any evidence that the relative fluorescent brightness of GFP and mCherry is a direct measure of the nuclear size, and the nuclear size is only a moderate correlation with the cell size. Thus sorting the nuclei based on GFP/mCherry brightness is not a great proxy for adipocyte diameter. Furthermore, no meaningful insights are provided about the functional significance of the reported transcriptional differences between small and large adipocyte nuclei.</p>
<p>Figure 5-6: The Ad6 population is highly transcriptionally analogous to the mAd3 population from Emont et al, and is thus not a novel finding. Furthermore, in the present data set, the authors conclude that Ad6 are likely stressed/dying hypertrophic adipocytes with a global loss of gene expression, which is a well-documented finding in eWAT &gt; iWAT, for which the snRNA-seq reported in the present manuscript does not provide any novel scientific insight.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to improve single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to address current limitations and challenges with nuclei and RNA isolation quality. They successfully developed a protocol that enhances RNA preservation and yields high-quality snRNA-seq data from multiple tissues, including a challenging model of adipose tissue. They then applied this method to eWAT and iWAT from mice fed either a normal or high-fat diet, exploring depot-specific cellular dynamics and gene expression changes during obesity. Their analysis included subclustering of SVF cells and revealed that obesity promotes a transition in APCs from an early to a committed state and induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype in immune cells, particularly in eWAT. In addition to SVF cells, they discovered six adipocyte subpopulations characterized by a gradient of unique gene expression signatures. Interestingly, a novel subpopulation, termed Ad6, comprised stressed and dying adipocytes with reduced transcriptional activity, primarily found in eWAT of mice on a high-fat diet. Overall, the methodology is sound, the writing is clear, and the conclusions drawn are supported by the data presented. Further research based on these findings could pave the way for potential novel interventions in obesity and metabolic disorders, or for similar studies in other tissues or conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• The authors developed a robust snRNA-seq technique that preserves the integrity of the nucleus and RNA across various tissue types, overcoming the challenges of existing methods.</p>
<p>• They identified adipocyte subpopulations that follow adaptive or pathological trajectories during obesity.</p>
<p>• The study reveals depot-specific differences in adipose tissues, which could have implications for targeted therapies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• The adipose tissues were collected after 10 weeks of high-fat diet treatment, lacking the intermediate time points for identifying early markers or cell populations during the transition from healthy to pathological adipose tissue.</p>
<p>• The expansion of the Ad6 subpopulation in obese iWAT and gWAT is interesting. The author claims that Ad6 exhibited a substantial increase in eWAT and a moderate rise in iWAT (Figure 4C). However, this adipocyte subpopulation remains the most altered in iWAT upon obesity. Could the authors elaborate on why there is a scarcity of adipocytes with ROS reporter and B2M in obese iWAT?</p>
<p>• While the study provides extensive data on mouse models, the potential translation of these findings to human obesity remains uncertain.</p>
