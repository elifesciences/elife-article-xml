<title>Abstract</title><p>A central feature of mechanotransduction is the ability of mechanosensitive channels to respond to mechanical stimuli from the surrounding lipid bilayer. Accordingly, the mechanical properties of membranes should play an important role in modulating force transmission to embedded channels, yet the nature of this relationship remains unclear for a wide class of mechanosensitive channels across prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. Here, we use a synthetic amphiphile to modulate the membrane mechanical properties of cell-derived vesicles and probe channel activation. Using precise membrane mechanical characterization approaches that have rarely been used in conjunction with electrophysiology techniques, we directly characterize three membrane properties and the activation threshold of the <italic>E. coli</italic> mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). Our study reveals that decreases in the membrane area expansion modulus, K<sub>A</sub>, and bending rigidity, k<sub>c</sub>, correlate with increases in the pressure required to activate MscL and that this effect is reproducible with the mammalian channel, TREK-1. MD simulations demonstrate that polymer-mediated changes in interfacial tension is the best mechanism to describe these experimental results. Together, our results bolster the <italic>force-from-lipids</italic> mechanism by demonstrating the generality of the relationship between changes in specific membrane mechanical properties and the gating pressure of MscL and TREK-1. In addition, our results reveal the mechanical mechanism by which membrane amphiphiles alter the activity and sensitivity of mechanosensitive channels through changes in long-range force transmission.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mechanosensitive channels are a class of membrane proteins which are found in all domains of life and play important roles ranging from cellular volume regulation to touch and hearing sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brohawn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cox et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dave et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">del Mármol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Procko et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vásquez et al., 2014</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Many mechanosensitive channels are thought to transduce mechanical forces into biochemical signals by opening or closing in response to tension in the lipid bilayer, referred to as the <italic>force-from-lipids</italic> mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Guo and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Martinac et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Reddy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ridone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Teng et al., 2015</xref>). Through this mechanism, mechanosensitive channels are proposed to be affected by long-range mechanical forces in the membrane that affect the bilayer lateral pressure profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anishkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bruno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cordero-Morales and Vásquez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pliotas and Naismith, 2017</xref>). As membrane tension can propagate distances of tens of microns within seconds in motile cells and axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Houk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Shi et al., 2022</xref>), and the diffusion of tension relies directly on membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cohen and Shi, 2020</xref>), lipid components that alter membrane mechanical properties should alter force transmission within a membrane and impact the activation of embedded mechanosensitive channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Johnson, 2015</xref>). Toward this idea, others have demonstrated the relationship between membrane composition and mechanosensitive channel function and have shown that changes in membrane composition may modulate force propagation to embedded channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Caires et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Nakayama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ridone et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, because different amphiphiles have different effects on mechanosensitive channel activity, the mechanism of their action and the role of membrane mechanical properties on channel activity remains unclear.</p>
<p>To date, it has been difficult to directly resolve the role of membrane mechanical properties in mechanosensitive channel activation for two key reasons. The first is that certain membrane mechanical properties are difficult to experimentally measure. The second is that it can be difficult to significantly change specific membrane properties using lipids alone to isolate or probe their impact on channel activation. Toward the former, a variety of studies have reported that the alteration of membrane properties, through changes in membrane composition, affects mechanosensitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anishkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Balleza, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bruno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Caires et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lundbæk et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Ridone et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Romero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Xue et al., 2020</xref>). Through these studies, the impact of various membrane properties such as area expansion modulus (K<sub>A</sub>), the extent to which the membrane stretches in response to tension, bending stiffness (k<sub>c</sub>), the energy required to bend and smooth thermal fluctuations in a membrane, fluidity, a measure of viscosity or the lateral diffusion of lipids in a membrane, and hydrophobic thickness, the length of the hydrophobic core of the membrane, have been proposed to play a role in mechanosensitive channel behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Caires et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Nakayama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ridone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Romero et al., 2019</xref>). However, an important knowledge gap is that most of these studies have relied on published estimates of membrane properties or used methods which measure the bulk property of cell membranes, which includes contributions from cytoskeletal mechanics. To better understand how membrane properties affect mechanosensitive channel activation, it would be useful to experimentally probe channel activity in plasma membranes devoid of a cytoskeleton, for example, by using cell-derived, giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) as a model system. Toward the second reason, the direct role of certain membrane mechanical properties on mechanosensitive channel behavior has been difficult to discern in the presence of purely natural lipids. For example, phospholipids, which are the most abundant class of lipids in living systems, impart only small changes to the area expansion modulus of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rawicz et al., 2000</xref>)— a physical property which is expected to play a significant role in the activation of channels regulated by a <italic>force-from-lipids</italic> mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiggins and Phillips, 2005</xref>). The effect of such small changes on mechanosensitive channel behavior is often difficult to detect or distinguish from changes in other membrane properties. However, non-natural amphiphiles, such as the plastics family referred to as poloxamers, can often alter membrane properties to a greater extent than natural lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bermudez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jacobs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rawicz et al., 2000</xref>). By using GPMVs and incorporating membrane amphiphiles that change the membrane properties in unique and amplified ways, we hypothesized that we could better distinguish the impact of specific properties on protein function.</p>
<p>Here, we experimentally reveal a membrane property that exerts significant influence on the gating of a mechanosensitive channel: interfacial tension. By studying the relationship between membrane properties associated with interfacial tension (e.g., membrane elasticity, and bending rigidity) and the pressure required to activate mechanosensitive channels expressed in mammalian U2OS cells, we validate a hypothesized but not yet confirmed role of interfacial tension in mechanosensitive channel activation. We first establish this relationship for <italic>E. coli</italic> MscL by using U2OS-derived GPMVs, poloxamer analogues, voltage-clamp electrophysiology studies, and a series of mechanical characterization techniques, and we subsequently extend these findings to the mammalian mechanosensitive channel TREK-1. Further, we performed MD simulations to probe the impact of poloxamers on bilayer properties and found that polymer-mediated modulation of interfacial tension is a likely mechanism driving changes in channel activity. Our results highlight a critical role of membrane amphiphiles in indirectly regulating channel activity via changes in the bulk biophysical properties of membranes, with important implications in defining a mechanism of force-sensing in various living systems from bacterial to neuronal mechanotransduction. As poloxamers are a class of nanoplastic, we comment on the potential impact of nanoplastics on cellular health through interaction with cellular membranes.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Toward the goal of understanding the relationship between membrane amphiphiles and membrane force-transmission to embedded proteins, we prepared channel-containing GPMVs which allow for both assessment of mechanosensitive ion channel activity and membrane mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Steinkühler et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">2019</xref>). GPMVs not only incorporate membrane proteins of interest, but also maintain biological membrane composition and have an overall larger size (&gt;5 µm) required for mechanical characterization via micropipette aspiration, while excluding organelles and cytoskeletal structures that might interfere with measurements of membrane mechanical properties, as in live cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Keller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Levental et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Steinkühler et al., 2019</xref>). We chose to first focus on the activity of the well-studied Mechanosensitive Channel of Large Conductance (MscL) in GPMVs. This channel opens when the membrane is stretched to permit molecules to flow across the membrane; channel activity can therefore be measured using electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, we used a gain of function MscL missense mutation, G22S, as opposed to MscL wild-type (WT), due to the lower activation threshold of the former which increased the number of GPMVs with pressure-gated MscL currents (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heureaux et al., 2014</xref>). We created U2OS cell lines stably expressing an MscL-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein (<xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 2</xref>), and induced GPMV formation by adding a vesiculation agent (<xref rid="figs1c" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>). We elected to use N-ethlymaleimide (NEM) rather than the more commonly used paraformaldehyde/dithiothreitol (PFA/DTT) formulation as the latter results in crosslinking of membrane components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sezgin et al., 2012</xref>) and may prevent mechanosensitive channel activation (<xref rid="figs1d" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4</xref>). This method also enables the incorporation of membrane additives to modulate membrane mechanical properties (<xref rid="figs1e" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 5</xref>). The addition of this agent resulted in GPMVs containing MscL visualized by GFP fluorescence and that were an appropriate size for micropipette aspiration measurements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>A) Schematic representation of GPMV formation. Human bone osteosarcoma epithelial cells (U2OS) expressing MscLGFP were treated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) vesiculation agent to form GPMVs that contain MscLGFP. In certain cases, exogenous amphiphiles, such as poloxamers, were added to U2OS cells during the vesiculation process to generate GPMVs with modified membrane compositions. B) Microscopy images of GPMVs from non-transfected cells (bottom) or GPMVs from cells transfected with MscLG22S tagged with GFP (top). DIC images (left) and GFP epifluorescence (right) are shown. The scale bar is 10 μM. C) Representative electrophysiology traces of MscL pressure sensitivity over time. MscLG22S (top) recordings show MscL activation in response to pressure ramp (bottom). MscL activation sensitivity is defined as the pressure at which the first MscL channel activates (ex.∼65 mmHg for the shown GPMV). GPMVs from non-transfected cells (no MscL) exhibit no change in current in response to pressure (middle). Recordings were performed at -10 mV in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2. Pipette internal solution consists of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 100 mM NaMES, 10 mM Na4BAPTA, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA. D) Example MscLG22S single channel events recorded from GPMVs derived from U2OS cells at different voltages. E) Resulting single channel current-voltage relationship used in determination of the MscLG22S conductance. The current amplitude at each voltage (shown in D) is plotted and the slope of the linear fit was used to determine channel conductance. MscLG22S conductance is 1.113 nS (95% confidence 1.020 to 1.207 nS), n = 17 individual recordings at various holding potentials.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>We next characterized our MscL-containing, GPMV system to confirm it retained key features of MscL function. We first validated the presence of MscLG22S in GPMVs via fluorescence microscopy using a C-terminal GFP tag, which was observable in our GPMV membranes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Following this confirmation, we assessed MscLG22S activation sensitivity using patch-clamp electrophysiology techniques with an integrated pressure controller and quantified MscLG22S sensitivity using the pressure at first channel opening (<xref rid="figs1f" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>). We applied a pressure ramp that reached suction pressures above 160 mmHg and observed pressure-induced channel activation in our GPMVs that contained MscLG22S, while no currents were observed in our control GPMVs which lacked MscLG22S (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1g" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 7</xref>). We measured channel conductance by quantifying the current through individual MscLG22S channels under different voltages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We found the conductance of <italic>E. coli</italic> MscLG22S and MscLWT to be ∼1 nS in GPMVs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1B</xref>), which is similar to published values of MscL conductance in mammalian cells [∼2 nS] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Doerner et al., 2012</xref>) and bacterial membranes [∼ 3 nS] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Sukharev et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">1994</xref>). In addition, we confirmed that MscLG22S was sensitive to membrane composition in our GPMV platform through the addition of a small inverted cone shaped amphiphile, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) as described previously (<xref rid="figs1h" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 8</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>). These observations confirmed that the stochastic channel currents we observed were due to pressure-induced MscLG22S activation and that MscLG22S is sensitive to membrane composition in GPMVs, similar to other membrane platforms. This is also, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration that MscL activity can be recapitulated in GPMVs, further supporting a bilayer-mediated gating of the channel as originally shown in liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sukharev et al., 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Poloxamer P124 reduces the pressure-sensitivity of MscL</title>
<p>After characterizing the behavior of MscLG22S in unmodified GPMVs, we next set out to modify the membrane composition to determine the effect of various membrane mechanical properties on MscLG22S activation sensitivity. To modulate membrane properties, we used a poloxamer, which is an amphiphilic triblock copolymer that can integrate into bilayer membranes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Großkopf et al., 2021</xref>). We included increasing amounts of poloxamer 124 (P124) in the buffer during GPMV formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and measured MscLG22S activation pressure in the vesicles using patch-clamp electrophysiology. To confirm that poloxamers can integrate into the membrane, we used MALDI-MS and observed that two types of selected poloxamers, P124 and P188, integrate into membranes (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). Using microscopy, we found that poloxamer addition in certain cases increases GPMV diameter and surface area (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we found that P124 increases GPMV stability as determined by resistance to rupture, consistent with previous studies (<xref rid="figs2c" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Calori et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these results suggest that poloxamer readily integrates into GPMV membranes.</p>

B) MscLG22S activation is desensitized in the presence of P124. MscLG22S activation is defined here as the pressure where the first MscLG22S channel is activated. The pressure at first channel opening was measured for GPMVs prepared in solutions containing 0 – 0.1% wt/vol P124, n ≥ 13 independent GPMVs were recorded. C) Images of micropipette aspiration of GPMVs measuring membrane mechanical properties. Micropipette aspiration is used to measure membrane areal changes in response to applied tension. The area expansion modulus (K<sub>A</sub>) and bending rigidity (k<sub>c</sub>) of GPMV membranes treated with poloxamer were measured. D) Sample aspiration curve from a micropipette aspiration experiment. A stress-strain curve was plotted to calculate K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> of GPMV membranes using micropipette aspiration techniques at high and low tension, respectively.

<p>We found that MscLG22S required higher pressures to activate when GPMVs contained P124 and this response was monotonic with increasing poloxamer concentration, indicating that P124 decreased the sensitivity of MscLG22S (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). To further evaluate MscLG22S sensitivity in the presence of P124, we quantified the percent of GPMVs that contained MscLG22S currents out of all recorded GPMVs which exhibited GFP fluorescence. In this quantification, we only monitored currents up to a maximum pressure above -80 mmHg, under which we would normally expect MscLG22S activation in a poloxamer-free membrane. We found in GPMVs with the highest buffer concentration of P124 (0.1% wt/vol), only ∼20% of GPMV recordings contained active MscLG22S currents, indicating that MscLG22S was not activating in ∼80% of GPMVs prepared in high concentrations of P124 (<xref rid="figs2d" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 4</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the pressure sensitivity of MscLG22S is reduced in the presence of P124 and increases in P124 content eventually leads to a large fraction of channels failing to productively open.</p>
<p>We then investigated how P124 altered GPMV mechanical properties. Using micropipette aspiration techniques, we measured the area expansion modulus (K<sub>A</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jacobs et al., 2021</xref>) and bending rigidity (k<sub>c</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rawicz et al., 2000</xref>) of GPMVs treated with P124 for greater than 4 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, D; <xref rid="figs2e" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 5</xref>). We found that membrane K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> decreased with increasing P124 concentration in the buffer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, F). We then measured P124 fluidity using fluorescence anisotropy techniques and did not observe a significant change in membrane fluidity in the presence of P124 (<xref rid="figs2f" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 6</xref>).</p>
<p>We wondered how these changes in mechanical properties induced by P124 may affect mechanosensitive channel behavior. To assess this relationship, we plotted MscLG22S activation pressure as a function of each of these membrane mechanical property measurements and found that decreases in membrane K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> correlate with commensurate increases in MscLG22S activation pressure, r = -0.89 and -0.99, respectively (<xref rid="figs2g" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 7</xref>). These results suggest that the reduced sensitivity of MscLG22S to pressure in the presence of P124 may be related to the alteration of specific membrane mechanical properties.</p>

<title>Various poloxamers and a detergent reveal a correlation between K<sub>A</sub>, k<sub>c</sub> and MscL activation sensitivity</title>
<p>To further explore the generality of the relationship between membrane mechanical properties and MscLG22S activation sensitivity, we used a chemically distinct detergent and an expanded set of poloxamers. We selected the detergent C12E8, which is known to decrease membrane K<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jacobs et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Otten et al., 2000</xref>), and measured the effect of this molecule on MscLG22S activation sensitivity. Similar to our results in the presence of P124, C12E8 increased the pressure required to activate MscLG22S (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>) although C12E8 did not depress the percent of active channels to the same extent as P124 (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>). We then measured the mechanical properties of GPMVs treated with C12E8 and confirmed that this molecule has a softening effect on membranes, reducing the K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C, D, E</xref>). We then measured the effect of other poloxamers with similar chemical structures but differing molecular weights on MscLG22S pressure sensitivity and membrane mechanical properties (<xref rid="figs1e" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref rid="figs3b" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs3c" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We plotted the activation pressure of MscLG22S as a function of K<sub>A</sub>, k<sub>c</sub>, and fluidity for each of the amphiphiles in which we measured both MscLG22S activation and membrane properties and found similar trends as when we evaluated these relationships for each amphiphile individually (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="figs3d" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref rid="figs2g" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 7</xref>).

Taken together, these results confirm that MscLG22S behavior is sensitive to changes in membrane composition and properties where conditions with reduced K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> generally correlate with a reduction in the pressure sensitivity of MscLG22S (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>P124 does not alter MscL activity through pore occlusion or changes in membrane thickness but may function through reduction in interfacial tension</title>
<p>We sought to understand the mechanism behind amphiphile-induced changes in MscLG22S activation sensitivity, and we elected to rule out the possibility that P124 modulates MscLG22S through a mechanism other than altering membrane mechanical properties. We first hypothesized that P124 could modulate MscLG22S through pore occlusion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). As MscLG22S conductance depends directly on pore size when measured in identical buffer conditions, a decrease in conductance would be expected if P124 resides within the MscLG22S pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rokitskaya et al., 2017</xref>). We measured the conductance of MscLG22S in the presence of increasing amounts of P124 and found that MscLG22S conductance was not affected by P124 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, C). We included C12E8 as a control which is chemically distinct from poloxamer and would therefore not be expected to interact with MscLG22S in the same way and found that C12E8 also did not affect MscLG22S conductance. Together, these observations suggest that P124 and C12E8 do not reside within the MscLG22S pore while in the active conformation.</p>

<p>A) Poloxamers could prevent MscLG22S activation through pore occlusion. B) MscLG22S pore size, as inferred by conductance calculations, does not change in the presence of P124. MscLG22S conductance in the presence of P124 is plotted; the slope of the linear fit was used to determine channel conductance. C12E8 serves as a non-polymeric control. C) MscLG22S conductance quantification in the presence of P124 and C12E8. Mean conductance and 95% confidence interval are plotted from the linear fit shown in (B). D) Chemical activation of MscLG22C.

DIC images show GPMV outline. E) P124 does not prevent MscL activation. GPMVs containing MscLG22C were formed in the presence of various P124 concentrations as indicated. Fluo4 fluorescence was quantified after GPMV incubation with MTSET and 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and is plotted as integrated intensity / vesicle area.

</fig>
<p>To further address the possibility that P124 alters MscL activation through pore occlusion, we measured the propensity of P124 to alter activation of a chemically-inducible mutant of MscL that is insensitive to pressure. A mutation within the pore of MscL serves as a hydrophobic gate (G22C) which can be activated by the addition of [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), a chemical which forcibly hydrates the pore by introducing charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Yoshimura et al., 2001</xref>). We hypothesized that if P124 occluded the MscL pore, MTSET would be unable to open the MscLG22C channel. To assess MscLG22C opening in GPMVs upon MTSET binding, we monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via a fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, Fluo4. We first validated this assay by ensuring that internal vesicle fluorescence, indicating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, increased only in the presence of the chemically activatable mutant of MscL G22C, and not the pressure sensitive mutant G22S, when MTSET was present (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). We also confirmed MscLG22C’s lack of pressure sensitivity (<xref rid="figs4b" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Levin and Blount, 2004</xref>). We then determined if MscLG22C chemical activation was altered by P124 addition by quantifying the internal fluorescence of GPMVs containing P124 in the presence of MTSET. This assay showed that P124 did not inhibit MscLG22C activation relative to the no P124 control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) and all conditions resulted in small but detectable increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced fluorescence relative to the MTSET-insensitive control. Taken together, these results suggest that P124 does not occlude the MscL pore.</p>
<p>Another potential mechanism by which MscLG22S activation could be altered in the presence of P124 is through increased membrane thickness (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). MscL is known to be sensitive to membrane thickness where thinner membranes reduce the gating threshold of MscL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ridone et al., 2018</xref>) and thicker membranes desensitize MscL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ridone et al., 2018</xref>). We do not expect membrane thickness to be increased in the presence of poloxamer based on our bending rigidity measurements, because the reduced k<sub>c</sub> values suggest a decreased membrane thickness (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To further investigate this hypothesis, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to measure changes in membrane thickness, surface area, and K<sub>A</sub> after P124 incubation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Our simulations demonstrated that P124 inserts into the bilayer and this integration increases surface area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>) and reduces membrane K<sub>A</sub> (<xref rid="figs4c" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 3</xref>) but does not alter membrane thickness significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>).</p>
<p>To better understand how polymers affect the mechanical properties of our membranes, we simulated the effect of mechanical tension on P124-containing lipid membranes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, 4K).</p>
<p>At zero tension, the polyoxyethylene (PEO) hydrophilic groups of the polymer protrude deeply into the water phase, resulting in an extended, “PEGylated” lipid bilayer. The conformation of the polymer changes with applied tension. Specifically, we observed that PEO obtains a more compact conformation “focused” at the lipid-water interface under tension. The behavior reflects the fact that PEO has partially amphiphilic character (Israelachvili 1997), and the lipid bilayer prefers to adsorb PEO to minimize exposure to water molecules that might otherwise penetrate the hydrophobic region of the membrane exposed under tension. Spontaneous adsorption of PEO groups (i.e., a thermodynamically-favored process) implies that the water-bilayer interfacial tension is reduced by P124 when under increased mechanical tension. Since interfacial tension is a known driver of MscL activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Melo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ollila et al., 2011</xref>), these data suggest a potential mechanism for how P124 increases MscL’s opening pressure despite decreasing membrane elastic properties K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub>.</p>

<p>Finally, we sought to explore the generality of our findings with another mechanosensitive channel. We chose to measure the effect of P124 on the mouse potassium channel, TWIK-related K+ channel 1 (TREK-1), a mechanosensitive channel found in neurons that can be activated by <italic>force-from-lipids</italic> and is sensitive to changes in membrane composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brohawn et al., 2014</xref>). Using a similar expression scheme as for MscL, we created stable cell lines of TREK-1 tagged with mEGFP (<xref rid="figs5a" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>), which was retained in the membrane after GPMV formation (<xref rid="figs5b" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed TREK-1 single-channel currents in response to a pressure gradient using an integrated pressure controller. Similar currents were not observed in non-transfected cells, lacking the channel, and exposed to the same experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figs5c" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 3</xref>). We measured TREK-1 conductance using voltage-clamp electrophysiology measuring the respective current through a single channel and observed an outward conductance of 140 pS, similar to the conductance of TREK-1 in cellular systems (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Heurteaux et al., 2004</xref>; Xian Tao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Li et al., 2006</xref>). The inward conductance was undetectable below +50 mV, suggesting a primarily outward rectifying channel, consistent with previous observations (Xian Tao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Li et al., 2006</xref>). We next determined if TREK-1 activation pressure was altered by P124. We treated TREK-1-containing GPMVs with P124 and observed an increase in the pressure required to activate the first TREK-1 channel (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Again, the chemically distinct C12E8 amphiphile also increased the channel activation pressure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), similar to our results with MscL (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Finally, we wondered if TREK-1 activation could be predicted by membrane properties. We plotted K<sub>A</sub>, k<sub>c</sub>, and fluidity as a function of TREK-1 activation pressure. Similar to MscL, we observed a strong correlation between TREK-1 activation pressure and K<sub>A</sub> (r = -0.99) and k<sub>c</sub> (r = -0.97) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, E). As we observed for MscL, there was not a strong correlation between membrane fluidity and TREK-1 activation pressure (r = -0.50) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). These results suggest that, as for MscL, a correlative relationship exists between membrane elastic properties, K<sub>A</sub>, and k<sub>c</sub>, and TREK-1 activation sensitivity. Taken together, our observations suggest that inclusion of non-natural amphiphiles can drive changes in membrane mechanical properties that are sufficient to alter mechanosensitive channel activation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through a series of micropipette aspiration and patch-clamp electrophysiology studies, we have determined the effect of various poloxamers and a chemically distinct detergent on membrane properties and mechanosensitive channel behavior. By measuring these membrane properties directly, we found that membrane K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> inversely correlate with activation sensitivity of a mechanosensitive MscL variant, while membrane fluidity does not to the same extent. We found that the amphiphiles we used did not appear to significantly change membrane thickness or occlude MscL pores, factors that would be expected to impact channel activity. Instead, polymer-mediated changes in MscL activation threshold are likely due to differences in bilayer mechanical properties. Finally, we determined that K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> also correlate to the behavior of more complex mechanosensitive channels in higher organisms by assessing the behavior of TREK-1 in response to changes in membrane properties. Our findings, together with molecular dynamics simulations, point to a specific mechanical property that influences pressure sensitivity of the studied channels: interfacial tension. By decreasing interfacial tension in the membrane, a greater force is required to activate MscL and TREK-1. To our knowledge, our study is the first to directly measure multiple membrane properties using GPMVs in conjunction with electrophysiology assessments to directly implicate interfacial tension, K<sub>A</sub>, and k<sub>c</sub> in MscL and TREK-1 activation sensitivity.</p>
<p>Mechanosensitive channel activation sensitivity is an important feature of all mechanosensitive channels. Overactive mechanosensitive channels may lead to deleterious effects ranging from a loss in cell volume in bacteria or red blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Levin and Blount, 2004</xref>) to persistent itch disease in higher organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">LaMotte, 2016</xref>). Membrane composition has been increasingly shown to modulate the <italic>force-from-lipids</italic> activation of mechanosensitive channels and this effect is hypothesized to be due to changes in global membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bruno et al., 2007</xref>). We recently showed that membrane amphiphiles can impact membrane properties in unpredictable ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jacobs et al., 2021</xref>) underlying the importance of directly measuring membrane properties when drawing conclusions about their role in a physiological outcome. While a number of studies discuss the effects of membrane properties on mechanosensitive channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ridone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Xue et al., 2020</xref>), and there is increasing appreciation of the need to measure channel activity in response to applied membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lüchtefeld et al., 2024</xref>), few have directly measured membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Caires et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Nakayama et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Romero et al., 2019</xref>) to determine their impact on channel function. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge no studies to date have used the classical micropipette aspiration technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kwok and Evans, 1981</xref>) in conjunction with patch-clamp electrophysiology to directly determine the relationship between membrane properties and mechanosensitive channel function. Accordingly, the body of research to date has left an unexplored gap between membrane mechanical properties and mechanosensitive channel behavior that we have sought to address. In the present study, we demonstrated that specific membrane properties modulate the <italic>force-from-lipids</italic> activation of two mechanosensitive channels.</p>
<p>How do our findings compare with the existing models of mechanosensitive channel activity?

The term Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub>refers to the energetic costs incurred from the elastic deformations of the lipid bilayer that are required to accommodate MscL, Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>protein</italic></sub>refers to the energy difference of the open and closed state of MscL (to include any changes in lipid-protein interactions), and −<italic>γ</italic>Δ<italic>A</italic> describes the impetus for channel activation which is the product of the protein surface area gained (Δ<italic>A</italic>) by opening the channel with applied tension (<italic>γ</italic>). We define ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>exp</italic></sub> as the free energy difference of channel opening between a lipid-only membrane and a modified membrane. We reason that most contributors to the Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> and <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>protein</italic></sub> terms are unlikely to contribute to ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>exp</italic></sub> (Supplementary Note 1). In the following sections, we discuss how the <italic>γ</italic>Δ<italic>A</italic> term, specifically the interfacial tension in the membrane, and certain contributors to the Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> term, specifically changes in K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub>, may explain our data in the context of existing models.</p>
<p>The term −<italic>γ</italic>Δ<italic>A</italic> describes the gain in energy from opening the channel, increasing the protein’s membrane area by Δ<italic>A</italic> with tension <italic>γ</italic>, and this is the core contribution to the <italic>force-from-lipids</italic> hypothesis; we assert this term best explains how the presence of polymer increases the channel activation pressure threshold. The applied tension acts against the lateral pressure profile induced by the membrane that surrounds MscL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ollila et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, lowering the water-bilayer interfacial tension leads to higher activation pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Melo et al., 2017</xref>). Mechanistically, MscL’s gating is driven by its tension-sensitive N-terminal helix which resides along the bilayer-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bavi et al., 2016</xref>), supporting our interpretation. Prior MD simulations suggest that MscL opening is most sensitive to changes in the head-group surface water-bilayer interfacial tension, leading to the approximation ΔΔ<italic>G</italic> = −Δ<italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>int</italic></sub>Δ<italic>A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Melo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ollila et al., 2011</xref>). Our simulations provide direct evidence for a lower interfacial tension in the membrane with applied tension due to recruitment of the PEO chains of the poloxamer polymers to the membrane-water interface (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>). However, simulations do not provide the magnitude of the reduction of interfacial tension. We can, however, benchmark the expected magnitude of the effect from air-lipid monolayers studies and compare these values to estimates derived from our measurements. Jordanova et al studied membranes containing the lipid DPPE with poloxamer P188 and found a change of interfacial tension of the lipid monolayer of about Δ<italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>int</italic></sub> ≈ −12 mN/m with adsorption of saturating polymer concentrations (Jordanova, Tenchov, and Lalchev 2011). We extract ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>exp</italic></sub> from the experimentally-measured changes in opening pressure Δ<italic>P</italic> for P124 at 0.1 % (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="492859v2_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>R</italic> is the radius of the membrane patch in the pipette (<italic>R</italic> = 2.5 – 4 µm is a typical range in our experimental setup) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiggins and Phillips 2005</xref>). Assuming a Δ<italic>A</italic> of 20 nm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chiang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>), we find that ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>exp</italic></sub> and ΔΔ<italic>G</italic> are similar at 298K (2-3.2 x 10<sup>-19</sup> Nm or 50-79 KbT and 2.3 x 10<sup>-19</sup> Nm or 57 KbT, respectively). This concordance supports our proposed mechanism whereby P124-containing membranes increases MscL activation pressure thresholds primarily by reducing interfacial tension.</p>
<p>We next consider the key Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> contribution between different membrane compositions (ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub>) in our study: the membrane-based, elastic costs of MscL opening. These elastic costs are proportional to the area expansion modulus K<sub>A</sub> and bending rigidity k<sub>c</sub> of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiggins and Phillips, 2005</xref>). We discuss other, likely insubstantial, contributions to ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> in Supplementary Note 1 (membrane asymmetry and hydrophobic mismatch). With respect to elastic membrane costs, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref>, F show that the addition of P124 decreases K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub>, and following from published thermodynamic models, it appears that this should reduce the energetic cost of MscL opening and the activation pressure threshold of MscL (Δ<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub>) because the membrane should require less energy to deform to accommodate MscL’s open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiggins and Phillips, 2005</xref>). This is not the effect observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2g" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 7A</xref>. To explain this apparent incongruity, we hypothesize that the addition of P124 to lipid membranes drives several, related elastic property changes which oppose one another. While polymer-containing membranes have lower K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> than lipid-only membranes (reducing the relative cost of opening a channel via ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub>), the polymer also lowers interfacial tension during membrane stretching (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>; reducing the thermodynamic driver of MscL opening, <italic>γ</italic>Δ<italic>A</italic>). To explain our results, we reason that the magnitude of ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> is smaller than the differences in <italic>γ</italic>Δ<italic>A</italic> between membrane compositions (50-79 KbT). This is consistent with order of magnitude estimates of Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> contributors, the scaling of these contributors with K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub>, and our results from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E,F</xref> (Supplementary Note 1). Together, this suggests that although membrane elastic properties are important for MscL opening, and these properties correlate strongly with Δ<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub>, polymer-mediated effects on interfacial tension are likely the dominant mechanism driving MscL behavior in our study. When we focus on interfacial tension as the dominant property driving mechanosensitive channel activation, the relationships between K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> with activation pressure make sense. Because these properties are proportional to interfacial tension with <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> ∝ 4<italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>int</italic></sub> and <italic>k<sub>c</sub></italic> ∝ <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub><italic>d</italic><sup>2</sup>, where d is the hydrophobic core thickness, changes in interfacial tension should proportionally alter these two membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lipowsky and Sackmann, 1995</xref>), which is what we observed experimentally. In summary, we have compared our experimental results to available models for MscL gating and found that the polymer-induced changes of interfacial tension fit quantitatively to the <italic>force-from-lipid</italic> hypothesis. This property, which in turn alters the K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> values of membranes, is likely the dominant mechanism to explain the relationship between membrane properties measured here, membrane composition, and MscL gating.</p>
<p>Although most poloxamers we studied exhibited a monotonic effect on membrane properties and channel activation as a function of poloxamer concentration, we observed a non-monotonic effect of P184 concentration on MscLG22S activation and k<sub>c</sub>. While most poloxamers generally decreased K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> as a function of concentration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs2g" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref rid="figs3c" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3</xref>), P184 induced a slight decrease in K<sub>A</sub> at all concentrations while k<sub>c</sub> decreased at low concentrations then returned to baseline levels at higher concentrations (<xref rid="figs3c" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a similar effect between membrane k<sub>c</sub> and MscLG22S activation pressure in the presence of P184 (<xref rid="figs3b" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 2</xref>). We are unsure of the mechanism of this non-monotonic effect of P184 on k<sub>c</sub> but attribute it to the large number of hydrophobic blocks relative to the small number of hydrophilic blocks in the polymer which likely leads to the polymer residing in a different location in the membrane relative to the other polymers explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rabbel et al., 2015</xref>). For example, P184 may increase membrane stiffness at higher concentrations through interdigitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Battaglia and Ryan, 2005</xref>) or through changing the depth of P184 insertion in the membrane at high concentrations which is known to alter membrane properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Grage et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zaki and Carbone, 2017</xref>). We speculate that these changes in polymer identity and integration at high concentration may also modulate polymer-mediated reduction in interfacial tension (as observed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref> for P124), for example by changing how the hydrophilic blocks adsorb to the bilayer under tension. In general, our results suggest that the effect membrane amphiphiles have on membrane properties can vary as a function of not only amphiphile identity, but also concentration, and may affect membrane mechanical properties in unexpected, nonmonotonic ways, further underscoring the importance of directly measuring membrane properties to determine the impact of membrane-associating biochemicals on physiological responses.</p>
<p>Finally, our observations of poloxamers interacting with membranes and altering mechanical properties and mechanosensitive channel activity highlight a potential unwanted effect of membrane amphiphiles on cellular membranes. Poloxamers represent a widely used class of nanoplastics. The concentrations of poloxamer we chose to assess in the present study are commonly used in laboratory cell culture applications to prevent cell sticking and improve cell integrity and are also found at these concentrations in household products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guzniczak et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings suggest that poloxamers used at these concentrations may alter the behavior of membrane-embedded ion channels which in turn may affect environmental and human health or may affect biophysical studies in unexplored ways. In addition, these findings propose one potential mechanism for the alteration of biological function in response to nanoplastic pollution which has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fleury and Baulin, 2021</xref>)—modulation of global membrane mechanical properties. Our results suggest that nanoplastics which have been increasingly shown to interact with cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fleury and Baulin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Goodman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hollóczki and Gehrke, 2019</xref>), may alter biological function by modulating membrane physical properties and the subsequent behavior of membrane-embedded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ohashi et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, we observed that various membrane-associating amphiphiles that decrease two membrane mechanical properties—membrane K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub>—increase the force required to activate mechanosensitive channels. Our results support a mechanism in which membrane interfacial tension, a modulator of both K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub>, regulates force transmission to mechanosensitive channels. Our study is the first to our knowledge to measure mechanosensitive channel activation as a function of membrane mechanical properties. By harnessing the unique features of polymeric amphiphiles, we could systematically alter several membrane properties by varying the amount of polymer present in the membrane. Our findings demonstrate that while K<sub>A</sub> and k<sub>c</sub> may be important for mechanosensitive channel function in some systems, they are not the dominating properties governing channel activation in our system containing non-natural amphiphiles. Rather, the relationships we observed between K<sub>A</sub>, k<sub>c</sub>, and channel activation pressure appeared to be a byproduct of alterations in a more dominant property, interfacial tension. These observations, using two distinct mechanosensitive channels, highlight a connection between the membrane physical environment and mechanosensitive channel function to show that bilayer properties, such as interfacial tension, are important mediators of mechanical force to channel proteins. Our results, accordingly, support the <italic>force-from-lipids</italic> mechanism of mechanosensitive channel activation by demonstrating that membrane composition and the associated bilayer mechanical properties can modulate mechanosensitive function through long-range, indirect interactions.</p>

<p>GPMV membrane area expansion modulus (K<sub>A</sub>) and bending rigidity (k<sub>c</sub>) were measured using micropipette aspiration techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Evans et al., 1976</xref>). Micropipettes were constructed from borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments) pulled using a P-1000 micropipette puller (Sutter instruments). The end was blunted and polished to an inner diameter of 5–8 <italic>μ</italic>m using a microforge. The micropipette and sample chamber surfaces were passivated using 5 mg/mL β-casein for 1 hour and were filled with GPMV buffer, pH 7.4. 10 μL GPMVs prepared in the presence of poloxamer, detergent, or no additive were diluted in a 1 mL glass chamber in GPMV buffer, pH 7.4 (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2). Imaging was performed on a Nikon inverted microscope connected to a Validyne pressure sensor and digital manometer (model DP 15-32; Validyne Engineering, Northridge, CA). A Narishige micromanipulator was used to control the micropipette (model WR-6; Narishige). GPMVs free of visible defects were aspirated and the membrane areal response to a change in pressure was measured using a series of DIC images with pressure recordings.

<title>Patch Clamp electrophysiology of stretch-activated ion channels</title>
<p>Channel activity measurements were performed in identical conditions as micropipette aspiration. GPMVs containing EcMscL and TREK-1 prepared under indicated poloxamer conditions were added to an open-air bath on an Olympus IX73 phase-contrast microscope. Electrophysiology pipettes were pulled using a Sutter P-1000 micropipette puller and fire polished using a microforge to 5-8 MΩ resistance. Voltage-clamp measurements were recorded on a Molecular Devices Axon Instruments system including an amplifier and digitizer Low-Noise Data Acquisition System plus Hum silencer along with an ALA Scientific Instruments High Speed Pressure Clamp pressure controller which was used to apply a pressure ramp during electrophysiology recordings. All signals were integrated using Clampex software and pressure and current values were recorded temporally. A pressure ramp from 0 mmHg to -160 mmHg was applied at a constant rate for all recordings. EcMscL and TREK-1 recordings were performed at -10 mV and -40 mV, respectively unless channel conductance calculations were being measured. Pressure and current were recorded through these experiments and were used to calculate pressure sensitivity and channel conductance, respectively. Each pressure sensitivity recording was performed on an independent GPMV and pressure ramps were never repeated as a decrease in pressure sensitivity is observed after repeat pressure ramps because of an increase in membrane tension when the membrane patch diffuses up the pipette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>). All electrophysiology recordings were performed at 25 °C. Bath solution was composed of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2 for MscL and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for TREK-1. The pipette solution was composed of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaMES, 10 mM BAPTA Na4, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM EGTA. All recordings were performed in the cell-attached or excised-patch configuration.

<title>Electrophysiology data analysis</title>
<p>Electrophysiology experiments were quantified using Clampfit software which displayed the current and pressure during the voltage-clamp recording. EcMscL and TREK-1 channel activation sensitivities were quantified using the pressure at first channel opening which has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>). Many recordings only contained one channel, and this first channel was clearly distinguished from electrical noise. However, some recordings contained many channels which could not be distinguished from membrane unsealing, making maximum current an unreliable measurement. Membrane rupture pressure was calculated by the pressure at which a very large current change occurred, indicating complete membrane rupture. Single channel conductance was measured by calculating the current through single channels at various voltages and was independent from pipette pressure. Each current and voltage measurement was recorded from an independent GPMV, and this measurement was not repeated by any single GPMV to mimic pressure sensitivity measurement conditions. The slope of many of these I/V relationships was used to calculate channel conductance. TREK-1 was observed to behave similarly to previous studies and had a short dwell time and was potassium selective with a much smaller conductance than MscL (Xian Tao <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Li et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

The wells were rinsed 3 times with GPMV buffer and 100 μL GPMV buffer with 5 mM CaCl2 was added to each desired well. 10 μL GPMVs were added to the bottom of each well. 5 μL of 21 mM MTSET was added to each well and GPMVs were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through MscL opening was quantified from raw images by a fluorescence increase in the GFP channel for each GPMV visible in the DIC channel of a Nikon Ti2 Inverted Microscope.</p>

<p>P124 polymer was assembled using CHARMM-GUI Polymer Builder from PEO and PPO groups from the CHARMM36 forcefield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jo et al., 2008</xref>). Based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rabbel et al., 2015</xref>) we assumed that P124 inserts as a harpin into the membrane. We further assumed that the incubation time is sufficient for P124 to flip-flop in the membrane and assume a symmetric configuration. The polymer chains were pre-equilibrated in water and a harpin-like conformation was selected by hand. Varying number of polymer chain copies were then inserted to a pre-equilibrated DOPC membrane (300 lipids in total) as indicated by the mol fraction reported in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H,I</xref> and <xref rid="figs4c" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 3</xref>. The parallel periodic membrane images were separated by a 4 nm water layer. Simulations were run using GROMACS (2020) with a timestep of 2 fs, Verlet cutoff-scheme, electrostatics and LJ interactions cutoff at 1.2 nm and PME long-range electrostatics. Simulations were run NPT ensemble, using a Nose-Hoover thermostat and semi-isotropic Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling for a (laterally) tensionless membrane. Temperature coupling was done with the Nose-Hoover algorithm. The membrane elastic modulus <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> was estimated from the thermal bilayer lateral area fluctuations from a (fully equilibrated) 500 ns long trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Feller and Pastor, 1999</xref>). Membrane thickness was calculated from the lipid headgroup phosphate distances between the two leaflets using MDAnalysis version 0.20.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Michaud-Agrawal et al., 2011</xref>). Statistical uncertainties in the membrane elastic modulus and thickness were estimated using blocking analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Flyvbjerg and Petersen, 1989</xref>) implemented in pyblock (James Spencer, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/jsspencer/pyblock">http://github.com/jsspencer/pyblock</ext-link>) with block sizes chosen to remove temporal correlation from the data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wolff, 2004</xref>). To induce, membrane tension in the experiment for <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>, the simulation box size was fixed to induce a positive area strain. Specifically, we considered the simulation of a single P124 harpin per membrane leaflet that in the membrane plane had an average area of 10.2 x 10.2 nm<sup>2</sup> at zero membrane tension. Fixing this area to 10.8 x 10.8 nm<sup>2</sup> induced an area strain of about 12% and included a mechanical tension of 17 mN/m (calculated using gmx energy, GROMACS).</p>

<caption><title>Differing GPMV formation methods yield similar MscL activation pressures, but crosslinking reagents may reduce the probability of channel opening.</title>
<p>GPMV formation is commonly performed using two different methods, NEM or PFA/DTT. While PFA/DTT is the most commonly used reagent mixture, this method induces crosslinking of lipids and proteins that is not amenable to mechanosensitive channel activation. In the presence of PFA/DTT, after &gt;30 attempts over three independent GPMVs preparations, only three instances of functional MscL channels were observed. In contrast, NEM preparation allowed reliable observation of MscL activation. The two methods for GPMV formation did not demonstrate different activation pressure thresholds of MscL. p-values to determine significance between means was measured using Student’s t-test. non-significant (ns) p &gt; 0.05, n &gt; 30.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Schematic and properties of amphiphiles used in this study.</title>
<p>We used various synthetic amphiphiles to exogenously alter membrane mechanical properties. These amphiphiles belong to two classes, poloxamer (Pluronic) and small nonionic detergent. Poloxamer is a class of triblock copolymers which consist of a polypropylene oxide hydrophobic block sandwiched by two polyethylene oxide hydrophilic blocks. Poloxamers have similar properties to surfactants in their ability to insert into bilayers but have much larger molecular weights. The detergent C12E8 we used has a much smaller molecular size in comparison to poloxamer.</p></caption>

<p>A) MscLG22S exhibits stochastic activation behavior in response to pressure in GPMVs. When applied pressure is returned to 0 mmHg, MscLG22S closes and current returns to baseline. This observation suggests that the change in current is due to channel activation and not membrane rupture. B) No MscL control demonstrates no channel currents under MscLG22S activation conditions. Channel currents are not observed up to pressures high enough to rupture the membrane. The open/close pressure ramp in (A) was only used to demonstrate channel closure after pressure reduction.

<p>The following is a continuation of the thermodynamic model of MscL opening presented in the Discussion. Remember that Δ<italic>G</italic> refers to the free energy cost of opening the channel per the below equation.

Recall that the term Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> refers to the energetic costs incurred from the elastic deformations of the lipid bilayer that are required to accommodate MscL, Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>protein</italic></sub> refers to the energy difference of the open and closed state of MscL, and −<italic>γ</italic>Δ<italic>A</italic> describes the impetus for channel activation which is the product of the protein surface area gained (Δ<italic>A</italic>) by opening the channel with applied tension (<italic>γ</italic>). The primary focus of the Discussion was the −<italic>γ</italic>Δ<italic>A</italic> term and the Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> term; here, we explain key assumptions and further rationale for assuming Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> and Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>protein</italic></sub> are not substantial contributors when explaining the different behaviors of MscL opening in membranes with and without poloxamer 124.</p>
<p>Beginning with important assumptions, we note that we experimentally investigated how MscL opening pressure varies with membrane composition (e.g., <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, 3) using a patch-clamp setup with an integrated pressure transducer. At constant micropipette and GPMV geometry in such an experiment, one can assume that the applied channel-opening pressure (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub>) is proportional to the opening free energy of MscL (Δ<italic>G</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiggins and Phillips, 2005</xref>). We will further assume that changes in opening pressure for MscL in different membrane compositions (Δ<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>open</italic></sub>) is proportional to changes in free energy of MscL opening in those compositions (ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>exp</italic></sub>, i.e., the free energy change from a lipid-only membrane to a polymer-containing membrane).</p>
<p>In line with other work, we assume that Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>protein</italic></sub> remains constant in experiments where we modified membrane compositions using the same MscL variants to observe ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>exp</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Melo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiggins and Phillips, 2005</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that MscL opening via delipidation of the transmembrane pocket and via applied tension results in the same channel structures for very different pore-opening forces (B. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). This supports our use of a constant Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>protein</italic></sub> in our experiments for tension-mediated pore opening for a given MscL variant. We also assume the lipid-protein interaction energy between the open and closed states for membranes with and without P124 are similar. This assumption is consistent with other reports using alcohols to modify membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Melo et al., 2017</xref>) and is supported by the observations in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-E</xref> that P124 does not impact conductance and therefore likely does not occlude the channel pore. Therefore, although we cannot rule out the possibly that protein-membrane interactions may change slightly with the incorporation of P124 into membranes, our assumption that Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>protein</italic></sub> remains constant is supported by our observations and other reports.</p>
<p>The contribution Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub>can be further dissected into several terms that, in the typically used continuum mechanical membrane model, depend on the membrane elastic parameters of bending rigidity, area expansion modulus and membrane spontaneous curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>). To date, hydrophobic thickness and local curvature strain have emerged as the predominant such modulators of MscL activation. In general, thinner membranes reduce the activation pressure of MscL as a result of hydrophobic mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Katsuta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ridone et al., 2018</xref>) and high local curvature favors the channel open state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bavi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Doerner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nomura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In the following two paragraphs, we are considering differences in membrane properties resulting from the addition of polymer to membranes.</p>
<p>At a high level, we expect Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> to penalize the open MscL configuration in part because a typical membrane hydrophobic thickness is larger than the hydrophobic region of the open, “thinned”, MscL configuration—this difference can induce a large hydrophobic mismatch between membrane thickness and channel thickness that is thermodynamically unfavorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perozo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Phillips et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ursell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiggins and Phillips, 2005</xref>). From simulations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>), we found only very small changes in membrane thickness with polymer P124, suggesting that the Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> cost due to hydrophobic mismatch is highly similar for membranes with and without P124.</p>
<p>With respect to Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub>, it is important to consider membrane spontaneous curvature which results from membrane asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perozo et al., 2002</xref>). This effect is highlighted in experiments where LPC was added to the GPMVs from the outside—here, we expect asymmetry to initially exist. As a result, the Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> energetic cost of channel opening is lowered because asymmetric LPC incorporation drives membrane curvature changes that favor opening of the MscL pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perozo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yoo and Cui, 2009</xref>). Over longer timescales, we expect LPC to be equilibrated between leaflets, and the LPC-mediated reduction of activation sensitivity vanishes (<xref rid="figs2g" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 7B</xref>). Similarly, we exclude the contribution from spontaneous curvature when considering experiments with C12E8 and polymer compared to lipid-only membranes because the additive’s distribution is likely equilibrated between bilayer leaflets during the patch clamp experiments. Equilibration is facilitated by the hour-long incubation times and perhaps by enhanced permeability of GPMVs (Skinkle, Levental, and Levental 2020). Such equilibration is also consistent with fast equilibration times of poloxamer observed using supported lipid bilayers (Kim et al. 2020). We conclude that membrane asymmetry is not a substantial factor for Δ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> differences between membranes with and without polymer.</p>
<p>In the Discussion, we reason that the magnitude of ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> arising from changes in K<sub>A</sub> and K<sub>c</sub> is smaller than the differences in <italic>γ</italic>Δ<italic>A</italic> between membrane compositions (∼50-79 KbT). Here we provide order of magnitude estimates for ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> from literature and our results. The cost of a midplane bilayer deformation due to channel opening is small (&lt; 1 KbT) and scales with K<sub>c</sub><sup>1/2</sup>, and the cost to deform the bilayer thickness is moderate (∼10 KbT) and scales with K<sub>c</sub><sup>1/4</sup> * K<sub>A</sub><sup>3/4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ollila et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wiggins and Phillips, 2005</xref>). The former term is small enough to omit from this analysis. From <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E,F</xref>, K<sub>A</sub> and K<sub>c</sub> decreased by ∼3.8x and ∼2.3x, respectively, in the presence of high concentrations of P124; we approximate the ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>membrane</italic></sub> term is reduced ∼3.4x to ∼3 KbT, much smaller than our 50-79 KbT estimate for ΔΔ<italic>G</italic><sub><italic>exp</italic></sub>.</p>

<p>Gating of mechanosensitive channels has been explained by the force-from-lipids model in which mechanical coupling of the channel protein to the plasma membrane transfers force from membrane tension to open the channel. In this <bold>important</bold> manuscript, the authors provide evidence for this mechanism in two different mechanically gated channels. The experiments were carried out in the same membranes, but the evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> without a clear explanation of the relationship between measured mechanical parameters and membrane interfacial tension.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors study the effect of the addition of synthetic amphiphile on the gating mechanisms of the mechano-sensitive channel MscL. They observe that the amphiphile reduces the membrane stretching and bending modulii, and increases the channel activation pressure. They then conclude that gating is sensitive to these two membrane parameters. This is explained by the effect of the amphiphile on the so-called membrane interfacial tension.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength is that the authors found a way to tune the membrane's mechanical properties in a controlled manner, and find a progressive change of the suction pressure at which MscL gates. If analysed thoroughly, these results could give valuable information.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weakness is the analysis and the discussion. I would like to have answers to some basic questions.</p>
<p>(1) The explanation of the phenomenon involves a difference between interfacial tension and tension, without the difference between these being precisely defined. In the caption of Figure 4, one can read &quot;Under tension, the PEO groups adsorb to the bilayer, suggesting adsorption is a thermodynamically favorable process that lowers the interfacial tension.&quot; What does this mean? Under what tension is the interfacial tension lowered? The fact that the system's free energy could be lowered by putting it under mechanical tension would result in a thermodynamic unstable situation. Is this what the authors mean?</p>
<p>(2) From what I understand, a channel would feel the tension exerted by the membrane at its periphery, which is what I would call membrane tension. The fact that polymers may reorganise under membrane stretch to lower the system's free energy would certainly affect the membrane stretching modulus (as measured Figure 2E), but what the channel cares about is the tension (I would say). If the membrane is softer, a larger pipette pressure is required to reach the same level of tension, so it is not surprising that a given channel requires a larger activation pressure in softer membranes. To me, this doesn't mean that the channel feels the membrane stiffness, but rather that a given pressure leads to different tensions (which is what the channel feels) for different stiffnesses.</p>
<p>(3) In order to support the authors' claim, the micropipette suction pressure should be appropriately translated into a membrane tension. One would then see whether the gating tension is affected by the presence of amphiphiles. In the micropipette setup used here, one can derive a relationship between pressure and tension, that involves the shape of the membrane. This relationship is simple (tension=pressure difference times pipette radius divided by 2) only in the limit where the membrane tongue inside the pipette ends with a hemisphere of constant radius independent of the pressure, and the pipette radius is much smaller than the GUV radius. None of these conditions seem to hold in Figure 2C. On the other hand, the authors do report absolute values of tension in the y-axis of Figure 2D. It seems quite straightforward to plot the activation tension (rather than pressure) as a function of the amphiphile volume fraction in Figure 2B. This is what needs to be shown.</p>
<p>(4) The discussion needs to be improved. I could not find a convincing explanation of the role of interfacial tension in the discussion. The equation (p.14) distinguishes three contributions, which I understand to be (i) an elastic membrane deformation such as hydrophobic mismatch or other short-range effects, (ii) the protein conformation energy, and (iii) the work done by membrane tension. Apparently, the latter is where the effect is (which I agree with), but how this consideration leads to a gating energy difference (between lipid only and modified membrane) proportional to the interfacial tension is completely obscure (if not wrong).</p>
<p>(5) I am rather surprised at the very small values of stretching and bending modulii found under high-volume fraction. These quantities are obtained by fitting the stress-strain relationship (Figure 2D). Such a plot should be shown for all amphiphile volume fraction, so one can assess the quality of the fits.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript describes how synthetic polymers, primarily poloxamers of different sizes, influence bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL gating by modifying the interfacial tension of the membrane. The authors expressed MscL in U2OS cells and chemically blebbed the cells to derive giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs) containing MscL G22S. They applied micropipette aspiration on GPMVs to obtain bending rigidity (kc) and area expansion modulus (kA) and used patch clamping to obtain activation pressure. They found a negative correlation between kc and kA with activation pressure and attributed the changes to activation pressure to the lowering of the interfacial tension in the presence of polymers. They carried out coarse-grain molecular dynamics simulations and showed that under tension the hydrophilic PEO group adsorbs to the bilayer more, thereby lowering the interfacial tension. Besides MscL, they showed similar results with TREK-1 activation. The conclusion that differences in interfacial tension are what drive the changes in activation pressure is based on using a thermodynamic model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Reveals that synthetic polymer that lowers bending rigidity and area expansion modulus increases activation pressure of mechanosensitive channel by lowering interfacial tension - this is an important finding.</p>
<p>(2) General data quality is high with detailed and thorough analysis. The use of both micropipette aspiration and patch clamp in the same study is noteworthy.</p>
<p>(3) Discussion on nanoplastics and their effect on membrane properties and therefore their impact on mechanosensitivity is interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Interfacial tension is not experimentally measured. Given the main argument of this paper is that synthetic polymers reduce interfacial tension, which increases MS channel activation pressure, it would be prudent to show experimental measurements to bolster their analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors set out to test the &quot;force from lipids&quot; mechanism of mechanosensitive channel gating, which posits that mechanical properties of the membrane are directly responsible for converting membrane tension into useful energy for channel gating. They employ amphiphilic polymers called poloxamers to alter membrane mechanical properties and relate those to the threshold of mechanical activation of the MscL channel of E.coli.</p>
<p>The authors heterologously express the channel, perform electrical recordings, and assess the mechanical properties of vesicles derived from the same membranes. This allows them to directly compare derived mechanical parameters to channel gating in the same environment.</p>
<p>They further repeat experiments in an eukaryotic mechano-channel and show that the same principles apply to gating in this very different protein, providing support for the force from lipids hypothesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In this work, characterization of the mechanical properties of the plasma membrane and electrical recordings of channel activity are carried out in membranes derived from the same cells. This is a nice contribution to these experiments since usually these two properties are measured in separate membranes with differing compositions. The experiments are of high quality and the data analysis and interpretation are careful.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is not clear to this reviewer what the relationship is between the mechanical properties the authors measure, the membrane area expansion modulus, and bending rigidity, to what they call &quot;interfacial tension&quot;.</p>

<p>We appreciate the time and thoughtful reviews of all 3 reviewers. Ahead of a full revision of the paper, we would like to address a couple of points the reviewers have raised that we plan to address in more detail in our full revision.</p>
<p>(1) The relationship between membrane tension and interfacial tension: The major request by reviewers was for a better explanation of the relationship between measured mechanical parameters and membrane interfacial tension. We plan to include a schematic of the different forces at play in the membrane and to clarify our discussion and here, provide a brief explanation.</p>
<p>In our study, we identified a relationship between channel activation pressure and two membrane mechanical properties (area expansion modulus (K<sub>A</sub>) and bending rigidity (K<sub>c</sub>)) though we did not find a correlation between channel activation pressure and a third mechanical property (membrane fluidity). Through further computational analysis of the membranes, we identified an additional property called interfacial tension that helps unify and explain our results. Interfacial tension (γ) is a property akin to surface tension that reflects the chemical composition at the interface of the membrane (between the polar headgroups of the lipids and the hydrophobic acyl chains of the lipids) and balances the repulsive interaction of the nonpolar hydrocarbon chains with the polar headgroup regions of the lipids. In the established polymer brush model, the expansion modulus is proportional to the interfacial tension (W. Rawicz, Biophyiscal Journal, 2000)</p>
<p>γ = <italic>K<sub>A</sub></italic>/<italic>C</italic>,</p>
<p>where C is a constant. Interfacial tension occurs at the boundary between the lipid bilayer and external aqueous environment and is different from mechanical tension. While mechanical membrane tension (t) reflects a physical force in plane with the membrane, interfacial tension reflects the chemical composition at each interface of the membrane. While mechanical membrane tension depends on the size and shape of the membrane, interfacial tension is independent of these features and depends on the molecular composition of the liquid-liquid interface. An expanded discussion on this topic was recently provided (Lipowsky. Faraday Discussions. 2024). While distinct, these two properties can be related to one another via the area expansion modulus (K<sub>A</sub>). Typically, one would imagine that upon reducing interfacial tension, and correspondingly reducing the K<sub>A</sub>, it should now take less energy to stretch the membrane to the same extent and should reduce the activation pressure (and corresponding in plane mechanical tension ) required to open an embedded mechanosensitive channel. Interestingly though, interfacial tension also works to pull the channel open so that a reduction in interfacial tension also means more energy will be required to open the channel. We find that reductions in interfacial tension and corresponding increased energy required to open embedded channels outweighs the reduced tension that should be required to stretch the membrane. We plan to more clearly explain this tradeoff in our revision. Overal, our findings identify the exact properties driving mechanosensitive channel behavior in our study. Further, they provide a guide to understanding how and why shifts in mechanosensitive channel activation occur by connecting chemical composition changes to the changes in membrane tension propagation in a given membrane.</p>
<p>(2) Data presentation to support determined area expansion modulus and bending rigidity values: We will show stress strain curves used to derive Ka and kc values</p>
<p>(3) Address why membrane tension data was not shown for ephys experiments: The micropipette and patch clamp setups are different, and we did not use the same system for both measurements. In fact, limitations in tools that would allow for concurrent tension measurements while conducting channel activation measurements have limited our understanding of the role of membrane tension on mechanosensation to date. While recent studies have attempted to resolve this limitation through the design of new tools that enable concurrent monitoring of mechanosensitive channel activation and membrane tension (Lüchtefeld et al. Nature Methods. 2024), these tools were not available to us during our study or now. Because our study also attempted to connect these two features (membrane tension and channel activation) but we lacked tools to do so simultaneously, we used two sets of measurements to separately uncover membrane mechanical properties and channel activation pressure.</p>
<p>One reason it is difficult to measure membrane tension during a typical patch clamp study is because of limitations in the imaging equipment and pipettes used for this assay. The experiment is usually done by looking through the eyepiece and the pipette angle is around 45 degrees from the plane of the stage so it would be hard to visualize changes in the patch geometry in the tip of the pipette. Basically, we are able to see the pipette touch the GMPV, but cannot resolve the patch moving up the pipette. In response to the reviewer comment that tension=pressure difference times pipette radius divided by 2, we were unable to measure the radius and changes in radius of a patch upon increases in applied pressure due to the above mentioned imaging constraints. This limitation is why we were unable to directly measure applied tension with our current patch clamp set up.</p>
<p>(4) Interfacial tension is not experimentally measured: Interfacial tension = K<sub>A</sub> /C where C is a constant (typically C=4 for bilayer membranes). The best way to measure interfacial tension is to determine K<sub>A</sub> (the area expansion modulus), which we have experimentally done by generating stress vs strain curves for GPMVs. In literature, reductions in interfacial tension of a membrane are typically experimentally determined by measuring a corresponding reduction in the associated K<sub>A</sub> value (eg. Ly and Longo. Biophys J. 2004). We have similarly followed this approach.</p>
