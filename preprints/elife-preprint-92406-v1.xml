<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Many eukaryotic membrane proteins are prone to misfolding, which compromises their functional expression at the plasma membrane. This is particularly true for mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors (GnRHRs), which are G protein-coupled receptors involved in reproductive steroidogenesis. We recently demonstrated that evolutionary modifications within mammalian GnRHRs appear to have coincided with adaptive changes in cotranslational folding efficiency. Though changes in protein stability are known to shape evolutionary interactions, it is unclear how the energetic drivers of cotranslational folding in the membrane may modify epistatic interactions. We therefore surveyed the pairwise epistatic interactions that modify the expression of two destabilized GnRHR variants bearing mutations that selectively compromise either its membrane topology (V276T) or its native tertiary structure (W107A). Using deep mutational scanning (DMS), we evaluated how the effects of these mutations on the expression of the mature form of the protein at the plasma membrane are modified by hundreds of secondary mutations. A focused analysis of 251 mutants with high-quality measurements in three genetic backgrounds reveals that V276T and W107A form distinct epistatic interactions that depend on both the degree to which they destabilize the protein and the mechanism of their destabilization. An unsupervised learning analysis shows that V276T forms predominantly negative epistatic interactions that are most pronounced among destabilizing mutations within soluble loop regions. In contrast, W107A forms interactions with mutations in both loops and transmembrane domains that skew positive as a result of the diminishing impact of the destabilizing mutations in the context of an already unstable variant. These findings provide general insights into how pairwise epistasis is remodeled by conformational defects in membrane proteins and, more generally, in unstable proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mutational effects on protein stability have important consequences for evolution. Destabilized proteins misfold more often, which can attenuate their ability to function in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Though natural selection typically maximizes fitness by incorporating mutations that produce new or improved functions, this optimization process is often hindered by the destabilizing effects of most random mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). The cumulative energetic effects of these mutations on protein stability are generally capable of creating non-additive, context-dependent epistatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Nevertheless, there are many different aspects of protein synthesis, folding, and assembly that are governed by distinct energetic constraints. While epistatic interactions arising from changes in protein stability have been previously characterized in soluble proteins (Gong et al. 2013; Olson et al. 2014; Faber et al. 2019; Nedrud et al. 2021), the impact of epistasis on membrane protein folding and stability has yet to be explored. Although many of the mechanistic underpinnings of pairwise epistasis in soluble proteins are likely to be generalizable to all proteins, membrane proteins undergo additional cotranslational folding reactions that are governed by mechanistically distinct kinetic and energetic constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Based on these considerations, we suspect that mutations in membrane proteins could potentially modify cotranslational processes in a manner that generates distinct epistatic interactions that bias their evolutionary pathways in unique ways.</p>
<p>Unlike water-soluble proteins, membrane proteins must be cotranslationally inserted into lipid bilayers (Stage I folding) in order to fold into their native structure (Stage II folding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). In eukaryotes, Stage I folding is primarily facilitated by the Sec61 translocon complex in concert with its various other accessory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>Ribosomes translating membrane proteins are targeted to this translocon complex at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, where the nascent transmembrane domains (TMDs) partition into the lipid bilayer and establish their native topology relative to the membrane (Stage I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). After translation is complete, membrane proteins fold and assemble (Stage II) in a manner that is coupled to their passage through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane and/ or other destination organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Though they are governed by distinct physicochemical constraints, failures in either Stage I or Stage II folding are capable of increasing the proportion of nascent membrane proteins that are retained in the ER and prematurely degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We therefore expect that epistatic interactions can arise from the cumulative energetic effects of mutations on either of these processes. Given that three-dimensional protein structures are stabilized by similar energetic principles in water and lipid bilayers, mutations that modify the fidelity of Stage II folding energetics should potentially generate long-range epistatic interactions that are comparable to those observed in soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). By comparison, the topological transitions that happen during the early stages of membrane protein synthesis may be coupled to neighboring loops and helices in a manner that can play a decisive role in the formation of the native topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Based on these considerations, we reason that the effects of mutations on each process could create distinct epistatic interactions.</p>
<p>To gain insights into the mechanistic basis of epistatic interactions in membrane proteins, we surveyed the effects of single and double mutants on the plasma membrane expression (PME) of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in reproductive steroidogenesis across many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that various evolutionary sequence modifications within mammalian GnRHRs have tuned its fitness by compromising the fidelity of Stage I folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains unclear how the inefficient cotranslational folding of GnRHR reshapes its tolerance of secondary mutations. Here, we utilize deep mutational scanning (DMS) to carry out a focused analysis of 251 mutations in the background of two mouse GnRHR (mGnRHR) variants that selectively compromise either Stage I or Stage II folding. Our results show that mutations which generate Stage I and Stage II folding defects form distinct epistatic interactions throughout this receptor. An unsupervised learning analysis reveals how these interactions depend on both changes in stability and the topological context of the mutation. Together, these findings suggest that the distinct biosynthetic mechanisms of integral membrane proteins may differentially shape their fitness landscapes. The general implications of our findings for the role of protein folding and stability in protein evolution are discussed.</p>

<title>Mutational Library Design</title>
<p>To compare how perturbations of Stage I and Stage II folding shape epistatic interactions, we first identified and characterized two individual mutations that are likely to selectively disrupt either the cotranslational membrane integration (V276T) or the native tertiary structure (W107A) of GnRHR. We previously showed that T277 in TMD6 of human GnRHR (hGnRHR) contributes to the inefficient translocon-mediated membrane integration of TMD6, which decreases the receptor’s PME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). A recent crystallographic structure of hGnRHR confirms that the polar side chain of T277, which corresponds to V276 in the mouse receptor (89.3% sequence identity), is exposed to the lipid bilayer and does not appear to make interhelical contacts that stabilize the native structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A &amp; B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Thus, mutations at this position modify the hydrophobicity of TMD6 without perturbing the native tertiary contacts that stabilize the native fold. Indeed, replacing the native valine residue in TMD6 of the mouse receptor with the threonine residue found in hGnRHR reduces the efficiency of its translocon-mediated membrane integration <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. S1, Table S1). Furthermore, this substitution decreases the PME of the mouse receptor by 65 ± 4% relative to that of wild-type mGnRHR (WT, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, these results confirm that the inefficient translocation of this helix promotes cotranslational GnRHR misfolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). In contrast, substitutions at W107 within extracellular loop 1 (ECL1) preserve the hydrophobicity of TMDs and their topological energetics while disrupting a conserved hydrogen bond network that is found in a wide array of GPCR structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Mutating this conserved tryptophan to alanine (W107A) reduces the PME of mGnRHR by 88 ± 4% relative to WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), which suggests that disrupting this hydrogen bond network destabilizes mGnRHR in a manner that promotes its cellular misfolding. Comparing how these mutations modify the proteostatic effects of secondary mutations will therefore reveal how changes in the fidelity of Stage I (V276T) and Stage II (W107A) folding differentially impact mutational epistasis.</p>

<p>To survey the epistatic interactions formed by these mutations, we generated a series of genetic libraries consisting of 1,615 missense variants in the background of V276T, W107A, and WT mGnRHR. To ensure adequate dynamic range in the downstream assay, we created these variants in the cDNA of mGnRHR, which exhibits intermediate, tunable expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Briefly, we used a structural homology model of mGnRHR to select 85 residues distributed across the loops and helices of mGnRHR. We included all 19 amino acid substitutions at the 3 most solvent-accessible and the 3 most buried residues in each TMD (Fig. S2 and Table S2). We also included mutations encoding all 19 amino acid substitutions at positions that are evenly distributed across each soluble domain. We then generated an array of mutagenic oligonucleotides encoding each of these mutations (Table S3), which was used to introduce these mutations in the context of the V276T, W107A, and WT mGnRHR cDNAs by nicking mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). We generated each of these libraries in the context of plasmids containing a randomized ten-base region within the backbone. Unique 10-base plasmid identifiers that could be matched to specific mGnRHR variants of interests were used to score variants in the downstream assay using Illumina sequencing. Using whole plasmid PacBio sequencing of each library, we matched 1,383 of the 1,615 possible variants to one or more ten-base unique molecular identifier (UMI) in at least one of the three libraries, 320 of which were found in all three genetic backgrounds (see <italic>Methods</italic> for details).</p>

<title>Plasma Membrane Expression of GnRHR Mutant Libraries</title>
<p>To identify secondary mutations that form epistatic interactions with V276T and W107A, we measured the relative PME of single and double mutants within each genetic library by DMS as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Briefly, we first generated a series of recombinant, pooled HEK293T cell lines in which the individual cells that each express one of the single or double mGnRHR mutants from one of the three plasmid libraries described above. A comparison of the mGnRHR surface immunostaining profiles of these cellular populations that recombinantly express this collection of variants in context of the V276T, W107A, or an otherwise WT genetic background reveals striking context-dependent differences in their proteostatic effects. Recombinant cells expressing these variants in the WT background exhibit a bimodal distribution of mGnRHR surface immunostaining, where 59% of cells exhibit immunostaining that is comparable to WT and 41% of cells exhibit reduced expression relative to WT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Although cells expressing this same collection of variants in the V276T background also exhibit bimodal surface immunostaining, 48% of the population exhibit diminished expression relative to the V276T variant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This observation suggests many of these variants synergistically decrease mGnRHR expression in combination with the V276T mutation. Unlike the WT and V276T libraries, cells expressing this same collection of variants in combination with the W107A mutation exhibit a continuous range of surface immunostaining intensities that are only slightly lower, on average, relative to cells expressing the W107A single mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The lack of dispersion likely reflects a compression of the distribution that arises as the folding efficiency of these variants approaches zero (see <italic>Discussion</italic>). Cells expressing this library of W107A double mutants do, however, still contain cellular subpopulations with surface immunostaining intensities that are well above or below that of the W107A single mutant, which suggests that this fluorescence signal is sensitive enough to detect subtle differences in the PME of these variants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Nevertheless, these results suggest that none of the secondary mutations can fully compensate for the proteostatic effects of the W107A mutation.</p>

</fig>
<p>To compare the PME of these variants in each genetic background, we separated the mixed cell populations into quartiles based on the relative surface immunostaining of their expressed mGnRHR variants using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), then extracted the genomic DNA from each cellular fraction. We then used Illumina sequencing to track the relative abundance of the recombined UMIs and their associated variants within each fraction, then used these measurements to estimate the corresponding PME of each variant. A series of filters relating to the quality of the reads, the sampling of each mutation, and the similarity of variant scores across replicates were used to remove poorly sampled variants with unreliable scores (see <italic>Methods</italic>). Briefly, to restrict our analysis to variants that can be reliably scored, we removed variants that did not have at least 50 counts across the four bins in each replicate. Additionally, we compared the percentile rank of each variant across replicates and discarded variant scores for which the difference in percentile rank across the two replicates was greater than 25%. The relative PME of the remaining variants was averaged across two biological replicates. Overall, we measured the relative PME of 1,004 missense variants in the WT background, 338 missense variants in the V276T background, and 1,179 missense variants in the W107A background (Table S4). Out of the 320 variants identified in all three plasmid libraries by PacBio sequencing, 251 mutations passed these quality filters in the Illumina sequencing of the cellular isolates (Table S 4). In the following, we will focus on the comparison of the effects of these 251 mutations in each background in order to determine how their proteostatic effects are modified by secondary mutations.</p>
<p>To facilitate the comparison of estimated immunostaining intensities for each variant across the three genetic backgrounds, we normalized the raw immunostaining intensity values for each variant relative to that of the measured intensity values for the corresponding reference sequence (V276T, W107A, or WT mGnRHR). Relative intensity values of 1.0 correspond to no effect, whereas values over 1.0 correspond to mutations that enhance surface expression in that genetic background, and vice versa. A histogram of the relative intensity values for the 251 variants measured in all three backgrounds generally recapitulates the trends in the cellular immunostaining histograms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). Most of these mutations decrease the PME of mGnRHR in all three backgrounds, which reflects the limited mutational tolerance of membrane proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Notably, only a modest fraction of mutations measurably enhance the surface expression of WT mGnRHR (51 mutations, 20%) and V276T mGnRHR (21 mutations, 8% <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Mutations in the V276T background tend to decrease surface expression more than they do in the WT background, and this trend persists across most domains of the protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A &amp; B</xref>). In contrast, a larger proportion of these mutations (100 mutants, 40%) enhance the surface expression of W107A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), though these increases in immunostaining are relatively modest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Furthermore, the mutations tend to be better tolerated with respect to surface expression in combination with W107A relative to their effects on expression in the WT background (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>Projecting the average relative intensities for the mutations at each residue onto the structure reveals that most positions exhibit similar trends in the mutational tolerance in each background, with loop residues being generally more permissive than those within TMDs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D – F</xref>). Nevertheless, there are subdomains where the quantitative mutagenic effects deviate in a context-dependent manner. Variants bearing mutations within the C-terminal region (ICL3-TMD6-ECL3-TMD7) fare consistently worse in the V276T background relative to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B &amp; E</xref>). Given that V276T perturbs the cotranslational membrane integration of TMD6 (Fig. S1, Table S1), this directional bias potentially suggests that the apparent interactions between these mutations manifest during the late stages of cotranslational folding. In contrast, mutations that are better tolerated in the context of W107A mGnRHR are located throughout the structure but are particularly abundant among residues in the middle of the primary structure that form TMD4, ICL2, and ECL2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C &amp; F</xref>). Together, these observations show how the proteostatic effects of mGnRHR mutations are modified by secondary mutations that differentially affect the fidelities of Stage I and Stage II folding.</p>

<title>Distinct Pairwise Epistasis in V276T and W107A</title>
<p>To compare epistatic trends in these libraries, we calculated the magnitude of the epistatic interactions these 251 mutations form with V276T and W107A by comparing their relative effects on PME of the WT, V276T, and W107A variants using a previously described relative epistasis model (product model, Olson et al. 2014). Briefly, we defined fitness as the ratio of the single/ double mutant PME to that of WT mGnRHR. Epistasis scores (ε) were then determined by taking the log of the double mutant fitness value divided by the difference between the single mutant fitness values (see <italic>Methods</italic>). Positive ε values denote double mutants that have greater PME than would be expected based on the effects of single mutants. Negative ε values denote double mutants that have lower PME than would be expected based on the effects of single mutants. Pairs of mutations with ε values near zero have additive effects on PME. Though epistatic interactions are typically rare in the context of stable proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), epistasis scores among this set of 251 random mutations generally form positive epistatic interactions with W107A and negative epistatic interactions with V276T (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Interestingly, the difference in the epistasis scores for the interactions these variants form with W107A and V276T was at least 1.0 for 98 of the 251 variants (Table S4). Notably, these 98 variants are enriched with TMD variants (65% TMD) relative to the overall set of 251 variants (45% TMD). In contrast to the sparse epistasis that is generally observed between mutations within soluble proteins, these findings suggest a relatively large proportion of random mutations form epistatic interactions in the context of unstable mGnRHR variants in a manner that appears to depend on the specific folding defect (V276T vs. W107A) and topological context.</p>

<title>Molecular Basis for the Observed Epistatic Interactions</title>
<p>To identify general trends in the observed epistatic interactions, we utilized unsupervised learning to elucidate patterns among the relative PME values of variants across each genetic background. We first utilized uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) to identify mutations that have similar expression profiles across these conditions. A projection of the variants onto a resulting two-dimensional coordinate reveals that most variants fall into one of approximately three groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Using a density-based hierarchical clustering analysis (HDBSCAN), we unambiguously assigned 182 variants into three distinct clusters based on their expression profiles alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, Table S4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). An analysis of the structural context of these mutants reveals that one of the largest clusters (Cluster 3, n = 76) primarily consists of mutations of soluble loop residues that have little impact on expression and exhibit minimal epistasis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A-C</xref>). This analysis also identified a smaller cluster of loop mutations (Cluster 2, n = 30) that moderately decrease expression and exhibit a greater propensity to form epistatic interactions with V276T and/ or W107A relative to the neutral loop mutations in Cluster 3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A-C</xref>). Nevertheless, most of the mutations that exhibit strong positive epistatic interactions with W107A fell into Cluster 1 (n = 76), which primarily consists of mutations within TMDs that significantly decrease expression in all three genetic backgrounds (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A-C</xref>). A comparison across these clusters suggests positive epistatic interactions with W107A primarily stems from the fact that mutations that compromise expression can only cause a relatively modest reduction in the PME of W107A GnRHR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B &amp; C</xref>), which is already predominantly misfolded. In contrast, the moderately disruptive loop mutations in Cluster 2 tend to exhibit more pronounced negative epistatic interactions with V276T than do the highly disruptive TMD mutations in Cluster 1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The divergent epistatic interactions that disruptive loop and TMD mutations form with V276T potentially arise from differences in the mechanistic basis for the destabilization caused by these two classes of mutations (see <italic>Discussion</italic>).</p>

<p>Many epistatic interactions arise from the additive energetic effects of mutations on protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). To determine how these trends relate to the effects of mutations on thermodynamic stability, we utilized Rosetta CM to generate structural models of 243 of the 251 variants that were scored in all three backgrounds and fall within the structured regions of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). We then utilized a membrane-optimized Rosetta energy scoring function to approximate the change in the energy of the native structural ensemble of each variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The cluster of loop mutations with lower expression (Cluster 2, avg. ΔΔG = + 2.2 REU) generally contains more destabilizing mutations relative to the cluster of loop mutations with WT-like expression (Cluster 3, avg. ΔΔG = + 0.8 REU), which affirms the general relationship between stability and PME in this system (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B &amp; D</xref>). However, the cluster of TMD variants (Cluster 1, avg. ΔΔG = + 3.4 REU) is generally more destabilizing than either of the loop clusters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). A comparison across the clusters suggests that the degree of destabilization generally tracks with the magnitude of positive epistatic interactions that form with W107A, regardless of structural context (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C &amp; D</xref>). This uptick in positive epistasis among mutations that destabilize the native fold and severely reduce PME likely reflects the attenuated effect of destabilizing mutations as the equilibrium fraction of folded protein approaches zero (see <italic>Discussion</italic>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). In contrast to W107A, epistatic interactions with V276T are predominantly negative and are most pronounced among moderately destabilizing loop mutations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C &amp; D</xref>). The abundance of negative interactions with V276T parallels the observed pairwise epistasis in other folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), and likely reflects the higher baseline expression and/ or stability of this variant relative to W107A (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Nevertheless, stability-mediated epistasis cannot account for the attenuation of the epistatic interactions that V276T forms with the highly destabilizing mutations within Cluster 1 relative to the moderately destabilizing mutations within Cluster 2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C &amp; D</xref>). These observations suggest that the magnitude of the epistatic interactions formed by V276T is dependent on not only the change in stability, but also the topological context of the secondary mutation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many epistatic interactions between mutations within genes encoding soluble proteins arise from their cumulative effects on protein folding energetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Folded proteins can only tolerate a limited number of destabilizing mutations before their cumulative energetic effects cause a cooperative decrease in the fraction of folded protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Although this general principle should apply to all proteins, it is unclear how the distinct energetic processes involved in membrane protein biosynthesis and folding may alter such evolutionary couplings. In this study, we utilize DMS to compare the epistatic interactions formed by two mutations that reduce the expression of a misfolding-prone GPCR by selectively destabilizing either its cotranslational membrane integration (V276T) or its native tertiary structure (W107A). We note that the introduction of the V276T mutation into the mouse receptor utilized herein mimics one of the key destabilizing modifications that reduces the expression of hGnRHR relative to mGnRHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Through a focused analysis of 753 total single and double mutants, we find that these mutations give rise to divergent epistatic interactions that modify the PME of mGnRHR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Mutations that form epistatic interactions with V276T tend to synergistically decrease mGnRHR expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3 A &amp; B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>)-a typical epistatic trend that likely arises from the combined destabilizing effects of both mutations. Surprisingly, these interactions are most prominent among moderately destabilizing loop mutations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). In contrast, many of these same secondary mutations instead form positive epistatic interactions with W107A mGnRHR, regardless of their topological context (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). As this comparison reflects the epistatic interactions formed by an identical set of secondary mutations, we conclude that these context-dependent epistatic interactions arise from differences in the magnitude and/ or the mechanism of the mGnRHR destabilization caused by the V276T and W107A mutations.</p>
<p>In the context of stable proteins, stability-mediated epistasis tends to magnify the effects of deleterious mutations due to the cumulative destabilization that arises from sequential random substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). This is a fundamental consequence of the cooperative dependence of the fraction of folded protein on the free energy of unfolding. Indeed, most of the random mGnRHR mutations characterized herein are predicted to destabilize the native structure in a manner that coincides with a measurable decrease in the PME in the context of all three genetic backgrounds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). Whereas these destabilizing mutations exhibit the expected negative epistatic couplings with V276T, their interactions with W107A skew positive (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). This anomalous positive epistasis is potentially a byproduct of the severe destabilizing effects of W107A relative to V276T (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). While destabilizing secondary mutations can cause significant decreases in the yield of folded WT or V276T mGnRHR, the W107A variant already exhibits marginal surface immunostaining. In the context of this predominantly misfolded, poorly expressed variant, even highly destabilizing secondary mutations can only cause a relatively small decrease in the yield of folded protein. This observation can be more generally related to the relatively shallow dependence of the fraction of folded protein on the free energy of folding under conditions where folding becomes unfavorable-unfolding transitions become shallow as the fraction of folded protein approaches zero (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Stabilizing mutations can also generate potent positive epistatic couplings in this context given that even small increases in stability can push the system into the steepest portion of the transition zone (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Paradoxically, the asymmetry of the folding curve in this regime suggests destabilizing mutations are more tolerable in the context of an unstable protein-folding efficiency effectively has nowhere to go but upwards. Essentially, the nature of this sigmoidal transition suggests the typical trends associated with stability-mediated epistasis should become inverted as stability decreases. Such considerations could potentially expand the accessible sequence space in metastable proteins, which constitute a significant portion of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Combinations of mutations that would not generally be tolerated in stable proteins may also occur through such mechanism in the context of the numerous misfolded secondary alleles that are carried within the genomes of humans and other diploids with no appreciable fitness cost (e.g. the ΔF508 variant of <italic>CFTR</italic>).</p>
<p>Unlike W107A, the epistatic interactions formed by V276T appear to depend on their topological context-negative epistasis is more prevalent among moderately destabilizing loop variants than highly destabilizing TMD variants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C &amp; D</xref>). This observation suggests stability-mediated epistasis between mutations that destabilize the native tertiary structure of integral membrane proteins (Stage II folding) may be distinct from the interactions that arise from the disruption of their translocon-mediated cotranslational membrane integration (Stage I folding). This divergence could potentially reflect the distinction between the energetic principles of protein folding relative to those that guide the insertion of proteins into membranes, which is fundamentally driven by a membrane depth-dependent solvation energetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Counterintuitively, polar mutations that disrupt the membrane integration of individual TMDs also have the potential to form interhelical hydrogen bonds that can stabilize the topological orientation of neighboring TMDs, which can give rise to long-range topological couplings. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The propensity of such contacts to form may in some cases depend on the length and hydrophobicity of the loops that connect them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Finally, we should note that complex epistatic interactions between residues within TMDs could potentially arise through their propensity to remodel the translocon complex-polar residues within TMDs may affect the recruitment of secondary insertases and/ or intramembrane chaperones such as TRAP, the PAT complex, and the ER membrane protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Additional insights into the mechanistic basis for the recruitment of such complexes may therefore be needed to fully rationalize evolutionary couplings between TMDs. We note that, more generally, we suspect that synergistic genetic interactions between mutations could potentially arise from changes in the energetics of many other biosynthetic processes such as cofactor binding, oligomer formation, and chaperone interactions.</p>
<p>Together, our results reveal divergent, mechanism-dependent patterns of pairwise epistasis in the context of a misfolding-prone integral membrane protein. These findings provide novel insights as to how the unique biosynthetic constraints of integral membrane proteins can potentially lead to unique evolutionary patterns. Moreover, our results generally suggest that the deleterious effects of destabilizing mutations are partially attenuated in the context of unstable proteins. Additional investigations are needed to explore how stability-mediated epistasis is modified by other proteostatic constraints, such as the interactions of nascent proteins with cofactors and/ or molecular chaperones.</p>

<p>The expression of transiently expressed single mutants was carried out using a previously described pcDNA5 FRT expression vector containing mGnRHR cDNA with an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope and bicistronic eGFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis with PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Biochemical measurements of the membrane integration of TMD6 were carried out using a previously described pGEM vector containing modified leader peptidase (Lep), with TMDs of interest cloned into the H-segment (Fig. S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Mutations were introduced into the H-segment by site-directed mutagenesis with PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Plasmids were purified using a ZymoPURE Midiprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). DMS experiments were carried out using a previously described pcDNA5 FRT vector containing mGnRHR cDNA bearing an N-terminal influenza hemaglutinin (HA) epitope, followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and eGFP sequence, which was further modified to be compatible with recombination-based DMS approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). First, an attB recombination site was inserted in place of the CMV promoter by InFusion HD Cloning (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). To facilitate the creation of these libraries using nicking mutagenesis, a BbvCI restriction site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The V276T and W107A mutations were also introduced by site-directed mutagenesis with PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan).</p>
<p>To generate mutational libraries, a 10N unique molecular identifier (UMI), or “barcode,” was first inserted into the plasmid backbone using a previously described nicking mutagenesis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Nicking mutagenesis plasmid products were transformed into NEB 10-beta electrocompetent cells (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and purified using a ZymoPURE Midiprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). A programmed oligo pool (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) encoding all 19 amino acid substitutions at 85 residues throughout the mGnRHR sequence was then used to generate pools of single and double mutants in the context of WT, V276T, and W107A mGnRHR cDNA using a previously described nicking mutagenesis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The resulting plasmid products were transformed into NEB 10-beta electrocompetent cells (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and purified using a ZymoPURE Midiprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). To limit the number of mGnRHR variants per UMI, these libraries were then bottlenecked through an additional transformation in NEB Turbo electrocompetent cells (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and were again purified using a ZymoPURE Midiprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The resulting plasmid preparations contained detectable levels of a concatemer product, which were removed from the mutational libraries by gel purification using a Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Purified products were again transformed into either NEB 10-beta (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) or SIG10 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) electrocompetent cells, and purified with a ZymoPURE Midiprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA).</p>
<p>To associate each UMI with its corresponding GnRHR variant, the final plasmid libraries were also sequenced using PacBio SMRT sequencing. Briefly, plasmid libraries were first double-digested with PmlI and MfeI-HF restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), then purified using a Zymo DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Complete digestion was verified by analyzing the products on an agarose gel, purity was assessed with a Synergy Neo2 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT), and the final yield was quantified using a Qubit4 fluorometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). The 1537 bp fragment for each library, containing the 10N UMI and GnRHR open reading frame, was isolated on a BluePippin instrument (Sage Science, Beverly, MA). These fragments were then assembled into PacBio libraries and sequenced on the Sequel II system with a 30-hour runtime.</p>
<p>The sequence of each plasmid-derived fragment containing mGnRHR variants and their corresponding UMIs was determined by reconstructing the circular consensus sequences (CCS) for each independent well in the PacBio readout. mGnRHR libraries were sequenced to a depth of 1,825,010 wells for WT, 1,545,151 wells for V276T, and 1,497,359 wells for W107A. A minimum coverage of five passes around each circular fragment (subread) was required for incorporation of sequencing data from an individual well into the analysis. CCS were mapped to the reference open reading frame using minimap2. CCS that did not contain a complete 10-base UMI sequence or fully cover the target ORF were excluded from the analysis. Variations in the mGnRHR sequence of individual fragments were called using SAMtools. Reads were then grouped according to their UMI sequences. Given that insertion and deletion (indel) artifacts are prevalent within PacBio sequencing data, we only removed UMIs from the analysis if indels were detected at a specific position within the UMI in at least 10% of the subreads. Indels observed within the open reading frame were only called if their occurrence was judged to be statistically significant relative to the background indel rate for the reads according to a binomial test (<italic>p</italic> &lt;= .05). Codon substitutions encoded in our primer library (Table S3) were called within the mGnRHR open reading frame only if they were detected in at least 75% of the individual subreads. Only UMIs that were found to be associated with a single mGnRHR variant were included in the final analysis. Our final “dictionaries” for the WT, V276T, and W107A libraries contained 3,261, 531, and 4,962 unique UMIs, respectively, that could be indexed to a corresponding mGnRHR variant.</p>

Cells were then sorted into even quartiles based on the amount of DyLight 550 fluorescence (561 nm laser, 585/15 nm emission filter). Sorted cells were collected in complete media supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and plated in 10-cm tissue culture plates. Cells were allowed to grow to confluency and then were washed with 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Gibco, Grand Island, NY) and harvested with TrypLE Express protease (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). Cell pellets were frozen for subsequent analysis.</p>

<title>Extraction of Genomic DNA and Next Generation Sequencing</title>
<p>Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from cell pellets using the Sigma GenElute Mammalian gDNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). DNA amplicons for Illumina sequencing were produced from the gDNA using a previously described semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In order to selectively amplify recombined DNA, the first PCR utilized a primer which anneals upstream of the 10N UMI and a primer which anneals in the BFP-encoding region of the landing pad. Eight replicate PCRs were carried out with 2.5 μg of gDNA and HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). These PCRs were limited to 7 cycles to avoid PCR bias. PCR products were purified using a ZR-96 DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), and replicate products were then pooled. 10 μL of this first PCR product was then used as the template for a second PCR, which utilized primers that incorporate Illumina adapter sequences to both ends of the 10N UMI. To avoid PCR bias, these reactions were monitored by real-time PCR on a StepOne RT-PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) and terminated during mid-log amplification (17 or 18 cycles). Four replicate PCRs were carried out with HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) and SYBR Green fluorescent dye (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA). Replicate PCR products were then combined and purified with a Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). To further improve the yield and quality of the amplicons, an additional 6-cycle PCR was carried out with the HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) and primers that preserve the DNA sequence. These PCR products were then purified using a Zymo DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Finally, amplicon yield and quality were assessed using an Agilent 2200 TapeStation with D1000 tape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and a Synergy Neo2 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). Amplicons were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq150 flow cell, paired end, with 50% PhiX content.</p>

<title>Plasma Membrane Expression and Epistasis Measurements</title>
<p>Illumina sequencing of the recombined UMIs within each sorted cell fraction were matched to the corresponding GnRHR mutants using the PacBio sequencing data and subjected to previously described quality filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Estimations of PME for each mutant were then calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). PME measurements were averaged across two biological replicates. Within each library, the average fluorescence intensity values of the mutants were ranked and converted into a percentile. Mutants which differed in their percentile values by more than 25% across the two replicates were excluded from analysis. The use of percentile-based filtering overcomes intrinsic limitations associated with the distinct dynamic range constraints that occur because of the distinct surface immunostaining profiles of these three cellular libraries (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Intensity values that meet these criteria are highly correlated across the two biological replicates (average Spearman’s ρ=0.936 across the three libraries, Supplementary Figs. S3 &amp; S4). To facilitate the comparison of epistatic interactions within a common set of secondary mutations, we excluded mutants that did not pass quality filtering in all three libraries from our analysis. After data filtering, we obtained PME measurements for 251 mutants in all three libraries (Table S 4-6). These PME measurements were then utilized to calculate epistasis scores for the double mutants in the V276T and W107A libraries using the following equation:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="554866v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

where <italic>ε</italic> is the epistasis score, <italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>ab</italic></sub> is the fluorescence intensity of the double mutant relative to WT mGnRHR, <italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> is the fluorescence intensity of the single mutant in the WT library relative to WT mGnRHR, and <italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> is the fluorescence intensity of the background mutation (either V276T or W107A) relative to WT mGnRHR, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>

<title>Expression Measurements of Individual GnRHR Variants</title>
<p>HEK283T cells were obtained from ATCC and grown under the same conditions described above. GnRHR variants were transiently expressed in these cells, and the plasma membrane and intracellular expression of these variants was measured by flow cytometry, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).

<title>In vitro Translation of Chimeric Lep Proteins</title>
<p>Messenger RNA (mRNA) of chimeric Lep proteins was generated and used for <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Translation products were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The intensities of singly (<italic>G1</italic>) and doubly (<italic>G2</italic>) glycosylated protein were quantified by densitometry in ImageJ software. Apparent transfer free energy values representing transfer of the TMDs of interest from the translocon to the membrane were then calculated using the following equation:

<title>Structural Modeling of M. musculus GnRHR</title>
<p>The sequence of mGnRHR was obtained from Uniprot (accession number Q01776) and a homology model in the inactive state was generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Images were generated by structurally aligning this mGnRHR model to an experimentally determined inactive-state human GnRHR crystal structure (GNRHR, PDB 7BR3, 2.79 Å) using the Super command in PyMol (Schrödinger, Inc., New York, NY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>

<title>Computational Estimates for the Stability of mGnRHR Variants</title>
<p>Structural estimates for the effects of mutations on the stability of mGnRHR were determined using a previously described Rosetta based protocol featuring a membrane protein optimized energy function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Briefly, the homology model of mGnRHR described above was used as the starting structure for computational stability estimates. A spanfile describing the transmembrane regions was created for mGnRHR using OCTOPUS predictions from Topcons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). The homology model was transformed into membrane coordinates using the mp_transform application. An ensemble of structures of each variant and wildtype (50 iterations) was generated from the homology model. For variants containing two mutations, the mutations were both introduced at the same time. The ΔΔG for each variant was calculated by subtracting the average score of the three lowest scoring variant models from the average score of the three lowest scoring WT models (ΔΔG = ΔG<sub>mut</sub> -ΔG<sub>wt</sub>).</p>

<title>Unsupervised Learning</title>
<p>To classify mGnRHR variants based on their expression profiles, we first standardized their scores using the Standard Scaler tool from Python’s scikit-learn library in order to ensure that the clustering algorithms are not affected by the scale of the data. Next, we then reduced the dimensionality of the standardized data using UMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We then used a density-based clustering algorithm (HDBSCAN) to cluster variants based on their expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Unsupervised learning analyses were carried out based on deep mutational scanning measurements alone, and did not incorporate any structural and/ or energetic parameters.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The paper carries out an impressive and exhaustive non-sense mutagenesis using deep mutational scanning (DMS) of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor for the WT protein and two single point mutations that I) influence TM insertion (V267T) and ii) influence protein stability (W107A), and then measures the effect of these mutants on correct plasma membrane expression (PME).</p>
<p>Overall, most mutations decreased mGnRHR PME levels in all three backgrounds, indicating poor mutational tolerance under these conditions. The W107A variant wasn't really recoverable with low levels of plasma membrane localisation. For the V267T variant, most additional mutations were more deleterious than WT based on correct trafficking, indicating a synergistic effect. As one might expect, there was a higher degree of positive correlation between V267T/W107A mutants and other mutants located in TM regions, confirming that improper trafficking was a likely consequence of membrane protein co-translational folding. Nevertheless, context is important, as positive synergistic mutants in the V27T could be negative in the W107A background and vice versa. Taken together, this important study highlights the complexity of membrane protein folding in dissecting the mechanism-dependent impact of disease-causing mutations related to improper trafficking.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is a novel and exhaustive approach to dissecting how receptor mutations under different mutational backgrounds related to co-translational folding, could influence membrane protein trafficking.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The premise for the study requires an in-depth understanding of how the single-point mutations analysed affect membrane protein folding, but the single-point mutants used seem to lack proper validation. Furthermore, plasma membrane expression has been used as a proxy for incorrect membrane protein folding, but this not necessarily be the case, as even correctly folded membrane proteins may not be trafficked correctly, at least, under heterologous expression conditions. In addition, mutations can affect trafficking and potential post-translational modifications, like glycosylation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this paper, Chamness and colleagues make a pioneering effort to map epistatic interactions among mutations in a membrane protein. They introduce thousands of mutations to the mouse GnRH Receptor (GnRHR), either under wild-type background or two mutant backgrounds, representing mutations that destabilize GnRHR by distinct mechanisms. The first mutant background is W107A, destabilizing the tertiary fold, and the second, V276T, perturbing the efficiency of cotranslational insertion of TM6 to the membrane, which is essential for proper folding. They then measure the surface expression of these three mutant libraries, using it as a proxy for protein stability, since misfolded proteins do not typically make it to the plasma membrane. The resulting dataset is then used to shed light on how diverse mutations interact epistatically with the two genetic background mutations. Their main conclusion is that epistatic interactions vary depending on the degree of destabilization and the mechanism through which they perturb the protein. The mutation V276T forms primarily negative (aggravating) epistatic interactions with many mutations, as is common to destabilizing mutations in soluble proteins. Surprisingly, W107A forms many positive (alleviating) epistatic interactions with other mutations. They further show that the locations of secondary mutations correlate with the types of epistatic interactions they form with the above two mutants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Such a high throughput study for epistasis in membrane proteins is pioneering, and the results are indeed illuminating. Examples of interesting findings are that: (1) No single mutation can dramatically rescue the destabilization introduced by W107A. (2) Epistasis with a secondary mutation is strongly influenced by the degree of destabilization introduced by the primary mutation. (3) Misfolding caused by mis-insertion tends to be aggravated by further mutations. The discussion of how protein folding energetics affects epistasis (Fig. 7) makes a lot of sense and lays out an interesting biophysical framework for the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The major weakness comes from the potential limitations in the measurements of surface expression of severely misfolded mutants. This point is discussed quite fairly in the paper, in statements like &quot;the W107A variant already exhibits marginal surface immunostaining&quot; and many others. It seems that only about 5% of the W107A makes it to the plasma membrane compared to wild-type (Figures 2 and 3). This might be a low starting point from which to accurately measure the effects of secondary mutations.</p>
<p>Still, the authors claim that measurements of W107A double mutants &quot;still contain cellular subpopulations with surface immunostaining intensities that are well above or below that of the W107A single mutant, which suggests that this fluorescence signal is sensitive enough to detect subtle differences in the PME of these variants&quot;. I was not entirely convinced that this was true. Firstly, I think it would be important to test how much noise these measurements have and how much surface immunostaining the W107A mutant displays above the background of cells that do not express the protein at all. But more importantly, it is not clear if under this regimen surface expression still reports on stability/protein fitness. It is unknown if the W107A retains any function or folding at all. For example, it is possible that the low amount of surface protein represents misfolded receptors that escaped the ER quality control. The differential clustering of epistatic mutations (Fig. 6) provides some interesting insights as to the rules that dictate epistasis, but these too are dominated by the magnitude of destabilization caused by one of the mutations. In this case, the secondary mutations that had the most interesting epistasis were exceedingly destabilizing. With this in mind, it is hard to interpret the results that emerge regarding the epistatic interactions of W107A. Furthermore, the most significant positive epistasis is observed when W107A is combined with additional mutations that almost completely abolish surface expression. It is likely that either mutation destabilizes the protein beyond repair. Therefore, what we can learn from the fact that such mutations have positive epistasis is not clear to me. Based on this, I am not sure that another mutation that disrupts the tertiary folding more mildly would not yield different results.</p>
<p>With that said, I believe that the results regarding the epistasis of V276T with other mutations are strong and very interesting on their own.</p>
<p>Additionally, the study draws general conclusions from the characterization of only two mutations, W107A and V276T. At this point, it is hard to know if other mutations that perturb insertion or tertiary folding would behave similarly. This should be emphasized in the text.</p>
<p>Some statistical aspects of the study could be improved:</p>
<p>1. It would be nice to see the level of reproducibility of the biological replicates in a plot, such as scatter or similar, with correlation values that give a sense of the noise level of the measurements. This should be done before filtering out the inconsistent data.</p>
<p>2. The statements &quot;Variants bearing mutations within the C- terminal region (ICL3-TMD6-ECL3-TMD7) fare consistently worse in the V276T background relative to WT (Fig. 4 B &amp; E).&quot; and &quot;In contrast, mutations that are 210 better tolerated in the context of W107A mGnRHR are located 211 throughout the structure but are particularly abundant among residues 212 in the middle of the primary structure that form TMD4, ICL2, and ECL2 213 (Fig. 4 C &amp; F).&quot; are both hard to judge. Inspecting Figures 4B and C does not immediately show these trends, and importantly, a solid statistical test is missing here. In Figures 4E and F the locations of the different loops and TMs are not indicated on the structure, making these statements hard to judge.</p>
<p>3. The following statement lacks a statistical test: &quot;Notably, these 98 variants are enriched with TMD variants (65% TMD) relative to the overall set of 251 variants (45% TMD).&quot; Is this enrichment significant? Further in the same paragraph, the claim that &quot;In contrast to the sparse epistasis that is generally observed between mutations within soluble proteins, these findings suggest a relatively large proportion of random mutations form epistatic interactions in the context of unstable mGnRHR variants&quot;.

<p><bold>Response to the Reviews</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for these balanced, nuanced evaluations of our work concerning the observed epistatic trends and our interpretations of their mechanistic origins. Overall, we think the reviewers have done an excellent job at recognizing the novel aspects of our findings while also discussing the caveats associated with our interpretations of the biophysical effects of these mutations. We believe it is important to consider both of these aspects of our work in order to appreciate these advances and what sorts of pertinent questions remain.</p>
<p>Notably, both reviewers suggest that a lack of experimental approaches to compare the conformational properties of GnRHR variants weakens our claims. We would first humbly suggest that this constitutes a more general caveat that applies to nearly all investigations of the cellular misfolding of α-helical membrane proteins. Whether or not any current in vitro folding measurements report on conformational transitions that are relevant to cellular protein misfolding reactions remains an active area of debate (discussed further below). Nevertheless, while we concede that our structural and/ or computational evaluations of various mutagenic effects remain speculative, prevailing knowledge on the mechanisms of membrane protein folding suggest our mutations of interest (V276T and W107A) are highly unlikely to promote misfolding in precisely the same way. Thus, regardless of whether or not we were able experimentally compare the relevant folding energetics of GnRHR variants, we are confident that the distinct epistatic interactions formed by these mutations reflect variations in the misfolding mechanism and that they are distinct from the interactions that are observed in the context of stable proteins. In the following, we provide detailed considerations concerning these caveats in relation to the reviewers’ specific comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The paper carries out an impressive and exhaustive non-sense mutagenesis using deep mutational scanning (DMS) of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor for the WT protein and two single point mutations that I) influence TM insertion (V267T) and ii) influence protein stability (W107A), and then measures the effect of these mutants on correct plasma membrane expression (PME).</p>
<p>Overall, most mutations decreased mGnRHR PME levels in all three backgrounds, indicating poor mutational tolerance under these conditions. The W107A variant wasn't really recoverable with low levels of plasma membrane localisation. For the V267T variant, most additional mutations were more deleterious than WT based on correct trafficking, indicating a synergistic effect. As one might expect, there was a higher degree of positive correlation between V267T/W107A mutants and other mutants located in TM regions, confirming that improper trafficking was a likely consequence of membrane protein co-translational folding. Nevertheless, context is important, as positive synergistic mutants in the V27T could be negative in the W107A background and vice versa. Taken together, this important study highlights the complexity of membrane protein folding in dissecting the mechanism-dependent impact of disease-causing mutations related to improper trafficking.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>This is a novel and exhaustive approach to dissecting how receptor mutations under different mutational backgrounds related to co-translational folding, could influence membrane protein trafficking.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The premise for the study requires an in-depth understanding of how the single-point mutations analysed affect membrane protein folding, but the single-point mutants used seem to lack proper validation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given our limited understanding of the structural properties of misfolded membrane proteins, it is unclear whether the relevant conformational effects of these mutations can be unambiguously validated using current biochemical and/ or biophysical folding assays. X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and NMR spectroscopy measurements have demonstrated that many purified GPCRs retain native-like structural ensembles within certain detergent micelles, bicelles, and/ or nanodiscs. However, helical membrane protein folding measurements typically require titration with denaturing detergents to promote the formation of a denatured state ensemble (DSE), which will invariably retain considerable secondary structure. Given that the solvation provided by mixed micelles is clearly distinct from that of native membranes, it remains unclear whether these DSEs represent a reasonable proxy for the misfolded conformations recognized by cellular quality control (QC, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00532">https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00532</ext-link>). Thus, the use and interpretation of these systems for such purposes remains contentious in the membrane protein folding community. In addition to this theoretical issue, we are unaware of any instances in which GPCRs have been found to undergo reversible denaturation in vitro- a practical requirement for equilibrium folding measurements (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-051013-022926">https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-051013-022926</ext-link>). We note that, while the resistance of GPCRs to aggregation, proteolysis, and/ or mechanical unfolding have also been probed in micelles, it is again unclear whether the associated thermal, kinetic, and/ or mechanical stability should necessarily correspond to their resistance to cotranslational and/ or posttranslational misfolding. Thus, even if we had attempted to validate the computational folding predictions employed herein, we suspect that any resulting correlations with cellular expression may have justifiably been viewed by many as circumstantial. Simply put, we know very little about the non-native conformations are generally involved in the cellular misfolding of α-helical membrane proteins, much less how to measure their relative abundance. From a philosophical standpoint, we prefer to let cells tell us what sorts of broken protein variants are degraded by their QC systems, then do our best to surmise what this tells us about the relevant properties of cellular DSEs.</p>
<p>Despite this fundamental caveat, we believe that the chosen mutations and our interpretation of their relevant conformational effects are reasonably well-informed by current modeling tools and by prevailing knowledge on the physicochemical drivers of membrane protein folding and misfolding. Specifically, the mechanistic constraints of translocon-mediated membrane integration provide an understanding of the types of mutations that are likely to disrupt cotranslational folding. Though we are still learning about the protein complexes that mediate membrane translocation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05336-2">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05336-2</ext-link>), it is known that this underlying process is fundamentally driven by the membrane depth-dependent amino acid transfer free energies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125904">https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biophys.37.032807.125904</ext-link>). This energetic consideration suggests introducing polar side chains near the center of a nascent TMDs should almost invariably reduce the efficiency of topogenesis. To confirm this in the context of TMD6 specifically, we utilized a well-established biochemical reporter system to confirm that V276T attenuates its translocon-mediated membrane integration (Fig. S1)- at least in the context of a chimeric protein. We also constructed a glycosylation-based topology reporter for full-length GnRHR, but ultimately found its’ in vitro expression to be insufficient to detect changes in the nascent topological ensemble. In contrast to V276T, the W107A mutation is predicted to preserve the native topological energetics of GnRHR due to its position within a soluble loop region. W107A is also unlike V276T in that it clearly disrupts tertiary interactions that stabilize the native structure. This mutation should preclude the formation of a structurally conserved hydrogen bonding network that has been observed in the context of at least 25 native GPCR structures (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.5489">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.5489</ext-link>). However, without a relevant folding assay, the extent to which this network stabilizes the native GnRHR fold in cellular membranes remains unclear. Overall, we admit that these limitations have prevented us from measuring how much V276T alters the efficiency of GnRHR topogenesis, how much the W107A destabilizes the native fold, or vice versa. Nevertheless, given these design principles and the fact that both reduce the plasma membrane expression of GnRHR, as expected, we are highly confident that the structural defects generated by these mutations do, in fact, promote misfolding in their own ways. We also concede that the degree to which these mutagenic perturbations are indeed selective for specific folding processes is somewhat uncertain. However, it seems exceedingly unlikely that these mutations should disrupt topogenesis and/ or the folding of the native topomer to the exact same extent. From our perspective, this is the most important consideration with respect to the validity of the conclusions we have made in this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, plasma membrane expression has been used as a proxy for incorrect membrane protein folding, but this not necessarily be the case, as even correctly folded membrane proteins may not be trafficked correctly, at least, under heterologous expression conditions. In addition, mutations can affect trafficking and potential post-translational modifications, like glycosylation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While the reviewer is correct that the sorting of folded proteins within the secretory pathway is generally inefficient, it is also true that the maturation of nascent proteins within the ER generally bottlenecks the plasma membrane expression of most α-helical membrane proteins. Our group and several others have demonstrated that the efficiency of ER export generally appears to scale with the propensity of membrane proteins to achieve their correct topology and/ or to achieve their native fold (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5b03743">https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.5b03743</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b08243">https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b08243</ext-link>). Notably, these investigations all involved proteins that contain native glycosylation and various other post-translational modification sites. While we cannot rule out that certain specific combinations of mutations may alter expression through their perturbation of post-translational GnRHR modifications, we feel confident that the general trends we have observed across hundreds of variants predominantly reflect changes in folding and cellular QC. This interpretation is supported by the relationship between observed trends in variant expression and Rosetta-based stability calculations, which we identified using unbiased unsupervised machine learning approaches (compare Figs. 6B &amp; 6D).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Chamness and colleagues make a pioneering effort to map epistatic interactions among mutations in a membrane protein. They introduce thousands of mutations to the mouse GnRH Receptor (GnRHR), either under wild-type background or two mutant backgrounds, representing mutations that destabilize GnRHR by distinct mechanisms. The first mutant background is W107A, destabilizing the tertiary fold, and the second, V276T, perturbing the efficiency of cotranslational insertion of TM6 to the membrane, which is essential for proper folding. They then measure the surface expression of these three mutant libraries, using it as a proxy for protein stability, since misfolded proteins do not typically make it to the plasma membrane. The resulting dataset is then used to shed light on how diverse mutations interact epistatically with the two genetic background mutations. Their main conclusion is that epistatic interactions vary depending on the degree of destabilization and the mechanism through which they perturb the protein. The mutation V276T forms primarily negative (aggravating) epistatic interactions with many mutations, as is common to destabilizing mutations in soluble proteins. Surprisingly, W107A forms many positive (alleviating) epistatic interactions with other mutations. They further show that the locations of secondary mutations correlate with the types of epistatic interactions they form with the above two mutants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Such a high throughput study for epistasis in membrane proteins is pioneering, and the results are indeed illuminating. Examples of interesting findings are that: (1) No single mutation can dramatically rescue the destabilization introduced by W107A. (2) Epistasis with a secondary mutation is strongly influenced by the degree of destabilization introduced by the primary mutation. (3) Misfolding caused by mis-insertion tends to be aggravated by further mutations. The discussion of how protein folding energetics affects epistasis (Fig. 7) makes a lot of sense and lays out an interesting biophysical framework for the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness comes from the potential limitations in the measurements of surface expression of severely misfolded mutants. This point is discussed quite fairly in the paper, in statements like &quot;the W107A variant already exhibits marginal surface immunostaining&quot; and many others. It seems that only about 5% of the W107A makes it to the plasma membrane compared to wild-type (Figures 2 and 3). This might be a low starting point from which to accurately measure the effects of secondary mutations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises an excellent point that we considered at length during the analysis of these data and the preparation of the manuscript. Though we remain confident in the integrity of these measurements and the corresponding analyses, we now realize this aspect of the data merits further discussion and documentation in our forthcoming revision, in which we will outline the following specific lines of reasoning.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Still, the authors claim that measurements of W107A double mutants &quot;still contain cellular subpopulations with surface immunostaining intensities that are well above or below that of the W107A single mutant, which suggests that this fluorescence signal is sensitive enough to detect subtle differences in the PME of these variants&quot;. I was not entirely convinced that this was true.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We made this statement based on the simple observation that the surface immunostaining intensities across the population of recombinant cells expressing the library of W107A double mutants was consistently broader than that of recombinant cells expressing W107A GnRHR alone (see Author response image 1 for reference). Given that the recombinant cellular library represents a mix of cells expressing ~1600 individual variants that are each present at low abundance, the pronounced tails within this distribution presumably represent the composite staining of many small cellular subpopulations that express collections of variants that deviate from the expression of W107A to an extent that is significant enough to be visible on a log intensity plot.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Firstly, I think it would be important to test how much noise these measurements have and how much surface immunostaining the W107A mutant displays above the background of cells that do not express the protein at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For reference, the average surface immunostaining intensity of HEK293T cells transiently expressing W107A GnRHR was 2.2-fold higher than that of the IRES-eGFP negative, untransfected cells within the same sample- the WT immunostaining intensity was 9.5-fold over background by comparison. Similarly, recombinant HEK293T cells expressing the W107A double mutant library had an average surface immunostaining intensity that was 2.6-fold over background across the two DMS trials. Thus, while the surface immunostaining of this variant is certainly diminished, we were still able to reliably detect W107A at the plasma membrane even under distinct expression regimes. We will include these and other signal-to-noise metrics for each experiment in a new table in the revised version of this manuscript.</p>
<p>Beyond considerations related to intensity, we also previously noticed the relative intensity values for W107A double mutants exhibited considerable precision across our two biological replicates. If signal were too poor to detect changes in variant expression, we would have expected a plot of the intensity values across these two replicates to form a scatter. Instead, we found DMS intensity values for individual variants to be highly correlated from one replicate to the next (Pearson’s R= 0.97, see Author response image 2 for reference). This observation empirically demonstrates that this assay consistently differentiated between variants that exhibit slightly enhanced immunostaining from those that have even lower immunostaining than W107A GnRHR.</p>

<p>But more importantly, it is not clear if under this regimen surface expression still reports on stability/protein fitness. It is unknown if the W107A retains any function or folding at all. For example, it is possible that the low amount of surface protein represents misfolded receptors that escaped the ER quality control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we believe that such questions are outside the scope of this work, we certainly agree that it is entirely possible that some of these variants bypass QC without achieving their native fold. This topic is quite interesting to us but is quite challenging to assess in the context of GPCRs, which have complex fitness landscapes that involve their propensity to distinguish between different ligands, engage specific components associated with divergent downstream signaling pathways, and navigate between endocytic recycling/ degradation pathways following activation. In light of the inherent complexity of GPCR function, we humbly suggest our choice of a relatively simple property of an otherwise complex protein may be viewed as a virtue rather than a shortcoming. Protein fitness is typically cast as the product of abundance and activity. Rather than measuring an oversimplified, composite fitness metric, we focused on one variable (plasma membrane expression) and its dominant effector (folding). We believe restraining the scope in this manner was key for the elucidation of clear mechanistic insights.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The differential clustering of epistatic mutations (Fig. 6) provides some interesting insights as to the rules that dictate epistasis, but these too are dominated by the magnitude of destabilization caused by one of the mutations. In this case, the secondary mutations that had the most interesting epistasis were exceedingly destabilizing. With this in mind, it is hard to interpret the results that emerge regarding the epistatic interactions of W107A. Furthermore, the most significant positive epistasis is observed when W107A is combined with additional mutations that almost completely abolish surface expression. It is likely that either mutation destabilizes the protein beyond repair. Therefore, what we can learn from the fact that such mutations have positive epistasis is not clear to me. Based on this, I am not sure that another mutation that disrupts the tertiary folding more mildly would not yield different results. With that said, I believe that the results regarding the epistasis of V276T with other mutations are strong and very interesting on their own.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. In light of our results we believe it is virtually certain that the secondary mutations characterized herein would be likely to form distinct epistatic interactions with mutations that are only mildly destabilizing. Indeed, this insight reflects one of the key takeaway messages from this work- stability-mediated epistasis is difficult to generalize because it should depend on the extent to which each mutation changes the stability (ΔΔG) as well as initial stability of the WT/ reference sequence (ΔG, see Figure 7). Frankly, we are not so sure we would have pieced this together as clearly had we not had the fortune (or misfortune?) of including such a destructive mutation like W107A as a point of reference.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Additionally, the study draws general conclusions from the characterization of only two mutations, W107A and V276T. At this point, it is hard to know if other mutations that perturb insertion or tertiary folding would behave similarly. This should be emphasized in the text.</p>

<p>We agree and will be sure to emphasize this point in the revised manuscript.</p>
