<title>Abstract</title><p>Biomechanical cues play an essential role in sculpting organ formation. Comprehending how cardiac cells perceive and respond to biomechanical forces is a biological process with significant medical implications that remains poorly understood. Here we show that biomechanical forces activate endocardial <italic>id2b</italic> (inhibitor of DNA binding 2b) expression, thereby promoting cardiac contractility and valve formation. Taking advantage of the unique strengths of zebrafish, particularly the viability of embryos lacking heartbeats, we systematically compared the transcriptomes of hearts with impaired contractility to those of control hearts. This comparison identified <italic>id2b</italic> as a gene sensitive to blood flow. By generating a knockin reporter line, our results unveiled the presence of <italic>id2b</italic> in the endocardium, and its expression is sensitive to both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. Furthermore, <italic>id2b</italic> loss-of-function resulted in progressive heart malformation and early lethality. Combining RNA-seq analysis, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography, we discovered profound impairment in atrioventricular (AV) valve formation and defective excitation-contraction coupling in <italic>id2b</italic> mutants. Mechanistically, deletion of <italic>id2b</italic> reduced AV endocardial cell proliferation and led to a progressive increase in retrograde blood flow. In the myocardium, <italic>id2b</italic> directly interacted with the bHLH component <italic>tcf3b</italic> (transcription factor 3b) to restrict its activity. Inactivating <italic>id2b</italic> unleashed its inhibition on <italic>tcf3b</italic>, resulted in enhanced repressor activity of <italic>tcf3b</italic>, which subsequently suppressed the expression of <italic>nrg1</italic> (neuregulin 1), an essential mitogen for heart development. Overall, our findings identify <italic>id2b</italic> as an endocardial cell-specific, biomechanical signaling-sensitive gene, which mediates intercellular communications between endocardium and myocardium to sculpt heart morphogenesis and function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The heart develops with continuous contraction, and biomechanical cues play an essential role in cardiac morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Blood flow is directly sensed by the surrounding endocardium, which undergoes multiscale remodeling during zebrafish heart development. In the atrioventricular canal (AVC) endocardium, oscillatory flow promotes valvulogenesis through transient receptor potential (TRP) channel-mediated expression of Krüppel-like factor 2a (<italic>klf2a</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, mechanical forces trigger ATP-dependent activation of purinergic receptors, inducing expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (<italic>nfatc1</italic>) and subsequent valve formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In the chamber endocardium, blood flow induces endocardial cells to adopt chamber- and region-specific cell morphology during cardiac ballooning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. A recent study further emphasizes that blood flow is essential for endocardial cell accrual in assembling the outflow tract<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Beyond their role in endocardial cells, proper biomechanical cues are indispensable for shaping the myocardium. For instance, in contraction compromised <italic>tnnt2a</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and <italic>myh6</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> mutants, trabeculation is markedly reduced. Moreover, apart from the tissue-scale regulatory effect, the shape changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> and myofibril content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> at the single-cardiomyocyte level are also sculpted by the interplay of contractility and blood flow in the developing heart.</p>
<p>In ventricular myocardium morphogenesis, biomechanical forces coordinate intra-organ communication between endocardial and myocardial cells by regulating BMP, Nrg/Erbb, and Notch signaling. The Nrg-Erbb axis stands as one of the most extensively studies signaling pathway mediating cell-cell communications in the heart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In particular, endocardial Notch activity induced by cardiac contraction promotes the expression of Nrg, which then secretes into the extracellular space, binding to Erbb2/4 receptor tyrosine kinases on cardiomyocyte and promoting their delamination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In agreement with the pivotal role of this signaling pathway in heart development, genetic mutations in zebrafish <italic>nrg2a</italic> and <italic>erbb2</italic> result in severely compromised trabeculae formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The development of cardiomyocytes encompasses the specification of subcellular structure, metabolic state, gene expression profile, and functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The rhythmic contraction of cardiomyocytes relies on precisely regulated excitation-contraction coupling (E-C coupling), transducing electrical activity into contractile forces. This intricate signaling cascade involves membrane action potential, calcium signaling, and sarcomeric structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Specifically, membrane depolarization triggers the opening of L-type calcium channel (LTCC), allowing calcium influx. The calcium signaling then activates the ryanodine receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane, releasing additional calcium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. E-C coupling is essential for heart development, as evidenced by the complete silence of the ventricle and reduced cardiomyocyte number in <italic>cacna1c</italic> (LTCC α1 subunit in zebrafish) mutant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Beyond its role in modulating cardiac structure formation, previous studies indicate that Nrg-Erbb2 signaling is also necessary for cardiac function, as <italic>erbb2</italic> mutants exhibit severely compromised fractional shortening and an immature conduction pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, the precise mechanism through which the blood flow-Nrg-Erbb2 axis controls cardiomyocyte functionality remains poorly understood.</p>

<title>Transcriptome analysis identifies <italic>id2b</italic> as a blood flow sensitive gene</title>
<p>Blood circulation is dispensable for early embryonic development in zebrafish, presenting an ideal model to investigate biomechanical cues influencing heart morphogenesis. To identify genes affected by cardiac contraction or blood flow, we treated <italic>myl7:mCherry</italic> zebrafish embryos with tricaine to inhibit cardiac contractility from 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to 96 hpf. Hearts from control and tricaine-treated zebrafish embryos were manually collected under a fluorescence stereoscope as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Subsequently, approximately 1,000 hearts from each group were subjected to RNA sequencing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). A total of 4,530 genes with differential expression were identified, comprising 2,013 up-regulated and 2,517 down-regulated genes. With a specific focus on identifying key transcription factors (TFs) affected by perturbing biomechanical forces, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) encoding TFs were enriched into signaling pathways through KEGG analysis. Interestingly, our analysis identified several pathways known to be involved in heart development, including the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling and Notch signaling pathways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In particular, the scaled expression levels of the top 6 DEGs (|log<sub>2</sub>FC| ≥ 0.585), exhibiting up- or down-regulation, were listed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1C</xref>). Notably, as a component of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family, <italic>id2b</italic> is the zebrafish homolog of the mammalian <italic>Id2</italic> gene, functioning as a transcriptional repressor. Intriguingly, <italic>Id2</italic> has been shown to regulate the formation of the murine AV valve, a process notably influenced by alterations in blood flow directionality. Consequently, we interrogated the expression and function of <italic>id2b</italic> in developing embryos.</p>

<p>Through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis on purified embryonic hearts, we observed a ∼50% reduction in <italic>id2b</italic> mRNA level following tricaine treatment from 72 to 96 hpf compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, in situ hybridization was performed to visualize <italic>id2b</italic> expression under tricaine or 10 uM blebbistatin (an inhibitor of sarcomeric function and cardiac contractility) treatment from 48 to 72 or from 72 to 96 hpf. Consistently, our results showed a reduction in <italic>id2b</italic> signal in contraction-deficient hearts compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, injection of a previously characterized <italic>tnnt2</italic> morpholino at the 1-cell stage also led to compromised contraction and diminished expression of <italic>id2b</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that biomechanical cues are essential for activating <italic>id2b</italic> in embryonic hearts.</p>

<title>Visualization of the spatiotemporal expression of <italic>id2b</italic> in developing embryos</title>
<p>Due to technical challenges in visualizing the cell-type-specific expression of <italic>id2b</italic> in the developing heart using whole-mount in situ hybridization, we employed an intron targeting-mediated approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> to generate a knockin <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> line. This method allowed us to achieve specific labeling without perturbing the integrity and function of the endogenous gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Comparison of <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> fluorescence with in situ hybridization at 24, 48, and 72 hpf revealed a substantial recapitulation of the eGFP signal with that of endogenous <italic>id2b</italic> expression. The fluorescence was notably enriched in the heart, brain, retina, and notochord (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), mirroring observations from a previously reported <italic>id2b</italic> transgenic line generated through BAC-mediated recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To further elucidate the spatiotemporal expression of <italic>id2b</italic> in developing hearts, we crossed <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> with <italic>myl7:mCherry</italic> or <italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic>, labelling cardiomyocytes or endocardial cells, respectively.

In sharp contrast, clear co-localization between <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> and <italic>kdrl:mCherry</italic> was evident at 48, 72, and 96 hpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).

<p>We then explored how cardiac contraction modulated <italic>id2b</italic> expression. Given that endocardial cells can sense blood flow through primary cilia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we used a characterized morpholino<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> to knockdown <italic>ift88</italic>, an intraflagellar transporter essential for primary cilia formation. Previously work demonstrated a complete loss of primary cilia in endocardial cells upon <italic>ift88</italic> knockdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. As expected, a significant decrease in <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> intensity was observed in the chamber and AVC endocardium of <italic>ift88</italic> morphants compared to control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, D), suggesting that biomechanical forces promote the expression of <italic>id2b</italic> via primary cilia. In the developing heart, a central hub for mediating biomechanical cues is the Klf2 gene, which includes the <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>klf2b</italic> paralogues in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Previous studies in mammals and zebrafish have highlighted the essential role of Klf2 transcription factor activity in cardiac valve and myocardial wall formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. As a flow-responsive gene, <italic>klf2a</italic> expression has been observed throughout the entire endocardium, evidenced by mRNA expression and transgenic studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Interestingly, in situ hybridization on 48 and 72 hpf <italic>klf2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>klf2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos unveiled a drastic decrease in <italic>id2b</italic> expression compared with wild-type zebrafish (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), supporting the notion that <italic>klf2</italic>-mediated biomechanical signaling is essential for activating <italic>id2b</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Because <italic>id2b</italic> has been reported to be a target gene of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, we explored whether BMP also played a role in regulating <italic>id2b</italic> when blood flow was perturbed. To this end, we knocked down <italic>bmp2b</italic>, <italic>bmp4</italic>, and <italic>bmp7a</italic> in 1-cell stage <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> embryos and found a significant reduction in fluorescence signal in morpholino-injected hearts compared to control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1A, B), suggesting that <italic>id2b</italic> is a target gene of BMP signaling during early embryonic development. Considering that heartbeats in zebrafish commence at approximately 22 hpf, we treated embryos with the BMP inhibitor Dorsomorphin from 24 to 48 hpf or from 36 to 60 hpf. While the number of endocardial cells was slightly reduced upon Dorsomorphin exposure, as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, surprisingly, quantification of the average <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> fluorescence intensity in individual endocardial cells revealed no significant differences between Dorsomorphin and DMSO controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1C, D).</p>
<p>We further visualized BMP activity using the <italic>Bre:dGFP</italic> reporter line. Confocal images revealed strong fluorescence in the myocardium at 72 hpf, with minimal signal present in the endocardium except for the AVC endothelium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1E). Moreover, after tricaine treatment, endocardial <italic>Bre:dGFP</italic> slightly increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1E), as opposed to the reduced <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> signal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B). Likewise, endocardial <italic>Bre:dGFP</italic> intensity was barely affected after completely blocking contraction with <italic>tnnt2a</italic> MO injection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1E). These observations align with previous work using pSmad-1/5/8 as a readout of BMP activity, indicating that endocardial BMP signaling is independent of blood flow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Collectively, these results suggest that BMP signaling and blood flow modulate <italic>id2b</italic> expression in a developmental-stage-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Compromised AV valve formation in <italic>id2b</italic> mutants</title>
<p>To investigate the role of the contractility-<italic>id2b</italic> axis in zebrafish heart development, we generated a loss-of-function mutant line using CRISPR/Cas9. A pair of sgRNAs designed to target exon 1 was injected with zCas9 protein into 1-cell-stage embryos. Consequently, we identified a mutant allele with a 157 bp truncation, leading to the generation of a premature stop codon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The overall morphology of <italic>id2b</italic> mutants (<italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) remained unaltered compared to <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic> siblings at 72 and 96 hpf (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). However, <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish were subjected to early lethality starting around 31 weeks post-fertilization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Strikingly, pericardial edema was observed in 20% (9/45) of adult <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, top). Upon dissecting hearts from these <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish, a prominent enlargement in the atrium was detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom). Histological analysis further revealed malformation in the AV valves of these <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants compared to the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Upon closer inspection of AV valve anatomy, we noted that the superior and inferior leaflets were significantly thinner, comprising only 1-2 layer of cells in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>zebrafish with an enlarged atrium. This was in sharp contrast to <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic> zebrafish, which exhibited multilayers of cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Subsequent examination of the remaining 80% of <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish (36/45) that did not display prominent pericardial edema also revealed an enlarged atrium and AV valve malformation, albeit to a lesser extent (data not shown).

<p>To further interrogate the effect of <italic>id2b</italic> inactivation on AV valve formation and function, we analyzed the number of AVC endothelial cells using <italic>kdrl:nucGFP</italic>. At 96 hpf, a reduced number of <italic>kdrl:nucGFP<sup>+</sup></italic> cells was detected in the AVC region of <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos compared with <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1A, B).

Subsequently, we assessed hemodynamic flow by conducting time-lapse imaging of red blood cells labelled by <italic>gata1:dsred</italic>.

Additionally, we performed echocardiography to analyze blood flow in adult zebrafish as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> hearts, prominent retrograde blood flow was detected in the AVC region (8/13) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), while unidirectional blood flow was observed in <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (10/10) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

Consistently, the superior and inferior leaflets were much thinner in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> exhibiting retrograde flow compared with control fish (data not shown).

<p>Although similar defects in AV valve formation have been reported in both <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>nfatc1</italic> mutants, they do not display noticeable pericardial edema at the adult stage, nor do they experience early lethality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether other cardiac properties have also been affected by <italic>id2b</italic> loss-of-function. To this end, we employed RNA-seq analysis on purified embryonic <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic> hearts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1). As expected, enrichment analysis of DEGs demonstrated that the top-ranked anatomical structures affected by <italic>id2b</italic> deletion included the heart valve, the compact layer of ventricle, and the atrioventricular canal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1A). Interestingly, <italic>id2b</italic> inactivation also impacted phenotypes such as cardiac muscle contraction and heart contraction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 1B). Therefore, we investigated cardiac contractile function through time-lapse imaging on the <italic>myl7:mCherry</italic> background. At 120 hpf, a significant decrease in cardiac contractility was observed in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, as evidenced by reduced fractional area change and heart rate, compared with <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>).

These functional defects in <italic>id2b</italic>-deleted hearts could not be attributed to differences in cardiomyocyte number, as we counted cardiomyocytes using the <italic>myl7:H2A-mCherry</italic> line and found no apparent changes between <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>id2b<sup>+/+</sup></italic> embryos at 72 and 120 hpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>-figure supplement 2A, B).

<p>The key functional unit that transmits electrical activity to contractile function is E-C coupling.

During heart development, blood flow operates through primary cilia, initiating endocardial <italic>id2b</italic> expression.

However, in the absence of <italic>id2b</italic>, <italic>tcf3b</italic> inhibits <italic>nrg1</italic> expression.

<p>To understand how the altered interaction between <italic>id2b</italic> and <italic>tcf3b</italic> influences <italic>nrg1</italic> expression, we analyzed the promoter region of zebrafish <italic>nrg1</italic> using JASPAR and identified two potential <italic>tcf3b</italic> binding sites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Subsequently, a DNA fragment containing the zebrafish <italic>nrg1</italic> promoter region was subcloned into a vector carrying the luciferase reporter gene. Co-injection of this construct with <italic>tcf3b</italic> mRNA into 1-cell stage embryos resulted in a significant decrease in luciferase signal. Conversely, co-injection with a previously characterized <italic>tcf3b</italic> morpholino led to enhanced luciferase intensity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest a possible mechanism by which <italic>tcf3b</italic> represses <italic>nrg1</italic> expression in zebrafish.</p>
<p>Lastly, injecting <italic>tcf3b</italic> morpholino into <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>embryos was performed to assess whether attenuating the overactive <italic>tcf3b</italic> in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> could restore the expression level of <italic>nrg1</italic>. qRT-PCR analysis of purified 72 hpf hearts revealed a partial restoration of the diminished <italic>nrg1</italic> expression in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> upon <italic>tcf3b</italic> inhibition (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that biomechanical cues activate endocardial <italic>id2b</italic> expression, leading to its interaction with <italic>tcf3b</italic> to alleviate repression on the <italic>nrg1</italic>promoter. Consequently, the depletion of <italic>id2b</italic> unleashes <italic>tcf3b</italic>’s repressor activity, leading to a reduction in <italic>nrg1</italic> expression, which further acts through <italic>erbb2</italic> to regulate cardiomyocyte function (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Biomechanical forces play an essential role in regulating the patterning and function of the heart. At AVC, oscillatory flow promotes the expression of <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>nfatc1</italic> to modulate valve morphogenesis. In chamber endocardium, blood flow induces endocardial cells to acquire distinct cell morphology. However, it still lacks a systematic analysis of the transcriptome underlying compromised heartbeats. In the present study, we analyzed embryonic zebrafish hearts without contractility and identified genes that are regulated by biomechanical forces. Specifically, our results unveiled the endocardial-specific expression of <italic>id2b</italic>, which was tightly regulated by flow-sensitive primary cilia-<italic>klf2</italic> axis. Genetic deletion of <italic>id2b</italic> resulted in compromised valve formation and progressive atrium enlargement. In addition, a reduction in heart rate and contractile force was observed in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, owing to decreased expression of LTCC α1 subunit <italic>cacna1c</italic>. Mechanistically, <italic>id2b</italic> interacts with bHLH transcription factor <italic>tcf3</italic>b to limit its repressor activity. Hence genetic deletion of <italic>id2b</italic> unleashes <italic>tcf3</italic>b activity, which further represses endocardial <italic>nrg1</italic> expression. As a result, Injection of <italic>nrg1</italic> mRNA partially rescues the phenotype of <italic>id2b</italic> deletion. Overall, our findings identify <italic>id2b</italic> as a novel mediator that regulate the interplay between endocardium and myocardium during heart development.</p>
<p>In mammals, the deletion of <italic>Id2</italic> leads to malformations in the arterial and venous poles of the heart, as well as affects AV valve morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Interestingly, approximately 20% perinatal lethality is reported in <italic>Id2</italic> knockout mice, exhibiting AV septal defects and membranous ventricular septal defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Remarkably, pericardial edema is evident in 20% of adult <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> zebrafish, with a prominent enlargement of the atrium. The superior and inferior leaflets of AV valves in <italic>id2b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants are significantly thinner compared to the control. Therefore, our results suggest that <italic>id2b</italic> may play a similar role in regulating AV valve formation in zebrafish as its mammalian orthologue <italic>Id2</italic>. It is proposed that the loss of <italic>Id2</italic> in mice results in compromised endocardial proliferation and aberrant endothelial-to mesenchymal transformation (EMT), collectively leading to defective valve morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which <italic>id2b</italic> loss-of-function causes a reduction in leaflet thickness in zebrafish remains to be determined in future studies.</p>
<p><italic>id2b</italic> has been recognized as a target gene of the BMP signaling pathway. As expected, knockdown of <italic>bmp2b</italic>, <italic>bmp4</italic>, and <italic>bmp7a</italic> at 1-cell stage confirms that endocardial <italic>id2b</italic> expression is controlled by BMP activity during early embryonic development. Surprisingly, treatment with the BMP inhibitor Dorsomorphin at 24 and 36 hpf, when cardiac contractions have already initiated, fails to alter <italic>id2b</italic> expression in the endocardium, suggesting that BMP is dispensable for <italic>id2b</italic> activation at these stages. Instead, endocardial <italic>id2b</italic> expression is reduced upon loss-of-function of <italic>klf2a</italic>, <italic>klf2b</italic>, and <italic>ift88</italic>, suggesting an essential role of the primary cilia-<italic>klf2</italic> axis in mediating <italic>id2b</italic> activation. In endocardial cells, Trp, Piezo, and ATP-dependent P2X/P2Y channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> are well-established sensors for biomechanical stimulation. The activation of these channels further promotes the activities of Klf2 and Nfatc1 to drive heart development and valvulogenesis. However, whether these channels are also required for the activation of <italic>id2b</italic> warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>The Nrg-Erbb signaling plays an essential role in regulating heart morphogenesis and function. In the mammalian heart, the genetic deletion of Nrg1 or Erbb2 results in severely perturbed cardiac trabeculae formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Zebrafish <italic>erbb2</italic> mutants exhibit a similar defect in cardiomyocyte proliferation and trabeculation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic>nrg1</italic> mutant zebrafish display grossly normal cardiac structure during early embryonic devolpment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, zebrafish <italic>nrg2a</italic> loss-of-function leads to defective trabeculae formation, suggesting that <italic>nrg2a</italic> is the predominant ligand secreted from endocardium, promoting ventricular morphogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In the adult stage, perivascular cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> or regulatory T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>-derived <italic>nrg1</italic> promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration. Hence, the specific ligand/receptor and the spatiotemporal regulation of the Nrg-Erbb axis appear to be more complicated in both embryonic and adult zebrafish. Interestingly, the <italic>nrg1</italic> mutant heart exhibits a defect in cardiac nerve expansion and heart maturation at the juvenile stage despite normal cardiac structure formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, suggesting its potential role in regulating cardiac function. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of <italic>nrg1</italic> in embryonic endocardial cells is influenced by biomechanical cues and <italic>id2b</italic> activity. This signaling axis is essential for coordinating endocardium-myocardium interaction and establishing proper cardiac function.</p>

<p>All animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Zhejiang University School of Medicine.

The following zebrafish lines were used in this study: <italic>Tg(myl7:mCherry)<sup>sd7</sup></italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, <italic>Tg(myl7:H2A-mCherry)<sup>sd12</sup></italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, <italic>Tg(kdrl:mCherry)<sup>S896</sup></italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup><italic>, Tg(kdrl: nucGFP)<sup>y7</sup></italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, <italic>Tg(Bre:d2GFP)<sup>mw30</sup></italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, and <italic>Tg(actb2:Gcamp6s).</italic> To generate the <italic>id2b</italic> mutant, two short guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting exon 1 were generated using the MAXIscript T7 transcription kit (ambion, AM1314). The sgRNAs were as follows: sgRNA1: 5’ - GAAGGCAGTCAGTCCGGTG - 3’; sgRNA2: 5’ - GAACCGGAGCGTGAGTAAGA - 3’. The two sgRNAs, along with zCas9 protein, were co-injected into one-cell stage embryos. Embryos were raised to adulthood and crossed to wild-type zebrafish to obtain F<sub>1</sub> progenies. Through PCR analysis, a mutant line with a 157 bp truncation was identified.</p>
<p>The knock-in <italic>id2b:eGFP</italic> line was generated using a previously reported method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Briefly, three sgRNAs were designed to target the intron of <italic>id2b</italic> (sgRNA1: 5’ - GAGACAAATATCTACTAGTG - 3’; sgRNA2: 5’ - GTTGAACACATGACGATATT - 3’; sgRNA3: 5’ - GCACAACTTAGATTTCAAGT - 3’). Co-injection of each individual sgRNA with zCas9 protein into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos yielded varying cleavage efficiency. Since sgRNA2 displayed the highest gene editing efficiency, it was selected for subsequent studies. Next, a donor plasmid containing the sgRNA targeting sequence of the intron, exon 2 of <italic>id2b</italic>, and P2A-eGFP was generated. Co-injection of sgRNA, donor plasmid, and zCas9 protein into one-cell stage embryos led to concurrent cleavage of the sgRNA targeting sites in both the zebrafish genome and the donor plasmid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Accordingly, eGFP fluorescence was observed in injected 24 hpf zebrafish embryos, indicating the incorporation of the donor. The insertion of the <italic>id2b</italic>-p2A-eGFP donor into the genome was confirmed by PCR analysis with primers recognizing target site or donor sequences, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Embryos with mosaic eGFP expression were raised to adulthood and crossed with wild-type zebrafish to obtain F<sub>1</sub> progenies. Overall, two founders were identified. The junction region of the F<sub>1</sub> embryos was sequenced to determine the integration sites. Although the two founders had slightly different integration sites in the intron, the expression pattern and fluorescence intensity of eGFP were indistinguishable between the two lines.</p>

The relative renilla luciferase activity, normalized by firefly luciferase activity, served as an indicator of <italic>nrg1</italic> expression level under the influence of <italic>tcf3b</italic> overexpression or reduction.</p>

<title>Image processing and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization images were captured with a Leica M165FC stereomicroscope. Live imaging of zebrafish embryos involved mounting anesthetized embryos in 1% low melting agarose (Sangon Biotech, A600015) and manually oriented them for optimal visual access to the heart. Confocal images were obtained with a Nikon Ti2 confocal microscope. Fluorescence intensity and cell number counting were processed using Nikon NIS Elements AR analysis and Image J software. Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad prism 8 software. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests was used to determine statistical significance. Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Chen et al. identified the role of endocardial id2b expression in cardiac contraction and valve formation through pharmaceutical, genetic, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography analyses. CRISPR/Cas9 generated id2b mutants demonstrated defective AV valve formation, excitation-contraction coupling, reduced endocardial cell proliferation in AV valve, retrograde blood flow, and lethal effects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Their methods, data and analyses broadly support their claims.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The molecular mechanism is somewhat preliminary.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Biomechanical forces, such as blood flow, are crucial for organ formation, including heart development. This study by Shuo Chen et al. aims to understand how cardiac cells respond to these forces. They used zebrafish as a model organism due to its unique strengths, such as the ability to survive without heartbeats, and conducted transcriptomic analysis on hearts with impaired contractility. They thereby identified id2b as a gene regulated by blood flow and is crucial for proper heart development, in particular, for the regulation of myocardial contractility and valve formation. Using both in situ hybridization and transgenic fish they showed that id2b is specifically expressed in the endocardium, and its expression is affected by both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. They further generated a null mutant of id2b to show that loss of id2b results in heart malformation and early lethality in zebrafish. Atrioventricular (AV) and excitation-contraction coupling were also impaired in id2b mutants. Mechanistically, they demonstrate that Id2b interacts with the transcription factor Tcf3b to restrict its activity. When id2b is deleted, the repressor activity of Tcf3b is enhanced, leading to suppression of the expression of nrg1 (neuregulin 1), a key factor for heart development. Importantly, injecting tcf3b morpholino into id2b-/- embryos partially restores the reduced heart rate. Moreover, treatment of zebrafish embryos with the Erbb2 inhibitor AG1478 results in decreased heart rate, in line with a model in which Id2b modulates heart development via the Nrg1/Erbb2 axis. The research identifies id2b as a biomechanical signaling-sensitive gene in endocardial cells that mediates communication between the endocardium and myocardium, which is essential for heart morphogenesis and function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which biomechanical forces influence heart development and highlights the importance of id2b in this process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The claims are in general well supported by experimental evidence, but the following aspects may benefit from further investigation:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1C, the heatmap demonstrates the up-regulated and down-regulated genes upon tricane-induced cardiac arrest. Aside from the down-regulation of id2b expression, it was also evident that id2a expression was up-regulated. As a predicted paralog of id2b, it would be interesting to see whether the up-regulation of id2a in response to tricane treatment was a compensatory response to the down-regulation of id2b expression.</p>
<p>(2) The study mentioned that id2b is tightly regulated by the flow-sensitive primary cilia-klf2 signaling axis; however aside from showing the reduced expression of id2b in klf2a and klf2b mutants, there was no further evidence to solidify the functional link between id2b and klf2. It would therefore be ideal, in the present study, to demonstrate how Klf2, which is a transcriptional regulator, transduces biomechanical stimuli to Id2b.</p>
<p>(3) The authors showed the physical interaction between ectopically expressed FLAG-Id2b and HA-Tcf3b in HEK293T cells. Although the constructs being expressed are of zebrafish origin, it would be nice to show in vivo that the two proteins interact.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
How mechanical forces transmitted by blood flow contribute to normal cardiac development remains incompletely understood. Using the unique advantages of the zebrafish model system, Chen et al make the fundamental discovery that endocardial expression of id2b is induced by blood flow and required for normal atrioventricular canal (AVC) valve development and myocardial contractility by regulating calcium dynamics. Mechanistically, the authors suggest that Id2b binds to Tcf3b in endocardial cells, which relieves Tcf3b-mediated transcriptional repression of Neuregulin 1 (NRG1). Nrg1 then induces expression of the L-type calcium channel component LRRC1. This study significantly advances our understanding of flow-mediated valve formation and myocardial function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Strengths of the study are the significance of the question being addressed, use of the zebrafish model, and data quality (mostly very nice imaging). The text is also well-written and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Weaknesses include a lack of rigor for key experimental approaches, which led to skepticism surrounding the main findings. Specific issues were the use of morpholinos instead of genetic mutants for the bmp ligands, cilia gene ift88, and tcf3b, lack of an explicit model surrounding BMP versus blood flow induced endocardial id2b expression, use of bar graphs without dots, the artificial nature of assessing the physical interaction of Tcf3b and Id2b in transfected HEK293 cells, and artificial nature of examining the function of the tcf3b binding sites upstream of nrg1.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Chen et al. identified the role of endocardial id2b expression in cardiac contraction and valve formation through pharmaceutical, genetic, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography analyses. CRISPR/Cas9 generated id2b mutants demonstrated defective AV valve formation, excitation-contraction coupling, reduced endocardial cell proliferation in AV valve, retrograde blood flow, and lethal effects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Their methods, data and analyses broadly support their claims.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The molecular mechanism is somewhat preliminary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypes, we will conduct the following experiments: (1) perform qRT-PCR to analyze the expression of id2a in hearts isolated from tricane-treated embryos and in id2b-deleted embryos; (2) use RNAscope to detect the expression of id2b in developing embryos; (3) validate the interaction between Id2b and Tcf3b in vivo; and (4) conduct CUT&amp;Tag experiments in developing zebrafish embryos to further validate the Tcf3b binding sites upstream of nrg1.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Biomechanical forces, such as blood flow, are crucial for organ formation, including heart development. This study by Shuo Chen et al. aims to understand how cardiac cells respond to these forces. They used zebrafish as a model organism due to its unique strengths, such as the ability to survive without heartbeats, and conducted transcriptomic analysis on hearts with impaired contractility. They thereby identified id2b as a gene regulated by blood flow and is crucial for proper heart development, in particular, for the regulation of myocardial contractility and valve formation. Using both in situ hybridization and transgenic fish they showed that id2b is specifically expressed in the endocardium, and its expression is affected by both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. They further generated a null mutant of id2b to show that loss of id2b results in heart malformation and early lethality in zebrafish. Atrioventricular (AV) and excitation-contraction coupling were also impaired in id2b mutants. Mechanistically, they demonstrate that Id2b interacts with the transcription factor Tcf3b to restrict its activity. When id2b is deleted, the repressor activity of Tcf3b is enhanced, leading to suppression of the expression of nrg1 (neuregulin 1), a key factor for heart development. Importantly, injecting tcf3b morpholino into id2b-/- embryos partially restores the reduced heart rate. Moreover, treatment of zebrafish embryos with the Erbb2 inhibitor AG1478 results in decreased heart rate, in line with a model in which Id2b modulates heart development via the Nrg1/Erbb2 axis. The research identifies id2b as a biomechanical signaling-sensitive gene in endocardial cells that mediates communication between the endocardium and myocardium, which is essential for heart morphogenesis and function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which biomechanical forces influence heart development and highlights the importance of id2b in this process.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The claims are in general well supported by experimental evidence, but the following aspects may benefit from further investigation:</p>
<p>(1) In Figure 1C, the heatmap demonstrates the up-regulated and down-regulated genes upon tricane-induced cardiac arrest. Aside from the down-regulation of id2b expression, it was also evident that id2a expression was up-regulated. As a predicted paralog of id2b, it would be interesting to see whether the up-regulation of id2a in response to tricaine treatment was a compensatory response to the down-regulation of id2b expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we will perform qRT-PCR to analyze the expression of id2a in hearts isolated from tricane-treated embryos, as well as in id2b-deleted embryos.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The study mentioned that id2b is tightly regulated by the flow-sensitive primary cilia-klf2 signaling axis; however aside from showing the reduced expression of id2b in klf2a and klf2b mutants, there was no further evidence to solidify the functional link between id2b and klf2. It would therefore be ideal, in the present study, to demonstrate how Klf2, which is a transcriptional regulator, transduces biomechanical stimuli to Id2b.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have examined the expression levels of id2b in both klf2a and klf2b mutants. The whole mount in situ results clearly demonstrate a decrease in id2b signal in both mutants. As noted by the reviewer, klf2 is a transcriptional regulator, suggesting that the regulation of id2b may occur at the transcriptional level. However, dissecting the molecular mechanisms underling the crosstalk between klf2 and id2b is beyond the scope of the present study.</p>

<p>(3) The authors showed the physical interaction between ectopically expressed FLAG-Id2b and HA-Tcf3b in HEK293T cells. Although the constructs being expressed are of zebrafish origin, it would be nice to show in vivo that the two proteins interact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and will perform additional experiments to validate the interaction between Id2b and Tcf3b in vivo. Due to the lack of antibodies targeting these proteins, we will overexpress Flag-id2b and HA-Tcf3b in zebrafish embryos and conduct a co-IP analysis.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>How mechanical forces transmitted by blood flow contribute to normal cardiac development remains incompletely understood. Using the unique advantages of the zebrafish model system, Chen et al make the fundamental discovery that endocardial expression of id2b is induced by blood flow and required for normal atrioventricular canal (AVC) valve development and myocardial contractility by regulating calcium dynamics. Mechanistically, the authors suggest that Id2b binds to Tcf3b in endocardial cells, which relieves Tcf3b-mediated transcriptional repression of Neuregulin 1 (NRG1). Nrg1 then induces expression of the L-type calcium channel component LRRC1. This study significantly advances our understanding of flow-mediated valve formation and myocardial function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of the study are the significance of the question being addressed, use of the zebrafish model, and data quality (mostly very nice imaging). The text is also well-written and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Weaknesses include a lack of rigor for key experimental approaches, which led to skepticism surrounding the main findings. Specific issues were the use of morpholinos instead of genetic mutants for the bmp ligands, cilia gene ift88, and tcf3b, lack of an explicit model surrounding BMP versus blood flow induced endocardial id2b expression, use of bar graphs without dots, the artificial nature of assessing the physical interaction of Tcf3b and Id2b in transfected HEK293 cells, and artificial nature of examining the function of the tcf3b binding sites upstream of nrg1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive assessments. Our specific responses are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) As all the morpholinos used in this study, including those targeting bmp ligands, the cilia gene ift88, and tcf3b, have been published and validated using genetic mutants in previous studies, we believe these loss-of-function analyses are sufficient to delineate their role in regulating id2b expression or function.</p>
<p>(2) To assess the role of BMP versus blood flow in regulating endocardial id2b expression, we plan to perform live imaging in the id2b:GFP knockin line prior to the initiation of the heartbeat, with or without of BMP inhibitors.</p>
<p>(3) We will revise the data presentation and use bar graphs with individual data points.</p>
<p>(4) We plan to perform additional Co-IP experiment in zebrafish embryos to assess the interaction between Tcf3b and Id2b.</p>
<p>(5) To further validate the tcf3b binding sites upstream of nrg1, we will conduct CUT&amp;Tag experiments in developing zebrafish embryos.</p>
