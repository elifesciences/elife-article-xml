<abstract>
<p>In response to central nervous system (CNS) injury, tissue resident immune cells such as microglia and circulating systemic neutrophils are often first responders. The degree to which these cells interact in response to CNS damage is poorly understood, and even less so, in the neural retina which poses a challenge for high resolution imaging in vivo. In this study, we deploy fluorescence adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to study microglia and neutrophils in mice. We simultaneously track immune cell dynamics using label-free phase-contrast AOSLO at micron-level resolution. Retinal lesions were induced with 488 nm light focused onto photoreceptor (PR) outer segments. These lesions focally ablated PRs, with minimal collateral damage to cells above and below the plane of focus. We used in vivo (AOSLO, SLO and OCT) imaging to reveal the natural history of the microglial and neutrophil response from minutes-to-months after injury. While microglia showed dynamic and progressive immune response with cells migrating into the injury locus within 1-day after injury, neutrophils were not recruited despite close proximity to vessels carrying neutrophils only microns away. Post-mortem confocal microscopy confirmed in vivo findings. This work illustrates that microglial activation does not recruit neutrophils in response to acute, focal loss of PRs, a condition encountered in many retinal diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the mammalian retina, a rapid and coordinated immune response to infection or injury is important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. This is especially critical in the eye since mature retinal neurons do not typically regenerate, resulting in long-term functional losses for the host.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> The retina is considered immune-privileged and is equipped with a resident population of innate immune cells including microglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> In healthy retina, microglia are distributed primarily in the inner retina, residing within nerve fiber layer (NFL), inner plexiform layer (IPL) and outer plexiform layers (OPL).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, generally avoiding the nuclear layers. Microglia tile the retina and like their counterparts in the brain, exhibit long, thin processes that continually probe the neuro-glial microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to phagocytosing debris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, regulating synaptic maintenance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and removing dead tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, microglia can secrete chemokines to recruit other leukocytes to help fight infection and repair damaged tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> For many injuries, one of the first systemic responders recruited and activated by microglia are neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> Neutrophils comprise a large fraction of leukocytes in murine blood (7.4 â 33.9%, âyoungâ C57BL/6J mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>). They assist in maintaining tissue homeostasis by neutralizing foreign agents, regulating the immune response, and phagocytosing dead tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Under inflammatory conditions, the spatiotemporal interplay between microglia and neutrophils is poorly understood. A missed window of interaction is highly problematic in histological study where a single time point reveals a snapshot of the temporally complex immune response, which changes dynamically over time. Here, we use in vivo imaging to overcome these constraints.</p>
<p>Documenting immune cell interactions in the retina over time has been challenged by insufficient resolution and contrast to visualize single cells in the living eye. The microscopic size of immune cells requires exceptional resolution for detection. Recently, advances in AOSLO imaging have provided micron-level resolution and enhanced contrast for imaging individual immune cells in the retina without requiring extrinsic dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. AOSLO provides multi-modal information from confocal reflectance, phase-contrast and fluorescence modalities, which can reveal a variety of cell types simultaneously in the living eye. Here, we used confocal AOSLO to track changes in reflectance at cellular scale. Phase-contrast AOSLO provides detail on highly translucent retinal structures such as vascular wall, single blood cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, PR somata<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and is well-suited to image resident and systemic immune cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> Fluorescence AOSLO provides the ability to study fluorescently-labeled cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and exogenous dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> throughout the living retina. These modalities used in combination have recently provided detailed images of the retinal response to a model of human uveitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> Together, these innovations now provide a platform to visualize, for the first time, the dynamic interplay between many immune cell types, each with a unique role in tissue inflammation. We combine these innovative modalities with conventional histology and commercial SLO/OCT to reveal the progressive nature of the cellular response to acute retinal injury.</p>
<p>Here, we ask the question: âTo what extent do microglia/neutrophils respond to acute neural loss in the retina?â To begin unraveling the complexities in this response, we deploy a deep retinal laser ablation model. Using AOSLO, we track and characterize the changes in microglia, neutrophils and retinal structure within hours, days and months after acute laser exposure.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>All experiments herein were approved by the University Committee on Animal Resources (protocol #: UCAR-2010-052E) and according to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research as well as institutional approvals by the University of Rochester. C57BL/6J (#000664, Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) mice were used to track the retinal phenotype after laser exposure.</p>
<p>Heterozygous CX3CR1-GFP (#005582, Jackson Labs) mice were used to track GFP-expressing microglia. Mice with heterozygous transgenic expression of tdTomato in neutrophils (âCatchupâ mice) were provided by the foundry lab of M. Gunzer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> 18 mice (10 male, 8 female) in total were used for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging. 10 additional mice (5 male, 5 female) were used for <italic>ex vivo</italic> histology. Age for all mice used for this work were post-natal weeks 6 - 24.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Preparation for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with intra-perotineal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). The pupil was dilated with 1% tropicamide (Sandoz, Basel, Switzerland) and 2.5% phenylephrine (Akorn, Lake Forest, IL). A custom contact lens (1.5 mm base curve, 3.2 mm diameter, +10 diopter power, Advanced Vision Technologies, Lakewood, CO) was fitted to the eye. For a subset of experiments, 50 mg/kg fluorescein (AK-FLUOR, Akorn, Decatur, IL) was administered by intra-peritoneal injection to confirm vascular integrity and perfusion status after injury. During AOSLO imaging, anesthesia was supplemented with 1% (v/v) isoflurane in oxygen and mice were maintained at 37Â°C via electric heat pad. Eye hydration was maintained throughout imaging with regular application of saline eye drops (Refresh tears, Allergan, Sydney, Australia) and lubricating eye gel (Genteal, Alcon Laboratories Inc. Fort Worth, TX). Mice were placed in a positioning frame with 6-degrees of freedom to allow for stable animal positioning and aid in retinal navigation.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> AOSLO imaging</title>
<p>Four light sources were used for AOSLO imaging. A 904 nm diode source (12 ÂµW, Qphotonics, Ann Harbor, MI) was used for wavefront sensing. A second 796 nm superluminescent diode (196 ÂµW, Superlum, Cork, Ireland) was used for reflectance imaging, including confocal and phase contrast modes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> A third 488 nm light source (56 ÂµW, Toptica Photonics, Farmington, NY) was used to visualize GFP-positive microglia in CX3CR1-GFP mice. A fourth 561 nm light source (95 ÂµW, Toptica Photonics) was used to visualize tdTomato-positive neutrophils in Catchup mice. All light sources were fiber-coupled and axially combined through the AOSLO system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Fast (15.4 kHz) and slow (25 Hz) scanners create a raster scan pattern, which is relayed through a series of afocal telescopes to and from the eye. A Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (consisting of a lenslet array and a Rolera XR camera, QImaging, Surrey, Canada) measures the aberrations of the eye and a deformable mirror (ALPAO, Montbonnot-Saint-Martin, France) provided the wavefront correction. Reflected 796 nm light was collected with a photomultiplier tube (H7422-50, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). All confocal reflectance images were captured with a 30 Âµm pinhole (1.3 Airy Disc Diameters, ADD). Phase-contrast was achieved by displacing the pinhole relative to the principal axis of the detection plane as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Fluorescence was captured with a photomultiplier tube (H7422-40, Hamamatsu) either coupled with a 520Î35 band-pass filter (FF01-520/35-25, Semrock, Rochester, NY) for GFP emission, or a 630Î92 band-pass filter (FF01-630/92-25, Semrock) for tdTomato emission. All fluorescent images were captured with a confocal 50 Âµm pinhole (2.1 ADD). Image field sizes were either 4.98Â° x 3.95Â° or 2.39Â° x 1.94Â°. NIR and visible imaging channels were made coplanar, compensating for longitudinal chromatic aberration by independently focusing each light source onto the same axial structure in the retina. Through-focus stacks were acquired by sequentially changing the focus from NFL to the PR outer segments by using the defocus term on the custom adaptive optics control software.</p>
<p>As described previously, red blood cell (RBC) imaging was achieved by combining phase-contrast imaging with a strategy to arrest the slow galvanometer scanner and let the resonant scanner project a single âlineâ (0.71Â° scan angle) on the retina. This enabled RBC flux imaging by positioning this line orthogonal to the direction of flow for single capillaries. As blood cells moved through capillaries, they were âself-scannedâ producing images of RBCs in space/time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>PR laser damage model and post-injury time points for imaging</title>
<p>488 nm light (Continuous wave Laser diode, Â±4 nm bandwidth, Toptica Photonics) was used to create an acute laser injury. 785 ÂµW of 488 nm light was projected through the AOSLO and focused onto the PR outer segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) for 3 minutes in a single line on the retina subtending 24 x 1 Âµm to concentrate the power to a small region. Laser injuries were placed between 5-15Â° from the optic disc. To avoid absorption confounds, we refrained from placing lesions beneath large retinal vessels. For experiments examining neutrophil involvement, lesions were placed &lt;100 Âµm away from retinal veins and within microns of capillaries to increase the chance of extravasation through these preferred pathways in the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. As many as four such lesions were placed per retina. This protocol produced a hyper-reflective phenotype in the &gt;40 locations across 28 mice. In rare cases, the exposure yielded no hyper-reflective lesion and were often in mice with high retinal motion, where the light dosage was spread over a larger retinal area. These locations were not included in the in-vivo or histological analysis.</p>

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> SLO, and OCT imaging</title>
<p>To confirm global ocular health and changes imparted by the laser damage, a commercial Heidelberg Spectralis system (Heidelberg, Germany) was used to acquire SLO and OCT images. 30Â° and 55Â° fields were used for SLO acquisitions. The 30Â° field was used for OCT acquisitions. For some experiments, fluorescein angiography was captured by imaging the retina within 10 minutes of fluorescein administration (details above). The fluorescence mode of the SLO also enabled wide-field images of GFP positive microglia.</p>
<p>OCT was used to provide detailed information regarding the axial nature of the laser damage. We used a coarse scan area to capture several damage locations in a single field (61 B-scans, 1.02 x 0.85 mm). A dense 3D data cube was also captured (49 B-scans, 513 x 171 Âµm). âFollow-upâ mode, which allows the HRA software to return to the same retinal location, was used whenever possible. To reveal the cross-sectional profile for each lesion, several adjacent B-scans were spatially averaged (â¼30 Âµm).</p>

<title>Preparation for <italic>ex vivo</italic> imaging</title>
<p>Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. Within 5 minutes of asphyxiation, eyes were enucleated and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, diluted from: #15714-S, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, Pennsylvania) in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS, #806552, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for one hour at room temperature. Eyes were dissected to remove the cornea, lens and vitreous. Each eye cup was placed in one well of a 24-well plate containing 0.5 ml of 0.8% PFA and left overnight at 4Â°C. The retina was separated from the retinal pigmented epithelium/choroid with attention to preserve inner retinal layers âupâ orientation. If not applying antibody, the tissue was directly flat mounted (see below). For antibody staining, the retina was placed in 1x BD perm/wash buffer (#554723, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with 5% donkey serum (#D9663, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in PBS for overnight incubation at room temperature with gentle shaking. The following was performed in the dark. Ly-6G-647 antibody (1:200, #127610, RRID:AB_1134159, BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and DAPI (1:500 of 10 mg/ml stock, #4083, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were diluted in 1x perm/wash buffer and retinas were incubated for 3 days at room temperature with gentle shaking. Retinas were washed with PBS three times over three hours. The retina was cut into 4 radially symmetrical petals, flat-mounted on a glass slide in Vectashield mounting buffer (H-1000-10, Vector labs, Newark, CA) with a #1.5 cover slip (#260406, Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA), sealed with nail polish and stored at 4Â°C until imaged.</p>

<title>Characterization of deep focal laser damage</title>
<p>Four complementary imaging modalities were used to evaluate the nature and localization of the focal laser damage induced by 488 nm light: wide field SLO, OCT, AOSLO and post-mortem histology. Each is reported in turn below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Laser damage induces focal hyperreflective lesions in outer retina imaged with wide-field SLO</title>
<p>To observe global and focal retinal health, we used commercial SLO. 1 day post-488 nm light exposure, both NIR and blue reflectance modalities showed hyperreflective lesions, most apparent at a deeper retinal focus position. In the inner retina, lesions were not visible and the retina appeared healthy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Despite deep retinal damage, fluorescein angiography did not reveal dye leakage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b, bottom</xref>), indicating the blood retinal barrier remained intact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>OCT B-scans reveal outer retinal hyperreflection without inner retinal damage</title>
<p>To assist in determination of which retinal layers are damaged by the 488 nm laser, we used OCT. Within 30 minutes post-laser exposure, OCT revealed a zone of hyperreflection within the ONL (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â figure supplement 1</xref>). 1 day post-lesion, the focal hyperreflection remained localized to the ONL (â¼50 Âµm wide, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Retina outside of damage foci appeared normal. The hyperreflective phenotype persisted through 7 days and was cleared by 2 months (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). There did not appear to be any cellular excavation, âcrateringâ or evidence of edema for any time point assessed. Bruchâs membrane appeared intact for all time points, evidenced by lack of fluorescein leakage at the site of lesion. Additionally, retinal vessels appeared normal in OCT B-scans.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>AOSLO reveals outer retinal damage with confocal and phase-contrast modalities</title>
<p>Confocal AOSLO provided micron-level detail of the lesioned area. Confirming OCT findings, we observed hyperreflective changes localized within the ONL that were, by 1 day, the brightest at the OPL/ONL interface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). At this plane, the lesions manifest as an ellipse with the long axis in the direction of the line scan used to create the lesion. The most prominent hyperreflective phenotype was seen at 1 day post lesion, with diminishing size and brightness by day 3 and 7. The phenotype was largely diminished by 2 months (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>).</p>
<p>Using phase-contrast AOSLO also allowed visualization of translucent cells within the retina which enabled us to image PR somas of the ONL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Normally, the ONL is comprised of PR somata that are densely-packed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. We found that the dense packing of individual somata was disrupted 1 day post-exposure (â¼50 Âµm ovoid, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>), suggesting degradation or ablation of the cell membrane.</p>

<title>Confirmation of outer retinal cell loss using post-mortem histology</title>
<p>To assess the extent of cell loss caused by focal laser exposure, we performed DAPI staining on whole-mount retinal tissue using the same time points assessed for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging. 1 day after laser exposure, we observed mild thickening of the ONL compared to unexposed locations only microns away. At 3 and 7 days, local ONL thinning was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). En-face planes within the ONL revealed a loss of PR nuclei in the outer aspect of the ONL for 3 and 7 day time points, while inner ONL exhibited little evidence of cell loss (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b, c</xref>), illustrating the precise axial confinement of the laser damage induced by this method. By 2 months, the lesionâs overall appearance and ONL thickness returned to baseline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a-c</xref>). This histological finding corroborates the OCT findings observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>ONL nuclear counts were reduced at locations of laser exposure. In comparison to control locations (501317 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup> Â± 46198 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup>, mean Â±SD, similar to previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>), at 3 and 7 days post-exposure, we found a corresponding reduction in the density of ONL nuclei of 18% (408965 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup> Â± 25621 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup>) and 27% (367542 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup> Â± 9038 nuclei/mm<sup>2</sup>) respectively. Compared to control locations, the 3 and 7 day data resulted in p-values of 0.17 and 0.07, respectively (Studentâs paired two-tailed t-test). 2 months after damage, PR nuclear densities were indistinguishable from that of control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f, gray bars</xref>). Despite losses of PR nuclei, total cell nuclei within the INL remained unchanged for all time points (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f, black bars</xref>). These data indicate that the laser exposure focally ablated PRâs whilst leaving inner retinal cells intact.</p>

<title>Retinal vasculature unaffected by deep retinal lesion</title>

<p>In addition to perfusion status, phase-contrast AOSLO also permitted analysis of single blood cell flux within capillaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We tracked capillary flux at different retinal depths within and above the lesion (IPL, OPL, 1 capillary each, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 â figure supplement 1a</xref>). Blood cell flux for capillaries within lesion locations were within the range of normal flux for the C57BL/6J mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 â figure supplement 1b, c</xref>). Flux tracked from hours to days in these capillaries changed synchronously, displaying positive linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 â figure supplement 1c, d</xref>). This suggested any such changes in flux were a property of systemic perfusion, rather than locally imparted changes in flow due to the lesion. As an additional control, we evaluated blood flux in two distant capillaries (control, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 â figure supplement 1e</xref>). Both capillaries displayed similar flux values from minutes to 2 months post-injury (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 â figure supplement 1f, g</xref>) resulting in positive linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.78, <xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 â figure supplement 1h</xref>).

<title>PR laser injury promotes a robust response in nearby microglia</title>
<p>To observe the microglial response to PR laser injury, we imaged fluorescent microglia in CX3CR1-GFP mice with both SLO and AOSLO. 1 day after injury, SLO revealed bright, focal congregations of microglia at injury locations in contrast to undamaged locations, which maintained a distribution of lateral tiling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a, b</xref>). The global visualization of microglia was augmented by high resolution fluorescence AOSLO, providing enhanced detail of the microglial response to laser injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.

<p>We returned to the same laser-damaged locations to capture microglial appearance at baseline, 1, 3, 7 day and 2 month time points with AOSLO to track the natural history of the microglial response to PR damage.

<title>Microglia form PR-containing phagosomes</title>
<p>A detailed examination of microglial involvement with PR somata in response to PR injury revealed unique microglia-PR interactions within the ONL. In cross-section, PR cells comprise a large portion of the retina reaching from the outer-segment tip, inner segments, somata and spherule/pedicle synaptic contacts at the OPL. Likewise, we saw microglial involvement with all of these layers. Within 1 day, we found microglial processes interspersed within the dense aggregation of PR somata within the ONL. Amoeboid cells enveloped the somata of PRâs and phagocytosis was detected 1, 3 and 7 days post-laser exposure (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 â figure supplement 2</xref>).

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In many retinal diseases, resident microglial populations are found to exhibit cross-talk with systemic immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The complex temporal dynamics between resident and systemic immune cells unfolds from seconds-to-months and has been poorly characterized due to lack of resolution, sufficient contrast and a non-destructive imaging approach that can track changes over time. Here, we overcome these limitations by using phase-contrast and fluorescent imaging with adaptive optics to visualize the interaction of multiple cell types. With this advanced imaging technology, we reveal the absence of neutrophil involvement in response to an acute injury, despite progressive changes in microglial activity and morphology. Here we discuss the implications of such findings in the context of retinal damage and more broadly, retinal disease.</p>

<title>Focal retinal lesions for tracking the immune response</title>
<p>Seminal studies in the brain have used focal light exposure to induce targeted, acute microglial responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> Since then, it has been a popular damage model. Focal lesions in the retina have been conducted in a number of popular animal models including mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, macaque<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> and cats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup> Laser damage is also clinically relevant as it is experienced with accidental laser exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> as well as purposeful ablation used in photocoagulation and as a therapy for retinal ischemic disease, retinopathy of prematurity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> and diabetic retinopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Thus, our results shed light toward the immune response that may be imparted due to phototoxic damage.</p>
<p>Light damage offers a number of advantages for creating acute damage in the retina. It offers placement precision that is better controlled than other invasive methods, such as incision/poke injuries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, retinal detachment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and chemical injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. In the mouse, focal light dosage comes with greater axial confinement within the retina by nature of the high numerical aperture of the mouse eye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> which imposes minimal collateral damage to layers above or below the plane of focus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). The damage took on an elliptical form, likely due to: 1) Eye motion from respiration and heart rate which spreads the light over a larger integrative area (rather than line). 2) The impact of focal light scatter. 3) A micron-thin line imparting damage on cells that are many microns across manifesting as an ellipse. Most light exposures produced lesions of this elliptical shape. For the reasons described above, some exposures failed to produce a strong, focal damage phenotype. To improve lesion reproducibility, future experiments should better control for subtle eye motions affecting light distribution, especially for long exposures.</p>

<title>Titration of the 488 nm laser leads to mild retinal damage</title>
<p>While it is beyond the scope of this report to catalog the vast parameter space in which light may impose damage in the retina, it is noteworthy to discuss that the exposure intensity, subtended angle and duration of the light source we used delivered an intentionally mild damage to the retina. Using dosages too high would run the risk of collateral damage to the blood retinal barrier or Bruchâs membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> which could cause a choroidal neovascularization phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. This would be undesirable for studying the native/systemic immune response as it could confound the traditional extravasation pathways of the inflammatory system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Instead, we chose our laser exposure condition to impart a weak, but reproducible loss of PRs while minimizing damage to the cells above and below the plane of focus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4d">
<title>Progressive PR loss and morphology of the lesion tracked over time</title>
<p>The amount of light delivered did not immediately ablate PRs as peak cell loss wasnât observed until 3-7 days after laser exposure, suggesting a progressive damage phenotype of apoptosis or necroptotic death. Histology showed a â¼27% reduction in PR nuclei 7 days post lesion. The total number of PR nuclei within the lesion location returned to values similar to baseline by 2 months, which was surprising given that PRs do not regenerate. Our interpretation is that adjacent PRs spill into the region of loss, similar to what others have described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Corroborating the histological finding of mild cell loss, OCT shows no evidence of local edema, cavitation or excavation of the ONL after PR loss (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). The return of the appearance, thickness and redistribution of cells within the ablated location indicates that retinal remodeling occurs within 2 months. The concurrence of microglia in these outer retinal bands (where they are normally absent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>) support the hypothesis that microglia localized to this region to facilitate a phagocytic injury response and may contribute toward synaptic remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>CX3CR1-GFP mice exhibit fluorescence not only in microglia</title>
<p>We recognize that the CX3CR1-GFP model can also label systemic cells such as monocytes/macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. While it is possible these cells could infiltrate the retina in response to the lesion, we find it unlikely since there was no indication of the leukocyte extravasation cascade (rolling/crawling/stalled cells) within the nearest retinal vasculature. In addition to microglia, retinal perivascular macrophages and hyalocytes also exhibit GFP fluorescence and these cells may also contribute toward damage resolution.</p>

<title>The hyperreflective phenotype does not arise from microglia or neutrophils</title>
<p>Light damage is known to create hyper-reflective bands in OCT imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. A common speculation is that the increased backscatter may arise from local inflammatory cells that activate or move into the damage location. In our data, confocal AOSLO and OCT revealed a hyperreflective band at the OPL/ONL after 488 nm light exposure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a, b</xref>). We found that the hyperreflective bands appeared within 30 minutes after the laser injury, preceding any detectable microglial migration toward the damage location (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 â figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1</xref>). We thus conclude that the initial hyperreflective phenotype is not caused by microglial cell activity or aggregation.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Direct activation of microglia from 488 nm light exposure was minimal</title>
<p>It is conceivable that 488 nm light used for either imaging (56 ÂµW) or imparting damage (785 ÂµW) might activate the GFP-containing microglia used here.</p>
<p>However, several lines of evidence speak against this possibility. 1) We did not observe photobleaching of CX3CR1 positive cells in response to the damage, suggesting the light was insufficient to damage microglia. 2) For retinal injury, the focal plane was adjusted such that the dose was axially concentrated onto the outer retina. Thus, the light dosage received by microglia above was defocused and less than the targeted PR layer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). 3) Histology showed no evident necrotic/apoptotic microglial morphologies.</p>

<label>488</label><title>nm laser lesion does not photocoagulate or alter retinal circulation</title>
<p>Despite imparting damage to the PRs, the damage regime used here did not alter the perfusion of the retinal circulation. We show three independent measures that blood flow is uninterrupted, despite PR loss and activation of microglia. 1) Fluorescein angiography (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b, bottom</xref>) revealed an absence of vascular leakage. 2) AOSLO motion contrast vascular maps <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> displayed persistent blood perfusion inside vessels near lesion sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). 3) Capillary line scans indicate that RBC flux was not modified at lesion locations and fell within the normal range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 â figure supplement 1</xref>).

<title>Resident microglia do not need systemic neutrophils for resolution of mild laser-damage</title>
<p>The CNS and retina, unlike other peripheral tissues, cannot suffer from excess inflammation as there may be dire functional consequences. Therefore it is possible that microglia protect against exorbitant inflammation by modulating the recruitment of systemic inflammatory cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> Of these, neutrophils are often one of the first systemic responders. Despite their helpful roles in other tissues, neutrophils can secrete neurotoxic compounds that could present a danger to the CNS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> Given their conflicted role in the body, we ask the question: to what extent do neutrophils respond to acute neural loss in the retina? Retinal cells are lost with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> and disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> and yet, for the organism, visual perception must persist. There are limitations on how generalizable this mild damage is to other damage or disease phenotypes, but this acute damage model can provide clues about how immune cells interact in response to PR loss. In this laser lesion model, we ablate 27% of the PRs in a 50 Âµm region.</p>
<p>We find that microglia undergo a rapid and progressive response to this injury. We show evidence of PR phagocytosis (<xref rid="fig9s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 - figure supplement 2</xref>), interaction with neighboring microglia (<xref rid="fig9s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9 â figure supplement 1</xref>) and they are also axially positioned to facilitate retinal remodeling (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Furthermore, throughout the temporal evolution of the microglial response, we find no evidence of neutrophil recruitment despite the damage being within 10s of microns from retinal vessels that carry them. At the onset of the neutrophil extravasation cascade, endothelial cells in the vicinity of inflamed tissue typically elevate the expression of adhesion molecules, facilitating the adherence and extravasation of circulating neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> Furthermore, neutrophils are dependent on priming events as prerequisite to further activation and engagement of their effector functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup> Based on our data, we suggest that although microglia show a strong and lasting activation, at no time point from seconds-to-months, are the damage-associated molecular patterns or chemotactic gradients strong enough to recruit neutrophils in response to this damage. This is evidenced in our data from two key observations: 1) We saw no examples of systemic leukocytes rolling in vessels adjacent to injury locations (<xref rid="fig8video1" ref-type="supplementary-material">figure 8 â video 1</xref>). 2) We did not observe adherent or extravasated neutrophils adjacent to imparted PR loss (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This may suggest that the region of insult is too small, or that activated microglia are not sufficient for recruiting neutrophils with damage of this magnitude. Perhaps a minimum threshold of neural damage must be met before neutrophils will respond. It is possible that resident microglia facilitate the necessary phagocytic and retinal remodeling response despite release of cytokines from damaged retinal cells that would normally recruit systemic immune cells in peripheral tissues. Such a strategy would benefit the CNS.</p>
<p>Future work will explore whether there is a threshold magnitude of neuronal cell loss required for recruitment of systemic cells that is unique to the retina. Next studies will examine more severe or widespread injury regimes that provide stronger activating molecular signals and interact with a larger population of systemic cells.</p>

<title>Microglia may inhibit neutrophil activation</title>
<p>Microglia may be involved in a system that protects the CNS from propagating a larger systemic response, potentially exacerbating disease pathologies that would compromise overall CNS function. In another damage model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>, they report that tissue-resident macrophages may exhibit the capacity to cloak tissue micro-damage. This offers the possibility that resident immune cells, such as retinal microglia, can handle small insults without inducing a chemokine cascade that may invoke a larger systemic response that could further damage the precious retinal tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> Regardless of the mechanism, we find that despite a robust microglial activation that lasts for weeks, at no time point do they recruit neutrophils. The nuance of this interaction likely represents the fine balance that facilitates a helpful local response within the CNS that does not impart a widespread cytokine storm that may otherwise exacerbate retinal damage. Further work will explore whether microglia exhibit a cloaking response in the retina, inhibiting neutrophil or other immune cell extravasation/chemotaxis toward lesion sites. We expect such work to be pivotal in understanding the balance that is broken or left unchecked in conditions of autoimmune disease and the umbrella of diseases that comprise the uveitic response, a direct threat to lifelong vision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Here, we have applied innovative <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging at the microscopic scale to reveal the cellular immune response to a retina in jeopardy. The dynamic environment of the retina includes a native population of resident microglia and systemic immune cells delivered through the vasculature. These two lines of defense work in concert in the mammalian body and are critical for maintaining retinal homeostasis. In this work we directly study the interaction between microglia and neutrophils, two major classes of immune cells that are implicated in inflammatory initiation, escalation, propagation and debris removal in response to acute geographical injury in the retina. Using cutting-edge retinal imaging modalities, we find that resident microglia become locally activated and regionally responsive to focal laser lesion. They migrate away from their stratified locations near plexiform layers of the retina and toward the site of damage within hours to weeks after injury. However, systemic neutrophils, which are typically regarded as first-line responders to tissue damage, are not recruited to this damage despite neutrophils flowing within 10s of microns away from the location of damage (<xref rid="fig8video2" ref-type="supplementary-material">figure 8 â video 2</xref>). Beyond the context of this specific finding, we share this work with the excitement that AOSLO cellular level imaging may reveal the interaction of multiple immune cell types in the living retina. By using fluorophores associated with specific immune cell populations, the complex dynamics that orchestrate the immune response may be examined in this specialized tissue. This work and future studies may reveal further insights to the interactions of single immune cells in the living body in a non-invasive way.</p>

<title>Limitations and future directions</title>
<p>This work represents some of the earliest reports of single immune cell interactions in the living retina. To narrow the scope, we focus on one type of injury, a targeted elimination of photoreceptors. Thus, these findings are limited to one type of injury that may be experienced in the retina. We expect that these seminal demonstrations will serve as a platform for future studies that examine the large parameter space of retinal damage. These include: 1) Conditions of greater severity with increased power, duration, and extent of light-damage. 2) Models of systemic and local infection. 3) Response to therapy that may modulate the immune response. 4) Examine immune cell activity in models of retinal disease such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration, each expected to reveal the nuance of the coordinated immune response.</p>

<p>Outer retinal Z-stacks of DAPI-stained whole-mount CX3CR1-GFP retinal tissue were imaged for control, 1, 3, 7 day and 2 month time points (n = 5 mice). DAPI + microglia composite cubes are displayed above and microglia cubes are displayed below. By 1 day, microglia send projections into the ONL, by 3 and 7 days, microglial somas have migrated into the ONL. Microglia within the ONL exhibit different morphology compared to the baseline condition. By 2 months, microglia are found back within the OPL, exhibiting lateral projections, similar to baseline.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study uses in vivo multimodal high-resolution imaging to track how microglia and neutrophils respond to light-induced retinal injury from soon after injury to 2 months post-injury. The in vivo imaging finding was subsequently verified by ex vivo study. The results suggest that despite the highly active microglia at the injury site, neutrophils were not recruited in response to acute light-induced retinal injury.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>An extremely thorough examination of the cellular-level immune activity at the injury site. In vivo imaging observations being verified using ex vivo techniques is a strong plus.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This work investigated the immune response in the murine retina after focal laser lesions. These lesions are made with close to 2 orders of magnitude lower laser power than the more prevalent choroidal neovascularization model of laser ablation. Histology and OCT together show that the laser insult is localized to the photoreceptors and spares the inner retina, the vasculature and the pigment epithelium. As early as 1-day after injury, a loss of cell bodies in the outer nuclear layer is observed. This is accompanied by strong microglial proliferation to the site of injury in the outer retina where microglia do not typically reside. The injury did not seem to result in the extravasation of neutrophils from the capillary network, constituting one of the main findings of the paper. The demonstrated paradigm of studying the immune response and potentially retinal remodeling in the future in vivo is valuable and would appeal to a broad audience in visual neuroscience.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>Adaptive optics imaging of murine retina is cutting edge and enables non-destructive visualization of fluorescently labeled cells in the milieu of retinal injury. As may be obvious, this in vivo approach is a benefit for studying fast and dynamic immune processes on a local time scale - minutes and hours, and also for the longer days-to-months follow-up of retinal remodeling as demonstrated in the article. In certain cases, the in vivo findings are corroborated with histology.</p>
<p>The analysis is sound and accompanied by stunning video and static imagery. A few different sets of mouse models are used: a) two different mouse lines, each with a fluorescent tag for neutrophils and microglia, b) two different models of inflammation - endotoxin-induced uveitis (EAU) and laser ablation are used to study differences in the immune interaction.</p>
<p>One of the major advances in this article is the development of the laser ablation model for 'mild' retinal damage as an alternative to the more severe neovascularization models. This model would potentially allow for controlling the size, depth and severity of the laser injury opening interesting avenues for future study.</p>
<p>The time-course, 2D and 3D spatial activation pattern of microglial activation are striking and provide an unprecedented view of the retinal response to mild injury.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The authors have addressed all the previous concerns raised by the reviewers.</p>

<p>Study weakness: though the finding prompts more questions and future studies, the findings discussed in this paper is potentially important for us to understand how the immune cells respond differently to different severity level of injury. The study also demonstrated an imaging technology which may help us better understand cellular activity in living tissue during earlier time points.</p>

<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>Generalization of the (lack of) neutrophil response to photoreceptor loss - there is ample evidence in literature that neutrophils are heavily recruited in response to severe retinal damage that includes photoreceptor loss. Why the same was not observed here in this article remains an open question. One could hypothesize that neutrophil recruitment might indeed occur under conditions that are more in line with the more extreme damage models, for example, with a stronger and global ablation (substantially more photoreceptor loss over a larger area). This parameter space is unwieldy and sufficiently large to address the question conclusively in the current article, i.e. how much photoreceptor loss leads to neutrophil recruitment? By the same token, the strong and general conclusion in the title - Photoreceptor loss does not recruit neutrophils - cannot be made until an exhaustive exploration be made of the same parameter space. A scaling back may help here, to reflect the specific, mild form of laser damage explored here, for instance - Mild photoreceptor loss does not recruit neutrophils despite...</p>

<p>We are striving for clarity and accuracy in our title without adding too many qualifiers.  At present, we feel that the title as submitted is consistent and aligned with the central finding of our manuscript.  The nuance that the reviewer points to is elaborated in the body of the manuscript and we hope the general readership appreciates the same level of detail as appreciated by reviewer #3.</p>

<p>EIU model - The EIU model was used as a positive control for neutrophil extravasation. Prior work with flow cytometry has shown a substantial increase in neutrophil counts in the EIU model. Yet, in all, the entire article shows exactly 2 examples in vivo and 3 ex vivo (Figure 7) of extravasated neutrophils from the EIU model (n = 2 mice). The general conclusion made about neutrophil recruitment (or lack thereof) is built partly upon this positive control experiment. But these limited examples, especially in the case where literature reports a preponderance of extravasated neutrophils, raise a question on the paradigm(s) used to evaluate this effect in the mild laser damage model.</p>

<p>This is a helpful suggestion. We agree that readers should see more evidence of the positive control. Therefore we have now included two more supplementary files that show that there is a strong neutrophil response to EIU.  In Figure 7 â supplementary figure 1, we show many Ly-6G-positive neutrophils in the retina seen with histology at the 24 hour time point. In Figure 7 â video 3, we show massive Catchup-positive neutrophil presence in vivo at 24hrs as well.  This aligns with our positive control and also the literature.</p>

<p>Overall, the strengths outweigh the weaknesses, provided the conclusions/interpretations are reconsidered.</p>

<p>With the added clarification about the magnitude of the neutrophil response in EIU, we feel that the conclusions presented in the manuscript as-is are valid and appropriate.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors are applauded for embracing the reviewers' feedback and making substantial revisions. Some minor comments below:</p>
<p>The weakness noted in the public review encourages the authors to reconsider the interpretations drawn based on the results. One would have expected to see far more examples of extravasated neutrophils from the EIU model. That this was not seen weakens the neutrophil recruitment claim substantially. Even without this claim, the methods, laser damage model, time-course and spatial activation pattern of microglial activation are all striking and unprecedented. So, as stated in the public review, the strengths do indeed outweigh the weaknesses once the neutrophil claim is softened.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We address this in the response above. A strong neutrophil response was observed to EIU. This was confirmed with both histology and in vivo imaging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This was alluded to by Reviewer 1 in the prior review - at times, there is an overemphasis on imaging technology that distracts from the scientific questions. The imaging is undoubtedly cutting-edge but also documented in prior work by the authors. Any efforts to reduce or balance the emphasis would help with the general flow.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Given that these discoveries are made possible partly through new technology, we prefer to keep the details of the innovation in the current manuscript. Given the exceptionally large readership of eLife, we feel some description of the AOSLO imaging is warranted in the manuscript.</p>
