<abstract>
<p>Zebra finches are sexually dimorphic vocal learners. Males learn to sing by imitating mature conspecifics, but females do not. Absence of song in females is associated with atrophy and apparent repression of several vocal learning brain regions during development. However, atrophy can be prevented and vocal learning retained in females when given early pharmacological estrogen treatment. To screen for drivers, we performed an unbiased transcriptomic analysis of song learning nuclei and surrounding regions from either sex, treated with vehicle or estrogen until 30 days old when divergence between the sexes becomes anatomically apparent. Analyses of transcriptomes by RNA sequencing identified song nuclei expressed gene modules associated with sex and estrogen manipulation. Female HVC and Area X gene modules were specialized by supplemental estrogen, exhibiting a subset of the transcriptomic specializations observed in males. Female RA and LMAN specialized modules were less dependent on estrogen. The estrogen-induced gene modules in females were enriched for anatomical development functions and strongly correlated to the expression of several Z sex chromosome genes. We present a hypothesis linking loss and de-repression of vocal learning in females, estrogen, and sex chromosomes gene expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vocal learning is the ability to imitate sounds, and is a necessary and specialized component for spoken language and song. Vocal learning is found in seven non-human clades, four mammalian and three avian, each having independently evolved the trait<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. Oscine songbirds have proved to be the most tractable for studying vocal learning in the lab, with much of the field focusing on the Australian zebra finch (<italic>Taeniopygia castanotis</italic>). Despite ∼300 million years of separation from their common ancestor<sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, there is remarkable evolutionary convergence between songbird and human vocal learning in terms of behavioral progression, developmental effects of deafening, anatomical connectivity of vocal-motor learning circuits, sites of accelerated evolution within the genome, and specific genes with specialized up- or down-regulated expression in song and speech circuits relative to the surrounding motor control circuits<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Unlike in humans, however, vocal learning is strongly sexually dimorphic in zebra finches and many other vocal learning species<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Male zebra finches learn to produce a species appropriate song by imitating mature male conspecifics during juvenile development, while females are limited to producing innate calls<sup><xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The songbird vocal motor learning circuit contains four major interconnected telencephalic song control nuclei; HVC (proper name) in the dorsal nidopallium (DN); the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) in the anterior nidopallium (AN); the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) in the lateral intermediate arcopallium (LAI); and Area X in the striatum (Str; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>)<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. During juvenile development in zebra finch females, HVC and RA atrophy, HVC fails to form synapses in RA, and Area X never appears<sup><xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Amazingly, female zebra finches treated with estrogen or a synthetic analog at an early age do not exhibit song system atrophy and instead form a functional neural circuit with all the anatomical components and connections seen in males<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. This “masculinized” song system allows estrogen supplemented females to imitate vocalizations, though not with the same accuracy as males<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Interestingly, lesioning female HVC prevents estrogen dependent anatomical “masculinization” of its postsynaptic targets of RA and Area X<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The genetic basis of this estrogen-sensitive and sexually dimorphic zebra finch vocal learning remains largely unknown beyond the downstream recruitment of the androgen receptor (AR)<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. However, the examination of a rare gynandromorphic zebra finch with lateralized sex chromosome composition indicates that genetically male HVC and Area X are larger than their female analogs independent of gonadal hormone production, implicating sex chromosome gene expression within the song system<sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. Unlike the mammalian X and Y, birds have a Z and W sex determination system where females are hemizygous (ZW) and males homozygous (ZZ)<sup><xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. The relevant transcriptional machinery appears to be set up by post-hatch day 30 (PHD30), after which estrogen fails to masculinize female song nuclei or behavior and the male song system enlarges while the female song system atrophies<sup><xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. Taken together with the hypothesis that vocal learning in females was lost multiple independent times amongst songbirds<sup><xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>, the extant findings suggest genetic drivers of vocal learning loss associated with estrogen, sex chromosomes, and song nuclei gene expression specializations. To screen for potential genetic drivers and locate their action within the song system, we performed an unbiased analysis of transcriptomes from song nuclei and surrounding motor control regions in zebra finches of either sex chronically treated with 17-β-estradiol (E2) or vehicle from hatch until sacrifice at PHD30 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). We used a new zebra finch genome assembly and annotation produced by the Vertebrate Genomes Project containing both the Z and W chromosomes<sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Identification of gene expression modules in song nuclei</title>
<p>We first sought to characterize differences in song nuclei gene expression specializations relative to surrounds in juvenile males and females with and without E2 treatment. We used RNA-Seq data from a previous study by our lab, on the effects of E2 manipulation on the song system in both males and females<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. This E2-treatment program masculinized females sufficiently for them to produce song as adults in another cohort of birds<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Birds were sacrificed as juveniles at post-hatch day 30 (PHD30), after a one hour period of silence to limit activity-dependent gene expression in song nuclei and surrounding motor regions; this developmental age was chosen because it is around the time when both males and E2-treated females start to sing (e.g. subsong) and all four song nuclei are sufficiently developed to be visually apparent in histological sections<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The four major song nuclei (HVC, LMAN, RA, and Area X) and their adjacent surrounding motor regions (DN, AN, LAI, and Str respectively; <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>) were dissected using laser capture. The E2-treated females in this study had similarly sized song system nuclei as males, indicating that E2 treatment prevented atrophy. This past study mapped the RNA-Seq reads to an older genome assembly lacking the W sex chromosome<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>With this data, we first remapped RNA-Seq reads (from n = 3 birds per group) to a new zebra finch assembly (GCF_008822105.2) with both the Z and W chromosomes. In our quality control analyses, hierarchical clustering of sample expression vectors revealed two technical outliers, one HVC from a vehicle-treated male HVC and one RA from a E2-treated female, which we excluded from further analysis (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). Similar to previous PCA and hierarchical clustering<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, the remapped RNA-Seq data expression levels with outliers removed still resulted in separation of song nucleus and surround and some E2-treated female samples, without sufficient resolution at finer group levels (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). To address our questions at finer resolution and in an unbiased way, we performed weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA), where we decomposed the transcriptome into actively expressed gene modules using hierarchical clustering of the gene adjacency matrix. This matrix describes the inferred structure of gene networks within our data and was calculated by soft thresholding the matrix of gene-to-gene expression correlations across samples (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>)<sup><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. After initial hierarchical cluster-based module assignment, genes were iteratively reassigned to the module whose aggregate expression they best correlated with until no additional genes met the WGCNA reassignment threshold (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref></bold> and <bold>Methods</bold> for parameterization). This optional reassignment was performed to ensure that genes are matched to the aggregate measure that best represents their expression.</p>
<p>Of the ∼21,000 annotated zebra finch genes, 13,220 were well expressed in the finch telencephalic brain regions sampled, a comparable number of genes to what we have seen expressed in adult zebra finch telencephalon<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. These 13,220 were assigned to 14 co-expression modules (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4a</xref></bold>). The median observation of unassigned transcripts was 22-fold lower than the median observation of module assigned transcripts (4.86 vs. 0.22 FPKM). Two modules clearly marked single samples from two different birds (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4a,b</xref> - arrows</bold>), indicative of technical overfitting; these two modules (not birds) were excluded from further analysis, resulting in a more visibly diverse pattern within and across modules (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4c,d</xref></bold>). The remaining 12 modules contained 12,444 genes in total were lettered in descending order of size A through L, containing from 4,890 to 127 constituent genes each, and were dynamically expressed across brain regions and treatment groups (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>)</p>

<title>Lack of male HVC and Area X specializations in juvenile females</title>
<p>To understand song system transcriptional specialization in the context of the gene modules, we calculated the module eigengene (MEG) expression values for each of the 12 modules (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>). MEGs are the first principle component of variance of all genes in a module and are the aggregate measure for each module’s expression across samples. We then tested for statistically significant correlations between MEG expression for each module and the song nuclei specializations relative to their respective surrounds. Each song nucleus had unique and overlapping specialization of genes in 2 to 4 modules of the 12 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>)</bold>. The LMAN specialization relative to the surrounding AN correlated with the expression of gene modules B, F and I; HVC specialization relative to DN correlated to the expression of gene modules B, F, and G; RA specialization relative to LAI consisted of gene modules C and L; and Area X specialization relative to the surrounding Str consisted of gene modules C, F, G, and I. Area X was the only song nucleus that did not have a specialized module unique to it relative to other song nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>In non-vocal learning juvenile females, interestingly LMAN was specialized relative to the AN by the same gene modules as in males (B, F, and I) as well as an additional module G (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>); RA was specialized by module A as in males, but not module L and by additional modules A and G. In contrast, neither juvenile female HVC nor Area X exhibited significant gene module expression specializations relative to their surrounds. We interpret these findings to indicate that: LMAN and RA atrophy later in juvenile female development; that module A and G genes could be associated with the start of this atrophy; HVC and Area X are likely the first to atrophy or not develop; and lack of any gene module specialization in them at this age could mean that they would be more sensitive to estrogen prevention of vocal learning loss.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>E2-responsive gene modules in song nuclei</title>
<p>To assess the effects of chronic exogenous estrogen on the developing song system, we first performed a control analysis of modules in the E2-treated juvenile males. In the E2-treated juvenile males, the song nuclei specialized modules overlap to those seen in vehicle-treated males (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> vs <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref></bold>); differences were that module I in LMAN and Area X and module L in RA were no longer present; and module G newly appeared in HVC, module A appeared in RA as seen in females, and module E also appeared in RA. These differences in gene module specializations in the male song system are consistent with the E2-treatment regimen used causing a slight decrease in vocal learning accuracy in males<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In contrast, E2-treated females more closely mirrored the gene module specializations seen in the vehicle treated male song system (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> vs <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref></bold>). Specifically, module G was not associated to RA while module C became more strongly correlated; module G expression was strongly specialized in HVC; and module C appeared specialized in Area X. Despite these changes to be more like males, in E2-treated females, module A in RA maintained its specialization as seen in vehicle-treated females (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> vs <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref></bold>), and module E appeared in RA as in E2-treated males (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> vs <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref></bold>); a weak correlation of a module I in HVC and module K in RA appeared (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). That is, the transcriptional response of female song nuclei to E2-treatment appeared to be far more dramatic than in males, consistent with estrogen inhibition in males having only a limited impact on song nuclei and vocal learning<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We performed an additional test for E2-induced changes to gene module expression in females by comparing E2-treated song nuclei in females to the combination of E2-treated surrounds from the same animals, vehicle-treated female surrounds, and vehicle-treated female song nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2e</xref></bold>). This analysis represents a comparison between samples from vocal learning capable female samples and non-vocal learning female samples at each node. It revealed 1 to 3 modules in each song nucleus of E2-treated females that were a subset of some of the strongest correlated modules found in control males (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> vs <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref></bold>). These were: module F in LMAN; module G in HVC; module C in RA; and modules C, F and G in Area X. That is, these are four core modules for song nuclei that are the most sensitive to E2-induction or enhancement in females and most associated with the presence of vocal learning in females.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Gene modules for telencephalic sex differences</title>
<p>We next tested whether some modules could be explained by sex differences in the brain. We compared vehicle treated male and female song nuclei and surrounds separately, and found that module E strongly correlated with higher expression in all male brain regions relative to females (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f,g</xref></bold>). Among the song nuclei, module G eigengene expression was significantly higher in male HVC and Area X; conversely, module C expression was higher in female LMAN and RA (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref></bold>). Among the surrounds, module H eigengene expression (not significant in any other comparison) was significantly higher in female DN and module C was significantly higher in female AN and Str (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref></bold>). These findings indicate the existence of a sex specific, telencephalon-wide shift in the transcriptome represented in these data by module E. This broad sexual dimorphism is further refined by regionally patterned sex differences like those observed for module G in HVC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Gene modules with region specific expression</title>
<p>We next quantified the magnitude of module expression differences and observed several gene modules with clear region-specific expression patterns (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h-k</xref></bold>). Module A, which appeared specialized in RA relative to LAI in several comparisons, was highly expressed in all Area X and Str samples, regardless of treatment or sex (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref></bold>). Interestingly, <italic>FOXP2</italic>, a gene critical for spoken-language and vocal learning in humans<sup><xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and songbirds<sup><xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>, was a potent member of module A, correlating with the eigengene at r<sup>2</sup> = 0.92 across all samples. Module C, which was specialized to several song nuclei including RA, HVC, and Area X relative to their surrounds and sexually dimorphic in LMAN and Str, was most highly expressed in arcopallial samples, especially RA, with some increase in HVC (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref></bold>). Module F, which was specialized to LMAN relative to its surround in all such comparisons, was highly expressed exclusively in LMAN regardless of sex and E2-treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref></bold>). Module G, which was specialized to HVC in a sex and E2 dependent manner, was only highly expressed in HVC samples, with males having higher expression than females, and females further split by treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2k</xref></bold>).</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Functional enrichment of specialized modules</title>
<p>We sought to understand the cumulative biological function of genes among the modules. To do this, we mapped the zebra finch genes to their 1:1 human orthologs where possible and then used human gene annotation to examine the Gene Ontology (GO) functions enriched within each module’s constituent genes. Of the 12,444 module assigned genes, 7,909 (63%) had 1:1 human orthologs annotated in Ensembl. We found GO terms significantly enriched in module G (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>), which included “DNA binding transcription factor activity”, “cell differentiation”, “anatomical morphogenesis”, “cell-to-cell signaling”, and “positive regulation of multicellular organism growth”, indicating that module G genes specialized in male and E2-treated female HVC and Area X potentially enact a proliferative developmental program. Other significantly enriched terms were “extracellular matrix structural component”, “external side of the plasma membrane”, and “extracellular space”, indicating that this module may also act to restructure the extracellular matrix, perhaps to accommodate new cells. Module E, which was differential between the sexes for both song nuclei and surrounds, had 6 significantly enriched terms, of which 3 pertained to DNA damage repair: “nucleolus”, “transcription, DNA templated”, and “U2-type precatalytic spliceosome” (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). These results in module E indicate that there is a telencephalon-wide sexually dimorphic gene expression program in finches that likely acts within the nuclear environment.

<title>Gene modules enriched for human speech associated genes</title>
<p>We next asked if any of the modules were enriched for genes previously determined to be convergently specialized in songbird song nuclei and human speech brain regions<sup><xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. We performed this analysis by treating the different sets of convergently specialized genes as gene ontology terms. These gene lists included the transcriptional convergence between RA and human dorsal laryngeal motor cortex (dLMC), HVC and dLMC, LMAN and dLMC, Area X and the anterior caudate, and Area X and the anterior putamen (Gedman et al. Fig3B,D<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>). We found that each of these convergent gene lists was enriched for the modules specialized to or highly expressed in the finch brain region used to generate the list (<bold>Fig3a</bold>).

<title>Gene modules enriched for specific chromosomes</title>
<p>We next determined whether any modules were enriched in genes from specific chromosomes. We performed a bootstrapped analysis, randomizing the mapping between genes and modules 50,000 times to approximate null distributions. P values for each chromosome-module pairing were then FDR corrected. To do this as accurately as possible, we performed this analysis using revised chromosomal assignments and structure from the most recent zebra finch genome assembly, bTaeGut_1.4.pri, which better resolves the microchromosomes<sup><xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> (see <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref></bold> for the less resolved bTaeGut_W.pat.v2 assembly). Surprisingly, we found that each of the 12 modules were enriched for genes from at least one chromosome (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref></bold>). The most striking enrichment was of module E genes on the Z and W sex chromosomes, with nearly all expressed W genes and ∼⅔ of expressed Z genes being members of module E. This is consistent with module E exhibiting higher expression in the male telencephalon regardless of treatment or region (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2d-e</xref></bold>). For the autosomes, we observed significant enrichments of two HVC specialized gene modules on chromosome 1A; module B (specialized in male HVC and human dLMC); and module G (specialized in male HVC and E2-treated female HVC and sexually dimorphic in vehicle-treated HVC). These results are particularly interesting given that zebra finch chromosomes 1 and 1A are believed to be the result of a songbird-specific fragmentation of the ancestral chromosome 1 found in chickens<sup><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Module A, the largest module which was highly expressed in Area X and adjacent striatum, was enriched across 5 macro-chromosomes (chr1, 2, 3, 4, and 10). Module F, which was strongly expressed in LMAN, was enriched on chromosomes 2 and 7. Modules C (most strongly expressed in the arcopallium and part of RA and Area X specializations) and I (a component of LMAN specialization) was enriched on chromosome 6 on microchromosome 35. Module D, a component of the LMAN specialization in E2-treated females, was enriched across 8 small microchromosomes (chr22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31). 4 of the 5 smallest modules in gene counts were enriched in the microchromosomes: Module H, which was sexually dimorphic only in DN, was enriched on microchromosome 28; module K was significantly enriched on microchromosome 37 and in the “other” category, which includes all remaining unnamed DNA scaffolds in the assembly such as further microchromosomes; module J was also enriched in “other”.</p>

<title>Sex- and micro-chromosome gene expression across the telencephalon</title>
<p>The telencephalon-wide, sexually dimorphic expression of the sex chromosome dominated module E is one of the strongest features in the present dataset; Module E eigengene is highly expressed in all male samples and depleted in all female samples regardless of brain region or treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> vs <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4c-d</xref></bold>). To better understand the relationship between the sex chromosomes and module E, we examined the distribution of membership in module E with the sex chromosomes separated. WGCNA allows us to consider gene membership in a module as a continuous variable, rather than a binary variable, by correlating each gene’s expression profile to the module eigengene. Doing this for module E, we found that Z transcripts were positively correlated to the module eigengene while W transcripts were anticorrelated (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>). This is consistent with Z chromosome transcripts being generally depleted in females relative to males, while W chromosome transcripts were only expressed in female brains. This reduction in Z chromosome transcript abundance is consistent with the finding that diploid Z chromosomes in male birds do not have one copy inactivated to compensate for gene dosage, unlike the X inactivation in female mammals<sup><xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Given the sexually dimorphic expression of module E across brain regions and the enrichment of the sex chromosomes within that module, we separately compared the expression of sex chromosome genes in the non-vocal motor surrounds of vehicle-treated control males and females regardless of WGCNA assignment to better understand sex chromosome expression without the influence of vocal learning specialization or E2 response. To do this, we correlated expression of each sex chromosome gene to the sexual dimorphism, such that female-enriched transcripts were positively correlated and male-enriched transcripts were anticorrelated (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f,g</xref></bold>). In these gene sets, we identified between 73 and 82 significantly expressed W chromosome genes and between 433 and 527 significantly depleted Z chromosome genes for each of the surround regions in males relative females. Examining the union of these gene sets revealed that a total of 95 W and 694 Z chromosome genes were differentially expressed between sexes in at least one brain region, 62% and 65% of annotated sex chromosome genes respectively. Conversely, the intersection of these regional gene sets contained 58 significantly expressed W chromosome genes and 306 significantly depleted Z chromosome genes in all non-vocal regions in females, representing 38% and 29% of annotated sex chromosome genes, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h-i</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref></bold>). This indicates that there is a telencephalon wide set of sex enriched and depleted sex chromosome genes in addition to regionally patterned sex chromosome gene expression.</p>
<p>We also observed strong enrichments of several of the smaller gene modules, J and K, on microchromosomes. Examining the MEG expression for these modules, we found that both were expressed brainwide in non-overlapping sets of animals. Module J was highly expressed in all samples taken from animal-b, an E2-treated female (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>); similarly, module K was most highly expressed across all samples from animal-g, an E2-treated male, and exhibited intermediate expression in all samples from animal-f, a vehicle-treated female (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>). Though not enriched on microchromosomes, Module L exhibited similar animal-specific high expression in animal-a, an E2 treated female (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref></bold>). These animal and chromosome specific shifts in the transcriptomes could represent the systemic effects of allelic chromosomal structural variation which WGCNA was able to capture due to our broad sampling of regions across the telencephalon.</p>

<title>Modeling vocal learning and sex chromosome module interactions</title>
<p>As it is unlikely that the gene modules act independently of each other, we sought putative interacting genes between two modules of interest, module G specialized in HVC and Area X and module E dominated by sex chromosome genes. To do this, we again replaced binary in-or-out module membership with continuous module membership by correlating each genes’ expression to the relevant module eigengene<sup><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. This allowed us to quantify the extent to which any gene was associated with any module, regardless of initial assignment<sup><xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. Looking across all assigned genes for our modules of interest, we identified two outlier genes, <italic>PDE8B</italic> and <italic>HABP4</italic>, which were the most E associated gene assigned to module G and the most G associated gene assigned to module E, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4j</xref></bold>).

<title>Candidate gene drivers of HVC specialization in E2-treated females</title>
<p>To reduce the 344 genes in module G to the putative drivers of masculine HVC development, we next examined the relationship of continuous membership in module G (correlation to MEG-G) to gene expression specialization in HVC at the level of single genes. We did this by correlating gene expression to the specialization of HVC in males (vehicle- and E2-treated) or E2-treated females for each of the following four vocal learning comparisons: 1) male HVC specialization relative to the surround; 2) E2-treated female HVC specialization relative to the surround; 3) HVC sexual dimorphism in vehicle-treated controls; and 4) E2-treated female HVC specialization relative to vehicle-treated female HVC. For all four comparisons, we found the higher the correlation of module G genes to the MEG, the higher the correlation with the vocal learning specialization (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-d</xref></bold>). This means that their expression was higher in male or E2-treated female HVC relative to the appropriate non-vocal learning controls across all comparisons. We identified genes of interest as being strongly correlated (r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.5) to both the module G eigengene and vocal learning specialization (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e-h</xref></bold>, higher magnification view of colored boxes in <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-d</xref></bold>).

<p>We examined the chromosomes of origin for these 14 core genes and found that three (<italic>GHR</italic>, <italic>RGS7BP</italic>, and <italic>THBS4</italic>) were on the Z sex chromosome (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5j</xref></bold>). This was a &gt;3-fold significant enrichment over chance of Z chromosome transcripts (p = 0.009, upper-tailed hypergeometric test) against a background of module assigned genes. This result was statistically significant regardless of the background gene set, when using all genes (∼21,000) or only module G members (344). These three Z chromosome module G genes in HVC not only exhibited &gt;50% reduced expression in control female HVC relative to males, but also exhibited upregulated expression in male HVC relative to the surrounding DN regardless of treatment and upregulation in E2-treated female HVC relative to either the surround or vehicle-treated female HVC (<bold>Fig. S7</bold>). In the context of our cross-region sex chromosome analysis (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c-f</xref></bold>), only <italic>RGS7BP</italic> was sexually dimorphic outside of the song system, being depleted in all female surround regions. Neither <italic>GHR</italic> (growth hormone receptor) nor <italic>THBS4</italic> were significantly depleted in any surround region comparison. Taken together, these results indicate that the 3 core genes in vocal learning capable HVC on the Z chromosome are subject to additional E2 sensitive transcriptional regulation in HVC, separate from the Z chromosome transcript depletion seen throughout the female brain.</p>
<p>Of the 14 core genes total, several have been previously studied in the brains of other species which may inform their role in vocal learning systems. <italic>THBS4</italic> encodes a secreted extracellular-matrix glycoprotein necessary for appropriate neuronal migration in the mouse<sup><xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and is elevated 6-fold in the human cortex compared with non-vocal learning primates<sup><xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. Human <italic>EDA2R</italic> was recently identified as a top correlate of cognitive performance and brain size<sup><xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>; it was also found in a human GWAS study to correlate with circulating estrogen and testosterone levels<sup><xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup>. Rare mutations in human <italic>PHETA1</italic> lead to Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome, that includes pathophysiology in seizures, mental retardation, and structural brain abnormalities<sup><xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. <italic>SIX2</italic> is a homeobox domain containing transcription factor that governs early brain and craniofacial development and provides neuroprotection from dopamine injury<sup><xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup>. <italic>GHR</italic> encodes a transmembrane receptor whose activation controls cell division<sup><xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>. The gene which encodes GHR’s ligand, growth hormone, is interestingly duplicated and undergoing accelerated evolution in the genomes of songbirds, including the zebra finch<sup><xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. Based on these findings, we consider <italic>GHR</italic> as the most likely candidate gene related to the E2 sensitive atrophy of HVC in females. Based on the findings in these gene sets, we hypothesize that without excess estrogen in females, HVC expansion is prevented by not specializing the growth and neuronal migration promoting genes in module G to the HVC lineage by late development. This is potentially enacted by depleting necessary gene products from the Z sex chromosome, such as GHR, which are already present in only one copy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study seeks to further our understanding of sexually dimorphic vocal learning in zebra finches by comparing the gene expression specializations in the song system between male and female birds at PHD30, during the critical period of atrophy for the female vocal circuit. The birds were given either a vehicle or E2 from hatching, which induces rudimentary vocal learning behavior in females where it would otherwise be absent. HVC appeared unspecialized at the level of gene module expression in control females, while in E2-treated females HVC exhibited a subset of the observed male HVC gene expression specialization. Similarly, Area X appeared unspecialized in vehicle-treated females, but exhibited a subset of the male Area X specialization in E2-treated females, consistent with the known absence of Area X in vehicle-treated females and presence in E2-treated females. This contrasts with RA and LMAN which were similarly specialized in males and females in the absence of E2-treatment. Given that lesions of HVC prevent the emergence of Area X in E2-treated females<sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>, these results support a model of zebra finch development where transcriptomic masculinization of female HVC by E2 is a critical event which facilitates the emergence of female Area X and ultimately endows these females their rudimentary song. When examining the module G HVC specialization induced by E2-treatment in female HVC, we surprisingly found that the most specialized genes were disproportionately from the Z chromosome.</p>
<p>How did E2 treatment produce the transcriptomic effects we observed with module G in female HVC and what are the implications regarding sexually dimorphic vocal learning in the zebra finch? One possibility is that this process begins with increased estrogen receptor (ER) activity within developing HVC cells after being provided surplus activating ligand<sup><xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>, followed by altered transcription of ER targets in the genome. Module G contained the androgen receptor (<bold><xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref></bold>), which is believed to be a major downstream effector of E2 response in female zebra finches<sup><xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>. This initial transcriptional loading of the system would then have been processed by gene regulatory networks within each cell, spreading in effect through the transcriptome. It is possible that differential module G expression arose purely from traditional gene regulatory networks, where transcription factors form complex, elaborate feedback networks with themselves and the genes they regulate. However, this framework fails to explain why the core 14 vocal learning correlated genes from module G in HVC were enriched for transcripts from a single chromosome: the Z sex chromosome with halved copy number in females.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the Z chromosome genes identified here are co-regulated, necessary components of a proliferative transcriptional program downstream of ER, represented by module G. The module G proliferative program could be specialized to developing male HVC by the expression of patterning genes, such as <italic>SIX2,</italic> early in development and maintained through persistent <italic>GHR</italic> signaling. We propose that these Z chromosome transcripts in module G are depleted in females by lower haplotype dosage during development and thus fail to specialize female HVC. Due to lower abundance of gene products from module G, the female HVC could be less proliferative during juvenile development and fail to facilitate emergence of its downstream target Area X. Similarly, without a sufficiently developed HVC, RA lacks one of its major inputs and may subsequently atrophy. We further propose that E2 masculinizes female song behavior by increasing the abundance of these module G transcripts in HVC, increasing specialized HVC proliferation, and facilitating emergence of HVC’s other major target, Area X (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref></bold>). This model of sex chromosome influenced song system development is consistent with recent work comparing male and female zebra finch transcriptomes from RA at young juvenile (PHD20) and young adult (PHD50) ages in un-manipulated birds, where they found that sexually dimorphic Z chromosome expression at juvenile ages preceded the dimorphic expression in the autosomes seen in adults<sup><xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>.</p>

<label>Figure 6</label>
<caption><title>Proposed model of sexually dimorphic zebra finch vocal learning.</title>
<p>We propose that estradiol treatment in female zebra finches masculinizes song behavior by overcoming insufficient Z sex chromosome dosage in HVC to increase the expressed of transcripts normally depleted in females. The Z chromosome genes upregulated by E2 are components in a larger proliferative genetic program which prevents HVC atrophy in males and allows for its expansion late in development. The upregulation of these genes allows for the increased specilization of the gene networks they participate in, promoting HVC development sufficiently to enable rudimentary vocal learning in females.</p></caption>

<p>Our results help refine the traditional notion that hormonal signaling organizes the brain to produce sexually dimorphic behaviors independent of neuronal sex chromosome content<sup><xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. Instead, our data indicate that sexual dimorphism in zebra finch song learning ability was likely established by the interaction of sex hormone signaling and sex chromosome gene expression within HVC during development. These findings are thematically similar to work in the Four Core Genotypes mouse model<sup><xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>, where chromosomal and gonadal sex are separable by translocating the sex determining <italic>Sry</italic> gene. In these mice, sex chromosome composition regulates sexually dimorphic brain gene expression, circuit anatomy, and behaviors<sup><xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>–<xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup>, though the sex chromosome genes responsible remain unknown. Additional experiments manipulating the candidate genes implicated here in developing HVC to both mimic and prevent the action of E2 in female zebra finches are needed to test these hypotheses.</p>
<p>In addition to these vocal learning focused results, performing unbiased gene network analysis with samples taken throughout the zebra finch telencephalon in both sexes revealed a surprisingly strong relationship between the modular organization of telencephalic gene expression and the chromosomal structure of the genome. Each of the 12 modules identified by WGCNA were enriched for genes from at least one chromosome. Of these significant enrichments, those from on the micro- and sex-chromosomes stood out as particularly strong. Module E encompassed the majority of W and Z chromosome genes and was sexually dimorphic in its expression throughout the telencephalon. Indeed, we found that roughly ⅓ of sex chromosome transcripts are significantly sexually dimorphic in all non-vocal brain regions, and roughly ⅔ are sexually dimorphic in at least one region. This half-brain-wide and half-regionally-patterned sexual dimorphism observed from the sex chromosomes may act as a substrate for the evolution of sexually dimorphic behaviors generally, with brain-wide shifts in expression providing a transcriptional background for evolution of sex-specific patterning in additional sex chromosome genes. These regionally patterned sex chromosome genes could then recruit gene expression networks from somatic chromosomes, resulting in the sex specific anatomical patterning of gene expression from throughout the genome. This general model is consistent with local depletion of GHR and other Z chromosome transcripts in the developing HVC lineage, leading to a loss of specialized module G expression from somatic chromosomes. This hypothesis of an interaction between sex chromosomes and autosomes linked to the gain and loss of vocal learning in one sex, can be tested in future studies.</p>

<title>Animal Handling and Sample Preparation</title>
<p>The 96 samples used in the present analysis are the E2 or vehicle treated subset of a previously published RNAseq dataset<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. We briefly re-describe our methodology here. All animal procedures were approved by the IACUC of Duke University.</p>
<p>E2 (Sigma E1024-1G) was dissolved in DMSO (100mg/mL) and then diluted in olive oil (1mg/mL). 30-50uL of E2 sample or DMSO only vehicle was applied to the flank of male and female zebra finches daily from PHD0-PHD14 and on alternating days from PHD15-30 (n=3 per sex-treatment combination). We have previously shown that this treatment program is sufficient to induce song system masculinization in E2 treated female zebra finches<sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>On PHD30, animals were sacrificed following one hour of dark isolation. Animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and rapidly decapitated. Brain hemispheres were dissected, embedded in OCT, and flash frozen in an ethanol and dry ice slurry. Sections were taken from the right hemisphere coronally at 14um onto polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) membrane slides for RNA isolation and adjacent sections taken on charged glass slides for histology or in-situ hybridizations. From the PEN membrane slides, song nuclei and surrounding control regions were laser capture microdissected (LCM) using an ArcturusXT LCM system (Nikon) guided by a Nissl stained tissue series for each animal. No sample pooling was performed, each sample originated from a single bird. This is 8 samples worth of RNAseq data per bird for 12 birds, providing 3 samples per sex-treatment-region combination, roughly a terabyte of read data.</p>
<p>RNA was extracted from the LCM isolated tissue samples using the Arcturus Picopure kit (Applied Biosystems KIT0204) following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 bio-analyzer and the RNA 6000 pico kit (Agilent 5067-1513). Next, cDNA was synthesized using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low input RNA Kit (Takara 634892). Sequencing libraries were made with the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep kit (New England Biolabs E7645L) and cleaned-up using SPRIselect beads (Beck-man Coulter B23317). Libraries were sequenced by Novogene Co., Ltd. on the Novaseq 6000 platform (Illumina) and S4 flow cells resulting in 150bp paired-end reads.</p>

<title>RNAseq read mapping and quality control</title>
<p>RNAseq reads were first trimmed to remove adapters and low quality base calls using Trimmomatic<sup><xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> and then mapped to a high-quality Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) female zebra finch nuclear genome (bTaeGut2.pat.W.v2, GCF_008822105.2)<sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> using STAR (v2.7.1)<sup><xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>. Uniquely mapped reads were then tallied at the level of genes using Rsubread::featureCounts (R-3.6.3)and then counts normalized to fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads<sup><xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>. Multi-mapped reads were rejected as they have a higher probability of being associated with technical artifacts of sequencing or genome assembly. Read based quality control was performed with FastQC (Babraham Bioinformatics) with reports prepared by MultiQC (Python-3.5.5)<sup><xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>. This workflow was automated by the CountMatrix pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mattisabrat/CountMatrix/">https://github.com/mattisabrat/CountMatrix/</ext-link>). We next removed two outlier samples (one male vehicle HVC and one female vehicle RA) based upon hierarchical clustering of the sample space before computing gene-to-gene correlations (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Gene Module Identification</title>
<p>All remaining analyses were completed in R-4.2 unless otherwise specified. Data was wrangled in the tidyverse, and custom visualizations produced with ggplot, ggdendro, VennDiagram, RColorBrewer, and ggpubr<sup><xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup>. Unsigned topological overlaps between genes (gene-to-gene correlations) were calculated in a single block with WGNCA::blockwiseModules with a soft thresholding power (β) of 6 based on scale free topology fit and model connectedness as described in the WGNCA vignette (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>)</bold><sup><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. Next we determined an appropriate WGCNA parameterization quantitatively and qualitatively by sweeping the module size and tree cut height parameters of WGNCA::recutBlockwiseTrees. We selected our model for analysis by examining the resulting gene assignments and sample-sample distance matrices. We were able to increase or decrease the proportion of genes assigned to WGCNA modules by lowering or raising the minimum module size parameter, respectively. We found that setting the minimum size parameter below 100 genes included more genes, but with models that increasingly over-fit single samples, producing obvious outliers in the distance matrix (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref></bold>). Correspondingly, raising the minimum size parameter beyond 100 included fewer genes, but did not greatly reduce the number of outlier samples. Based on this we selected 100 as the minimum module size, parameterizing to explain as much transcriptomic variance as possible while minimizing the number of technically overfit samples (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>-<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Module association to vocal learning</title>
<p>Module eigengenes (MEGs) from each module were correlated against binarized song system membership, vocal learning capability, or sex and the statistical significance of each correlation assessed using WGCNA::corPvalueStudent. This was done in the following sample subsets by node: male samples broken out by treatment; female samples broken out by treatment; all female samples; song system components from either sex treated with vehicle; and surrounding control regions from either sex treated with vehicle. Within each of the 4 sex-treatment combinations we compared the song system components to surrounds at each node. Within all female samples we compared the vocal learning capable E2-treated song system elements to all other female samples from each node. Within the vehicle song systems and vehicle surrounds we compared between male and female finches for each region.</p>

<title>Module gene ontology and convergent vocal learning gene expression signature enrichment</title>
<p>Module assigned zebra finch genes were mapped to their 1:1 human orthologs where possible, dropping unmapped or multi-mapped genes, using orthofindR::getOrthos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ggedman/orthofindR">https://github.com/ggedman/orthofindR</ext-link>) which wraps Ensembl’s biomaRt. Uncorrected p values for the enrichment of human gene ontology terms within the human orthologs of module G were calculated using generally applicable gene set enrichment (GAGE) implemented in gage::gage<sup><xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>. To determine if the genes previously shown as convergently differentially expressed in the zebra finch song system and human speech brain regions mapped to specific modules, we treated these five gene lists identically to GO terms and tested for their significant enrichment across the human orthologs of each module also using GAGE.</p>

<title>Analysis of sex chromosome gene expression independent of vocal learning or E2 treatment</title>
<p>Sex chromosome transcripts, regardless of WGCNA module assignment, were examined in the vehicle-treated non-vocal learning producing surround samples for each node. To find the most consistently expressed and depleted W and Z chromosome genes respectively, we correlated expression of each sex chromosome transcript with sexual dimorphism within each region, such that expressed W genes would be positively correlated and depleted Z chromosome genes would be anticorrelated. We computed correlations and p values using the WGCNA corAndP function; upper-tailed for the W chromosome and lower-tailed for the Z chromosome. Genes significantly expressed or depleted across regions were then intersected to identify consistently regulated transcripts across the telencephalon.</p>

<title>Module enrichment on chromosomes</title>
<p>To associate modules to chromosomes, we bootstrapped FDR corrected p values for the enrichment of each chromosome-module pairing by randomizing the mapping of genes to modules 50k times and calculating the enrichments observed on each chromosome from each module in each randomization to empirically determine the null distributions. The calculation of bootstraps and p values was performed in Python-3.5.5 and parallelized using joblib’s Parallel.</p>

<title>Identification of core module G genes in HVC and Z chromosome enrichment</title>
<p>We defined genes of interest as the subset of significantly (T test for correlation: p≤0.05) vocal learning capability correlated genes in HVC whose expression correlated to module eigengene G (MEG-G) across the dataset at r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.5 and to vocal learning at r<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.5 in at least one of the four vocal learning comparisons in HVC, calculated using WGCNA::corAndP. These comparisons were: all male HVC samples against all male DN samples; female E2 treated HVC against all other female samples at the node, including vehicle treated HVC; Vehicle treated male HVC against vehicle treated female HVC; and E2 treated female HVC against vehicle treated female HVC. We defined core genes as those meeting this criteria for all four HVC vocal learning comparisons. We tested the statistical significance of Z chromosome enrichment in this core gene list with an upper-tailed hypergeometric test, implemented in phyper, where each core gene is a sampling event without replacement from module assigned genes.</p>

<p>This study is <bold>useful</bold> as it provides further analysis of previously published data to address which specific genes are part of the masculinizing actions of E2 on female zebra finches, and where these key genes are expressed in the brain. However the data supporting the conclusion of masculinizing the song system are <bold>incomplete</bold> as the current manuscript is a re-analysis of differential gene expression modulated by E2 treatment between male/female zebra finches without manipulation of gene expression. The conclusions (and title) regarding song learning are not completely supported, with no gene manipulation or song analysis. The use of WGCNA for a question of sex-chromosome expression in species without dosage compensation is considered <bold>inadequate</bold>. As the experimental design did not include groups to directly test for song learning, and there was also no analysis of song performance, these data were also considered <bold>inadequate</bold> in that regard.</p>

<p>Prior research demonstrated that vocal learning is sexually dimorphic in zebra finches; female song nuclei atrophy and fail to develop, but can be rescued with exogenous 17-𝛃-estradiol (E2) treatment. In previous research, the authors treated both male and female birds with exogenous E2. They laser-captured dissected tissue samples from the E2-treated individuals as well as untreated controls. They then extracted RNA and used RNA-seq to characterize the transcriptomes within and adjacent to four major song nuclei (HVC, LMAN, RA, Area X) in these birds. In this study, Davenport et al. remapped this massive amount of transcriptome data (n=3 birds per sex/treatment group) to fully resolve the genomic location of differentially expressed genes, which they assigned to several modules based on co-expression. Adequate read mapping to all chromosomes was previously impossible with zebra finch genome assemblies lacking W chromosome data. Using the high-quality zebra finch genome assembly with Z and W chromosomes (bTaeGut2.pat.W.v2), the authors were able to demonstrate the enrichment of certain modules on certain chromosomes; most interestingly, Z chromosome gene expression was increased in E2-treated females. This research greatly improves our understanding of the ontology and location of genes involved in song development in E2-treated females, providing insight into the development of vocal learning in the zebra finch.</p>
<p>The authors' main conclusions on the importance of certain gene modules in the vocal learning process are well warranted by their excellent data and thorough analyses, but should not be too broadly interpreted as necessarily applying to the gene expression involved in vocal learning in other species. While the data here further supports convergent evolution in vocal learning genes in humans and zebra finches, vocal learning is unusually sexually dimorphic in zebra finches compared to most other vocal learners.</p>
<p>The authors note the possibility of female haploinsufficiency of Z-linked genes such as the growth hormone receptor (GHR) and also imply there are potential effects of the fission of the ancestral chromosome into passerine chromosomes 1 and 1A impacting the typical development of male zebra finch song and the lack thereof in females. These thoughts are intriguing and should prompt further transcriptomic research in avian species with the same genomic features (ZW females, split 1 and 1A chromosomes) where females also learn song, i.e. female-singing passerine species. Currently, it is impossible to say if female-singing species are, as is likely with the E2-treated zebra finch females, using estrogen signaling pathways to regulate an increase in dosage of these genes. Alternately, these female-singing birds may be using different gene modules, which is also worthy of investigation. This research excels at elucidating the genomic underpinnings of vocal learning in a model organism; further research will demonstrate how broadly applicable these authors' findings are across other species.</p>

<p>This work tried to identify genes involved in the song learning of zebra finches by looking at gene expression from individuals who could learn to sing (males and E2-treated females) or not learn to sing (untreated females). They use extensive RNAseq data from one of their previous publications, but this time align the reads to a female genome (from another of their previous publications). Here they use traditional Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules (sets of genes whose expression co-varies across all samples) and then find how these sets of genes collectively differ between brain regions involved in song learning and the surrounding tissues not involved in song learning. This approach identified modules that were significantly different in expression between males and females, and the authors interpret this as sex chromosomes being involved in song learning. However, this approach is highly skewed by unrelated patterns of gene expression from the sex chromosomes due to a lack of dosage compensation in birds. In short, by generating WGCNA modules from males and females, all sex chromosome genes will be expected to be artificially pulled into one module due to methodological artifacts and not true biologically relevant differences.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
It's nice to see large datasets being reevaluated with updated genomes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Zebra finches (like all birds) do not have XX/XY sex determination, but instead have ZZ/ZW, which means that males have two copies of the Z chromosome and females have one copy of the Z and one copy of the W. This is important because it means that if males and females express all their genes at the same rate, then expression of Z genes will always be twice as high in males relative to females. [While mammals have mechanisms to equalize expression of X chromosome genes between males and females (aka. dosage compensation), birds do not have such chromosome-scale mechanisms.] Therefore, the expression of genes on the sex chromosomes of birds will always differ dramatically between males and females, without necessarily indicating any biologically meaningful difference. WGCNA-based approaches (such as those used here) form modules based on differences in gene expression across all samples. Since this manuscript used all samples to generate their WGCNA modules then all (or nearly all) of the expressed genes on the sex chromosomes would be expected to be pulled into the same module - which is precisely what happened: the reported 'module E' contained 904 genes, while there are only 1,078 genes annotated on the Z chromosome of the reference genome used. Some of these genes may 'belong' in other modules if there are regional differences, but the dosage-driven-differences between sexes across all regions will overwhelm these signals. Therefore great care needs to be taken when interpreting the results of this study until such time as independent analyses can verify these results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Davenport et al have investigated how the administration of a masculinizing dose of estrogen changes the transcriptomes of several key song nuclei song and adjacent brain areas in juvenile zebra finches of both sexes. Only male zebra finches sing, learn song, and normally have a fully developed song control circuitry, so the study was aimed at further understanding how genetic and hormonal factors contribute to the dimorphism in song behavior and related brain circuitry in this species. Using WGCNA and follow-up correlations to re-analyze published transcriptome datasets, the authors provide evidence that the main variance of several identified gene co-expression modules shows significant correlations with one or some of the factors examined, including sex, estrogen treatment, regional neuroanatomy, or occurrence of vocal learning.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Among the main strengths are the thorough gene co-expression module and correlation analyses, and the inclusion of both song nuclei and adjacent areas, the latter serving as sort of controls for areas that are not dimorphic and likely broadly present in birds in general. The most relevant finding is arguably the identification of some modules where gene expression variation within song nuclei correlates with hormonal effects and/or gene location on sex chromosomes, which are present at different dosages between sexes. The study also shows how a published RNA-seq dataset can be reanalyzed in novel and informative ways.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Among its main weaknesses, the study relies entirely on one set of transcriptomic data and lacks effort to validate the inferred direction of regulation in the identified co-expression modules using other molecular methods or approaches on independent samples. The study shows that some representative and/or highly significant genes in some of the main modules that correlate with anatomical, sex, or hormone treatment group comparisons indeed differ in expression when comparing song nuclei vs surroundings, male vs female, or E2- vs VEH-treated tissues in independent samples by qPCR or in situ hybridization would provide important validation and enhance experimental rigor for the analyses presented. In the absence of this further validation, the WGCNA data need to be interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>The findings related to ex-chromosome genes (i.e. module E) are a significant strength of the study. Two points, however, need to be taken into account more closely. First, sex differences in gene expression in areas that are not song nuclei are likely related to functions other than song behavior or vocal learning, thus not related to the main question posed by the study. Furthermore, an alternative interpretation with regard to sex chromosome gene expression is that the higher male expression for a large number of Z chromosome genes may not significantly or fundamentally affect brain cell function and can be tolerated, thus not requiring active compensation. This alternative interpretation (mentioned for song nucleus RA in Friedrich et al, Cell Reports, 2022) suggesting that the higher male dosage of many of these genes might not affect or contribute to sex differences in brain function, cannot at present be discarded, and should at least be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Friedrich et al, Cell Reports, 2022 (Table S3 ) presented an extensive manual curation of W chromosome genes in zebra finches. BLAST alignments showed that a large proportion of W chromosome genes are also on the Z, noting that only a small subset of these are annotated as Z:W pairs. The genes that are truly W-specific and present at a higher dosage in females are thus only a fraction of W-chromosome genes. This creates a complication when examining the mapping of RNA-seq reads to sex chromosomes: to conclude about higher expression of W genes in female tissue samples one needs to take into account reads that may also map to the homologous genes on the Z, if that gene is present as a W:Z pair. Because Friedrich et al mapped reads to a male genome assembly, W genes were not assessed, thus the present study provides novel info. However, the issues above need to be acknowledged and taken into account to accurately assess sex differences in W chromosome gene expression.</p>
