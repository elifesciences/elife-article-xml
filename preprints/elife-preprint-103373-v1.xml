<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Perception relies on the neural representation of sensory stimuli. Primary sensory cortical representations have been extensively studied, but how sensory information propagates to memory-related multisensory areas has not been well described. We studied this question in the olfactory cortico-hippocampal pathway in mice. We recorded single units in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the anterior piriform cortex (aPCx), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), the hippocampal CA1 subfield, and the subiculum (SUB) while animals performed a non-associative learning paradigm involving novel and familiar stimuli. Novel stimuli evoked larger responses than familiar stimuli in the AON, whereas in hippocampal areas, novelty was reflected by the number of responsive neurons. In parallel, odorant selectivity increased along the pathway. While both stimulus identity and experience were thus reflected in all regions, their neural representations gradually separated. Our findings provide a potential mechanism for how sensory representations are transformed to support stimulus identification and implicit memories.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sensory systems form a neural representation of the outside world inside the brain by converting physical stimuli into sequences of action potentials. These neural representations enable the detection, identification, and discrimination of stimuli in the environment. The representation of stimuli in primary auditory, visual, somatosensory, and olfactory cortices has been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">deCharms and Zador, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kriegeskorte and Wei, 2021</xref>), but how stimulus representations transform from primary sensory to multisensory areas is not well described. Moreover, cortical representations are not static, but they undergo changes over shorter (&gt;seconds; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Homann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>) and longer (&gt;days; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Frenkel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Woloszyn and Sheinberg, 2012</xref>) timescales. Nonetheless, non-instrumental stimuli can be remembered in large number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Standing, 1973</xref>) and with remarkable detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brady et al., 2008</xref>). While non-associative learning can thus create vast, implicit memory of stimuli in the environment, it is unclear how stimulus representations reflect this memory.</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the transformation of neural representations from cortical primary sensory to multisensory areas in the medial temporal lobe and investigated how they were affected by non-associative learning. We focused on the olfactory system, which contrary to visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems lacks thalamo-cortical pathways. Mitral and tufted cells, the output neurons of the olfactory bulb (OB), directly project to primary olfactory cortical areas, including the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) and the anterior piriform cortex (aPCx) through the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) fiber bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brunjes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cleland and Linster, 2019</xref>). The LOT further provides input to the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), a multisensory structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wu et al., 2023</xref>) situated at the intersection with the hippocampal region. The LEC, in turn, projects to the hippocampal CA1 subfield and the subiculum (SUB), a major output of the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Witter et al., 2000</xref>). This olfactory cortico-hippocampal pathway is further characterized by extensive feedforward and feedback connections between the AON, aPCx, and LEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haberly and Price, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Neville and Haberly, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Su et al., 2009</xref>, p. 209) on one hand and the LEC, CA1, and SUB on the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Craig and Commins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Witter and Moser, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Non-associative learning modulates olfactory neural representations already in the OB, the first processing stage of the olfactory pathway. Brief, repeated odor experience leads to a gradual and long-lasting weakening of mitral cell odor representations in awake mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kato et al., 2012</xref>). In the aPCx, which has been suggested as a site of perceptual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wilson and Stevenson, 2003</xref>), repeated presentation of odorants leads to short-term habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wilson, 1998</xref>). Over longer time scales, neurons have been observed to lose their responsiveness to odors unless they are frequently exposed to them, which has been interpreted as representational drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>). How non-associative learning affects olfactory representations in the other structures of the olfactory hippocampal pathway, namely the AON, the LEC, CA1, and SUB, has not been reported.</p>
<p>To investigate the transformation of odorant representations across multiple brain areas along the cortico-hippocampal pathway, we used high-density neural probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Van Daal et al., 2021</xref>) to record more than 1400 neurons in the AON, aPCx, LEC, (ventral) CA1, and SUB of mice performing an olfactory non-associative learning paradigm, in which we presented familiar and novel odors. This paradigm allowed us to compare the encoding of chemical identity between regions and analyze at the cellular and population level how representations are shaped by experience.</p>

<title>Olfactory responses in the cortico-hippocampal pathway</title>
<p>We used a non-associative olfactory learning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rabell et al., 2017</xref>) in which we repeatedly presented four odorants in random order to head-restrained mice (n = 16) in one daily session over four consecutive days (long-term habituation, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). After this familiarization period, we recorded single units along the olfactory pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), specifically in the AON (n = 215), aPCx (n = 266), LEC (n = 233), CA1 (n = 474) and SUB (n = 186). We identified significant odor responses by comparing the firing rate before and after the onset of the odor with a Wilcoxon rank test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bolding et al., 2020</xref>). In all areas investigated, we found odorant-responsive neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). The fraction of neurons that responded significantly to at least one odor was slightly larger in the AON and aPCx than in the LEC, CA1, and SUB, but overall differences were not significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>In other sensory modalities, it has been observed that neuronal spike train statistics are different between primary sensory and multisensory neocortex. The interspike-intervals (ISI) of neurons in sensory areas follow Poisson-like statistics, whereas multisensory regions tend to exhibit more regular firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Maimon and Assad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Shin and Moore, 2019</xref>). Fitting a gamma function to the ISI distributions of each recorded brain area reveals a similar pattern for the olfactory hippocampal pathway. Only for AON and aPCx, the shape or alpha parameters of the fitted gamma functions were close to 1, indicating a Poisson-like spiking dynamic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>). The LEC, CA1, and SUB showed larger alpha values, consistent with more regular firing. While responses to odorants are thus found throughout the pathway, only AON and aPCx exhibit characteristics observed in sensory neocortex.</p>

<title>Experience modulates odor responses across the cortico-hippocampal pathway</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of non-associative learning on odorant representations along the olfactory hippocampal pathway, we introduced novel stimuli randomly interleaved with familiar stimuli in our olfactory paradigm. This paradigm allowed us to directly compare how chemical identity and experience (i.e., stimulus familiarity) are represented in different brain areas.</p>
<p>It is well established that novel odorants evoke a stereotypical increase in respiration frequency, also referred to as exploratory sniffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wesson et al., 2008</xref>). We used exploratory sniffing as a behavioral measure of experience. As expected, mice responded to novel stimuli with a significant increase in breathing rate (Figure S1A, <italic>p&lt;</italic>0.01, paired t-test). Within one experimental session, behavioral responses to novel stimuli habituated with recurrent stimulus presentation (short-term habituation, Figure S1A) such that they became indistinguishable from those to long-term habituated, familiar stimuli (<italic>p&gt;</italic> 0.1, paired t-test, after three stimulus presentations).</p>
<p>Experience affected neuronal odorant responses in all regions studied (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The differential behavioral response to novel and familiar stimuli might confound the analysis of the effect of experience on sensory representations, in particular in regions in which respiration modulates spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bathellier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>). Therefore, we focused all further analysis on a 400ms window around the first inhalation after odor onset, when the respiration rate was not yet diverging between novel and familiar stimuli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref> and S1B). In this time window, novel stimuli evoked larger responses than familiar stimuli, in particular in the AON. The impact of novelty on response magnitude gradually decreased towards the posterior regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="615807v2_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Next, we compared the odor selectivity of neurons between regions. We determined how selectively neurons encoded different chemicals by counting the number of stimuli each neuron significantly responded to. We found marked differences between primary sensory and multisensory regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Stimulus selectivity was lowest in the AON (mean=4.1±1.5 SD) and gradually increased from aPCx (3.0±1.0) to LEC (2.3±0.7), CA1 (2.4±0.8), and SUB (2.3±0.8).</p>
<p>We then asked how selectively neurons encoded novelty and familiarity. We determined for each neuron whether it significantly responded to odorants of the novel, the familiar or both stimulus categories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In primary sensory regions, both novel and familiar stimuli activated a large fraction of neurons, suggesting a mixed representation of chemical identity and experience. In the LEC, CA1, and SUB, on the other hand, a large fraction of neurons was selective just for novel stimuli.</p>
<p>To characterize sensory representations at the population-level, we used a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). First, we focused on the representation of stimulus identity and decoded the chemical identity of odorants from neuronal firing rates during the analysis window across all experimental sessions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). The decoding accuracy was above chance level in all areas, indicating that the information about odorant identity is preserved throughout the pathway. The highest accuracy values were obtained in the AON, all other structures showed a marked decrease in decoding accuracy for odor identities in the population.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed the encoding of experience in the neuronal population from each region by training a SVM to classify novel vs. familiar trials. Since we had found earlier that odor identities could be decoded from the neural data, the SVM might recover the information about experience solely based on odor identity. To address this potential confound, we compared the decoding accuracy of novel versus familiar odors with the decoding accuracy of two groups of randomly selected odors (“<italic>shuffled</italic>”).</p>
<p>The decoding accuracy was higher for experience than for the shuffled odors, indicating that neurons reflected odorant experience. We found the highest decoding accuracy of experience in the AON, while all other regions showed similar, lower levels of accuracy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>). The neural representation in the AON thus showed the highest decoding accuracy for both odor identity and experience.</p>

<title>A small subpopulation of neurons in the aPCx is tuned to familiar stimuli</title>
<p>Non-associative learning creates implicit memories of stimuli in the environment. To investigate how this memory is reflected in the sensory representations, we compared the encoding of odor identities between novel and familiar conditions. Using an SVM to decode odorant identity separately for novel and familiar odorants, we found that experience impacts the representation of stimulus identity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, the aPCx showed much higher decoding accuracy for familiar odors than novel ones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This might suggest the population of aPCx neurons is particularly tuned to familiar odorants. To investigate this further, we calculated the mutual information between neuronal firing and odorant identity, separately for novel and familiar conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This measure indicates how much knowing the firing rates reduces the uncertainty about the identity of odorants. Surprisingly, mutual information was similar for novel and familiar conditions in the aPCx indicating no specific tuning of the whole population to familiar odorants. But how could the SVM then have achieved a much higher accuracy in decoding the identity of familiar odorants compared to novel ones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) ?</p>

Importantly, a relatively small number of neurons with a large weight can have a decisive impact on classifier performance, yet they might not affect measures such as mutual information. When examining the weight distributions of SVMs for encoding familiar and novel odor identity, we found that the weights for decoding familiar odorants in the aPCx had a long tail of outliers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We calculated the mutual information for outlier subpopulations across all brain areas, corresponding to an average of 5.2% (± 0.8 SD) of the data for each brain area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The mutual information of the outlier population now captured the differences in the accuracy of encoding familiar and novel odorants observed in the SVM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), in particular in the aPCx but also the LEC and CA1 regions.</p>
<p>Collectively, these results indicate the presence of a subpopulation of neurons in the aPCx that are particularly tuned to odorants when they are familiar, as well as a subpopulation of neurons in the LEC and CA1 tuned to novel odorants. This analysis highlights that long-term, non-associative learning can refine the tuning of small fractions of neurons.</p>

<title>The representations of odor identity and experience become independent from each other along the cortico-hippocampal pathway</title>
<p>The presence of neuronal subpopulations specifically tuned to familiar odors in aPCx and to novel odors in LEC and CA1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>) raises the general question of how much each neuron contributes to encoding individual stimulus features. Do separate groups of neurons represent different stimulus features, or do all neurons form a continuous distribution for “multiplexed” encoding of odorant identity and experience?</p>
<p>To address this question, we analyzed the weights of the SVM trained to classify odorant identity. We did this separately for novel and familiar odors. If the same neurons which were good at classifying the chemical identity of the familiar odors were also good at identifying the chemical identity of the novel odors, their weights should be correlated. We found that SVM weights were increasingly correlated across the olfactory pathway from AON to SUB (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggests that neurons specialized in encoding chemical identity, independent of experience.</p>

<p>If this was indeed the case, it should also be reflected in the errors made by the SVM. If a neuronal population is specialized in encoding chemical identity irrespective of experience, a classification error will correspond to mistaking an odor for any other odor. On the other hand, if separate populations encoded familiar and novel odors, a SVM should mostly mistake familiar odors for other familiar odors and novel odors for other novel odors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Analyzing the SVM errors for each brain area, we found a shift from making errors within the same category (i.e., the decoder mistakes a familiar odor for another familiar odor or a novel odor for another novel odor) to mistakes being made interchangeably between novel and familiar categories (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding that encoding stimulus identity becomes independent of experience in multisensory areas is further supported by analysis of neuronal firing at the population level. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate the position of novel and familiar trials in neural space. Notably, the representations of stimulus identity were separated between novel and familiar stimuli in AON and aPCx, while they became increasingly similar in multisensory areas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>To quantify this effect, we calculated the Euclidean distance between novel and familiar trials on the one hand and between all trials irrespective of experience on the other. In AON, aPCx and LEC, the distance between novel and familiar trials was significantly higher than when not taking experience into account. Conversely, in the SUB, novel and familiar trials were significantly closer than the average distance between all trials (Figure S2A). The ratio of the two Euclidean distance measures revealed a significant, progressive decrease in distance between familiar and novel trials along the pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the representation of odorant identity gradually became independent from the representation of experience, we then asked if there was a distinct population of neurons encoding experience, independent of odorant identity. The SVM could decode experience in the multisensory areas with high accuracy (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>), but we found little evidence for the emergence of neurons that specifically responded in a stimulus-invariant manner to all novel or all familiar stimuli (novel 1/1414s and familiar 2/1414; Grubbs test confirmed stimulus-invariant neurons were not rare outliers of the distribution; see methods). Instead, we observed an increasing odor selectivity in multisensory areas (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) and the emergence of a population of neurons responding significantly to specific odors only when they were novel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Across the olfactory-hippocampal pathway, if a neuron responded to at least one novel odor, it had a decreasing probability of also responding to a familiar odor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). These observations imply that the number of odor-responsive neurons reflects experience. In any given trial, the more neurons were activated by a stimulus, the more likely the stimulus was novel.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found a gradual transformation of sensory representations from primary sensory to multisensory areas, during which the representations of odorant identity and experience became increasingly independent from each other. This gradual transformation of sensory representations coincided with increasing response reliability, as we observed that the variance of neuronal responses progressively decreased from AON to medial temporal lobe structures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we carried out extracellular recordings in awake, head-restrained mice performing a non-associative olfactory learning paradigm to characterize the transformation of olfactory representations from cortical primary sensory to multisensory areas in the medial temporal lobe. We analyzed neural responses to different novel and familiar olfactory stimuli in the AON, aPCx, LEC, CA1, and SUB to determine how odorant identity and odorant experience were reflected in each brain area. We found that both odor identity and olfactory experience were represented in every region, but representations were transformed between brain areas along the pathway. In the AON, neurons were broadly tuned to different chemicals, and their responses were modulated by experience such that novel stimuli caused larger increases in firing rates than familiar stimuli. From the AON to hippocampal structures, the selectivity of neurons for specific odorants gradually increased, concurrent with the development of population-level odor representations, which became independent of novelty and familiarity. Consistent with this, we observed the emergence of specific populations of neurons tuned to select familiar odorants in aPCx and novel odorants in medial temporal lobe structures. These results suggest a gradual separation of the representations for identity and experience from AON to SUB.</p>
<p>The very first cortical processing stage, the AON, consistently outperformed all other brain areas in decoding accuracy for both stimulus features. Although the AON is the earliest cortical brain region involved in olfaction, it has thus far received remarkably little attention. This is in part because past research has focused on the aPCx, which is widely believed to carry the information for determining odorant identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kadohisa and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Miura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>). Our results are more consistent with an earlier hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Haberly, 2001</xref>) and recent experimental findings which suggest the AON plays a critical role in novel odor recognition(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rabell et al., 2017</xref>) and odor identification in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chae et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Quintela et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, we support the view that the AON rather than aPCx should be considered as the primary sensory cortex in olfaction, but more research is needed to validate this hypothesis.</p>
<p>In the aPCx, we found a small population of neurons, specifically tuned to familiar odorants which might support the identification of known stimuli in the face of representational drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>). Small, specialized subpopulations, like the one we identified in the aPCx might well provide a stable representation, even when most other neurons are unstable. However, they are easily overlooked due to the current limitations of longitudinal tracking of neurons. Approaches for tracking neurons with large-scale recording techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Van Beest et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yuan et al., 2024</xref>) will be instrumental in clarifying this question.</p>
<p>The finding that the LEC, CA1, and SUB represent the identity of odorants after they have been familiarized by passive exposure over several days might be considered surprising since nondeclarative learning is commonly viewed to be independent of medial temporal lobe structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Squire et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">2004</xref>). However, a specific projection from the CA1 to the AON has recently been shown to be critical for spatiotemporal odor memory in a nondeclarative behavioral paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aqrabawi and Kim, 2020</xref>)This suggests that the representation of specific odorant chemicals we observed might underlie the formation of contextual odor memories in CA1 and other medial lobe structures.</p>
<p>The analysis of the representation of experience in the LEC, CA1, and SUB offers additional important insights. Novel stimuli activated more neurons than familiar stimuli in the LEC, CA1, and SUB, which is in line with earlier descriptions of novelty-related activity in the hippocampus (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">Rolls et al., 1993</xref>). However, we did not find evidence for an abstract representation of novelty by stimulus-invariant “<italic>novelty</italic>” neurons. Consistent with the fact that hippocampal lesions do not disrupt novelty detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aqrabawi and Kim, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Honey et al., 1998</xref>), our results thus offer a new perspective on the widely accepted interpretation that the hippocampus conveys a novelty signal to other brain structures, which broadly enhances attention and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lisman and Grace, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ranganath and Rainer, 2003</xref>). Of note, previous studies had limited temporal or cellular resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>), often used few novel stimuli, and did not report on stimulus-invariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Xiang and Brown, 1998</xref>). Rather than encoding abstract stimulus novelty, our data suggests that the highly stimulus-selective neurons in LEC, CA1, and SUB represent stimulus identity, but an attentional gating mechanism causes their preferential activation when stimuli are novel. Further research is required to validate this hypothesis and to clarify the stimulus-invariance of individual neurons in response to novel stimuli from other sensory modalities and complex, multimodal stimuli, such as novel environments.</p>
<p>How experience affects sensory cortical representations has thus far mainly been studied in the visual system. Compared to familiar stimuli, novel stimuli induce larger activation in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garrett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Homann et al., 2022</xref>), which can be explained by plasticity mechanisms inherent to neocortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aitken et al., 2024</xref>). We found the same effect of stimulus novelty on response magnitude in the AON, which is remarkable, given the anatomical differences between the AON, a 2-layered archeocortical structure, and the 6-layered neocortex. Collectively, these results suggest an evolutionary conserved mechanism for novelty processing is implemented in circuits with diverging architectures.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we propose a model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) in which olfactory cortical areas represent stimulus identity with broadly tuned neurons, whose response magnitude is modulated by experience. This representation is gradually transformed such that stimulus identity becomes encoded by narrowly tuned neurons and experience by the number of active neurons. Future research involving simultaneous recordings along the cortico-hippocampal pathway will provide further insights into the processing of novel and familiar olfactory stimuli. While technically more challenging, simultaneous recordings can help to establish the temporal order of activation of different brain areas in order to resolve how the intricate network of feedforward and feedback connections supports encoding of stimulus identity and experience. Moreover, further work is needed to address the question if our findings extend to declarative paradigms, such as operant novelty detection tasks.</p>

<title>Experimental model</title>
<p>Experiments were approved by KU Leuven Animal Ethics Committee under protocol P067/2017 and performed in accordance with the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations.</p>
<p>We used 13 male and 3 female mice between 18 and 30 weeks old, C57BL/6J (from KU Leuven). Animals were housed on a 12 h dark/12 h light cycle (dark from 07:00 to 19:00). Before the experiment, they were housed in groups of 2 to 4 mice until adult age, and at the start of the experiment, they were individually housed in GM500 cages (391 × 199 × 160 mm) with food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Before starting behavioral tasks, animals were habituated to head-restrain for two days. All animals performed their task around the same time each day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4b">
<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>All mice were surgically implanted with a stainless-steel head plate to allow for head-restraining. Animals were anesthetized with ketamine and medetomidine mixture (60mg/Kg and 0.5mg/Kg of body weight intraperitoneally), and the depth of anesthesia was checked by monitoring tail pinch response, whisking and eye reflexes (as regularly throughout surgeries). If necessary, a booster shot of half the initial amount of anesthesia was given during the surgery. The head was shaved and then washed down with a series of Betadine (Meda, cat. no. 2990-257). The Xylocaine 5% (wt/wt) (Aspen, cat. no. 0137-398) was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 13 mg/Kg. Duratears (Alcon, cat. no. 0037-820) was applied to avoid dehydration of the eyes. Then mice were placed on a heating pad at 37°C (Harvard apparatus) in a stereotaxic frame (Narishige Instruments) using ear bars. An incision was made longitudinally along the top of the head, and a window of 2cm<sup>2</sup> was cut out to expose the underlying skull. Less than 50μL of Vet Bond (3M) was applied at the border between the skin and the skull to prevent irritation and scratching. A scalpel was used to remove connective tissue. The skull was dried using an air-blow device for 1 minute. The site of the craniotomy was then marked using a scalpel. Using a dental drill, ridges were created in the bone to increase the surface area of the skull for more adhesion. Dental cement (acrylic) was applied to glue the custom-made titanium head plate to the bone while leaving the site of the craniotomy free. The cement was let to dry for 10 minutes. The craniotomy was made in the shape of a circular hole of 1.5-2mm. A durotomy was made using a small precision scissor and a tweezer.</p>
<p>Subsequent steps following the craniotomy were performed according to whether recordings were conducted under acute or chronic conditions. For acute recordings, we used Neuropixels 1.0 probes (n=6); for chronic recordings, we used Neuropixels 2.0 probes (n=10). Before brain insertion, all probes were marked with a fluorescent dye (diI, Life Technologies). In animals designated for acute recordings, the craniotomy was covered with artificial dura to keep the exposed cortex healthy. Then, the craniotomy was closed with silicone (Kwik-Sil, World Precision Instruments). In animals designated for chronic recordings, probes were inserted using a micromanipulator at 200 μm/s per second to 600μm/s. Bone wax (Surgical Specialties, cat. No. 901) was applied over the probe insertion site to maintain a closed environment around the craniotomy site. Light curable dental cement (SDI Wave, cat. no. 7510203) was applied to secure the probe to the skull by curation with blue light.</p>
<p>At the end of each surgery, atipamezole (antisedan, 0.5mg/kg) was administered IP, immediately followed by the analgesic Metacam at 5-10 mg/kg. Animals were continually monitored until they regained consciousness.</p>

<p>During acute recordings, the silicone seal covering the craniotomy was removed, and the probe was connected to the recording hardware and inserted using a micromanipulator. For chronic recordings, implanted probes were connected to the recording hardware. Setups were denoised with grounded metal structures attached to the recording system. Raw data was acquired using SpikeGLX software on a computer specifically dedicated to this use. Experimental events were acquired at 3 kHz by analog inputs on SpikeGLX. Respiration was monitored with a thermal camera (FLIR A325sc with 50μm lens, 60fps, 320×240 pixels) directed to the nostrils of the animal to capture respiration.</p>

<title>Odorants</title>
<p>The stimulus set consisted of 28 single-molecule substances (Sigma-Aldrich) commonly used in olfaction research. Odors were benzyl acetate, nonadienal, isoamyl acetate, heptanal, ethyldecanoate, linalyl formate, trimethylpyrazine, geraniol, geranyl acetate, salicylaldehyde, alpha-pheleandrene, thiophane, phenylethyl alcohol, dimethylpyrazine, limonene, carvone, octanoic acid, acetic acid, menthol, eugenol, benzaldehyde, ethyl methyl phenylglycidate, anisole, cinnamaldehyde, ethyl valerate and pentenoic acid. Each odor was dissolved in mineral oil to reach a final vapor pressure of 1Pa. Odors were delivered with a custom-made, constant air flow olfactometer, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rabell et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Non-associative olfactory learning paradigm</title>
<p>All experiments were performed inside a sound and light isolated box (75*75*75 cm3) with constant exhaust to ensure rapid clearance of odorants. After recovery from the surgery (minimum 3 days), mice underwent habituation to head-restraining in the setup for one to three days. The paradigm was then performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Morrens et al., 2020</xref>). First, mice were familiarized with 4 odorants for 4 consecutive days. On subsequent days, novel odorants were introduced randomly interleaved with the previously familiarized odorants. All odors were delivered for 2 seconds and presented 10 times within one session. In recordings performed in AON and aPCx, a total of 8 novel odors were presented per session; in all other recording sessions, we used 6 novel odorants. To ensure that results were comparable between regions, we restricted our analysis to the first 6 novel stimuli presented. AON/aPCx recording sessions started with 4 presentations of familiar odorants, after which novel and familiar stimuli were presented in random order. In all other sessions, the order of odorant delivery was fully randomized. Two recording sessions were excluded from the analysis because 3 odorants which had been introduced as novel on the previous day, were mistakenly presented again.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>Upon completion of experiments, mice received an overdose of ketamine/medetomidine, exsanguinated with PBS, and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were cut into 80μm coronal sections on a vibratome. Brain slices were mounted on glass slides using a VectaShield medium and analyzed using a confocal microscope to reconstruct anatomical recording locations based on the DiI label (Life Technologies), the probe’s apparent trajectory, and the implantation’s depth.</p>

<title>auROC odor responses</title>
<p>We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) to compute the change in firing rate during odor presentation. Spiking activity was first divided into 100ms bins.

<p>Significant odorant responses were identified by comparing baseline firing rates before odorant delivery during the first 10 presentations of a given odor to the firing rate during the analysis window (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) with a Wilcoxon rank test. A neuron was considered responsive to an odor if the test result was statistically significant.

Neurons significant for both novel and familiar conditions were indicated as responding to both.</p>

<title>Gamma fit</title>
<p>We used a methodology described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Maimon and Assad, 2009</xref>).

Alpha parameters close to 1 signal a Poisson-like spiking dynamic.</p>

<title>Population decoding</title>
<p>Decoding was done using a linear Support Vector Machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kramer, 2016</xref>) to determine the identity of odorants (multi-class) or level of experience (binary class) using the firing rate of neurons in the analysis window (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Neurons from all sessions were concatenated. To allow for comparing the accuracy between regions, we subsampled the same number of neurons for each region (185 neurons). During 100 iterations, neurons were randomly chosen from the entire pool of neurons. Subsequently, neurons were divided into distinct sets for training and testing the SVM for each iteration. In order to mitigate the issue of overfitting, the Leave-1-out approach was used. Since sample sizes differed between regions, each iteration of the leave-one-out approach was averaged across different pools of decoded subpopulations. Thus, the variation (95%CI or SD) represents the fluctuation of performance of the SVM in trial-to-trial differences.</p>
<p>As there were more novel than familiar stimuli in our experimental paradigm, we took measures to balance the dataset for the SVM. For decoding experience, we used the first 40 trials of familiar and novel stimuli, respectively. For decoding odorant identity of novel and familiar stimuli separately, we used a Min-Max normalization (1) to balance different chance levels of decoding novel and familiar stimuli (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).

This allows for measuring the dependencies between two variables based on the methodologies described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kraskov et al., 2004</xref>), which gives an entropy estimation from k-nearest neighbors distances (k=3). There is one discrete variable (odor identities) and one continuous (firing rate over consecutive trials).

<p>Using formula (2), <italic>P</italic>(<italic>familiarity</italic>) and <italic>P</italic>(<italic>novelty</italic>) were computed for each neuron responding to at least one novel or one familiar odor. A value of 1 for <italic>P</italic>(<italic>novelty</italic>) indicates that the neuron is responding only to novel odor. A Grubb test was then used to evaluate whether those values indicated a particular outlier outside the normal range of the distribution.</p>

<sec id="s5k">
<title>Weight of the SVM</title>
<p>Weights of the SVM were extracted for the identity decoding of familiar and novel odors. The absolute value of those weights was used for the following analysis. The Pearson correlation for those weights was computed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. For the subpopulation analysis, neurons that had weights two times the standard deviation above the mean were counted (for familiar odors, AON=12, aPCx =11, LEC=13, SUB=8, CA1=24 and for novel odors, AON=15, aPCx =15, LEC=14, SUB=8, CA1=22) and used to compute the MI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5l">
<title>Confusion matrix and proportion of errors inside/outside level of experience</title>
<p>The confusion matrix for the decoding of all odors was computed. The mean error inside the same category (novel odors are mistaken for other novel odors; familiar for other familiar odors) and outside the category (novel odors are mistaken for familiar odors; familiar for novel odors) were then assessed. The proportion of errors made inside or outside the category was then quantified. The variance reflects the variability between different test/training sets.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5m">
<title>Distance in the neural space</title>
<p>The spike rate of each neuron in the analysis window was extracted for the first ten presentations of familiar and novel odors. They were reduced into a 2D space using a PCA. The PCA space was normalized using a Min-Max method (3) per region and for each dimension. The distance between trials was evaluated using Euclidean distance in 2D. The inter-experience distance was measured between the familiar odor trials and the first six novel odors trials. The ratio of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref> was computed by dividing the inter-experience distance by the inter-trials distance.

<p>In this important study, the authors characterized the transformation of neural representations of olfactory stimuli from the primary sensory cortex to multisensory regions in the medial temporal lobe and investigated how they were affected by non-associative learning. The authors used high-density silicon probe recordings from five different cortical regions while familiar vs. novel odors were presented to a head-restrained mouse. This is a timely study because unlike other sensory systems (e.g., vision), the progressive transformation of olfactory information is still poorly understood. The authors report that both odor identity and experience are encoded by all of these five cortical areas but nonetheless some themes emerge. Single neuron tuning of odor identity is broad in the sensory cortices but becomes narrowly tuned in hippocampal regions. Furthermore, while experience affects neuronal response magnitudes in early sensory cortices, it changes the proportion of active neurons in hippocampal regions. Thus, this study is an important step forward in the ongoing quest to understand how olfactory information is progressively transformed along the olfactory pathway.</p>
<p>The study is well-executed. The direct comparison of neuronal representations from five different brain regions is impressive. Conclusions are based on single neuronal level as well as population level decoding analyses. Among all the reported results, one stands out for being remarkably robust. The authors show that the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), which receives direct input from the olfactory bulb output neurons, was far superior at decoding odor identity as well as novelty compared to all the other brain regions. This is perhaps surprising because the other primary sensory region - the piriform cortex - has been thought to be the canonical site for representing odor identity. A vast majority of studies have focused on aPCx, but direct comparisons between odor coding in the AON and aPCx are rare. The experimental design of this current study allowed the authors to do so and the AON was found to convincingly outperform aPCx. Although this result goes against the canonical model, it is consistent with a few recent studies including one that predicted this outcome based on anatomical and functional comparisons between the AON-projecting tufted cells vs. the aPCx-projecting mitral cells in the olfactory bulb (Chae, Banerjee et. al. 2022). Future experiments are needed to probe the circuit mechanisms that generate this important difference between the two primary olfactory cortices as well as their potential causal roles in odor identification.</p>
<p>The authors were also interested in how familiarity vs. novelty affects neuronal representation across all these brain regions. One weakness of this study is that neuronal responses were not measured during the process of habituation. Neuronal responses were measured after four days of daily exposure to a few odors (familiar) and then some other novel odors were introduced. This creates a confound because the novel vs. familiar stimuli are different odorants and that itself can lead to drastic differences in evoked neural responses. Although the authors try to rule out this confound by doing a clever decoding and Euclidian distance analysis, an alternate more straightforward strategy would have been to measure neuronal activity for each odorant during the process of habituation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript investigates how olfactory representations are transformed along the cortico-hippocampal pathway in mice during a non-associative learning paradigm involving novel and familiar odors. By recording single-unit activity in several key brain regions (AON, aPCx, LEC, CA1, and SUB), the authors aim to elucidate how stimulus identity and experience are encoded and how these representations change across the pathway.</p>
<p>The study addresses an important question in sensory neuroscience regarding the interplay between sensory processing and signaling novelty/familiarity. It provides insights into how the brain processes and retains sensory experiences, suggesting that the earlier stations in the olfactory pathway, the AON aPCx, play a central role in detecting novelty and encoding odor, while areas deeper into the pathway (LEC, CA1 &amp; Sub) are more sparse and encodes odor identity but not novelty/familiarity. However, there are several concerns related to methodology, data interpretation, and the strength of the conclusions drawn.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors combine the use of modern tools to obtain high-density recordings from large populations of neurons at different stages of the olfactory system (although mostly one region at a time) with elegant data analyses to study an important and interesting question.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The first and biggest problem I have with this paper is that it is very confusing, and the results seem to be all over the place. In some parts, it seems like the AON and aPCx are more sensitive to novelty; in others, it seems the other way around. I find their metrics confusing and unconvincing. For example, the example cells in Figure 1C show an AON neuron with a very low spontaneous firing rate and a CA1 with a much higher firing rate, but the opposite is true in Figure 2A. So, what are we to make of Figure 2C that shows the difference in firing rates between novel vs. familiar odors measured as a difference in spikes/sec. This seems nearly meaningless. The authors could have used a difference in Z-scored responses to normalize different baseline activity levels. (This is just one example of a problem with the methodology.)</p>
<p>(2) There are a lot of high-level data analyses (e.g., decoding, analyzing decoding errors, calculating mutual information, calculating distances in state space, etc.) but very little neural data (except for Figure 2C, and see my comment above about how this is flawed). So, if responses to novel vs. familiar odors are different in the AON and aPCx, how are they different? Why is decoding accuracy better for novel odors in CA1 but better for familiar odors in SUB (Figure 3A)? The authors identify a small subset of neurons that have unusually high weights in the SVM analyses that contribute to decoding novelty, but they don't tell us which neurons these are and how they are responding differently to novel vs. familiar odors.</p>
<p>(3) The authors call AON and aPCx &quot;primary sensory cortices&quot; and LEC, CA1, and Sub &quot;multisensory areas&quot;. This is a straw man argument. For example, we now know that PCx encodes multimodal signals (Poo et al. 2021, Federman et al., 2024; Kehl et al., 2024), and LEC receives direct OB inputs, which has traditionally been the criterion for being considered a &quot;primary olfactory cortical area&quot;. So, this terminology is outdated and wrong, and although it suits the authors' needs here in drawing distinctions, it is simplistic and not helpful moving forward.</p>
<p>(4) Why not simply report z-scored firing rates for all neurons as a function of trial number? (e.g., Jacobson &amp; Friedrich, 2018). Figure 2C is not sufficient. For example, in the Discussion, they say, &quot;novel stimuli caused larger increases in firing rates than familiar stimuli&quot; (L. 270), but what does this mean? Odors typically increase the firing in some neurons and suppress firing in others. Where does the delta come from? Is this because novel odors more strongly activate neurons that increase their firing or because familiar odors more strongly suppress neurons?</p>
<p>(5) Lines 122-124 - If cells in AON and aPCx responded the same way to novel and familiar odors, then we would say that they only encode for odor and not at all for experience. So, I don't understand why the authors say these areas code for a &quot;mixed representation of chemical identity and experience.&quot; &quot;On the other hand,&quot; if LEC, CA1, and SUB are odor selective and only encode novel odors, then these areas, not AON and aPCx, are the jointly encoding chemical identity and experience. Also, I do not understand why, here, they say that AON and PCx respond to both while LEC, CA1, and SUB were selective for novel stimuli, but the authors then go on to argue that novelty is encoded in the AON and PCx, but not in the LEC, CA1, and SUB.</p>
<p>(6) Lines 132-140 - As presented in the text and the figure, this section is poorly written and confusing. Their use of the word &quot;shuffled&quot; is a major source of this confusion, because this typically is the control that produces outcomes at the chance level. More importantly, they did the wrong analysis here. The better and, I think, the only way to do this analysis correctly is to train on some of the odors and test on an untrained odor (i.e., what Bernardi et al., 2021 called &quot;cross-condition generalization performance&quot;; CCGP).</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate how odor-evoked neural activity is modulated by experience within the olfactory-hippocampal network. The authors perform extracellular recordings in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON), the anterior piriform (aPCx) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), the hippocampus (CA1), and the subiculum (SUB), in naïve mice and in mice repeatedly exposed to the same odorants. They determine the response properties of individual neurons and use population decoding analyses to assess the effect of experience on odor information coding across these regions.</p>
<p>The authors' findings show that odor identity is represented in all recorded areas, but that the response magnitude and selectivity of neurons are differentially modulated by experience across the olfactory-hippocampal pathway.</p>
<p>Overall, this work represents a valuable multi-region data set of odor-evoked neural activity. However, limitations in the interpretability of odor experience of the behavioral paradigm, and limitations in experimental design and analysis, restrict the conclusions that can be drawn from this study.</p>
