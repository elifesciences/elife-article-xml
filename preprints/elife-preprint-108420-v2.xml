<p>Ctenophores possess a unique gravity receptor (statocyst) in their aboral organ formed by four clusters of ciliated balancer cells that collectively support a statolith. During reorientation, differential loads on the balancer cilia lead to altered beating of the ciliated comb rows to elicit turns. To study the neural bases of gravity sensing, we used volume electron microscopy (vEM) to image the aboral organ of the ctenophore <italic>Mnemiopsis leidyi</italic>. We reconstructed 1011 cells, including syncytial neurons that form a nerve net. The syncytial neurons synapse on the balancer cells and also form reciprocal connections with the bridge cells that span the statocyst. High-speed imaging revealed that balancer cilia beat and arrest in a coordinated manner but with differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes of the animal, reflecting nerve-net organisation. Our results suggest a coordinating rather than sensory-motor function for the nerve net and inform our understanding of the diversity of nervous-system organisation across animals.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ctenophores, or comb jellies, are gelatinous marine animals that actively swim by beating rows of fused cilia known as comb plates. These coordinated ciliary movements not only generate propulsion but also allow precise control of body orientation and directional changes within the water column. Despite lacking a centralized nervous system, ctenophores exhibit sophisticated and dynamic behavioural patterns and respond to a broad range of external stimuli, suggesting the presence of an evolutionarily unique and functionally integrated sensorimotor system coordinating locomotion and posture. Several components of the ctenophore nervous system have been described, including a subepithelial nerve net (SNN), mesogleal neurons, tentacular nerves, and elements of the nervous system in the aboral organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hernandez-Nicaise, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hertwig, 1880</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jager et al., 2010</xref>). These neural structures are characterized by unique features such as a syncytial architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burkhardt et al., 2023</xref>) and an extensive repertoire of lineage-specific neuropeptides not found in other metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hayakawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sachkova et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, early genomic and single-cell transcriptomic studies failed to identify classical neuronal markers in ctenophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moroz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2018</xref>). It was only through the use of pro-neuropeptide-based markers that distinct neural cell types were molecularly identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hayakawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sachkova et al., 2021</xref>). In parallel, phylogenomic and chromosomal synteny analyses have suggested that ctenophores may represent the sister group to all other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ryan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schultz et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Whelan et al., 2015</xref>), raising the possibility that their nervous system evolved independently from those of other metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Moroz, 2015</xref>). This hypothesis positions ctenophores as a key lineage for re-evaluating the origins and diversity of neural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burkhardt and Jékely, 2021</xref>). However, without a detailed understanding of how ctenophore neurons are spatially organized and interconnected, it remains unclear how their nervous system controls behaviour. Clarifying this relationship between neural architecture and behavioural control is essential to uncovering ctenophore neural function.</p>
    <p>To address the lack of structural, circuit-level understanding of the ctenophore nervous system, we focused on a unique sensory structure—the aboral organ. This organ functions as a statocyst, a gravity-sensing structure in which a statolith, composed of lithocytes, rests upon four clusters of mechanosensory balancer cells. The statolith acts as a dense mass that deflects the balancer cilia, while the lithocytes are the specialized cells that produce the statolith material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Noda and Tamm, 2014</xref>). Each balancer cluster serves as a pacemaker: their ciliary beats initiate excitation waves in the ciliated grooves, which are then transmitted to the comb plate cilia to regulate body orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Horridge, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tamm, 1980</xref>). A key feature of balancer cilia is their bidirectional, mechanoresponsive control of beat frequency. Depending on the direction of deflection and the animal’s geotactic state, balancer cells may either increase or decrease their ciliary activity, indicating a dynamic response system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Horridge, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tamm, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tamm, 2014a</xref>).</p>
<p>In the natural environment, most ctenophores can freely adjust their posture within the water column and exhibit both positively and negatively gravitactic orientations. This behavioural flexibility is likely supported by the aboral organ, which functions as a gravity sensor and pacemaker for ciliary movement. In this study, we represent ctenophores with their aboral organ facing upwards (“balancer-up” posture), as this configuration facilitates intuitive interpretation of balance-like functions and matches the setup used in high-speed imaging experiments.</p>
<p>Previous studies have implicated membrane potential, intracellular calcium concentration, and synaptic input in modulating the balancer response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lowe, 1997</xref>). In particular, deflection-induced excitation can be abolished by calcium-channel inhibitors or calcium-free conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lowe, 1997</xref>), while high extracellular K⁺ depolarizes and activates cilia in the absence of mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lowe, 1997</xref>). Local calcium application further suggests that Ca²⁺ influx at the ciliary base may be required for the excitatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lowe, 1997</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that ionic currents and potential neural inputs play critical roles in shaping balancer-cell output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lowe, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies have revealed that the aboral organ contains diverse sensory and neural components, including a distinct neural structure termed the deep nerve net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aronova, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hernandez-Nicaise, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jager et al., 2010</xref>). However, how this deep nerve net regulates balancer or other functions has remained elusive.</p>
<p>To investigate how balancer cilia are modulated within the aboral organ, we combined volume electron microscopy (vEM) and high-speed imaging in the ctenophore <italic>Mnemiopsis leidyi</italic>. Through connectomic reconstruction, we characterized the synaptic architecture of the aboral nerve net, revealing synaptic inputs to the balancer cells. By high-speed ciliary imaging, we uncovered correlated activity patterns in balancer cilia across the four quandrants of the apical organ. Our results suggest that the aboral nerve net functions in coordinating the activity of balancer cilia, rather than fulfilling a feedforward sensory-motor function.</p>

<title>Volume EM reconstruction of the <italic>Mnemiopsis</italic> aboral organ</title>
<p>For vEM analysis, we used a 5-day-old cydippid larva of <italic>Mnemiopsis leidyi</italic>. To ensure optimal ultrastructural preservation, the specimen was prepared by high-pressure freezing, followed by freeze substitution and Epon embedding. From the aboral tip, we collected ∼1,000 ultra-thin (50 nm) serial sections as ribbons, targeting only the region containing the aboral organ. These were imaged using a Zeiss Gemini 500 SEM at a pixel size (xy) of 2.8 nm. We imaged only the region containing the aboral organ. Subsequently, images from 620 layers were stitched and aligned in TrakEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>). The final vEM dataset encompassed a volume of 60 μm × 40 μm × 30 μm. We skeletonised and annotated all cells in this dataset in CATMAID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). We reconstructed 1011 cells with intact nuclei and somata. Among these, 905 were located within the aboral organ (AO), including balancers and the aboral nerve net neurons (Video 1). Due to the compact and mostly self-contained organization of the AO, these cells were largely contained within the imaged volume. We classified these cells into cell types (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs1b" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). Our classification was based on i) ultrastructural features (e.g. number of cilia), ii) cell morphology (e.g. nerve net or bridge cells), iii) unique organelles (e.g. lamellate body, plumose cells), iv) and similarities to cell types previously described by EM. Our classification mostly agrees with the cell types identified in the one-day-old larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ferraioli et al., 2025</xref>).</p>
<p>In cells containing cilia, we also traced cilia along their length and annotated all basal bodies (Video 2 and not shown). For neuronal skeletonization, nodes were placed to interconnect the profiles of the same neuron’s processes across layers, extending the skeleton until all branches were fully traced. All nodes relevant to synaptic sites were tagged, and skeletons were named and assigned multi-level annotations. As described later, some neurons formed loop-like structures (anastomosed neurons), in which separated branches often rejoined either the main branch or smaller branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burkhardt et al., 2023</xref>). Since CATMAID only supports skeleton trees, branch nodes in such cases were placed near the closest existing node. 73 fragments could not be attached to somata-associated skeletons. Most of these fragments represent short skeletal branches that could not be traced beyond gaps or low-quality layers.</p>
<p>Next, we divided the entire aboral organ into four quadrants (Q1-Q4) to facilitate grouping the identified cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Martindale and Henry, 1999</xref>). The general body plan of ctenophores, when viewed from the aboral side, exhibits biradial symmetry around the anal pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Martindale and Henry, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>An aboral synaptic nerve net of syncytial neurons</title>
<p>Previous immunofluorescent staining in <italic>Pleurobrachia pileus</italic> suggested the presence of a nerve net at the base of the aboral organ, possibly continuous with the surrounding epithelial nerve net (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jager et al., 2010</xref>). Electron microscopy studies later revealed synapses near the floor of the aboral organ, a region where densely packed epithelial cells form a floor-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hernandez-Nicaise, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Horridge and Mackay, 1964</xref>).</p>
<p>In our volume EM dataset, we identified 396 synapses based on the canonical presynaptic triad morphology: a cluster of synaptic vesicles, a smooth endoplasmic reticulum cisterna, and a mitochondrion. At synaptic sites, we marked mitochondria as synaptic nodes (orange in CATMAID) and connected this node to the nearest node in postsynaptic cells across the regions where synaptic vesicles aligned with the presynaptic cell’s membrane, as indicated by light blue arrows in CATMAID (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</xref>). No specialized postsynaptic densities were observed, consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hernandez-Nicaise, 1973</xref>). Synapses were either monoadic (one postsynaptic target) or polyadic (multiple postsynaptic targets) (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified and reconstructed three aboral nerve-net (ANN) neurons, each exhibiting a syncytial morphology characterized by anastomosing membranes and multiple nuclei (ranging from two to five) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C</xref>, Video 3). These three neurons are the only fully reconstructed ANN neurons contained within the volume. Several small ANN-like fragments were also observed at the periphery of the aboral organ, but their continuity with the three ANN neurons remains uncertain.</p>

<p>Near the perifery of the aboral organ, we identified four further anastomosing nerve-net neurons. These resembled the previously reported syncytial subepithelial nerve net (SNN) neurons in the body wall of <italic>Mnemiopsis</italic> (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C–G</xref>) and were clearly distinct from the ANN neurons (both in location and morphology).</p>
<p>SNN neurons show a blebbed morphology and contain dense core vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burkhardt et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C–G</xref>) but no synapses. In contrast, ANN neurons are smooth-surfaced and lack dense core vesicles and are located centrally within the aboral organ. Furthermore, ANNs are also different from other neurons previously reported by EM, including mesogleal neurons and ciliated sensory cells that synapse on the SNN (types 1-4)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burkhardt et al., 2023</xref>). Our results thus identify a second type of syncytial neuron in <italic>Mnemiopsis</italic>.</p>
<p>Based on soma size and spatial distribution, we classified ANN neurons into two types. The first is a single large neuron, ANN_Q1-4, spanning all four quadrants and containing four (possibly five) nuclei. This neuron formed 164 presynaptic sites. The second type includes two smaller neurons, ANN_Q1Q2 and ANN_Q3Q4, each confined to two adjacent quadrants and containing two nuclei. ANN_Q1Q2 had 121 presynapses, while ANN_Q3Q4 had 67 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C–F</xref>). In contrast, SNN neurons exhibited no synaptic contacts.</p>

<title>Synaptic connectome of the gravisensory organ</title>
<p>Synapse annotation revealed multiple types of connections involving ANN neurons within the gravisensory organ. We identified synapses between different ANN neurons and synapses that ANN_Q1-4 forms on itself (autapses). The ANN neurons also form synapses on the gravity-sensing balancer cells and the bridge cells. Bridge cells, but not balancer cells, also synapse on the ANN.</p>
<p>Balancer cells are monociliated cells with long motile cilia that form four bundles of compound cilia, one in each quadrant (Video 2). These bundles come together at the centre of the aboral organ to support the cellular mass of the statolith. In each quadrant, there were between 28-37 balancer cells (Q1: 37; Q2: 32; Q3: 32; Q4: 28). Each cell contained 3 to 7 mitochondria. The curvature of the ciliary bundle and the position of somata differed clearly when viewed laterally from the sagittal or the tentacular plane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>ANN_Q1-4 formed synapses on balancer cells in all four quadrants (on 8 cells in Q1, 11 cells in Q2, 8 cells in Q3 and 10 cells in Q4) while ANN_Q1Q2 and ANN_Q3Q4 synapsed to balancer cells in their respective quadrants (ANN_Q1Q2 on 7/37 cells in Q1 and 7/32 cells in Q2; ANN_Q3Q4 on 2/32 cells in Q3 and 2/28 cells in Q4). Some balancer cells received inputs from both ANN_Q1-4 and either of ANN_Q1Q2 or ANN_Q3Q4. Notably, we found no presynaptic sites in balancer cells (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref>), contradicting earlier suggestions of afferent signalling from balancer cells to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hernandez-Nicaise, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>The second group of cells that formed synaptic contacts with the ANN were the bridge cells. Bridge cells, first described in 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tamm and Tamm, 2002</xref>), are characterized by bundles of elongated processes filled with microtubules that arch over the epithelial layer, resembling a bridge. Their somata are located at the base of the paired balancer-cell clusters along the tentacle surface and extend across the sagittal plane towards the base of the opposite balancer cells. Bridge cells form two distinct cell groups across the sagittal plane, in the Q1Q2 and Q3Q4 regions. In the Q1Q2 region, we identified 14 bridge cells, in Q3Q4, 12 cells (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – figure supplement 1</xref>, Video 1).</p>
<p>In contrast to balancer cells, bridge cells participated in reciprocal synaptic interactions with ANN neurons, forming both pre- and postsynaptic connections.</p>
<p>Nearly all bridge cells (25/26) received synaptic input from ANNs. Bridge cells in Q1Q2 received inputs from ANN_Q1Q2 (11 cells), ANN_Q1-4 (1 cell), or both (2 cells). In Q3Q4, synapses on bridge cells were from ANN_Q3Q4 (1 cell), ANN_Q1-4 (8 cells), or both (3 cell).</p>
<p>Bridge cells also had presynaptic sites with the typical presynaptic triad structure near 30% of their mitochondria. The presynaptic triads are concentrated on the basal end of the cell, near the nucleus. These bridge-cell synapses were formed on ANN neurons or other bridge cells. Bridge cells in the Q1Q2 region formed synapses on ANN_Q1Q2 (3 cells) or on both ANN_Q1Q2 and ANN_Q1-4 (2 cells). Bridge cells in Q3Q4 synapsed on ANN_Q3Q4 (1 cell) or ANN_Q1-4 (6 cells).</p>
<p>In both the Q1Q2 and the Q3Q4 regions, bridge cells also formed synapses with adjacent bridge cells. However, we found no synapses across the sagittal plane to bridge cells in the opposite region.</p>
<p>To examine the overall synaptic organization of the balancer organ, we grouped cells of the same type and region into network nodes, summed the synaptic counts, and mapped the network onto the four-quadrant anatomy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). The resulting connectivity graph revealed feedback loops among ANN neurons and between ANN and bridge cells, displaying biradial symmetry. Local sub-circuits centered around ANN_Q1Q2 and ANN_Q3Q4 were evident, while ANN_Q1-4 formed global connections across quadrants.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, and contrary to the expected sensory–motor or input–output model of balancer function, we found no synapses from the mechanosensory balancer cells to ANN neurons, nor from ANN neurons to known motor effectors such as ciliated groove cells.</p>
<p>The ANN neurons also formed synapses on other cell types in the aboral organ, including the dense-vesicle cells, epithelial floor cells and several non-ciliated, monociliated or biciliated cells (<xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). None of these other cell types synapsed on the ANN. These cell types and synaptic connections are outside the gravisensory organ and are not considered further here.</p>

<title>Dynamics of balancer cilia imply a coordinating function for the nerve net</title>
    <p>To investigate whether balancer cilia are coordinated by neural inputs, we did high-speed video microscopy recordings to analyze their activity patterns across body axes. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lowe, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tamm, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">1980</xref>) have established that balancer cilia function as mechanoreceptors, with their beating frequency modulated by inclination.</p>
<p>Tamm also suggested that differences in statolith morphology and the shape of balancer cilia between the tentacular and sagittal planes could lead to different forces exerted on cilia by the statolith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tamm, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">2014b</xref>). To further explore this, we used a tilted microscope with a vertical stage where we mounted immobilised cydippid larvae with their aboral-oral axis aligned in different orientations relative to the gravity vector (Videos 4-8). Larvae were oriented with their sagittal or tentacular plane parallel to the sample stage. We could confirm earlier finding that the beating frequency of balancer cilia is dependent on the inclination (Video 8). Our aim here was to focus on spontaneous ciliary beating under conditions of equal load from the statolith across quadrants. Therefore, we only analysed larvae whose aboral–oral axis was approximately parallel to the gravity vector (mouth facing downward within a 0–20° deviation). We then compared larvae oriented either with their sagittal or tentacular plane parallel to the sample stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In larvae with their sagittal plane facing the objective, we could compare balancer-cilia movements between Q1 vs. Q2 or Q3 vs. Q4. In other larvae oriented in the tentacular plane, we could simultaneously image Q1 and Q4 or Q2 and Q3. We used a high-speed camera and recorded at 100 fps for 2 minutes (12,000 frames). To analyse ciliary beating, we selected regions of interest (ROIs) in areas where brightness changes indicated ciliary beating. Ciliary beating was both manually quantified and plotted as kymographs.</p>
<p>During the two-minute recordings, balancer cilia could beat fast, slow, or exhibit abrupt stops of beating (“arrest”) followed by re-initiation (“re-beat”). Occasionally, large body-contractions moved the entire cydippid out of frame, and data from these episodes were excluded. We focused on three metrics for inter-quadrant comparison: (1) the timing of ciliary arrest, (2) the timing of re-beat after an arrested phase, and (3) ciliary beat frequency.</p>
<p>We found that arrest and re-beat events were synchronized between balancers across the sagittal plane. However, while the timing of re-beat was also near-simultaneous along the tentacular plane, arrest timing was offset by up to 2.16 seconds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, Videos 4-7). Overall, these data reveal that arrests are only coordinated between Q1-Q2 and Q3-Q4, whereas re-beat is coordinated over all four quadrants.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> (and <xref rid="figs4a" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>), beat frequencies of left and right balancers fluctuated substantially in both orientations. However, while left–right activity was largely synchronized in sagittal pairs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, left), tentacular pairs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, right) displayed strikingly periodic alternations between left and right balancer activity. This pattern suggests a consistent temporal offset between the two sides, possibly arising from differences in the timing of arrest or re-beat events.</p>
<p>To quantify this, we calculated a rolling Pearson correlation between left and right balancer activity in each plane. The resulting mean correlations were significantly higher in the tentacular plane compared to the sagittal plane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; t-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.014). This result indicates that tentacular balancers beat in a more coordinated, mirror-symmetric manner, whereas sagittal balancers exhibit greater variability between sides.</p>
<p>Evaluating these data in light of the circuit diagram suggests that shared ANN inputs (ANN_Q1Q2 or ANN_Q3Q4) to a pair of balancers along the sagittal plane may underlie their synchronized arrests. In contrast, in the tentacular plane, separate ANNs innervate the balancer pairs. At the same time, the ANN_Q1-4 neuron synapses on all four balancers, hinting at a neural substrate for their synchronised re-beat.</p>
<p>Notably, bridge neurons associated with each quadrant region (Q1Q2 or Q3Q4) extend their processes across the midline, forming connections that span between opposite quadrant domains when viewed along the tentacular plane. This morphology suggests a potential role for bridge neurons in modulating inter-quadrant coordination. By linking ANN activity across orthogonal planes, these neurons may contribute to the dynamic regulation of CBF patterns by facilitating the spread of activity across orthogonal planes, thus supporting coordinated beating throughout the aboral organ.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>An aboral nerve net for ciliary coordination</title>
<p>In this study, we generated the first high-resolution connectome of the ctenophore nervous system by reconstructing approximately 900 cells from the aboral organ of a 5-day-old <italic>Mnemiopsis leidyi</italic> cydippid by volumetric electron microscopy. Among the reconstructed cells, we identified a previously undescribed type of syncytial neuron—here referred to as aboral nerve net (ANNs)—with multiple nuclei. The ANN has a morphology distinct from that of the subepithelial nerve net (SNN) reported for one-day-old cydippids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burkhardt et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sachkova et al., 2021</xref>). The ANN neurons described here are morphologically and anatomically distinct from both the body wall SNN. Instead of forming discrete nodal swellings or a “beads-on-a-string” organization typical for the SNN, ANNs extend through intercellular spaces, weaving between neighboring cells in a smooth, interdigitating fashion. The presence of four SNN-type anastomosing neurons more laterally in the aboral organ in our dataset (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) further underlines the distinct identity of ANNs. The neurotransmitter content and activation dynamics of these nerve-net neurons remains unresolved. However, the combination of circuit architecture and behavioural outputs provides the first insight into the function of nerve-net neurons in a ctenophore. A parallel vEM study of a one-day-old cydippid describes a “condensed” SNN in the aboral region, which display a more compact morphology compared to body wall SNNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ferraioli et al., 2025</xref>). This “condensed” part of the SNN has a similar position and shape to the ANN we describe here. Furthermore, only the “condensed” part of the nerve net contained synapses. The main synaptic target of the “condensed” nerve net are bridge and balancer cells, which matches our observations. Therefore, the 5-day-old seems to have two morphologically and physically distinct neuronal cell types, while in the one-day-old they seem to not physically separated, even though they comprise two domains with different ultrastructure. It is unclear whether this is due to developmental differences or the difficulty of reliably reconstructing the neurites of the SNN.</p>
    <p>ANNs form no synaptic output to classical effector organs such as muscles or comb plates. All observed output synapses were directed to balancer ciliary cells, bridge cells or other sensory cells. This suggests that ANNs are unlikely to serve as motor drivers (premotor neurons or motoneurons) in the conventional sense. Rather, our findings suggest that the ANN network has a coordinating function to synchronize the activity of balancer cilia. This departs fundamentally from reflex-arc models of simple nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arendt, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jékely, 2010</xref>) and instead supports the idea that coordination, not command, may have been a foundational role of ancestral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Keijzer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wiljes et al., 2015</xref>). Such an organisation may have been retained in modern ctenophores ever since they evolved a pelagic lifestyle and a balancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stanley and Stürmer, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>How could the aboral nerve net exert a coordinating function? Our circuit reconstruction and high-speed imaging experiments suggest that the nerve net coordinates balancer ciliary beating, arrests and beat frequency. We observed that these changes in ciliary dynamics span multiple temporal scales from rapid arrests and re-beats to slower drifts in frequency, indicating hierarchical tuning of activity across balancers, implying higher-level coordination. We found differences in the innervation patterns of ANNs across the sagittal and tentacular planes. The two smaller ANNs targeted a pair of balancers (either Q1-Q2 or Q3-Q4) across the sagittal plane. This innervation pattern corresponded with plane-specific differences in the dynamics of balancer cilia. Across the sagittal but not the tentacular plane, the closures of balancer cilia were near-simultaneous, within less than one beat phase. Once all cilia have arrested, the re-beats occur nearly synchronously (within less than one beat phase) across all four quadrants, implying a global synchronizer. Since the large ANN innervates balancers in all four quadrants, this neuron could account for the near-simultaneous re-beat of the balancers.</p>
<p>The observation that balancer cilia beat spontaneously, even in the absence of external tilt, suggests that they are active sensory oscillators rather than static stretch sensors. Their spontaneous beating could set a dynamic baseline of sensitivity, which can then be modulated by ANN inputs or sensory changes during tilt. Such a dynamic system may be more sensitive to small deflections and be more responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lowe, 1997</xref>). Thus, the regulated beating of balancer cilia should not be seen as noise, but as an adaptive feature that enables flexible and robust graviceptive responses. The ctenophore balancer may thus use active ciliary oscillations for enhanced sensorimotor integration similar to other sensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wan, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>How could ANN neurons regulate this active oscillatory balancer system? Coordinated ANN inputs may regularly reset responsiveness by arresting cilia and modulate sensitivity by inducing periodic frequency fluctuations. This synaptic regulation may ensure uniform sensitivity to sensory load and the integration of potential modulatory inputs. Ciliary coordination could be further enhanced locally in each balancer by electrical coupling via gap junctions. Although unresolved in our EM, the expression of innexin genes indicates their presence within balancer clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ortiz et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative model for the function of the nerve net would be a feedforward sensory-motor system, in which balancer cells provide mechanosensory input to motor effectors via the nerve net, similar to a reflex arc. None of our observations support such a sensory-motor model. There are no synaptic pathways from balancer cells or any other sensory cells to the nerve net. The only synaptic input to ANNs comes from the bridge cells (discussed below) and from each other. The three synaptically interconnected ANNs may generate endogenous rhythm that controls balancer cilia and is influenced by bridge input. ANNs may also be influenced by neuropeptides secreted by other aboral organ neurons.</p>
<p>Such chemical inputs may underlie the flexibility of gravitaxis and its modulation by other cues (e.g. light). Overall, the coordination model parsimoniously explains both the ANN wiring topology and the observed dynamics, whereas a simple feedforward reflex does not.</p>
<p>The functional organisation of the ANN circuit is reminiscent of the ciliomotor circuit in the larvae of the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>. Here, the activation of cholinergic motor neurons leads to the coordinated arrest of cilia on all multiciliary bands across body segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>). This is antagonised by serotonergic midline-crossing neurons that drive ciliary re-beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calderón et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Verasztó et al., 2017</xref>). The ctenophore balancer-circuit is the second synaptically mapped ciliomotor circuit that convergently evolved analogous ciliary control mechanisms to the annelid and other cilimotor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Marinković et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Moroz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Roberts et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Bridge cells as feedback regulators of ciliary rhythms</title>
<p>In our volumetric reconstruction, bridge cells were identified as the only cell type providing synaptic input to the ANN network, positioning them as key upstream regulators of the ciliary coordination system in the aboral organ. Unexpectedly, no direct afferent connections from the balancers to the ANN were found; all balancer cells act as ‘sink nodes’ (inputs only; <xref rid="figs3a" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, bridge cells remain the sole neuronal input to the ANN. Originally described morphologically by Tamm et al. (2002), bridge cells extend thin projections towards the base of the balancer cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tamm, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tamm and Tamm, 2002</xref>). Based on this spatial relationship, they may receive information about the physical state of the cilia—such as mechanical load or phase—or possibly local field potential (LFP) changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jurisch-Yaksi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sheu et al., 2022</xref>). These features suggest that bridge cells may act as transducers, converting local ciliary signals into neural inputs directed towards the ANN circuit.</p>
<p>As revealed by our high-speed imaging, ciliary beat frequency (CBF) exhibited rhythmic changes over time that differed between anatomical planes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), indicating spatially distinct coordination dynamics. These CBF rhythms are likely generated by the ANN circuit, while bridge cells may function to stabilize or adjust this rhythmic output in accordance with the real-time state of the cilia. This way, bridge cells may provide feedback about the state of balancer cilia to the coordination circuit, serving as a core element of a self-regulating rhythm-control system.</p>
<p>This architecture can be interpreted as a recurrent information loop, in which output from the ANN circuit modulates ciliary activity, and the resulting ciliary state is in turn relayed back to the ANN via bridge cells. Such a structure suggests a loop-based coordination mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arshavsky, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Selverston, 2010</xref>), where the central circuit adapts its timing based on feedback from its target. Although the electrophysiological properties of bridge cells remain to be elucidated, their recursive integration into the ANN circuit indicates that they may function in maintaining the robustness and flexibility of endogenous ciliary rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kennedy and Weissbourd, 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>Future directions</title>
<p>Our connectomic reconstruction of the ctenophore aboral organ provides a first framework for understanding how the ANN neurons may coordinate the activity of balancer cilia. Establishing causality, however, will require new experimental approaches. For example, a direct test of the neuronal control of balancer cilia could involve the targeted ablation of ANN neurons combined with ciliary imaging.</p>
<p>Alternatively, calcium imaging of ANN activity while imaging cilia could indicate a physiological link between neural signalling and ciliary movement. Such experiments will require advances in genetic delivery methods and reporter constructs in ctenophores. We are actively developing microinjection protocols for mRNA and DNA delivery into zygotes to enable these future applications.</p>
<p>Future experiments could also explore how orientation affects the response of balancer cilia. For example, when the statolith is suspended below the cilia (the “balancer-down” posture), ciliary beating patterns may differ from what we observed here in the “balancer-up” configuration. Orientation-dependent analyses, together with multi-sensory paradigms (e.g., light or other stimuli), will help determine how the balancer combines multiple inputs to generate motor output and how the ANN shapes its dynamics. Finally, further work is needed to address the molecular composition of ctenophore neurons, including their neurotransmitters, ion channels and modulators, and their functions in ANN signalling and ciliary coordination.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>How do differences in balancer cilia coordination across anatomical planes shape behaviour? In <italic>Mnemiopsis</italic>, the animal swims upright with its mouth facing upward, and performs 90-degree rotational turns when hunting prey or responding to disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Courtney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Waggett, 1999</xref>). Large rotational maneuvers may involve balancer cells in the tentacular plane, while sagittal-plane balancers may contribute to postural stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tamm, 2015</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our findings reveal a circuit composed of ANN neurons and bridge cells that coordinates ciliary beating rhythms in space and time without direct sensory input, and features a recursive architecture in which ciliary outputs may feed back to the circuit via bridge cells. Such a configuration suggests that even with a limited number of cells, the system is capable of flexible and robust rhythm control.</p>
        <p>As Jagar et al. (2011) once described, this organ evokes the metaphor of a “ciliary brain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jager et al., 2010</xref>). The network we describe here orchestrates output through dynamic, self-regulating coordination. Future work could uncover these dynamics, visualized through live imaging of the entire cell ensemble, to offer a window into the core functions of a unique nervous system.</p>

<title>Specimen preparation, volume electron microscopy, and image processing</title>
<p>Larvae of <italic>Mnemiopsis leidyi</italic> 5-day-old (5 days post-hatching) were cryofixed using a high-pressure freezing apparatus (HPM Live μ, CryoCapCell, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cryocapcell.com/technologies/high-pressure-freezer">https://www.cryocapcell.com/technologies/high-pressure-freezer</ext-link>) and immediately transferred to liquid nitrogen for storage. The frozen samples were processed in a substitution medium containing 2% (w/v) osmium tetroxide and 0.5% uranyl acetate in acetone, using a cryo-substitution device (EM AFS-2, Leica).</p>
<p>Cryo-substitution was carried out by gradually raising the temperature from -90°C to -70°C over 4 hours, then returning to -20°C over 2 hours, and finally to room temperature over 2 hours. The samples were then embedded in epoxy resin (EMbed 812, Electron Microscopy Sciences).</p>
<p>Serial ultrathin sections of 50 nm thickness were prepared using a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome and a 45° DiATOME diamond knife. A conductive indium tin oxide-coated glass slide (ITO Glass, UQG Optics) was treated with air glow discharge using the PELCO easiGlow system (Ted Pella, Inc.) to enhance section adhesion and improve hydrophilicity. This process rendered the glass surface negatively charged.</p>
<p>Section ribbons were collected on prepared glass slides, gently dried to ensure proper stretching, and firmly adhered to the glass surface. The sections were stained with UranyLess and lead citrate (Reynolds) using airless staining procedures. The glass slides were mounted on a STEM-specific stage (Zeiss) using Copper Foil EMI Shielding Tape (3M).</p>
<p>Imaging was performed using a Gemini SEM 500 (Zeiss), equipped with SmartSEM and Atlas 5 imaging software (Zeiss), using the Inlens detector. A total of 620 serial sections, each 50 nm thick, were analyzed. The imaging resolution was 2.8 nm/pixel, and the acceleration voltage was set to 1.5 kV. The imaging time for each tile was 54 minutes and 21 seconds, with a pixel size of 2.8 nm, a tile size of 91.8 × 91.8 µm (32768 × 32768 pixels), and a dwell time of 3.0 µs.</p>

<title>Image-stack alignment and export for CATMAID</title>
<p>To process the image stack, we utilized the TrakEM2 plugin of FIJI (ImageJ) (version 2.0.0-rc-15/1.49k / Java 1.6.0_24 (64-bit) – 2014). A project was created, and all TIFF images were imported using the “import sequence as grid” function. Subsequently, the following filters were applied sequentially: Invert, Equalize Histogram, and Gaussian Blur.</p>
<p>The alignment process consisted of three stages, each progressively refining the spatial accuracy (rigid, affine, elastic).</p>
<p>Initially, a rigid alignment was run with the following parameters: least squares mode (linear feature correspondences), encompassing the entire layer range with the first layer as the reference. Only visible images were used, without propagation. The alignment was executed with an initial Gaussian blur of 1.6 pixels, three steps per scale octave, a minimum image size of 512 pixels, and a maximum of 2048 pixels. Additional parameters included a feature descriptor size of 8, orientation bins of 8, and a closest ratio of 0.92. The alignment allowed clearing the cache, using 32 feature-extraction threads, a maximal alignment error of 100 pixels, a minimal inlier ratio of 0.20, and a minimum of 12 inliers. The expected and desired transformations were set to rigid, with testing multiple hypotheses (tolerance: 5.00 pixels) and considering up to 5 neighboring layers, giving up after 5 failures. Regularization was done with a maximal iteration of 1000, a maximal plateau width of 200, and a rigid lambda of 0.10.</p>
<p>Next we applied an affine alignment step with similar parameters, except the expected and desired transformations were set to affine. The minimal image size was reduced to 64 pixels, while the other parameters (Gaussian blur, feature descriptor size, inliers, and testing hypotheses) remained unchanged to ensure consistent processing.</p>
<p>Finally, we ran two iterations of elastic alignment to fine-tune the spatial data. Key parameters included a block-matching layer scale of 0.05, a search radius of 200 pixels, a block radius of 2000 pixels, and a resolution of 60. Correlation filters were employed with a minimal PMCC r of 0.10, a maximal curvature ratio of 1000, and a maximal second-best r/best r of 0.90. A local smoothness filter was applied with the approximate local transformation set to affine, a local region sigma of 1000 pixels, and an absolute maximal local displacement of 10 pixels (relative maximal displacement: 3.00). Pre-aligned layers were tested for up to 4 neighboring layers. The elastic alignment used a rigid approximation, maximal iterations of 3000, a plateau width of 200, spring mesh stiffness of 0.01, and a maximal stretch of 2000 pixels. A legacy optimizer was employed to enhance performance.</p>
<p>After each alignment stage, the project was saved as an XML file under a unique name to preserve iterative progress. Finally, the images were exported from FIJI using TrakEM2 in a format compatible with CATMAID.</p>

<title>Neuron tracing, synapse annotation, and review</title>
<p>For skeletonisation, annotation and tagging we used CATMAID installed on a local server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). To mark the locations of cell bodies, we placed tags at the approximate center of each nucleus within the dataset. At each nuclear center, the radius of the single node was adjusted according to the size of the cell body in that specific layer. All skeletons were rooted at their respective cell bodies, and the root nodes were tagged as “soma.” Synapses were identified based on four key structural features: the cell membrane, synaptic vesicles, the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria. Most synapses could be verified across consecutive sections, ensuring accurate annotation and connectivity mapping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5d">
<title>Cell-type nomenclature, annotations and connectome analysis</title>
<p>We assigned each cell a specific cell-type name based on its morphological or functional category (e.g., balancer, bridge, large granular, ciliated grooves, dense vesicle cell, dome, epithelial floor (ef), intracellular multiciliated cells (imc), lamellate bodies (lb), lithocyte, plumose cell, and ANN), resulting in a total of 12 primary cell types.</p>
<p>In addition, some cells lacked distinctive features and were instead categorized into one of four general ciliated types, based on the presence and number of cilia: biciliated (biC), monociliated (monoC), multiciliated (multiC), or non-ciliated (non-C).</p>
<p>To indicate spatial positioning, we appended the quadrant number to the cell-type name using an underscore. For instance, cells located in the first quadrant were labeled “_Q1,” while those situated between two quadrants were labeled with both (e.g., “Q1Q2”).</p>
<p>Cells of the same type and in the same region were further distinguished by serial numbering, ensuring each cell has a unique identifier.</p>
<p>We further distinguished cells of the same type within the same region by serial numbering. This way each cell in the volume has a unique name string. Each cell was also assigned multiple annotations, which can be utilized to query the database via CATMAID or the CATMAID API (e.g., using the R catmaid package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bates et al., 2020</xref>)). These annotations provide a structured and precise framework for identifying and analyzing specific cells, facilitating robust data integration and retrieval from the dataset.</p>

<title>Imaging the activity of balancer cilia</title>
<p>For ciliary imaging, we used the cydippid stage of <italic>M. leidyi</italic> at 5-day-old. A coverslip with a thin layer of Vaseline applied to its two edges was gently placed over a glass slide. Filtered natural seawater and cydippids were placed beneath the coverslip. The orientation of the larvae was adjusted by carefully sliding the coverslip, and the larvae were gently immobilized by applying slight pressure.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency in gravitational input, we selected only larvae whose aboral–oral axis was oriented nearly parallel to the gravitational vector (within 20° tilt). This minimized the potential influence of larval tilt on left–right differences in balancer cilia activity, as all balancers received comparable stimulation from the statolith.</p>
<p>This orientation corresponds to a “balancer-up” orientation, in which the aboral organ faces upward. We selected this configuration not only to ensure consistent stimulation from the statolith across individuals, but also because it facilitates intuitive interpretation of balancer function—as if balancing a stone on top. Moreover, this orientation matches the orientation used in electron microscopy and was technically advantageous for high-speed imaging under vertical-stage alignment. Using a consistent orientation throughout minimized potential confusion when comparing ultrastructural and functional data.</p>
    <p>Because the tilt angle strongly affects the beat frequency of balancer cilia via asymmetric mechanical loading by the statolith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tamm, 1980</xref>), our quantitative analysis was restricted to recordings that met the above orientation criterion (tilt &lt; 20°). In this orientation, gravitational input from the statolith is approximately symmetrical across the left and right balancers, allowing meaningful comparisons of their activity. To illustrate how excessive tilt induces asymmetric stimulation, Video 8 presents two examples of larvae outside the permitted range: one tilted by ∼135° in the sagittal plane and the other by ∼60° in the tentacular plane. In both cases, strong asymmetries in balancer ciliary beating are evident, consistent with previous observations of gravity-induced geotactic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tamm, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Balancer cilia movement was imaged using a differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope (Zeiss Axio Imager.M2) equipped with a 40x glycerine-immersion objective (LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 40x/1.2 Imm Corr DIC M27). Images were acquired with a high-sensitivity monochrome CMOS camera (UI-3360CP-NIR-GL Rev.2, iDS), optimized for near-infrared detection. Illumination was provided by a custom-built 850 nm LED strobe system, synchronized with camera exposure using BohNavi software.</p>
<p>Recordings were acquired at 640 × 480 pixels, 100 frames per second (fps), for a duration of 2 minutes, using 0.05 ms pulse illumination from the LED.</p>
<p>For beat frequency analysis, kymographs were generated using the Multi Kymograph plugin in Fiji. One-second segments were manually extracted from the kymographs, and ciliary beat frequencies were visually counted for each manually defined region of interest (ROI). These manually determined frequencies were then used for subsequent computational analysis.</p>
<p>Traces of left and right cilia were extracted, cleaned to remove missing or non-finite values, and indexed by frame. Data were saved as RDS objects for downstream analysis. Mean values were plotted as bar graphs with left and right cilia plotted as positive and negative bars, respectively, to visually distinguish their activity.</p>
<p>To assess coordination between left and right cilia, we computed rolling Pearson correlation coefficients over a window of 20 frames. For each dataset, we excluded windows with insufficient valid data or no variation. Time series of correlation coefficients were plotted and summarized as mean values. These mean correlations were then compared across planes (sagittal vs. tentacular) using Welch’s t-test. The resulting statistics were visualized as boxplots with jittered data points.</p>

<p>(A) Registration and annotation of synapses in the actual cellular traces. Pink dots indicate the approximate center of each individual cell, marked within its plasma membrane boundary. Mitochondria involved in synaptic contacts are labeled with orange dots. Red arrows point from these mitochondria to the presynaptic cell body, marking presynaptic structures. Cyan arrows point from the orange-labeled mitochondria to the corresponding postsynaptic cell. (B) Electron microscopy (EM) images showing representative presynaptic structures. The left panel shows a monadic synapse, while the right panel shows a polyadic (byadic) synapse, in which a single presynaptic site contacts two postsynaptic cells. (C) Nuclei within two different types of ANN cells are shown in purple in a single EM section. On the left, the ANN_Q1-4 cell extends widely across the aboral organ and appears as a continuous structure in 3D, despite having nuclei located distantly from each other. In contrast, ANN_Q1Q2 (right) has two adjacent nuclei. (D) Three-dimensional reconstruction of the subepithelial nerve net (SNN). The SNN neurons extend broadly, enveloping the aboral organ. Some portions of the network remain as unconnected fragments due to incomplete reconstruction. (E) Morphological comparison between the ANN in EM images. The SNN shows a “beads-on-a-string” morphology, with discrete bead-like swellings connected by faint electron-dense fibrous structures. (F) Three-dimensional reconstruction of the SNN and ANNs. (G) Morphological comparison between the SNN in EM images. The ANN exhibits a more diffuse distribution, often appearing to interdigitate between surrounding cells. Relatively large mitochondria are frequently observed in the ANN processes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work presents an interesting circuit dissection of the neural system allowing a ctenophore to keep its balance and orientation in its aquatic environment by using a fascinating structure called the statocyst. By combining serial-section electron microscopy with behavioral recordings, the authors found a population of neurons which exists as a syncytium and could associate these neurons with specific functions related to controlling the beating of cilia located in the statocyst. The type A ANN neurons participate in arresting cilia beating, and the type B ANN neurons participate in resuming cilia beating and increasing their beating frequency.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors found that bridge cells are connected with the ANN neurons, giving them the role of rhythmic modulators.</p>
<p>From these observations, the authors conclude that the control is coordination instead of feedforward sensory-motor function, a hypothesis that had been put forth in the past but could not be validated until now. They also compare it to the circuitry implementing a similar behavior in a species that belongs to a different phylum where the nervous system is thought to have evolved separately.</p>
<p>Therefore, this work significantly advances our knowledge of the circuitry implementing the control of the cilia that participate in statocyst function which ultimately allow the animal to correct its orientation. It explains how the nervous system allows an animal to solve a specific problem and puts it in an evolutionary perspective showing a convincing case of convergent evolution.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The evidence for how the circuitry is connected is convincing. Pictures of synapses showing the direction of connectivity are clear and there are good reasons to believe that the diagram inferred is valid, even though we can always expect that some connections are missing.</p>
<p>The evidence for how the cilia change their beating frequency is also convincing, and the paradigm and recording methods seem pretty robust.</p>
<p>The authors achieved their aims and the results support their conclusions. This work impacts its field by presenting a mechanism by which ctenophores correct their balance, which will provide a template for comparison with other sensory systems.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors describe the production of a high-resolution connectome for the statocyst of a ctenophore nervous system. This study is of particular interest because of the apparent independent evolution of the ctenophore nervous system. The statocyst is a component of the aboral organ, which is used by ctenophores to sense gravity and regulate the activity of the organ's balancer cilia. The EM reconstruction of the aboral organ was carried out on a five-day old larva of the model ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. To place their connectome data in a functional context, the authors used high-speed imaging of ciliary beating in immobilized larvae. With these data, the authors were able to model the circuitry used for gravity sensing in a ctenophore larva.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Because of it apparently being the sister phylum to all other metazoans, Ctenophora is a particularly important group for studies of metazoan evolution. Thus, this work has much to tell us about how animals evolved. Added to that is the apparent independent evolution of the ctenophore nervous system. This study provides the first high-resolution connectomic analysis of a portion of a ctenophore nervous system, extending previous studies of the ctenophore nervous system carried out by Sid Tamm. As such it establishes the methodology for high-resolution analysis of the ctenophore nervous system. While the generation of a connectome is in and of itself an important accomplishment, the coupling of the connectome data with analysis of the beating frequency of balancer cell cilia provides a functional context for understanding how the organization of the neural circuitry in the aboral organ carries out gravity sensing. In addition, the authors identified a new type of syncytial neuron in Mnemiopsis. Interestingly, the authors show that the neural circuitry controlling cilia beating in Mnemiopsis shares features with the circuitry that controls ciliary movement in the annelid Platynereis, suggesting convergent evolution of this circuity in the two organisms. The data in this paper are of high quality, and the analyses have been thoroughly and carefully done.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper has no obvious weaknesses.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed the minor issues that I brought up in my original review.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>It has been a long time since I enjoyed reviewing a paper as much as this one. In it, the authors generate an unprecedented view of the aboral organ of a 5-day old ctenophore.

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the analysis are the sophisticated imaging methods used, the labor-intensive reconstruction of individual neurons and organelles, and especially the mapping of synapses. The synaptic connections to and from the main coordinating neurons allow the authors to created a polarized network diagram for these components of the aboral organ. These connections give insight about the potential functions of the major neurons, which also giving some unexpected results, particularly the lack of connections from the balancer system to the coordinating system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There were no significant weaknesses in the paper - only a slate of interesting unanswered questions to motivate future studies.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>This manuscript was already strong from the start, and I am fully satisfied with the revisions, which corrected a few glitches and points of clarification.</p>

<p>This work presents an interesting circuit dissection of the neural system allowing a ctenophore to keep its balance and orientation in its aquatic environment by using a fascinating structure called the statocyst. By combining serial-section electron microscopy with behavioral recordings, the authors found a population of neurons that exists as a syncytium and could associate these neurons with specific functions related to controlling the beating of cilia located in the statocyst.

</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for these comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The evidence supporting the claim that the neural circuitry presented here controls the cilia beating is more correlational because it only relies on the fact that the location of the two types of ANN neurons coincides with the quadrants that are affected in the behavioral recordings. Discussing ways by which causality could be established might be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added additional discussions in a new “Future Directions” section explaining that for example calcium imaging or targeted neuron ablations could be used in future work to establish causality. This would require the development of genetic delivery techniques to e.g. introduce GCaMP calcium sensor or transgenic reporters.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The explanation of the relevance of this work could be improved. The conclusion that the work hints at coordination instead of feedforward sensory-motor control is explained over only a few lines. The authors could provide a more detailed explanation of how the two models compete (coordination vs feedforward sensory-motor control), and why choosing one option over the other could provide advantages in this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added a more detailed explanation about the two types of model and why we believe that a coordination model is more compatible with our connectome data.</p>
<p>“An alternative model for the function of the nerve net would be a feedforward sensory-motor system, in which balancer cells provide mechanosensory input to motor effectors via the nerve net, similar to a reflex arc. None of our observations support such a sensory-motor model. There are no synaptic pathways from balancer cells or any other sensory cells to the nerve net. The only synaptic input to ANNs comes from the bridge cells (discussed below) and from each other. The three synaptically interconnected ANNs may generate endogenous rhythm that controls balancer cilia and is influenced by bridge input. ANNs may also be influenced by neuropeptides secreted by other aboral organ neurons. Such chemical inputs may underlie the flexibility of gravitaxis and its modulation by other cues (e.g. light). Overall, the coordination model parsimoniously explains both the ANN wiring topology and the observed dynamics, whereas a simple feedforward reflex does not.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Since the fact that the ANN neurons form a syncytium is an important finding of this study, it would be useful to have additional illustrations of it. For instance, pictures showing anastomosing membranes could typically be added in Figure 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included a movie (Video 3) showing a volumetric reconstruction of a segment of an ANN neuron, which highlights the anastomosing morphology in greater detail than static images.</p>
<p>“Video 3. Volumetric reconstruction of a single ANN Q1-4 neuron showing syncytial soma (cyan) and nuclei (magenta). The rotating view highlights the anastomosing morphology, although not all fine details could be reconstructed due to data limitations.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, to better establish the importance of the study, it could be useful to explain why the balancers’ cilia spontaneously beat in the first place (instead of being static and just acting as stretch sensors).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have discussed in more detail why it may be important for the balancer cilia to beat.</p>
<p>“The observation that balancer cilia beat spontaneously, even in the absence of external tilt, suggests that they are active sensory oscillators rather than static stretch sensors. Their spontaneous beating could set a dynamic baseline of sensitivity, which can then be modulated by ANN inputs or sensory changes during tilt. Such a dynamic system may be more sensitive to small deflections and be more responsive [@Lowe1997]. Thus, the regulated beating of balancer cilia should not be seen as noise, but as an adaptive feature that enables flexible and robust graviceptive responses. The ctenophore balancer may thus use active ciliary oscillations for enhanced sensorimotor integration similar to other sensory systems [@Wan_2023].”</p>

<p>There were no significant weaknesses in the paper - only a slate of interesting unanswered questions to motivate future studies.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comments:</bold></p>
<p>In consultation, the reviewers recommend that improving the evidence to “exceptional” would require additional perturbation experiments (e.g., ablation of specific neurons), as Reviewer 1 suggests. They also recommend adding a “Future Directions” section to the manuscript, because it opens up so many new experimental directions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a new “Future Directions” section at the end of the Discussion. To carry out the proposed perturbation or calcium imaging experiments would require significant additional work and method development. We are actively working in establishing mRNA and DNA injection into ctenophore zygotes to enable live imaging, cell labelling or ablations in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments, data, or analyses:</p>
<p>To establish causality (neurons control balancer cilia), an important experiment would be to manipulate each of these neuronal populations (e.g., by ablating them) and measure the effect of these ablations on the beating frequency of the balancer cilia of the four quadrants. Moreover, direct observation of neuronal activity (e.g., by using calcium imaging) would also provide more compelling evidence for neuronal control.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that such perturbation experiments would be needed to establish causality. Such experiments are currently still not possible in ctenophoes and would require significant technology development. We discuss such experiments in the “Future directions” section and also place this in the context of the currently available techniques in ctenophores. We are actively working on this but waiting for such technological breakthroughs and new experiments would significantly delay the publication of a version of record of the paper.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation:</p>
<p>ANN neurons are described in great detail, though SNN neurons are described more loosely. Perhaps a more detailed description of SNN neurons would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the information on SNNs to show that these cells are distinct from the ANN neurons. Since our focus is on the aboral organ, we did not aim for a comprehensive reconstruction of SNNs. Several of the processes of the SNNs are also truncated and outside our EM volume. We have nevertheless added additional details about the morphology and connectivity of SNN neurons.</p>
<p>“Near the perifery of the aboral organ, we identified four further anastomosing nerve-net neurons. These resembled the previously reported syncytial subepithelial nerve net (SNN) neurons in the body wall of Mnemiopsis (Figure 2–figure supplement 1C–G) and were clearly distinct from the ANN neurons (both in location and morphology). SNN neurons show a blebbed morphology and contain dense core vesicles @Burkhardt2023 but no synapses.”</p>

<p>Clearer usage of the terms statocyst, aboral organ, aboral nerve net, statolith, dome, and lithocytes would be helpful.

</disp-quote>
<p>In this sentence we referred to the orientation of the animals in our figures. There is a consensus among ctenophore researchers that when depicting ctenophores, the aboral organ should face downwards. However, for this paper we chose the opposite orientation to better match our experiments and help interpreting the results. We changed the text to: “In this study, we represent ctenophores with their aboral organ facing upwards (”balancer-up” posture), as this configuration facilitates intuitive interpretation of balance-like functions and matches the setup used in high-speed imaging experiments. ”</p>
<p>We added the sentences “Future experiments could also explore how orientation affects the response of balancer cilia. For example, when the statolith is suspended below the cilia (the”balancer-down” posture), ciliary beating patterns may differ from what we observed here in the “balancer-up” configuration.” to the section Future Directions”.</p>

<p>(3) Panel C legend: arrows are not really arrows. Say “Eye icons” or something like that. Can you show the location of the anal pores in the DIC image?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Changed to ‘eye icons’. The anal pores are usually closed and only open briefly therefore it is not clear where exactly they would be, so indicating their position would be misleading.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Panel F, I cannot see the lines mentioned in the legend at all, except for maybe a tiny wisp in a couple of places. Either omit or make visible.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>changed to “The spheres indicate the position of nuclei in the reconstructed cells.”</p>

<p>(5) Panel G. “Cells are color coded according to quadrants”… but unfortunately, the color scale is 90{degree sign} off of what is presented in the rest of the panels and the paper. Q1 and Q3 have been blue, but now Q2+4 are blue/purple, while Q1+3 are orange/yellow. Again, it seems like too much work to recolor panel G, but in future, it would be nice to maintain that consistency, especially since other panels specifically mention the consistent colors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed the color code in panels B, C and E to match G and the subsequent panels/figures.</p>

<p>RESULTS: Aboral synaptic nerve net</p>
<p>(1)“We reconstructed three aboral nerve-net (ANN) neurons” - out of how many total? Were these three just the first ones traced, or are they likely to be all of the multi-domain neurons? One can’t tell if these are the top 3 (out of X), or if there are other multi-quad neurons that were not traced. Are there any Q1Q4 or Q2Q3 neurona? Specify overall composition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are only three ANN neurons in the aboral organ. These are all completely reconstructed and contained within the volume. We have clarified this in the text. “We identified and reconstructed three aboral nerve-net (ANN) neurons, each exhibiting a syncytial morphology characterized by anastomosing membranes and multiple nuclei (ranging from two to five) (Figure 2A and B, Figure 2–figure supplement 1C). These three neurons are the only fully reconstructed ANN neurons contained within the volume. Several small ANN-like fragments were also observed at the periphery of the aboral organ, but their connectivity to the main ANN remains uncertain.”</p>

<p>FIGURE 2:</p>
<p>(1) Panel C: “N &gt; 2 cells for each cell type” - is that supposed to say “N &gt; 2 mitochondria”? More than 2 cells in all the types shown in the graph.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is number of cells for each cell type</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Panel D: Is this the wrong caption? I can only see green and black circles, not red, yellow, or blue. Make them larger or “flat” (circled, not shaded spheres) if they are supposed to be visible</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. The caption was incorrect and has been corrected to match the figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Panel E: Amazing to see the cross-network connections!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Again, it is great to see the three ANN mapped out, but … are there other connections that weren’t mapped in this study? Other high-level coordinating neurons? ANN_Q1Q4 or Q2Q3?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reconstruction is complete and there are no other neurons or connections. Given the large size of ctenophore synapses, we are confident that we identified all or most synapses and their connections.</p>

<p>RESULTS: Synaptic connectome</p>
<p>(1) “displaying rotational symmetry” - This is one of the things I am most curious about. Where is the evidence of rotational symmetry in the network diagram? Is it the larger number of connections to Q2 and Q4? Any evidence of rotational symmetry, like Q1 and Q3 connect to Q2 and Q4 respectively, but not the other way around?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>changed to “displaying biradial symmetry”, we do not consider the slight difference in synapse number from ANN Q1-4 to the Q1-Q3 vs. Q2-Q4 balancers as significant or strong enough evidence for a single rotational symmetry (i.e. 180 degrees rotation)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) “Surprisingly” - this *was* really surprising. There have to be some afferent neurons connecting from the balancers, don’t there? I can’t remember the connections to the SNN, but is there a tertiary set of ANNs that connect between the balancers and the top 3 ANNs? I would like a little more discussion about this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, this is why this is so surprising. Most people would have expected some output connections from the balancer to the nerve net or elsewhere. There are none. We have the complete balancer network and all balancer cells are ‘sink nodes’ (inputs only)(Figure3–figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>we added a short statement in the beginning of the Bridge Cells as Feedback Regulators of Ciliary Rhythms section noting that no direct connections from the balancers to the ANN were found and that all balancer cells act as sink nodes (inputs only; Figure 3–figure supplement 1). This highlights that bridge cells are indeed the sole neuronal input to the ANN circuit.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3:</p>
<p>(1) As you know, during development, the diagonally opposite cells have a shared heritage and shared functionality. Are there neuronal signatures that correspond to the rotational symmetry that we see, for example, in the position of the anal pores?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not find any evidence in neuronal complement for a diagonal symmetry, suggesting that neuronal organization does not simply mirror the organism’s rotational body symmetry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Do you have the information to say whether there are any diagonal or asymmetric connections? Can’t tell if those would have shown up in the mapping efforts or if you focused on the major ones only.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on our complete mapping, we did not find evidence for a diagonal pattern. The connectivity instead shows a biradial organization.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) “extending across opposite quadrant regions” - to me, opposite would be diagonally opposite, but this looks like a set of cells between Q1 and Q2 is connecting to a sister-set in Q3+Q4. I wonder if, in a more detailed view, you could see whether this is a rotational correspondence, rather than a reflection. There are some subtle hints of this in the aboral view, with some cells on the right of the blue cluster and the left of the magenta cluster.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>changed to “extending across tentacular-axis-symmetric quadrant regions” for clarity</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) As with Figure 2, I do not see any circles/spheres that are yellow, red, or blue! There are some traces of what appear to be other neurons that have these colors, but nothing that would suggest the localization of mitochondria.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have corrected the caption to match the figure, as in the previous item.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The connectivity map is very cool, but the caption does not seem to correspond to the version included in the manuscript. I don’t see any hexagons; all arrows seem to have the same thickness.</p>

<p>changed to: “Complete connectivity map of the gravity-sensing neural circuit. Cells belonging to the same group are shown as diamonds, and the number of cells is added to their labels. The number of synapses is shown on the arrows.”</p>

<p>RESULTS: Dynamics of balancer cilia</p>
<p>(1) The orientation of the stage+larvae is a bit hard to follow. Maybe say the sagittal or tentacular plane is parallel to the sample stage and the gravity vector?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>we added “Larvae were oriented with their sagittal or tentacular plane parallel to the sample stage.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) “We could simultaneously image Q1(3) and Q2(4). The meaning of the numbers in () is not clear. Either way that I try to interpret it does not match the diagrams. Should this say viewing the tentacular plane, you can image Q1 and 4 or Q2 and 3?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for spotting this mistake, we have changed to: “In larvae with their sagittal plane facing the objective, we could compare balancer-cilia movements between Q1 vs. Q2 or Q3 vs. Q4. In other larvae oriented in the tentacular plane, we could simultaneously image Q1 and Q4 or Q2 and Q3.”</p>

<p>DISCUSSION:</p>
<p>This section is quite clean. Maybe mention some future directions:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a “Future Directions” section</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Do these networks change during development? Five-days-old is still quite undeveloped - what would it look like in an adult specimen? Would you expect a larger version of the same or more diverse connections?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As far as we know from work on aboral organs in adult ctenophores, the same structures and cells can be found. We do not know how the network will develop. We know that at 5 days the balancer is fully functional and the animals can orient and their behaviour is coordinated. So the wiring may not change extensively later in development. In the 1-day-old larva, Ferraioli et al. did not distinguish ANN neurons as a separate population, as these were merged with SNNs in their dataset. This suggests that significant cellular and circuit maturation likely occurs between 1 and 5 days.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>METHODS: Imaging the Activity of Balancer Cilia</p>
<p>(1) “we selected only larvae whose aboral-oral axis was oriented nearly perpendicular to the gravitational vector”. Shouldn’t this be “nearly parallel to the gravity vector” not perpendicular?</p>

<p>Thank you for spotting this, corrected.</p>
