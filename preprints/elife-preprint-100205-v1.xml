<title>Abstract</title><p>The induction of adipose thermogenesis plays a critical role in maintaining body temperature and improving metabolic homeostasis to combat obesity. β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) is widely recognized as a canonical β-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in mediating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Nonetheless, the limited expression of β3-AR in human adipocytes restricts its clinical application. The objective of this study was to identify a GPCR that is highly expressed in human adipocytes and to explore its potential involvement in adipose thermogenesis. Our research findings have demonstrated that the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3), an orphan GPCR, plays a significant role in adipose thermogenesis through its constitutively active effects. ADGRA3 exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes and mouse brown fat. Furthermore, the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in an exacerbated obese phenotype and a reduction in the expression of thermogenic markers. Conversely, <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression activated the adipose thermogenic program and improved metabolic homeostasis without an exogenous ligand supplementation. We found that ADGRA3 facilitates the biogenesis of beige adipocytes through the Gs-PKA-CREB axis. Moreover, hesperetin was identified as a potential agonist of ADGRA3, capable of inducing adipocyte browning and ameliorating insulin resistance. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the overexpression of constitutively active ADGRA3 or the activation of ADGRA3 by hesperetin can induce adipocyte browning by Gs-PKA-CREB axis. These findings indicate that the utilization of hesperetin and the selectively overexpression of ADGRA3 in adipose tissue could serve as promising therapeutic strategies in the fight against obesity.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since 1975, there has been a substantial increase in the global prevalence of obesity, with the magnitude nearly tripling. The World Health Organization projects that the prevalence of obesity among adults will exceed 20% by the year 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Currently, the management of excessive adiposity poses a paramount economic burden and healthcare predicament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In addition to the detrimental social and psychological implications, a multitude of studies have consistently demonstrated a significant association between obesity and an increased vulnerability to a range of health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Activating and maintaining the thermogenesis of beige/brown fat has been shown to be effective in treating obesity and related metabolic disorders in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. As a well-established β-adrenergic GPCR, the β3-AR has been identified as a prominent target for stimulating adipose thermogenesis in mice. Regrettably, the clinical application of β3-AR has been impeded due to its low expression in human adipocytes and the cardiovascular risks associated with other adrenergic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most prevalent class of drug targets among all drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They also play a crucial role in the clinical treatment of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is of clinical significance to identify novel GPCR targets that induce adipose thermogenesis.</p>
<p>ADGRA3 is classified as an orphan adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR) and exhibits the typical domains found in aGPCRs within its N-terminal extracellular region (ECR), including a leucine-rich repeat (LRR), an immunoglobulin-like domain (Ig), a hormone-binding domain (HBD), and a GAIN domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. ADGRA3 was initially discovered as a distinctive indicator of various spermatogonial progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Recent studies have shown that the orphan status of receptors has posed challenges to the study of aGPCRs. However, these studies have also uncovered a conservative mechanism of aGPCR activation, which involves the use of tethered ligands in the GAIN domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. ADGRA3 has been previously identified as a receptor capable of auto-cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. However, the functional activity of ADGRA3 in a constructive manner is still uncertain. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated a significant correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ADGRA3 and body weight in chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the precise role of ADGRA3 in the progression of obesity and adipose thermogenesis remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate three main aspects: (1) the impact of ADGRA3 on browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), (2) the effects of ADGRA3 on metabolic homeostasis, and (3) the underlying mechanisms by which ADGRA3 induces adipose thermogenesis.</p>

<label>2.1.</label><title>Mice</title>
<p>Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice were obtained from the Center of Laboratory Animal at Sun Yat-sen University. All mice were housed in the Sun Yat-sen University Laboratory Animal Center, where they were subjected to a 12-hour light-dark cycle and maintained at a controlled environmental temperature of 21±1℃. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed with a normal chow diet (NCD) or a high fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal) for 12 weeks to render mice obese. With the exception of mice fed with a HFD, male mice at the age of eight weeks were utilized in all experimental procedures. For the treatment with a selective β3-adrenoceptor agonist, CL-316,243 (hereafter referred to as CL), mice fed a HFD were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with CL (1 mg/kg daily) for 7 days. For the knockdown and over-expression experiments of <italic>Adgra3</italic> in mice fed with a NCD, the following procedures were conducted: sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> (pLKO.1-U6-sh<italic>Adgra3</italic>-2 plasmid encapsulated in nanomaterials) and shNC (pLKO.1-U6-shNC plasmid encapsulated in nanomaterials) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for knockdown experiments, while <italic>Adgra3</italic> OE ( pLV3-CMV-<italic>Adgra3</italic> (mouse)-3×FLAG plasmid encapsulated in nanomaterials) and CON ( pLV3-CMV-MCS-3×FLAG plasmid encapsulated in nanomaterials) were injected i.p. for over-expression experiments. The frequency of the sessions was twice a week over a period of four weeks. For the knockdown and over-expression experiments of <italic>Adgra3</italic> in mice fed with a HFD, the following procedures were conducted: sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> and shNC were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) for knockdown experiments, while <italic>Adgra3</italic> OE and CON were injected i.p. for over-expression experiments. The frequency of the sessions was twice a week over a period of 12 weeks. For the treatment with hesperetin (hes), hesperetin is dissolved in drinking water (200mg/L) and water were available ad libitum.</p>
<p>Intraperitoneal injections of glucose (2g/kg for mice fed with a NCD and 1g/kg for mice fed with a HFD) or insulin (0.5U/kg for mice fed with a NCD and 1U/kg for mice fed with a HFD) were administered. At the designated time points of 0 minutes, intraperitoneal glucose or insulin tolerance tests were conducted on mice that had been fasted for six hours. After administration, the blood glucose concentration was assessed at specific time intervals using a OneTouch Ultra Glucometer. Finally, the animals were euthanized, followed by the collection of tissue samples. Cohorts of ≥4 mice per genotype or treatment were assembled for all in vivo studies. All in vivo studies were repeated 2-3 separated times. All procedures related to animal feeding, treatment and welfare were conducted at Sun Yat-sen University Laboratory Animal Center.</p>

<p>We conducted a comprehensive analysis of three datasets to identify ADGRA3 as a potential GPCR target that promotes the development of beige fat (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To identify novel GPCRs that induce the biogenesis of beige fat, we conducted differential gene expression analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and Venn diagram analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) using the GSE118849 dataset obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Additionally, we utilized the human subcutaneous adipocytes dataset and human visceral adipocytes dataset from the human protein atlas database. The GSE118849 dataset comprises samples of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) obtained from mice subjected to a 72-hour cold exposure at a temperature of 4℃.</p>

<p>A total of 1134 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that exhibited up-regulation in BAT compared to iWAT under cold stimulation were identified in the analysis. These DEGs were further screened to identify highly expressed GPCRs in BAT relative to WAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, red). We conducted additional annotation on 1134 DEGs and identified that 27 of these genes were associated with the encoding of GPCRs (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). Among the set of 27 genes, it was found that 24 genes were not present in the group of genes that exhibited high expression levels in human adipocytes, as determined by the human protein atlas database. Consequently, these 24 genes were excluded from further analysis. We conducted a comprehensive literature review and discovered that out of the three remaining GPCRs namely ADGRA3, ADRA1A, and ADRB1, only ADGRA3 has not been documented to have any association with brown fat. Therefore, our research subsequently shifted towards investigating the potential regulatory role of ADGRA3 in obesity and brown fat.</p>
<p>The findings indicated that the level of <italic>Adgra3</italic> expression in mouse adipose tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) was comparatively lower than that of <italic>Adrb3</italic>, the coding gene for β3-AR. Conversely, in human adipose tissue, <italic>ADGRA3</italic> expression was observed to be higher than that of <italic>ADRB3</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1E</xref>). We conducted an investigation to examine the regulatory effects of a high-fat diet on the transcription of <italic>Adgra3</italic> and <italic>Ucp1</italic> (Uncoupling protein 1, a functional protein and marker of beige/brown fat). The findings of the study demonstrated that a HFD had a significant inhibitory effect on the expression of ADGRA3 and UCP1 in iWAT and BAT, while CL robustly increased the expression of ADGRA3 and UCP1 in iWAT and BAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-G</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A-D</xref>). Interestingly, in human subcutaneous fat, there was a moderate positive correlation between the expression level of <italic>ADGRA3</italic> and the expression level of <italic>UCP1</italic> (<italic>R</italic>=0.5, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). On the other hand, the expression level of <italic>ADRB3</italic> showed a weak positive correlation with the expression level of <italic>UCP1</italic> (<italic>R</italic>=0.21, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1F</xref>). The data presented in this study indicate that ADGRA3 is a GPCR that exhibits high expression levels in BAT and may participate in inducing adipose thermogenesis.</p>

<label>3.2.</label><title>Adgra3 overexpression induces the biogenesis of beige adipocytes in vitro</title>
<p>To ascertain the predominant expression of ADGRA3, the isolation of stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) and mature adipocytes from WAT and BAT was conducted for subsequent validation. The results showed that ADGRA3 is predominantly expressed in adipocytes. Furthermore, the expression level of ADGRA3 in BAT adipocytes was found to be higher compared to WAT adipocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). However, no significant difference was observed in the expression level of ADGRA3 in the SVF of WAT and BAT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Moreover, it was observed that the modulation of the expression levels of <italic>Adgra3</italic> and <italic>Ucp1</italic> exhibited a similar pattern during the differentiation process between WAT and BAT adipocytes (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G-H</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the role of ADGRA3 in the biogenesis of beige adipocytes, we conducted an experiment where we transformed pre-adipocytes 3T3-L1 into mature adipocytes with a knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic>. Our findings indicate that the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in a decrease in the expression of genes related to thermogenesis and lipolysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Western blot analysis and Mito-Tracker staining revealed a decrease in the expression of UCP1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and a reduction in the number of mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) following <italic>Adgra3</italic> knockdown. Lipid droplet fluorescence staining and intracellular triglyceride assay were performed on adipocytes to assess the impact of <italic>Adgra3</italic> knockdown. The results revealed a significant increase in the number of lipid droplets and intracellular triglyceride levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>) following <italic>Adgra3</italic> knockdown. Moreover, the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-NBDG), a fluorescently-labeled deoxyglucose analog, by adipocytes was significantly inhibited following the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was detected to verify the effect of ADGRA3 on the oxygen consumption of adipocytes. The results indicated that the loss of ADGRA3 decreased the both basal and max OCR of adipocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F-G</xref>).</p>

<p>Following the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic>, there was an observed up-regulation in the expression of UCP1 in 3T3-L1 mature adipocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-I</xref>). Additionally, Mito-Tracker staining revealed an increase in the quantity of mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>).

<p>To evaluate the role of ADGRA3 in the biogenesis of beige fat in vivo, mice fed with a NCD were injected with shNC or sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> for 28 days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>Remarkably, the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in a significant reduction in both body temperature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) and BAT temperature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of genes related to thermogenesis and lipolysis in both iWAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) and BAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Moreover, the Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H-I</xref>) and Immunohistochemical staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>) of UCP1 revealed comparable outcomes. Additionally, it was observed that the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in an increase in the size of lipid droplets and a decrease in the number of mitochondria in BAT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). These findings indicate that ADGRA3 plays a crucial role as a receptor in the biogenesis of beige fat and the activation of BAT.</p>
<p>Moreover, the genes that were highly expressed in ADGRA3 high-expressed human subcutaneous adipose tissue (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>, red) exhibited enrichment in various biological processes. These processes included hyperinsulinism, obesity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>), metabolic processes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>), adipogenesis (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>), regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E</xref>), and lipid metabolism (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F</xref>). GSEA was conducted to search the enriched KEGG pathways based on the expression level of ADGRA3 in human subcutaneous adipose dataset and human visceral adipose dataset from GTEx portal database. For ADGRA3 high-expressed group, both subcutaneous adipose dataset (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3G</xref>) and visceral adipose dataset (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3H</xref>) enriched in insulin signaling pathway, which indicates that ADGRA3 may be involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism in addition to its influence on lipid metabolism. Furthermore, it was observed that sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> mice exhibited significant disruptions in overall glycemic homeostasis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>) and insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>). Moreover, the fasting serum insulin level was increased and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) showed an increase in sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N-O</xref>).

The lysate obtained from the 293T cells was then utilized for the subsequent co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analysis. The results of the co-IP experiment demonstrated that mouse ADGRA3 coupled to the G<sub>s</sub> protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>), while no interaction was observed with the other three Gα proteins (G<sub>i</sub>, G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>12</sub>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A-C</xref>) ADGRA3 exhibits intrinsic and auto-cleavable receptor activity, allowing it to signal even in the absence of an exogenous ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].

Additionally, our findings indicate that the effect of <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression on cAMP production is dependent on G<sub>s</sub> protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6E</xref>).

<p>Hence, it was hypothesized that the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> could potentially stimulate adipocyte thermogenesis by activating the PKA signaling pathway. As expected, the Western-blot analysis revealed that the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> leads to an elevation in the phosphorylated form of CREB (p-CREB), indicating an increase in PKA-CREB signaling activity. This effect was observed in 3T3-L1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), as well as in the iWAT and BAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Consistently, the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> resulted in a decrease in the level of p-CREB in 3T3-L1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), as well as in iWAT and BAT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). To investigate the potential role of <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression in promoting the biogenesis of beige adipocytes and activating the PKA-CREB signaling pathway via G<sub>s</sub> protein, we conducted an experiment using 3T3-L1 cells. The cells were treated with <italic>Adgra3</italic> OE and sh<italic>Gnas</italic>, respectively. <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression was found to be adequate in inducing the expression of UCP1 in 3T3L1 cells. However, this effect was observed to be eliminated when <italic>Gnas</italic> was knocked down (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6E</xref>). Furthermore, the utilization of PKAi (protein kinase A inhibitor, H-89) was employed to ascertain the dependence of the browning effect of Adgra3 overexpression on the PKA-CREB signal. The results showed that PKAi effectively inhibited the activation of PKA-CREB signaling and UCP1 expression induced by <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6F</xref>). These results suggest that the observed browning effect resulting from <italic>Adgra3</italic> overexpression is mediated through the PKA-CREB signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings indicate that ADGRA3 facilitates the biogenesis of beige adipocytes through the G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Considering the difficulty of overexpressing ADGRA3 in clinical application, hesperetin was screened as a potential agonist of ADGRA3 by PRESTO-Salsa database (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The results showed that hesperetin treatment stimulates cAMP production (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) and increases the expression level of UCP1 and p-CREB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>). To verify whether hesperetin induces the biogenesis of beige adipocyte and activates PKA-CREB signal via ADGRA3, we treated 3T3-L1 with hesperetin and sh<italic>Adgra3</italic>, respectively. We found that the induction effect of hesperetin on UCP1 and p-CREB is eliminated when <italic>Adgra3</italic> is knocked down (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-F</xref>). In addition, OCR was detected to verify the effect of hesperetin on the oxygen consumption of adipocytes.

<p>Moreover, the results showed that the induction effect of hesperetin on UCP1 and p-CREB is attenuated after <italic>Gnas</italic> knocked down (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I-J</xref>), suggesting that hesperetin up-regulates UCP1 and activates PKA-CREB axis dependent on G<sub>s</sub>.

The results revealed that hesperetin treatment resulted in the upregulation of UCP1 and p-CREB.

<label>3.7.</label><title>Hesperetin: a potential ADGRA3 agonist that activates the adipose thermogenic program and counteracts metabolic disease dependent on ADGRA3</title>
<p>To identify whether hesperetin induces adipose thermogenesis and improves the metabolic homeostasis against obesity via ADGRA3, shNC mice or sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> mice were treated with hesperetin and fed with a HFD (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Hesperetin was found to alleviate the growth of body weight (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>) during the HFD feeding and the weight of iWAT, eWAT, BAT and liver weight ratio (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), which was dependent on ADGRA3.

Meanwhile, hesperetin decreased the area of adipocytes in iWAT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>) and BAT (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>), and the effect disappeared in sh<italic>Adgra3</italic> mice.

<label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we have elucidated a novel role of ADGRA3 and hesperetin in inducing the development of beige adipocytes through the activation of the G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB signaling pathway. ADGRA3 is responsible for the activation of the adipose thermogenic program and plays a significant role in maintaining systemic glucose homeostasis. Additionally, the development of beige adipocytes induced by hesperetin is contingent upon the presence of ADGRA3. The novelty of this study is the discovery that ADGRA3 plays a role in the advancement of beige fat and the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. This suggests that targeting the ADGRA3-G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB signaling pathway could potentially be a therapeutic approach for obesity and related metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>The induction of beige fat has been investigated as a potentially effective therapeutic approach in combating obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. While the promotion of thermogenesis in brown and beige adipocytes in rodents was effectively achieved by the β3-adrenoceptor agonist, the clinical implications of this finding appear to be unfeasible in humans due to the low efficacy of β3-adrenoceptor agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. It is of utmost importance to investigate alternative therapeutic targets that can effectively and selectively enhance beige adipogenesis in order to combat obesity and its related metabolic disorders. In this study, we have identified ADGRA3 as a novel GPCR therapeutic target that exhibits high expression in human adipocytes. Our findings suggest that ADGRA3, when overexpressed or stimulated by its known agonist, hesperetin, can induce the biogenesis of beige fat.</p>
<p>Hesperetin has been reported to attenuate the age-related metabolic decline, reduce fat and improve glucose homeostasis in naturally aged mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Previous studies showed that hesperetin improved glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] and was involved in adipocyte differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], but whether hesperetin induces the biogenesis of beige adipocyte was uncertain. In previous reports, male mice deficient in ADGRA3 showed obstructive azoospermia with high penetrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Moreover, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located in the downstream region of <italic>ADGRA3</italic> as a genomic locus associated with body weight in chickens, suggesting that the ADGRA3 is a potential regulator of body weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, the agonist and the downstream signal axis of ADGRA3 remain unclear as well as the effects of ADGRA3 on adipose thermogenesis and glucose homeostasis have not been explored. Consequently, our study has confirmed that the knockdown of <italic>Adgra3</italic> exacerbates obesity and disrupts glucose homeostasis. Additionally, both the overexpression of <italic>Adgra3</italic> and the administration of hesperetin have been found to stimulate the biogenesis of beige adipocytes through the ADGRA3-G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB signaling pathway and improve glucose homeostasis.</p>
<p>Given the high expression level of ADGRA3 in adipose depots in both mice and humans, additional investigations are warranted to ascertain whether ADGRA3 plays a comparable role in humans. Nevertheless, our findings underlie a potential therapeutic feature of ADGRA3 and hesperetin in obesity and the associated metabolic diseases from the thermogenic viewpoint of beige fat.</p>

<label>5.</label><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the activation of the G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB axis by ADGRA3 has been found to induce adipose thermogenesis, promote lipid metabolism, and alleviate lipid accumulation in adipose tissues. Furthermore, the induction of beige adipocyte biogenesis by hesperetin occurs through the ADGRA3-G<sub>s</sub>-PKA-CREB axis. Given the importance of identifying signaling pathways that induce beige fat and alleviate obesity-related dysfunction in adipose tissue, our research findings suggest that hesperetin and activation of the intracellular signaling of ADGRA3 could serve as a promising and innovative therapeutic approach.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This article identifies ADGR3 as a candidate GPCR for mediating beige fat development. The authors use human expression data from the Human protein atlas and Gtex databases and combine this with experiments performed in mice and a murine cell line. They refer to a GPCR bioactivity screening tool PRESTO-Salsa, with which it was found that Hesperetin activates ADGR3. From their experiments, authors conclude that Hesperetin activates ADGR3, inducing a Gs-PKA-CREB axis resulting in adipose thermogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors analyze human data from public databases and perform functional studies in mouse models. They identify a new GPCR with a role in the thermogenic activation of adipocytes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Selection of ADGRA3 as a candidate GPCR relevant for mediating beiging in humans:</p>
<p>The authors identify genes upregulated in iBAT compared to iWAT in response to cold, and among these differentially expressed genes, they identify highly expressed GPCRs in human white adipocytes (visceral or subcutaneous). Finally, among these genes, they select a GPCR not previously studied in the literature.</p>
<p>If the authors are interested in beiging, why do they not focus on genes upregulated in iWAT (the depot where beiging is described to occur in mice), comparing thermoneutral to cold-induced genes? I would expect that genes induced in iWAT in response to cold would be extremely relevant targets for beiging. With their strategy, the authors exclude receptors that are induced in the tissue where beiging is actually described to occur.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors are comparing genes upregulated in cold in BAT (but not WAT) to highly expressed genes in human white adipocytes during thermoneutrality. Overall, the authors fail to discuss the logic behind their strategy and the obvious limitations of it.</p>
<p>(2) Relevance of ADGRA3 and comparison to established literature:</p>
<p>There has been a lot of literature and discussion about which receptor should be targeted in humans to recruit thermogenic fat. The current article unfortunately does not discuss this literature nor explain how it relates to their findings. For example, O'Mara et al (PMID: 31961826) demonstrated that chronic stimulation with the B3 adrenergic agonist, Mirabegron, resulted in the recruitment of thermogenic fat and improvement in insulin sensitivity and cholesterol. Later, Blondin et al (PMID: 32755608), highlighted the B2 adrenergic receptor as the main activation path of thermogenic fat in humans. There is also a recent report on an agonist activating B2 and B3 simultaneously (PMID: 38796310). Thus, to bring the literature forward, it would be beneficial if the current manuscript compared their identified activation path with the activation of these already established receptors and discussed their findings in relation to previous studies.</p>
<p>In Figures 1d and e, the authors show the expression of ADGRA3 in comparison to the expression of ADRB3. In human brown adipocytes, ADRB2 has been shown to be the main receptor through which adrenergic activation occurs (PMID: 32755608), thus authors should show the relative expression of this gene as well.</p>
<p>(3) Strategy to investigate the role of ADGRA3 in WAT beiging:</p>
<p>Having identified ADGRA3 as their candidate receptor, the authors proceed with investigations of this receptor in mouse models and the murine inguinal adipocyte cell line 3T3.</p>
<p>First of all, in Figure 1D, the authors show a substantially lower expression of ADGRA3 compared to ADRB3. It could thus be argued that a mouse would not be the best model system for studying this receptor. It would be interesting to see data from experiments in human adipocytes. Moreover, if the authors are interested in inducing beiging, why do they show expression in iBAT and not iWAT?</p>
<p>The authors perform in vivo experiments using intraperitoneal injections of shRNA or overexpression CMV-driven vectors and report effects on body temperature and glucose metabolism. It is here important to note that ADGRA3 is not uniquely expressed in adipocytes. A major advantage of databases like the Human Protein Atlas and Gtex, is that they give an overview of the gene expression across tissues and cell types. When looking up ADGRA3 in these databases, it is expressed in subcutaneous and visceral adipocytes. However, other cell types and tissues demonstrate an even higher expression. In the Human protein atlas, the enhanced cell types are astrocytes and hepatocytes. In the Gtex database tissues with the highest expression are Brain, Liver, and Thyroid.</p>
<p>With this information in mind, IP injections for modification of ADGRA3 receptor expression could be expected to affect any of these tissues and cells.</p>
<p>The manuscript report changes body temperature. However, temperature is regulated by the brain and also affected by thyroid activity. Did the authors measure the levels of circulating thyroid hormones? Gene expression changes in the brain? The authors report that Adgra3 overexpression decreased the TG level in serum and liver. The liver could be the primary targeted organ here, and the adipose effects might be secondary. The data would be easier to interpret if authors reported the effects on the liver, thyroid, and brain, and the gene expression across tissues should be discussed in the article.</p>
<p>Finally, the identification of Hesperetin using the PRESTO-Salsa tool, and how specific the effect of Hesperetin is on ADGRA3, is currently unclear. This should be better discussed, and authors should consider measuring the established effects of Hesperetin in their model systems, including apoptosis.</p>

<p>Based on bioinformatics and expression analysis using mouse and human samples, the authors claim that the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor ADGRA3 may be a valuable target for increasing thermogenic activity and metabolic health. Genetic approaches to deplete ADGRA3 expression in vitro resulted in reduced expression of thermogenic genes including Ucp1, reduced basal respiration, and metabolic activity as reflected by reduced glucose uptake and triglyceride accumulation. In line, nanoparticle delivery of shAdgra3 constructs is associated with increased body weight, reduced thermogenic gene expression in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT, BAT), and impaired glucose and insulin tolerance. On the other hand, ADGRA3 overexpression is associated with an improved metabolic profile in vitro and in vivo, which can be explained by increasing the activity of the well-established Gs-PKA-CREB axis. Notably, a computational screen suggested that ADGRA3 is activated by hesperetin. This metabolite is a derivative of the major citrus flavonoid hesperidin and has been described to promote metabolic health. Using appropriate in vitro and in vivo studies, the authors show that hesperetin supplementation is associated with increased thermogenesis, UCP1 levels in WAT and BAT, and improved glucose tolerance, an effect that was attenuated in the absence of ADGRA3 expression.</p>
<p>Overall, the data suggest that ADGRA3 is a constitutively active Gs-coupled receptor that improves metabolism by activating adaptive thermogenesis in WAT and BAT. The conclusions of the paper are partly supported by the data, but some experimental approaches need further clarification.</p>
<p>(1) The in vivo approaches to modulate Adgra3 expression in mice are carried out using non-targeted nanoparticle-based approaches. The authors do not provide details of the composition of the nanomaterials, but it is highly likely that other metabolically active organs such as the liver are targeted. This is critical because Adgre3 is expressed in many organs, including the liver, adrenal glands, and gastrointestinal system. Therefore, many of the observed metabolic effects could be indirect, for example by modulating bile acids or corticosterone levels. Consistent with this, after digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, hesperetin is rapidly metabolized in intestinal and liver cells. Thus, hesperetin levels in the systemic circulation are likely to be insufficient to activate Adgra3 in thermogenic adipocytes/precursors. Overall, the authors need to repeat the key metabolic experiments in adipose-specific Adgra3 knockout/overexpression models to validate the reliability of the in vivo results. In addition, to validate the relevance of hesperetin supplementation for adaptive thermogenesis in BAT and WAT vivo, the levels of hesperetin present in the systemic circulation should be quantified.</p>
<p>(2) Standard measurements for energy balance are not presented. Quantitative data on energy expenditure, e.g. by indirect calorimetry, and food intake are missing and need to be included to validate the authors' claims.</p>
<p>(3) The thermographic images used to determine the BAT temperature are not very convincing. The distance and angle between the thermal camera and the BAT have a significant effect on the determination of the temperature, which is not taken into account, at least in the images presented.</p>
<p>(4) The 3T3-L1 cell line is not an adequate cell culture model to study thermogenic adipocyte differentiation. To validate their results, the key experiments showing that ADGRA3 expression modulates thermogenic marker expression in a hesperetin-dependent manner need to be performed in a reliable model, e.g. primary murine adipocytes.</p>
<p>(5) The experimental setup only allows the measurement of basal cellular respiration. More advanced approaches are needed to define the contribution of ADGRA3 versus classical adrenergic receptors to UCP1-dependent thermogenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Zhao et al. explored the function of adhesion G protein-coupled receptor A3 (ADGRA3) in thermogenic fat biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Through both in vivo and in vitro studies, the authors found that the gain function of ADGRA3 leads to browning of white fat and ameliorates insulin resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several lines of weak methodologies such as using 3T3-L1 adipocytes and intraperitoneal(i.p.) injection of virus. Moreover, as the authors stated that ADGRA3 is constitutively active, how could the authors then identify a chemical ligand?</p>
<p>Recommendations:</p>
<p>(1) Primary cultured cells should be used to perform gain and loss function analysis of ADGRA3, instead of using 3T3-L1. It is impossible to detect Ucp1 expression in 3T3-L1 cells.</p>
<p>(2) For virus treatment, the authors should consider performing local tissue injection, rather than IP injection. If it is IP injection, have the authors checked other tissues to validate whether the phenotype is fat-specific?</p>
<p>(3) The authors should clarify how constitutively active GPCR needs further ligands.</p>
