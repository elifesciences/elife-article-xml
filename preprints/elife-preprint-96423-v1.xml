<title>Abstract</title><p>Regional specificity of stem cell-derived astrocytes is believed to be an important prerequisite for their applications in disease modelling and cell-based therapies. The regional identity of these astrocytes is often defined by the positional characteristics of their antecedent, stem cell-derived neural progenitors patterned to a fate of interest, with the assumption that the positional specification is to be preserved by the derived astrocytes. Using a human induced pluripotent stem cell line designed for tracing midbrain floor plate derivatives, here we show that lineage composition of the derived astrocytes is not a faithful recapitulation of the founder progenitor population, as demonstrated by the loss of floor plate differentiated progeny in the final astrocyte products. Using deep single cell RNA sequencing, we identified distinct transcriptomic signatures of midbrain floor plate-derived astrocytes. Our study highlights the need for rigorous characterisation of pluripotent stem cell-derived regional astrocytes and provides a valuable resource for assessing midbrain floor plate-derived human astrocytes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the brain. They play important roles in the central nervous system in supporting neuronal survival and synaptic activities, including the regulation of ionic homeostasis, providing energetic support, elimination of oxidative stress, and neurotransmitter removal and recycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard 2018</xref>). Abnormalities in astrocytes have been linked to various neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, autism spectrum disorders and Alexander’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Molofsky et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Phatnani and Maniatis 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Booth et al. 2017</xref>). There is therefore a growing interest in using human pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived astrocytes for disease modelling <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chandrasekaran et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Contrary to the widely held belief that astrocytes in the brain are largely identical, recent studies revealed diversity in their transcriptomic profile, physiological properties and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Oberheim et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schober et al. 2022</xref>). For example, single cell and spatial transcriptomic studies have identified several astrocyte subpopulations in the mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zhu et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Batiuk et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bayraktar et al. 2020</xref>). In human, although astrocyte heterogeneity remains largely elusive, heterogeneity in radial glia across brain regions and within midbrain has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">La Manno et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Li et al. 2023</xref>). Furthermore, different molecular and physiological features and distinct responses to stimuli were also observed in astrocytes from different mouse brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Takata and Hirase 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chai et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Morel et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Itoh et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kostuk et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Makarava et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xin et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lozzi et al. 2020</xref>). Indeed, astrocyte heterogeneity has been suggested to underly the regional susceptibility to human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Schober et al. 2022</xref>). Therefore, recapitulating astrocyte regional specificity in PSC-derived astrocytes is generally accepted as an important prerequisite.</p>
<p>Several reports have described the generation of regional astrocytes from human embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which include forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Krencik et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhou et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tcw et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lin et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bradley et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hedegaard et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Peteri et al. 2021</xref>), ventral midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Booth et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barbuti et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Crompton et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">de Rus Jacquet et al. 2021</xref>), hindbrain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Roybon et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Serio et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Holmqvist et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bradley et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">di Domenico et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yun et al. 2019</xref>). The regional identity of these astrocytes is typically evaluated at the stage of early neural progenitors generated via cell type- or region-directed neural patterning protocols, with the assumption that the positional characteristics will be faithfully preserved in the final astrocyte products. However, astrocyte production in vitro involves an extended period of astrocytic fate induction and progenitor expansion using FGF and EGF while substantial literature reported alterations in region-specific gene expression and/or neurogenic competence in expanded neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jain et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sun et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Koch et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Falk et al. 2012</xref>). Therefore, better characterisations of PSC-derived astrocytes and their lineage-specific features are needed to advance our knowledge about the molecular heterogeneity of human astrocytes.</p>
<p>Using a human iPSC line that allows the tracing of LMX1A expressing midbrain floor plate neural progenitors and their differentiated progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cardo et al. 2023</xref>), we discovered an unexpected gradual depletion of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitor progeny during astrocyte induction from a bulk population of ventral midbrain patterned progenitors despite LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitors being the predominant starting population. LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitor derived astrocytes can however be generated if astrocytic induction is initiated from purified LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitors, indicating that the positional constituents of the founding cell population may not be preserved faithfully in the derived astrocytes. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of astrocytes derived from both parental populations identified distinct transcriptomic signatures, providing a useful resource for assessment of human PSC-derived midbrain astrocytes.</p>

<title>Depletion of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitors and/or derivatives in ventral midbrain patterned neural progenitor cultures during astrogenic induction</title>
<p>To investigate whether regionally patterned neural progenitors retain their lineage identity during astrogenic induction and glial progenitor expansion, we made use of the LMX1A-Cre/AAVS1-BFP iPSCs tracer line, which enables the tracking of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> midbrain floor plate progenitors and their differentiated progeny(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cardo et al. 2023</xref>). We differentiated the LMX1A-Cre/AAVS1-BFP iPSCs towards the ventral midbrain fate following a modified protocol based on Jaeger <italic>et al</italic>. and Nolbrant <italic>et al</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Jaeger et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nolbrant et al. 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunocytochemistry of day (d)19 cultures confirmed a high proportion of cells expressing BFP (96.01±0.42%) and ventral midbrain progenitor markers LMX1A (92.94±0.91%), FOXA2 (94.76±0.57%) and OTX2 (97.82±0.28%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref> with the original images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1A</xref>). Most cells (91.26±1.64%) co-expressed LMX1A and FOXA2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). At this stage, all BFP<sup>+</sup> cells also stained positive to a pan neural progenitor marker NESTIN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We detected a small proportion of cells expressing midbrain basal plate marker NKX6.1 (2.03±0.47%, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>) whose expression domain in the early developing ventral midbrain partially overlap with that of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andersson et al. 2006</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andersson et al. 2006</xref>). However, few PAX6<sup>+</sup> cells were present (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), which marks the forebrain and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Duan et al. 2013</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Duan et al. 2013</xref>). Immunocytochemical analysis of FACS-sorted BFP<sup>+</sup> cells confirmed highly enriched expression of LMX1A (95.51±0.09%) and FOXA2 (95.35±0.14%), and co-expression of both markers (94.68±0.10%; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). In contrast, only a small number of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> cells (4.96±0.70%) were present in the sorted BFP<sup>-</sup> population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and1D). These findings provide further support that BFP expression faithfully recapitulate LMX1A expression and that LMX1A<sup>+</sup> ventral midbrain progenitors represent the major cell population in d19(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cardo et al. 2023</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cardo et al. 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>The d19 cells were then induced to undergo astrogenic switch in media containing FGF2 and EGF with the BFP content monitored by flow cytometry at each weekly passaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, representative gating strategy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1B-E</xref>). We found, unexpectedly, a dramatic decrease of BFP<sup>+</sup> cell proportion from the starting point of 88.20±1.10% to only 27.59±8.28% at d43 and to nearly absent as the differentiation continued (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We did not observe evident cell death during culture and replating; thus, the absence of BFP could be either due to the silencing of BFP expression in the derivatives of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitors or the loss of these cells through growth competition. To address this question, we performed progenitor expansion and astrogenic induction under the same culture condition with purified d19 BFP<sup>+</sup> progenitors isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Interestingly, the sorted BFP<sup>+</sup> cells exhibited similar population growth rate to that of unsorted cultures, and the proportion of BFP<sup>+</sup> cells remained at approximately 90% throughout the astrogenic induction and glial progenitor expansion period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). This observation demonstrates that BFP expression can be maintained in the derivatives of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> midbrain floorplate progenitors, and that the loss of BFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the unsorted culture is likely due to their growth disadvantage compared to the derivatives of LMX1A<sup>-</sup> progenitors.</p>
<p>Our finding is unexpected and demonstrates that the regional or lineage identity of PSC-derived astrocytic cells should not be assumed merely based on the dominant regional property of their cellular origin, given that no <italic>in vitro</italic> fate specification paradigm is 100% efficient.</p>

<title>Astrogenic switch occurred earlier in derivatives of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> midbrain progenitors</title>
<p>Since sorted BFP<sup>+</sup> (LMX1A<sup>+</sup> or their derivatives) and unsorted astrocytic cultures differ distinctively in BFP expression soon after the initiation of astrogenic induction, for simplicity, these cultures are hereafter referred to as the BFP<sup>+</sup> and BFP<sup>-</sup> cultures, respectively. Wondering whether the two cell populations behave differently in the process of astrogenic switch, we examined astrocytic marker expression in these cultures at d45 and d98 by immunocytochemistry. SOX9 and NFIA are transcription factors crucial for the initiation of astrogenesis and acquisition of astrogenic competence in the developing central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Stolt et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Deneen et al. 2006</xref>), while CD44 identifies astrocyte-restricted precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liu et al. 2004</xref>). We found that all these markers were more abundantly detected in the BFP<sup>+</sup> cultures (NFIA: 65.89±2.81%; SOX9: 57.19±4.25%) than the BFP<sup>-</sup> cultures (NFIA: 4.26±1.28%; SOX9: 8.88±1.82%) at d45 (Two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Turkey test, NFIA: p=2.52×10<sup>-5</sup>, SOX9: p=9.21×10<sup>-6</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref> with the original images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref>). Although the number of NFIA<sup>+</sup> and SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells significantly increased in the BFP<sup>-</sup> cultures by d98 (NFIA: 44.07±4.56% on d98, p=3.58×10<sup>-4</sup>; SOX9: 44.28±2.84% on d98, p=1.21×10<sup>-4</sup>), the BFP<sup>+</sup> cultures still contained more cells expressing NFIA (65.71±4.25%; p=2.06×10<sup>-2</sup>) and SOX9 (73.25±2.12%; p=5.51×10<sup>-4</sup>) than BFP<sup>-</sup>cultures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate whether the temporal difference in astrocytic switch between the BFP<sup>+</sup> and BFP<sup>-</sup> cultures affects maturation and functionality of the derived astrocytes, we initiated astrocyte terminal differentiation by exposing the BFP<sup>+</sup> and BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocyte precursors to CNTF and BMP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Krencik et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bradley et al. 2019</xref>) from d87 (referred to as early astrocytes) and d136 (late astrocytes). Both BFP<sup>+</sup> and BFP<sup>-</sup>cultures exhibited a similar expression profile of classic astrocyte markers, including AQP4, EAAT2, and S100B, but few GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells at both time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> with the original images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>As a reference, we also generated neural progenitors without employing any patterning cues and induced astrogenic switch and astrocyte differentiation from these non-patterned neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A-B</xref>). We found that, while the astrocyte cultures derived from the non-patterned progenitors contained a similar proportion of cells expressing AQP4, EAAT2 and S100B compared to the BFP<sup>+</sup> and BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocyte cultures, there are more GFAP<sup>+</sup> cells in the non-patterned astrocyte preparations (17.89±5.4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A-B</xref>).</p>
<p>Functional astrocytes exhibit transient calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) spikes upon chemical stimulation, such as ATP (Zhang et al. 2016). Using a FLIPR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release assay, we observed a sharp increase in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration upon ATP administration in both the early and late BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocyte populations (early BFP<sup>+</sup>: p=5.37×10<sup>-12</sup>; late BFP<sup>+</sup>: p&lt;2.2×10<sup>-16</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref>). ATP induced Ca2<sup>+</sup> release is partially mediated by inositol trisphosphate. Indeed, addition of an inositol trisphosphate receptor antagonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate (2-APB) reduced the amplitude (early BFP<sup>+</sup>: p=5.88×10<sup>-5</sup>; late BFP<sup>+</sup>: p=9.22×10<sup>-10</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) and rise time (early BFP<sup>+</sup>: p=2.63×10<sup>-5</sup>; late BFP<sup>+</sup>: p=3.59×10<sup>-4</sup>; late BFP<sup>-</sup>: p=0.028; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) of ATP-induced Ca2<sup>+</sup> response in both the early and late BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes. Interestingly, the early BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes had significantly lower peak amplitude than that observed in late BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes (p=6.92×10<sup>-9</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), despite their similar level of astrocyte marker expression, suggesting a difference in maturity at the functional level. Early and late BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocytes exhibited a similar profile of time-dependent increase in the amplitude of ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> response but did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref>). However, late BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocytes showed a significantly lower peak amplitude than late BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes (p&lt;2.2×10<sup>-16</sup>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our data demonstrate that astrogenesis occurred earlier in BFP<sup>+</sup> cultures than BFP<sup>-</sup> cells. This temporal difference is also reflected in functional maturity of the derived astrocytes, despite a similar expression profile of classic astroglial markers.</p>

<p>To further characterize the PSC-derived astrocytes, we performed full-length scRNAseq on early and late BFP<sup>+</sup> and BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocytes using the iCELL8 platform and SMART-seq technology, with non-patterned astrocytes derived from the LMX1A-Cre/AAVS1-BFP tracer line as a control.

<title>Distinct transcriptome fingerprints of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> midbrain floor plate-derived astrocytes</title>
<p>Significant advance has been made recently in understanding the molecular profiles of midbrain dopamine neurons. However, our knowledge about midbrain astrocytes in this regard remains limited and does not inform anatomic or lineage origin of the cells. In this regard, the BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes provide a unique resource to determine the transcriptomic characteristics of human midbrain floor plate derived astrocytes. By performing pairwise differential gene expression (details described in Methods and Materials), we identified 1153 genes differentially expressed (DEGs; adjusted p values less than 0.05 and log2 fold change over 0.25) in BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes when compared to either BFP<sup>-</sup> or non-patterned astrocyte populations (Supplementary Data 1). Of these, 159 were unique to BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes (BFP<sup>+</sup> enriched, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), which include genes associated with midbrain dopamine neuron development such as <italic>SULF1</italic>, <italic>LMO3</italic>, <italic>NELL2</italic>, and <italic>RCAN2</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Strelau et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">La Manno et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bifsha et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmed et al. 2021</xref>).

We also identified 530 DEGs enriched in BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocytes only (BFP<sup>-</sup> enriched, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and Supplementary Data 1), which include those known to be expressed in the ventrolateral - dorsal domain of the midbrain and hindbrain, such as <italic>IRX3</italic>, <italic>IRX5</italic>, <italic>PAX3</italic>, and <italic>PAX7</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Houweling et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Matsunaga et al. 2001</xref>). This transcription profile supports the notion that the BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocytes are descendants of the initial minor populations of lateral midbrain progenitors. Moreover, 72 DEGs were shared by BFP<sup>+</sup> and BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocytes against the non-patterned astrocytes (midbrain enriched, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and Supplementary Data 1).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the general belief that recapitulating astrocyte lineage heterogeneity is necessary for stem cell-based disease modelling and cell transplantation, the extent of astrocyte heterogeneity in different brain regions and subregions remains largely elusive. By harnessing an LMX1A based lineage tracing human iPSC line and cutting edge scRNAseq technology, we show that astrocytes derived from the LMX1A<sup>+</sup> midbrain floor plate progenitors, the same cells giving rise to midbrain dopaminergic neurons, possess distinct transcriptional landmarks from those derived from non-midbrain patterned neural progenitors as well as other midbrain patterned progenitors. Moreover, we discovered unexpected negative selection against derivatives of LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitors during astrocyte induction and progenitor expansion. Our study highlights the need for careful characterisation of PSC-derived astrocytes and provides a transcriptomic fingerprint for midbrain floor plate derived astrocytes.</p>
<p>Using a popular astrocyte in vitro differentiation paradigm, we found that astrocytes descended from the LMX1A<sup>+</sup> midbrain progenitors could only be obtained from purified progenitors. In contrast, astrocytes derived from bulk midbrain patterned progenitors exhibits transcriptomic profiles of the lateral-dorsal midbrain, despite LMX1A<sup>+</sup> midbrain progenitors being the predominant starting population. Our findings demonstrate that the lineage composition of the parent progenitors may not be faithfully preserved during astrocyte induction and progenitor expansion. FGF is the most popular inductive molecule used for astrocyte differentiation from stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chandrasekaran et al. 2016</xref>). It is evident however that FGF expanded neural progenitors, originated either from the brain or neutralized PSCs, exhibit restricted regional competence and positional gene expression. For example, bulk expanded human ventral midbrain neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Jain et al. 2003</xref>), and fetal forebrain or spinal cord derived neural stem (NS) cells only give rise to GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sun et al. 2008</xref>); likewise, lt-NES cells display anterior hindbrain-like positional profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Falk et al. 2012</xref>), while their antecedents, PSC-derived neural rosettes and early passage derivatives, express anterior forebrain markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Koch et al. 2009</xref>). It is not clear whether this is due to deregulation of the original patterning at the level of gene expression or the loss of associated cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gabay et al. 2003</xref>). In this study, since BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes can be generated under the same culture condition with purified LMX1A<sup>+</sup> progenitors, we reasoned that the loss of their derivatives in unsorted cultures was possibly due to differential growth capacity.</p>
<p>Our study highlights the need for careful assessment of astrocyte positional identity. A common practice in this regard is to confirm the regional characteristics of the founder progenitors following fate directed neural induction, with the assumption that the dominant positional features will be maintained by the astrocyte progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Krencik et al. 2011</xref>). This strategy is at least partly dictated by our limited knowledge in gene expression signatures of regional- and/or lineage-specific astrocytes. Hence, an end point evaluation of PSC-derived astrocytes often relies on region-specific markers defined in the developmental brain during the neurogenic period. For example, LMX1A and FOXA2 expression were used as criteria for midbrain astrocytes in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barbuti et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Crompton et al. 2023</xref>). However, scRNAseq of human fetal ventral midbrain and adult substantia nigra revealed negligible expression of these transcripts in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">La Manno et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kamath et al. 2022</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we did not detect LMX1A or FOXA2 in neither the BFP<sup>+</sup> nor BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocytes. Our analysis however identified new positive and negative markers that could be applied to confirm the regional identity of ventral midbrain astrocytes.</p>
<p>In addition to distinct transcriptomic profile, BFP<sup>+</sup> and BFP<sup>-</sup> astrocytes may also be functionally different. Astrocytes generated from progenitors broadly patterned to the dorsal forebrain, ventral forebrain and spinal cord have been shown to exhibiting different GO enrichment profile as well as different physiological and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bradley et al. 2019</xref>). In comparison to the BFP<sup>-</sup> and non-patterned astrocytes, the current study revealed that GO terms enriched in BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, which originated from the same progenitor giving rise to midbrain dopaminergic neurons, were closely related to various biological processes disrupted in astrocytes carrying familial Parkinson’s disease mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">di Domenico et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barbuti et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Sonninen et al. 2020</xref>). Such a distinct enrichment profile implicates BFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes being functionally adapted to supporting midbrain dopaminergic neurons compared to BFP<sup>-</sup> and non-patterned astrocytes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study lends further support on regional diversity of astrocytes and identified a set of midbrain enriched genes. Crucially, the transcriptomic fingerprint of human midbrain floor plate-derived astrocytes described here offers a much-needed resource for assessing the authenticity of stem cell derived astrocytes in studies associated with Parkinson’s disease.</p>

Trimmed FASTQ files were aligned to the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> GRCh38.106 primary assembly with the BFP reporter gene attached to the end of the genome, using STAR 2.7.9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Dobin et al. 2013</xref>) with the following settings: --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM -- outReadsUnmapped Fastx --outSAMstrandField intronMotif --chimSegmentMin 12 -- chimJunctionOverhangMin 8 --chimOutJunctionFormat 1 --alignSJDBoverhangMin 10 --alignMatesGapMax 100000 --alignIntronMax 100000 --alignSJstitchMismatchNmax 5 -1 5 5 --chimMultimapScoreRange 3 --chimScoreJunctionNonGTAG -4 -- chimMultimapNmax 20 --chimNonchimScoreDropMin 10 --peOverlapNbasesMin 12 - -peOverlapMMp 0.1 –alignInsertionFlush Right -- alignSplicedMateMapLminOverLmate 0 --alignSplicedMateMapLmin 30. After alignment, gene-level quantification was performed using featureCounts from subread 2.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Liao et al. 2013</xref>) with the following settings: -t exon --primary -R CORE -F GTF -Q 0 -B -g gene_id. The count matrix of each index was combined in R 4.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Team 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>All downstream analysis was performed in R 4.3.0 using Seurat 4.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Stuart et al. 2019</xref>). Gene-level filtering was applied by including only protein-coding genes with at least five total counts across all cells and being expressed in at least 1% of all cells. Poor quality cells were then identified using the <italic>is.outlier</italic> function from the scater 1.28.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">McCarthy et al. 2017</xref>). Poor quality cells were defined as having a high percentage of mitochondrial gene count, or high or low the total number of genes detected, or high total gene counts. The thresholds of each metrics for each sample were determined as twice the median absolute deviation of the sample. Raw gene counts were log normalised with a scale.factor setting of 1×10<sup>5</sup>. Data from the two batches of experiments were integrated using the <italic>FindIntegrationAnchors</italic> and <italic>IntegrateData</italic> based on the common top 2000 highly variable genes and the first 30 dimensions of principal components. The percentage of mitochondrial gene count and total gene count were regressed out using the <italic>ScaleData</italic> function. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the top 2000 high variable genes and the number of principal components used for uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was determined using the JackStraw method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chung and Storey 2015</xref>). UMAP and unbiased Louvain clustering was performed on the first 33 principal components. Pairwise differential gene expression analysis was performed using the MAST method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Finak et al. 2015</xref>) with “Chip” as the latent variable. Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using <italic>enrichGO</italic> function in the clusterProfiler 4.10.0 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Stirling et al. 2021</xref>) with all genes in the filtered dataset as the background. GO term database was downloaded using the org.Hs.eg.db 3.18.0 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Carlson 2019</xref>). Revigo v1.8.1 was used to group the representative GO terms based on semantic similarity using a size setting of 0.5, Homo sapiens database, and SimRel method for semantic similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Schlicker et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Supek et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Published datasets were downloaded from NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Clough and Barrett 2016</xref>) and processed in R 4.2.0. Gene level filtering was performed by retaining only protein-coding genes with more than five total counts across all cells. Gene counts were normalised using the NormalizeData function (scale.factor settings are listed in Supplementary Table 2). PCA was performed based on the top 2000 highly variable genes to obtain the first 50 PCs. Visual inspection of the elbow plot was used to determine the number of PCs for downstream analysis. Batch effect between subjects was evaluated on the two-dimensional PC2∼PC1 plot. Where inter-subject batch effect was observed, Harmony integration was performed based on the PCs selected in the previous step (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). UMAP was performed based on either the PCA or Harmony reduction (using the top 30 dimensions), and Louvain clustering was performed (settings shown in Supplementary Table 2). Cluster identities were verified against the reported annotation where possible. For datasets without detailed annotation published or astrocyte lineage reported (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), reannotation was performed based on the expression of known markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7A-E</xref>). Reference mapping was performed using <italic>FindTransferAnchors</italic> and <italic>TransferData</italic> function in Seurat based on the first 30 dimensions of either the PCA or Harmony loadings of the reference dataset.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>All data were collected from at least three independent experiments and presented as mean ± standard error of means unless otherwise specified. Data were tested for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test and for equal variance with Levene test before performing statistical analyses by two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test for multiple comparisons where relevant. Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc Dunn’s test for pairwise comparison was used where parametric test was not suitable. Effect size was calculated as Cohen’s f for ANOVA or eta squared based on the H-statistic for Kruskal-Wallis test. All statistical tests were performed in R4.3.0.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Li and coworkers analyzed astrocytic differentiation of midbrain floor plate-patterned neural cells originating from human iPS cells, with a LMX1A reporter. This <bold>valuable</bold> work identifies transcriptomic differences at the single-cell level, between astrocytes generated from LMX1A reporter positive or negative cells, as well as non-patterned astrocytes and neurons. The evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, but the paper can be strengthened by further analyses of the transcriptomic data, and astrocytic morphology; also, searching for some of the differentially expressed genes by immunohistochemistry in different regions of the mammalian brain, or in human specimens, would be very informative.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In a previous study, the authors developed a human iPS cell line which expresses Cre under the control of the Lmx1a promoter in order to track, select for, and differentiate human dopamine neurons. In the manuscript under review, the authors are using methods which they have modified to generate astrocytes from the same cell line. The authors are interested in examining astrocytes which are derived from regionalized, floor plate progenitors.</p>
<p>The fundamental weakness of this paper is that the authors are making arguments about regional identity but their work is limited to experiments in vitro. Some of the claims that the authors make should be tested in vivo - ie, in sections, at least. Are floor plate markers or other ventral markers ever expressed in astrocytes or glial progenitors in the mammalian fetus? When do astrocytes emerge in the floor plate? All of the data here are based on an overly simplified in vitro platform.</p>
<p>Lmx1a expression is not limited to the ventral midbrain; it is also expressed in other parts of the developing, ventral CNS and in the roof plate and dorsal CNS (Millonig et al, Nature 2000). Indeed, many of the phenotypes of the Lmx1a mutant mouse (dreher) have little to do with the ventral midbrain. The authors are making an assumption that regional identity is fixed when they begin their astrocyte differentiation protocol - not necessarily true. After astrocytic differentiation is initiated, the authors have done little to demonstrate that floor plate identity is maintained even in selected cells; in fact, the transcriptomic data suggests that the cells are released from a floor plate fate. The authors seem to realize this but do not make any attempt to prove their thesis. If regional identity is not maintained, the authors need a better experiment.</p>
<p>If regional identity is not maintained, so what? Don't we already know that this can happen? The authors acknowledge that this is known in the discussion.</p>
<p>The authors have done transcriptomics studies to follow the changes in these cells but they have not told us very much that is meaningful. It would be useful to validate some of the new astrocytic markers that they have identified - Pax and Irx genes (Welle et al., Glia 2021) come quickly to mind. What about genes related to Shh and Wnt signaling that are prevalent in the floor plate? In particular, a lot of work has been done examining the role of Shh on the properties and lineage of astrocytes (Farmer et al., Science 2016; Hill et al., eLife 2019; Gingrich et al., Neural Dev 2022; Xie et al., Cell Rep 2022). There are a lot of stones which remain unturned, here, and the authors could actually tell us much more without doing an immense amount of work. These suggestions and criticisms are described in far greater detail in the confidential comments to the authors.</p>

<p>In the current manuscript Li et al., study the preservation of the regional identity during the process of astrocyte generation from pluripotent stem cells. More precisely, this work investigates if neural progenitor cells patterned for the ventral midbrain give rise to astrocytes with conserved regional specification, which could reflect the astrocytic heterogeneity in the brain. To this end, the authors utilized a previously generated reporter iPSC line in which the expression of introduced blue fluorescence protein (BFP) is subjacent to the activation of LMXA1, a ventral midbrain floor plate marker. The study reports that following a defined patterning protocol based on SHH and FGF8, over 90% of d19 cells, corresponding to a neural progenitor stage, acquired the midbrain floor plate identity. However, during the subsequent astrogenic induction and glial progenitor expansion, this identity is gradually lost, supposedly due to the growth advantage of cells deriving from the residual LMX1A- neural progenitors. Contrariwise, if the LMX1A+ progenitors were purified, regional identity would be maintained throughout the astrocytic generation and incur an early astrogenic switch and maturation of derived astrocytes. By using single-cell RNA sequencing, the authors further identified distinct transcriptomic signatures on the astrocytic progeny of LMX1A- and LMX1A- progenitors.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The main model utilized was engineered from the KOLF2 human iPSC line into an elegant LMX1A-reporter line based on the expression of BFP. This results in an attractive model for studies tracing the fate of LMX1A cells. However, consideration should be given to the fact that the parental line, exhibits a splice disruption in the COL3A1 gene encoding type III collagen (Pantazis 2022, doi:10.1016/j.stem.2022.11.004 ), which has been identified as being enriched in certain ventral astrocytic populations (Bradley 2019, doi:10.1242/dev.170910).</p>
<p>(2) The authors argue that the depletion of BFP seen in the unsorted population immediately after the onset of astrogenic induction is due to the growth advantage of the derivatives of the residual LMX1A- population. However, no objective data supporting this idea is provided, and one could also hypothesize that the residual LMX1A- cells could affect the overall LMX1A expression in the culture through negative paracrine regulation. Therefore, cell cycle or proliferation studies of these cells are needed to prove the authors' assumption. Furthermore, on line 124 it is stated that: &quot;Interestingly, the sorted BFP+ cells exhibited similar population growth rate to that of unsorted cultures...&quot;. In the face of the suggested growth disadvantage of those cells, this statement needs clarification.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the fidelity of the model system, it is not clear to me how the TagBFP expression was detected in the BFP+ population supposedly in d87 and d136 pooled astrocytes (Fig S6C) while no LMX1A expression was observed in the same cells (Fig S6F).</p>
<p>(4) The generated single-cell RNASeq dataset is extremely valuable. However, given the number of conditions included in this study (i.e. early vs late astrocytes, BFP+ vs BFP-, sorted vs unsorted, plus non-patterned and neuronal samples) the resulting analysis lacks detail. For instance, from a developmental perspective and to better grasp the functional significance of astrocytic heterogeneity, it would be interesting to map the identified clusters to early vs late populations and to the BFP status. Moreover, although comprehensive, Figure S7 is complex to understand given that citations rather than the reference populations are depicted.</p>
<p>(5) Do the authors have any consideration regarding the morphology of the astrocytes obtained in this study? None of the late astrocyte images depict a prototypical stellate morphology, which is reported in many other studies involving the generation of iPSC-derived astrocytes and which is associated with the maturity status of the cell.</p>

<p>(1) Rationale of the study and key finding</p>
<p>We respectively disagree with Reviewer #1’s comments on ‘<italic>the fundamental weakness of this paper … about regional identity ...</italic>’. We believe that they misunderstood the rationale and key message of the paper.</p>
<p>The rationale of the study stems from the increasing recognition of the importance of generating ‘regional-specific’ astrocytes from iPSCs for disease modelling, due to astrocyte heterogeneity and their region-specific involvement in disease pathology. Regional astrocytes are typically differentiated from neural progenitors (NPCs) that are ‘patterned’ to the desired fate during iPSC neural induction. While the efficiency is not 100%, it is nevertheless assumed that the initial lineage composition (%) of patterned NPCs is preserved during the course of astrocyte differentiation and hence that the derived astrocytes represent the intended regional fate.</p>
<p>We questioned this approach using genetic lineage tracing with ventral midbrain-patterned neural progenitors as an example. By monitoring astrocytic induction of purified BFP+ NPCs and unsorted ventral midbrain-patterned NPC (referred to as BFP- in the paper, line 154 submitted PDF), we demonstrate that despite BFP+ NPCs being the vast majority (&gt;90% LMX1A+ and FOXA2+) at the onset of astrocytic induction, their derivatives were lost in the final astrocyte product unless BFP+ NPCs were purified prior to astrocytic induction and differentiation.</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that iPSC-derived astrocytes may not faithfully represent the antecedent neural progenitor pool in terms of lineage, and that the regionality of PSC-derived astrocytes should not be assumed based on the (dominant) NPC identity. We believe that this finding is important for iPSC disease modelling research, especially where disease pathophysiology concerns astrocytes of specific brain regions.</p>
<p>Reviewer #1 raised several interesting questions concerning floor plate marker expression during astrocytic induction and astrocyte differentiation in normal development. These are important outstanding questions in developmental neurobiology, but they are outside the scope of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study. Indeed, the approach taken by published PSC-astrocyte studies - such as assigning regional identity of PSC-derived astrocytes based on the starting NPC fate or validating PSC-astrocyte using regional markers defined in the developing embryo - is partly due to our limited knowledge about the developing and mature astrocytes in different brain regions. This knowledge gap consequently restricts a thorough characterisation of the regional identity of PSC-astrocytes in such cases.</p>
<p>(2) LMX1A expression in the brain and LMX1A-BFP lineage tracer line</p>
<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for highlighting the wider expression of LMX1A. We are fully aware of this consideration and hence the thorough examination of PSC-derived ventral midbrain-patterned NPCs by immunostaining and single cell RNA-sequencing in this and a previous study (PMID: 38132179). All LMX1A+ cells produced in our protocol exhibit ventral midbrain progenitor gene expression profiles when compared to dataset obtained from human fetal ventral midbrain.</p>
<p>Some of the comments give us the impression that there might be some confusion regarding the lineage tracing system used in this study. The LMX1A-Cre/AAVS1-BFP line is not a classic reporter line that mark LMX1A-expressing cells in real time. Instead, it was designed as a tracer line that expresses BFP in the derivatives of LMX1A+ cells as well as cells expressing LMX1A at the time of analysis.</p>
<p>(3) Is regional identity fixed?</p>
<p>We feel that Reviewer #1 misunderstood the paper in their comments <italic>‘The authors are making an assumption that regional identity is fixed when they begin their astrocyte differentiation protocol - not necessarily true…’</italic>.  We in fact pointed out in the paper that expression of LMX1A and FOXA2, a signature of midbrain floor plate progenitors, is lost in our BFP+ astrocytes. In this paper, ‘regional identity’ was loosely used to also refer to lineage identity and genetic traits, not just gene expression. We will consider alternative wording during revision to avoid potential confusion.</p>
<p>(4) Splice disruption in the COL3A1 gene and potential effect on astrocyte differentiation of Kolf2 iPSCs</p>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for highlighting the variations in KOLF2C1 hiPSCs and the study by Bradley <italic>et al.</italic> (2019) on differential <italic>COL3A1</italic> expression in some ventral astrocytes. We noted that the progenitors produced by Bradley <italic>et al.</italic> were NKX2.1+ ventral forebrain cells, rather than the LMX1A+ ventral midbrain progenitors investigated in our study. Our scRNAseq data show that all three populations of astrocytes exhibit low levels of <italic>COL3A1</italic> expression. While we will continue to examine astrocyte <italic>COL3A1</italic> expression in publicly available gene expression datasets, we feel that a selective impairment in astrocyte differentiation of BFP+ cells is unlikely.</p>
<p>(5) Additional data analysis and validation of potential new markers</p>
<p>We will carefully consider the reviewers’ suggestions on further analysis of our single-cell RNA sequencing dada during revision. Regarding eLife’s assessment of validating differential gene expression in different brain regions, it is worth noting that both BFP+ and BFP- cells mapped to the published midbrain scRNAseq data set (La Manno et al, Cell 2016, PMID: 27716510), supporting their midbrain fate. We agree in principle that all single-cell RNA sequencing findings should be validated by immunostaining. It would be beneficial to experimentally verify that our candidate BFP+ differentially expressed genes indeed mark astrocytes derived from LMX1A+ NPCs <italic>in vivo</italic>, as opposed to other midbrain NPCs. However, this verification cannot be realistically performed in a human setting, but only in an analogous mouse tracer line.</p>
<p>The current eLife assessment nicely summarised part of our findings, in a sense secondary output of this work. We would appreciate a revised eLife assessment that include the message that iPSC-derived astrocytes, in terms of genetic lineage, can deviate greatly from the starting progenitor pool.  We would be very happy to provide further information or clarification if it would be helpful. We are committed to doing our best as authors to enhance reader experience and support the continued success of eLife.</p>
