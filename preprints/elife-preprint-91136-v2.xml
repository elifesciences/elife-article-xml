<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Midbrain dopamine neurons impact neural processing in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) through mesocortical projections. However, the signals conveyed by dopamine projections to the PFC remain unclear, particularly at the single-axon level. Here, we investigated dopaminergic axonal activity in the medial PFC (mPFC) during reward and aversive processing. By optimizing microprism-mediated two-photon calcium imaging of dopamine axon terminals, we found diverse activity in dopamine axons responsive to both reward and aversive stimuli. Some axons exhibited a preference for reward, while others favored aversive stimuli, and there was a strong bias for the latter at the population level. Long-term longitudinal imaging revealed that the preference was maintained in reward- and aversive-preferring axons throughout classical conditioning in which rewarding and aversive stimuli were paired with preceding auditory cues. However, as mice learned to discriminate reward or aversive cues, a cue activity preference gradually developed only in aversive-preferring axons. We inferred the trial-by-trial cue discrimination based on machine learning using anticipatory licking or facial expressions, and found that successful discrimination was accompanied by sharper selectivity for the aversive cue in aversive-preferring axons. Our findings indicate that a group of mesocortical dopamine axons encodes aversive-related signals, which are modulated by both classical conditioning across days and trial-by-trial discrimination within a day.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes to a variety of higher cognitive functions, achieving the flexible control of behaviors that enables animals to adapt to a changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fuster, 2015</xref>). The PFC is involved, for instance, in stimulus selection, working memory, rule switching, and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miller and Wallis, 2009</xref>). PFC processing and circuits are highly sensitive to neuromodulators, including dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Seamans and Yang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Arnsten et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, studies using pharmacological or optogenetic manipulation of dopamine signaling have suggested roles of dopamine in gating sensory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Popescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>), maintaining working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1994</xref>), and relaying decisions to motor structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ott et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, dysregulation of dopamine signaling in the PFC has been suggested to underlie a wide array of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Okubo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lindstrom et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Granon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Arnsten and Dudley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Howes and Kapur, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoexter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Grace, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The PFC receives dopaminergic inputs from a subset of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, but the information encoded by this subset <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unclear. Decades of investigations have revealed that midbrain dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) generally encode reward prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>): the neurons increase their firing to unexpected reward delivery and shift their response to cues that precede reward delivery after instrumental learning or classical conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sutton and Barto, 1981</xref>). However, several studies have reported that a subpopulation of dopamine neurons show phasic responses to aversive stimuli as a part of salience signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chiodo et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mantz et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guarraci and Kapp, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>), implying that midbrain dopamine neurons may not be functionally homogeneous. Indeed, depending on the projection target, dopamine neurons can have distinct molecular, anatomical, and electrophysiological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Poulin et al., 2018</xref>). Dopamine neurons that project to the PFC might locate primarily to the medial posterior VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>) and show different genetic profiles from other dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Poulin et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, optogenetic stimulation of the PFC-projecting DA neurons does not reinforce specific actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Popescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ellwood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, these neurons might respond not only to rewarding stimuli but also to aversive stimuli. Microdialysis, amperometry, and voltammetry measurements in the PFC have demonstrated an increase of dopamine in response to appetitive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hernandez and Hoebel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahn and Phillips, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">St Onge et al., 2012</xref>), aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Thierry et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abercrombie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Finlay et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>), or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bassareo et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, measurements of the bulk calcium activity of mesocortical dopaminergic fibers have shown responses to appetitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ellwood et al., 2017</xref>) and aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) stimuli. This apparent discrepancy is difficult to reconcile because none of these approaches could investigate the activity of individual dopamine neurons. Moreover, most previous studies evaluated the effects of either a rewarding or an aversive stimulus, rather than both. Consequently, it remains unknown whether the same or different mesocortical dopamine neurons respond to behaviorally opposing stimuli. It is also not known how these dopamine neurons change their response during classical conditioning, where rewarding or aversive stimuli are paired with conditioned cues.</p>
<p>To address these knowledge gaps, we developed an approach for imaging individual dopamine axons based on <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon imaging with a microprism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Low et al., 2014</xref>). We optimized the microprism design and imaged dopamine axon terminals expressing genetically encoded calcium sensors in the mouse medial PFC (mPFC). We then head-fixed the mice to give rewards or aversive stimuli (water drops or electrical shocks) and trained the mice to associate the stimuli with preceding auditory cues (classical conditioning). During classical conditioning, we tracked the activity of dopamine axons over a period of days. We found that the dopamine axons showed diverse preferences for unconditioned (rewarding or aversive) stimuli. Through the classical conditioning, activity preferences for conditioned auditory cues were enhanced only for aversive-preferring axons. Moreover, in aversive-preferring axons, a machine learning-based analysis revealed that cue activity became more selective when the behavior of animals was judged as correct. We conclude that mesocortical dopamine axon activity is involved in aversive-related processing that is modulated by both classical conditioning across days and trial-by-trial judgements of conditioned cues within a day.</p>

<title>Two-photon imaging shows dopaminergic axons in the mPFC of awake mice</title>
<p>To investigate the signal sent by dopamine neurons to the mPFC in mice, we developed an approach based on two-photon imaging using a microprism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Andermann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Low et al., 2014</xref>). We first expressed axon-jGCaMP8m, an axon-targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Broussard et al., 2018</xref>) genetically encoded calcium sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>), in dopamine neurons in the VTA. We injected Cre-dependent AAV into the midbrain regions of transgenic mice (DAT-Cre), which express Cre-recombinase in dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, see Methods). After 2â3 weeks, using sectioned slices, we confirmed that GCaMP expression in cell bodies in the VTA (and substantia nigra pars compacta [SNc]) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) coincides with the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, an endogenous marker for dopamine neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Dopamine neurons in the VTA are known to project sparsely to the mPFC, including the superficial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), but the mPFC itself is located deep in the medial bank (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), rendering two-photon imaging of GCaMP (which is typically excited at 920â980 nm) infeasible. Therefore, we inserted a microprism into the longitudinal fissure between the two medial banks (two hemispheres) to optically access the mPFC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1EâF</xref>). The right-angle microprism bends the optical axis within the brain, providing optical access to the fissure wall and the mPFC surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Low et al., 2014</xref>). We optimized the microprism assembly (<xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1â figure supplement 2C</xref>) in order to reach up to 2 mm in depth from the dorsal surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The assembly incorporated double-layer glass at the top (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Komiyama et al., 2010</xref>), stabilizing the brain from both the medial and dorsal sides, which significantly reduced the movement of the brain (<xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E-F</xref>). Through the microprism, we could visualize GCaMP-expressing axons in the superficial layers of the mPFC in live animals (at a depth of 30â100 Î¼m, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Sparse axons in the superficial layers are advantageous for two-photon imaging, achieving low background noise. In contrast, axons in the deep layers, which are known to be denser in sectioned slices (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>), could not be visualized under our experiments. The GCaMP signal can indicate the calcium influx into axons and terminals, which is triggered by axonal action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Petreanu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>), thereby providing a measure of the activity of dopamine neurons that send projections to the mPFC. In contrast, when we inserted a gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens into the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kamigaki and Dan, 2017</xref>), we could not reliably visualize GCaMP-expressing dopamine axons, unlike the case for dopamine axons in the basal amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>). This difference might indicate that the dopamine axons in the mPFC have weaker signals requiring a lens with a larger numerical aperture (GRIN lens: NA 0.5 vs. Nikon objective lens: NA 0.8) or that these axons are less resilient to mechanical damage in close vicinity.</p>

<title>Dopaminergic axons in the mPFC have diverse responses to rewarding and aversive stimuli</title>
<p>Using our imaging approach, we first investigated whether individual dopamine axons respond to unexpected rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>) and unexpected aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>). As a reward, we delivered drops of water through a spout with random timing to water-deprived mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In response to the reward delivery, the mice licked the water spout, and we filmed this behavior to quantify the tongue position (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Upon the delivery of a water drop, the mice started licking (licking latency: 0.538 Â± 0.065 s, n = 8 animals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Otis et al., 2017</xref>). Two-photon calcium imaging revealed that the water reward evoked brief calcium transients in many dopamine axons (40.1% of axons in 8 animals, example in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). The brief calcium response to the reward is consistent with increased phasic firing in dopamine neurons at the time of unexpected reward, as previously reported in many studies in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amo et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast to conventional midbrain dopamine neurons, mPFC dopamine axons are proposed to play a key role in aversive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vander Weele et al., 2019</xref>). To investigate the calcium response to an unexpected aversive stimulus, we delivered mild electrical shocks to the tail of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) that were randomly interleaved with reward delivery (one shock for every seven rewards on average). The mild shock evoked calcium transients in many dopamine projections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F, G, H</xref>), together with locomotion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These transients could simply reflect locomotion initiation, similar to dopamine axons in the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>). To explore this possibility, we investigated whether locomotion without aversive stimuli is accompanied by increased calcium activity. We found no significant calcium increase at the time point of spontaneous locomotion initiation (<xref rid="figs2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2â figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, unlike the axons projecting from the SNc to the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ma et al., 2022</xref>), mPFC dopamine axons do not encode the initiation of movement; rather, these axons respond to the aversive stimulus.</p>
<p>Some previous studies have demonstrated that the overall dopamine release at the mPFC or the summed activity of mPFC dopamine axons exhibits a strong response to aversive stimuli (e.g., tail shock), but little to rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). We evaluated the preference of individual axons for rewarding and aversive signals at a single-axon resolution by computing the polar angle for individual axons on a Cartesian representation of reward and shock activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J, K</xref>, <xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). In the polar representation, an angle of 0Â° indicates a strong preference for reward information, whereas 90Â° indicates a preference for aversive information. The polar angle distribution revealed that a significant number of axons preferred aversive stimuli, although some preferred reward. As a result, probability density, estimated by kernel smoothing, showed a bimodal distribution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>, solid line) with a trough at around 45â50Â°. In addition, axons showing significant responses were categorized into two clusters based on k-means clustering (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>), the separation of which coincided roughly with 45â50Â° (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Thereafter, we refer to these clusters as aversive- or reward-preferring axons (colored magenta or cyan, respectively). These clusters do not respond exclusively to one hedonic valence (rewarding or aversive stimuli), as evident from the broad angle distributions. We could not find any anatomical patterns for aversive- or reward-preferring axons. These axons were present in either half of the prism view (i.e., anterior or posterior; ventral or dorsal), implying no obvious functional projection patterns within the mPFC. We note that the strength of preference could be quantitatively changed. Indeed, we found that the reward response to 10 Î¼L nearly reached saturation, but the aversive response could be further increased at a stronger current (<xref rid="figs2-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, the exclusive preference for aversive stimuli observed in some studies might possibly be explained by a smaller reward volume and/or stronger aversive stimulus. It may also be possible that the relative frequency of the aversive stimulus could influence the aversive preference. Moreover, measured signals in these studies may arise from deep layers and be different from the superficial axons that we image. Altogether, our two-photon imaging revealed, for the first time, that individual axons in the superficial layers show diverse preferences for rewarding and aversive stimuli.</p>

<title>Aversive cue processing is enhanced in aversive-preferring axons during classical conditioning</title>
<p>How do the reward and aversive activities of individual axons change while animals are learning that the reward and aversive events are preceded and predicted by sensory cues? This paradigm, known as classical conditioning, is a key framework for capturing learning-related changes in midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sutton and Barto, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>) and mPFC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Otis et al., 2017</xref>). We presented mice with a 2-s pure tone as a conditioned stimulus (CS<sub>reward</sub> and CS<sub>aversive</sub>: 9 and 13 kHz, or 13 and 9 kHz), and then, after a 1-s delay, we presented either a rewarding or an aversive unconditioned stimulus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Previous work has shown that mice are able to discriminate between two tones that differ by more than 7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">de Hoz and Nelken, 2014</xref>). Indeed the mice learned the contingency between the conditioned stimulus (tone) and the outcome (reward or electrical shock), which was reflected in changes in their behavior throughout this conditioning process (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref>). To quantify such behavioral changes during learning, we separated the learning into three phases in addition to the first day (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3DâG</xref>, for six phases, <xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). On the first day, the animals licked the water spout only after the reward was delivered (first day; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). However, during the middle and late phases, animals gradually showed licking behavior even before the reward delivery, representing an anticipation of reward (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We observed this anticipatory licking more frequently after CS<sub>reward</sub> than CS<sub>aversive</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> vs. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.031 for the middle phase, <italic>p</italic> = 0.031 for the late phase, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <italic>n</italic> = 6 animals), indicating that the animals behaviorally learned to discriminate the two conditioned stimulus tones. Similarly, running before the delivery of the unconditioned stimulus was more frequent after CS<sub>aversive</sub> than CS<sub>reward</sub> at the late phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> vs. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>, p = 0.031, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 6 animals), again indicating that the two conditioned auditory cues were behaviorally discriminated. Therefore, as in previous studies, anticipatory licking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Otis et al., 2017</xref>) and anticipatory running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>) can capture whether animals behaviorally discriminate conditioned cues in classical conditioning.</p>

<p>Through the classical conditioning paradigm, our long-term two-photon imaging revealed that aversive-preferring dopamine axons maintained their preference for the unconditioned response but enhanced their selectivity for the aversive cue activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). We evaluated the activity change at the time of the unconditioned stimuli (US) throughout the learning process for aversive- and reward-preferring axons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>, magenta and cyan, respectively). On the first day, aversive-preferring dopamine axons showed stronger activity for the aversive stimuli (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>, top, <xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), similar to the response without classical conditioning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Across learning, the activity for the rewarding and aversive unconditioned stimuli gradually decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>, magenta, p = 0.002 for rewarding stimuli, p = 0.007 for aversive stimuli, n = 47; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, comparison between the first day and the last phase), maintaining similar preferences for rewarding and aversive stimuli (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>, magenta, p = 0.24, n = 47; circular statistics, comparison between the first day and the last phase). Similarly, reward-preferring axons maintained their preferences over the course of classical conditioning (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>, cyan, p = 0.77, n = 12; circular statistics, <xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we quantified the activity change at the time of the conditioned auditory cues (CS<sub>reward</sub> and CS<sub>aversive</sub>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) throughout the learning process. On the first day, aversive-preferring axons already showed a transient response to conditioned cues, implying that the conditioned stimulus response was not acquired through learning (first day in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H, M</xref>, and <xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, the conditioned stimulus response showed no particular reward/aversive preference (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>, first day, for aversive-preferring axons, p = 0.66, n = 47), indicating that aversive-preferring axons did not distinguish the two conditioned cues. However, at the later phases of learning, the conditioned stimulus response was enhanced for CS<sub>aversive</sub> in aversive-preferring axons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>, magenta, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, n = 47; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, comparison between the first day and the last phase) and slightly attenuated for CS<sub>reward</sub> (p &lt; 0.001), resulting in a stronger preference for aversive processing (late phase in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>, magenta, p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, for reward-preferring axons, the conditioned stimulus response increased both for CS<sub>aversive</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>, dotted cyan line, non-significantly, p = 0.09, n = 12, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and for CS<sub>reward</sub> (solid cyan line, significantly, p &lt; 0.007), resulting in an unchanged preference (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>, cyan, p = 0.77). Consistently, these changes in CS and US responses across the training phases were evident in the population-averaged calcium response (<xref rid="figs3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We also tested whether the dopamine axons showed suppressed activity when the predicted reward was omitted, one of the major features of reward prediction error coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amo et al., 2022</xref>). Such activity suppression has been detected with GCaMP6m at cell bodies of dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>) as reduced signal at 0â4 s after the delivery of reward. Therefore, we included one condition for an unexpected reward omission on the last day of the late phase of the classical conditioning (<xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We found that upon the reward omission, the reward-preferring dopamine axons did not show activity suppression, indicating that the mPFC dopamine axons do not respond to reward omission.</p>
<p>Taken together, our two-photon imaging revealed that a minority of mPFC dopamine axons prefer reward activity (reward-preferring axons), and that these axons are not involved in reward prediction error in a classical learning paradigm. In contrast, the majority of dopamine axons are strongly involved in aversive-related processing (aversive-preferring axons), and the preference for the aversive cue is enhanced through classical conditioning.</p>

<title>Dopamine axons show enhanced selectivity of cue activity in trials with correct discrimination</title>
<p>In the classical conditioning paradigm, an enhanced preference of aversive-preferring dopamine axons for aversive cues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>) was accompanied by improved behavioral discrimination of the two conditioned cues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-G</xref>). Based on this finding, can correct cue discrimination be accompanied by an enhanced neural preference when animals make trial-by-trial judgements in discriminating cues even after conditioning?</p>
<p>To investigate trial-by-trial judgements of conditioned cues, we classified the trials into four groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) based on correct or incorrect discriminating behavior. First, we focused on the presence or absence of anticipatory licking, as the licking behavior can discriminate the two conditioned stimulus tones, particularly at the late phase of learning (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, based on the random forest classifier). The first group exhibited licking after CS<sub>reward</sub> (correct reward discrimination), the second group exhibited no licking after CS<sub>reward</sub> (incorrect reward discrimination), the third group displayed no licking after CS<sub>aversive</sub> (correct aversive discrimination), and the fourth group displayed licking after CS<sub>aversive</sub> (incorrect aversive discrimination). The classification is invalid when animals make random guesses (discrimination of 50%), so we focused on results from the late phase of learning (or the middle phase if there were no errors in anticipatory licking in the late phase).</p>

</fig>
<p>Can the axonal response to conditioned cues be impacted by whether animals discriminate the cues correctly or incorrectly? An incorrect discrimination of the aversive cue is accompanied by the presence of anticipatory licking, resulting in error trials in our machine learning-based analysis. Such error trials (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, fourth group) occurred in 1.6% of cases, showing a weaker aversive cue response than correct trials (third group) (p &lt; 0.0001, n = 44 magenta axons, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, right). In contrast, the absence of anticipatory licking despite the reward-predictive cue comprises another type of error (second group, 49.0%). In such error trials, the reward cue response was not significantly different from that in the correct trials (first group) (p = 0.26 n = 44 axons, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, left). Overall, the reward/aversive preference was stronger in correct discrimination trials than in incorrect trials (left vs. right in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, magenta, 82.2Â° Â± 1.1Â° vs. 70.0Â° Â± 7.6Â°, p = 0.049, circular statistics).</p>
<p>In addition to anticipatory licking, the discrimination of predictive cues can be inferred by the facial expressions of mice. Facial expressions of mice can capture emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dolensek et al., 2020</xref>), and have been used to make binary judgements of the presence or absence of pain with the application of a deep neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tuttle et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we combined a pretrained deep neural network (ResNet3D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tran et al., 2018</xref>) and a machine learning classifier (random forest classifier) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Breiman, 2001</xref>) to make binary judgements of whether the animals experienced reward or aversive conditions, based on facial expressions during the cue presentation (<xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The percentage of errors in discrimination during the 2-s cue presentation was 16.0% Â± 1.4% (n = 6 animals), comparable to the result for anticipatory licking during the cue plus delay periods (25.3% Â± 6.1%). However, discrimination based on facial expressions resulted in a higher number of error trials in aversive conditions than discrimination based on licking (14.1% vs. 1.6%), and a lower number in reward conditions (18.0% vs. 49.0%). This discrepancy might be explained either by temporal discrepancy between the cue period (facial expression) and the delay period (most cases of anticipatory licking) or by the fact that anticipatory licking might represent reward uncertainty rather than reward expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ogawa et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Correct cue-discrimination based on facial expressions analysis also revealed sharper selectivity for reward or aversive cues. A trial-by-trial error analysis revealed that the axonal activity to CS<sub>aversive</sub> was enhanced in the correct trials in the aversive-preferring axons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, right, p = 0.023, n = 47 axons, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), consistent with the analysis based on anticipatory licking (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, right). In addition, the response to CS<sub>reward</sub> was significantly weaker in the correct trials (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, left, p = 0.019, n = 47 axons, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). As a result, the reward/aversive preference was stronger in correct discrimination trials than in incorrect trials for the aversive-preferring axons (left vs. right in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, magenta, 84.7Â° Â± 3.0Â° vs. 81.7Â° Â± 4.0Â°, p = 0.019, circular statistics).</p>
<p>In contrast to the aversive-preferring axons, correct discrimination had no effect on the CS activity of the reward-preferring axons. We found that the response to CS<sub>reward</sub> and CS<sub>aversive</sub> was not significantly different between correct and incorrect judgement trials (cyan points in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, anticipatory licking: CS<sub>aversive</sub> p = 0.052, facial expressions: CS<sub>rewad</sub> p = 0.08, CS<sub>aversive</sub> p = 0.20, n = 12, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) except for the CS<sub>reward</sub> response based on anticipatory licking (p = 0.016, n= 12). As a result, selectivity for CS<sub>reward</sub>/CS<sub>aversive</sub> was not improved in correct trials (anticipatory licking: p = 0.15, facial expressions: p = 0.39, cyan points in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, E</xref>). Therefore, correct/incorrect discrimination impacts aversive- and reward-preferring axons differentially. Altogether, when animals exhibited the correct behavioral response (either anticipatory licking or facial expression), aversive-preferring but not reward-preferring axons showed a higher selectivity for aversive cue processing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dopamine projections to the mPFC are considered one of the key neuromodulators that enable flexibility in neural processing of the mPFC. However, due to technical difficulties in recording the dopamine neurons of specific projections, little is known about the signals conveyed by mPFC projections, including the basic question of whether individual projections signal reward or aversive information. In this study, we optimized a two-photon imaging approach based on a microprism to image the calcium activity of dopaminergic axons in the mPFC. We uncovered differences in reward/aversive preferences in individual dopamine axons with an overall preference for aversive stimuli. In addition, we demonstrated that aversive-preferring axons responded equally to reward- and aversive-predictive conditioned cues in classical conditioning on the first day; however, this response became strongly biased toward the aversive conditioned cue through the conditioning. Finally, based on a trial-by-trial analysis of the animalsâ behavior following reward- or aversive-predictive cues, we found that aversive-preferring axons exhibited higher selectivity for cues when the cues were successfully discriminated behaviorally.</p>
<p>Our study revealed functional diversity in mPFC-projecting dopamine axons by addressing a long-standing question of whether dopamine neurons send reward- or aversion-related signals to the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vander Weele et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Verharen et al., 2020</xref>). The activity of mPFC-projecting dopamine neurons can be investigated extracellularly by incorporating antidromic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mantz et al., 1989</xref>), but this approach is laborious. Thus, many studies have used more technically feasible but less direct approaches, particularly for awake animals, such as measuring dopamine release with microdialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abercrombie et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bassareo et al., 2002</xref>), measuring catecholamine release with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (recently combined with optogenetic and pharmacological identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>), and measuring bulk calcium activity from dopamine axons with fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ellwood et al., 2017</xref>). These studies have led to somewhat inconsistent conclusions: some studies have reported reward signals whereas others have reported aversive signals. Reconciling these findings is challenging, as different studies have used different approaches to assess the effects of either a rewarding or an aversive stimulus, but not both. Our two-photon imaging approach provided a unique opportunity to compare rewarding and aversive signals of individual projection neurons (i.e., individual axon projections). Our comparison revealed diversity in the dopamine axons, and that many dopamine axons responded to both rewarding and aversive stimuli, with a strong bias for aversive stimuli at the population level. However, this population bias was not fixed; rather, the bias depended on both the reward volume and the intensity of the aversive stimulus. In addition, the bias might also rely on of the frequency of rewarding and aversive events, which our study could not address; we presented aversive stimuli less frequently to keep mice engaged. All of these parameters may collectively explain why some studies have reported a strong response to aversive stimuli but little response to rewards. Our study revealed functional diversity in dopamine axons in the superficial layers, but did not address whether this diversity could also be found in axons in the deep layers. It is not clear whether single axons have branches in both the superficial and deep layers, even in anatomical studies that used single-cell tracing of dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Matsuda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aransay et al., 2015</xref>). Further investigation into these layers may reveal a richer functional diversity in dopamine axons in the mPFC.</p>
<p>The firing of mPFC-projecting dopamine neurons cannot be simply explained by value coding performed by conventional midbrain dopamine neurons; their firing rates increase in response to opposite hedonic valences, rewarding and aversive stimuli, exhibiting diverse preference. Their firing might be captured by salience coding, which includes motivational salience signals and alerting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, salience coding may explain the response of aversive-preferring axons to aversive-predictive cues. On the first day of classical conditioning, when the animals had not yet established a link between conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, the aversive-preferring axons showed a transient activity increase to two types of conditioned cues with no bias, implying that activity serves as an alerting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>). After days of training, the activity became strongly biased toward the aversive cue, indicating that the activity might additionally encode a motivational salience signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). In our study, motivational salience might appear to play a significant role in the processing of the aversive predictive cue. Specifically, in aversive-preferring axons, the activity associated to the aversive cue shows a distinct pattern in the initial trial of each session, compared to the activities related to the reward cue and unconditioned cues (as depicted by magenta points in <xref rid="figs3-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>). The response of the aversive-preferring axons may be useful for the recipient mPFC to allocate its resources to the most salient outcomes and their predictors, a proposed role of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Desimone and Duncan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Ridderinkhof et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bissonette et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sharpe et al., 2019</xref>). The response of reward-preferring axons also does not follow value-coding, considering the absence of reward omission suppression. It is an open question whether saliency coding plays more important roles in aversive processing than in reward processing. To clarify the detailed nature of the saliency coding, together with the functional diversity of mPFC dopamine axons, further study is necessary. Such a study should include different types of unconditioned stimuli, systematically vary the physical features of conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, and separate the motivational salience and alerting signals with different task designs.</p>
<p>Consistent with salience coding without hedonic valences, phasic optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the mPFC does not reinforce or suppress any behavioral actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Popescu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ellwood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>) (but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>)). Instead, optogenetic stimulation can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of aversive processing in mPFC neurons for competitive situations in which reward and appetitive cues are simultaneously presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>). Our results are consistent with the recent view that dopamine at the mPFC gates sensory inputs for aversive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ott and Nieder, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vander Weele et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Using aversive classical conditioning, we revealed that aversive learning can induce activity changes in dopamine axons. The classical conditioning is a form of aversive learning distinct from instrumental aversive learning [including punishment and active avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2018</xref>)]. Although all types of aversive learning are processed in the mPFC and dopamine systems, each type may be expected to include distinct neural circuits. Further research is necessary to reveal the detailed processing of aversive learning in the mPFC and dopamine projections.</p>
<p>Our study provides new insights into the functional diversity of dopamine neurons that constitute mesocortical pathways. Previous studies employing fiber photometry imaging have identified functional diversity among dopamine neurons with distinct projection pathways; dopamine axons in the ventral nucleus accumbens medial shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>), in the tail of the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Menegas et al., 2017</xref>), and in the basal amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>) do not show activity that matches reward prediction error coding, but instead show increased activity for aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Verharen et al., 2020</xref>). Our two-photon imaging results demonstrate that even the same projection-defined dopamine neurons can be inhomogeneous, with some preferring aversive signals and others preferring reward signals. The aversive response found in some dopamine pathways, including mesocortical dopamine projections, might be linked to glutamate co-release, as vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (<italic>Vglut2</italic>) genes are expressed in dopamine neurons projecting to the ventral nucleus accumbens medial shell, the tail of the striatum, and the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Poulin et al., 2018</xref>), and as AMPA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents have been confirmed upon the stimulation of dopamine axon terminals in the basal amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>). These glutamate co-releasing dopamine axons might even be collaterals of the same dopamine neurons; a single-cell tracing study showed examples of dopamine neurons with their axon collaterals in the PFC and the basal amygdala or those in the PFC and nucleus accumbens shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aransay et al., 2015</xref>). Meanwhile, dopamine axons projecting to the PFC are not just from <italic>Vglut2</italic>-expressing neurons but also from <italic>Vglut2</italic>-negative neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Poulin et al., 2018</xref>). One possible scenario is that <italic>Vglut2</italic> may be expressed in aversive-preferring axons in the mPFC but not in reward-preferring axons. This scenario might be in line with a recent fibermetry study on genetic features of dopamine neurons in the SNc, where <italic>Vglut2<sup>+</sup></italic> dopamine neurons showed a strong aversive and weak reward response as a population, whereas <italic>Vglut2<sup>-</sup>/Calb1<sup>+</sup></italic>dopamine neurons showed a weak aversive and strong reward response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Azcorra et al., 2023</xref>). As of now, it is not clear how functional diversity within the same mesocortical pathway is linked to molecular diversity. Clarifying such a link will further advance our understanding of distinct dopamine subsystems and may shed light on how dopamine subsystems are dysregulated in prefrontal psychiatric diseases.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Medical University of South Carolina, Monash University, Kagoshima University, and local institutions supervising animal experiments. Heterozygous dopamine transporter (DAT)-Cre mice (Slc6a3<sup>tm1.1(cre)Bkmn</sup>, Jackson Laboratory, #006660, crossed with wild-type C57BL/6) was used in this study, including 12 mice for two-photon imaging and 10 for histology. Previous research utilized the same mouse line to express GCaMP6f in dopamine axon terminals in the mPFC that could be detected by one-photon fiber photometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Mice of both sexes, aged &gt;8 weeks were included. The mice were maintained in group housing (up to five mice per cage) and experiments were performed during the dark period of a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>All surgical procedures were performed aseptically, with the mice under anesthesia with isoflurane. Lidocaine (subcutaneously at the incision), atropine (0.3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), caprofen (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), and dexamethasone (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) were applied to prevent pain and brain edema. After surgery, the mice were allowed to recover for at least three days. No experimenter blinding was done.</p>

<title>Headplate implant and virus injection</title>
<p>A custom-made headpost was glued and cemented to the skull, and then, a small craniotomy (&lt;0.5 mm) was performed over the VTA (â¼2.9â3.5 mm posterior and â¼0.5 mm lateral from the bregma). Inside the small craniotomy, axon-GCaMP virus (AAV2/1-hSynapsin1-FLEx-axon-jGCaMP8m-WPRE-SV40) was volume-injected (Nanoject III, Drummond Scientific) to the VTA through a pulled capillary glass (40â60 nL/site; depth: 4,200â4,400 Î¼m; 15 min/injection). After the injection, the craniotomy was sealed with a small piece of cover glass and silicon sealant (Kwik-Cast) and animals were returned to their home cage.</p>
<p>For axon-GcaMP, we synthesized an axon-jGCaMP8m construct based on GAP43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Broussard et al., 2018</xref>), a linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Broussard et al., 2018</xref>), and jGCaMP8m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>), together with restriction sites for SpeI and AscI. Then, the construct was inserted into a hSynapsin1-FLEx vector, to make hSynapsin1-FLEx-axon-jGCaMP8m-WPRE-SV40. The plasmid has been deposited into Addgene (#216533).</p>

<title>Microprism implant</title>
<p>After a 3-week waiting period of adeno-associated virus (AAV) expression, a microprism was inserted for two-photon imaging as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Low et al., 2014</xref>). A rectangular craniotomy (4 x 2 mm) was made over the bilateral PFC (â¼1.5â3.5 mm anterior from the bregma), and the dura was removed over the right hemisphere. Then, a microprism implant assembly was inserted into the subdural space within the fissure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, E, F</xref>). The microprism was centered â¼2.5 mm anterior to the bregma to avoid damaging bridging veins. Once implanted, the prism sat flush against the opposing fissure wall, which contained the medial wall of the PFC (mainly the prelimbic area) in the left hemisphere. The front face of the prism was oriented along the midline. The assembly consisted of a right-angle microprism (2 x 2 x 1 mm, Prism RA N-BK7, Tower Optical Corp.) and two coverslip layers (top layer: 4.5 x 3.0 mm, bottom layer: 3.6 x 1.8 mm), which were glued by ultraviolet curing optical adhesive (Norland #81). The top layer of glass was cemented to the skull with dental acrylic. Our assembly design (microprism of 2 x 2 x 1 mm, plus double-layer glass) is different from the original report (microprism of 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 mm plus single-layer glass) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Low et al., 2014</xref>) for the following reasons. First, the thinner microprism (1 mm in the anterior-posterior axis) was easier to insert into the bank, avoiding superficial veins branching from the superior sagittal sinus. Second, the longer prism (2 mm in the dorsal-ventral axis) could spare a wider imageable region below the superior sagittal sinus. Third, the double-layer glass helped suppress brain movements.</p>

<title>Behavior</title>
<p>After the microprism implant surgery, the mice were allowed to recover in their home cages for one week. After recovery, the mice underwent water scheduling (receiving 0.8â1 mL of water per day). Then, the mice were pretrained for head fixation and for drinking water from a spout on a linear passive treadmill (SpeedBelt, Phenosys) in a sound-proof blackout box for two days. After the initial days of reward only, the animals received infrequent electrical shocks interspersed with the reward. Once the animals experienced both reward and shock conditions, we started the two-photon imaging sessions.</p>
<p>To monitor licking behavior, the face of each mouse was filmed with a camera at 65 Hz (CM3-U3-13Y3M-CS, FLIR) using infrared illumination (850-nm light-emitting diode, IR30, CMVision or M850F2, Thorlabs). To detect locomotion, the running speed on the treadmill was recorded at 30 kHz.</p>
<sec id="s8b1">
<title>Rewarding and aversive stimuli</title>
<p>The mice received rewarding or aversive stimuli with unpredictable timing. The stimuli were administered in a randomized order (rewarding stimuli: 7 out of 9 cases; aversive stimuli: 1 out of 9; control period: 1 out of 9), with a randomized inter-trial interval of 55â65 s. The mice exhibited comfortable behavior on the treadmill for 1.5â2 h.</p>
<p>As a reward, 10 Î¼L of sugar water was delivered through a water spout (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), controlled by a TTL pulse (200 ms) delivered to a syringe pump (PHM-107, Med Associates, Inc., USA). Based on previous literature, a 10-Î¼L reward is relatively large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tsutsui-Kimura et al., 2020</xref>). Animals typically underwent 100â200 reward trails. In some experiments, the reward volume was varied between 0 and 15 Î¼L (<xref rid="figs2-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). As an aversive stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>), a 1-s, 0.2-mA electrical current was delivered via a stimulator (AM2100, A-M systems, USA) between two electrode pads attached to the mouseâs tail (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This current was considered to be mild, just strong enough to evoke locomotion. When the current was doubled (<xref rid="figs2-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>), the locomotion tended to become stronger, but some animals stopped drinking water. Similarly, when the frequency of the aversive stimuli was increased (e.g., 50% of trials), some mice were no longer motivated to drink the reward water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s8b2">
<title>Classical conditioning</title>
<p>After three days of reward and aversive stimulus sessions, we trained the mice in reward and aversive trace conditioning. The structure of the task is the same as that for the reward and aversive stimulus sessions (reward condition: 7 out of 9 cases; aversive condition: 1 out of 9; control condition: 1 out of 9; inter-trial interval: 55â65 s), except that auditory stimuli (9 or 13 kHz, 2 s) were presented 3 s before presenting the unconditioned stimuli (rewarding or aversive stimulus). Anticipatory behavioral responses confirmed that the mice could discriminate the tone frequency differences (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-G</xref>), consistent with a previous report showing that mice can discriminate frequency differences down to 4â7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">de Hoz and Nelken, 2014</xref>). In three animals, 9 kHz tone was used for the reward-predictive cue, 13 kHz for the aversive-predictive cue. In the remaining three animals, the tone association was reversed.</p>
<p>We separated the learning into three phases in addition to the first day. In the late phase, anticipatory licking and running reach a saturation level, as evidenced by learning curves spanning six periods (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>When the anticipatory licking was stably manifested (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, late phase), we included one condition for an unexpected reward omission among the seven reward conditions (<xref rid="figs3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>) and continued for two more days.</p>

<sec id="s8b3">
<title>Timing control</title>
<p>Synchronization of the two-photon imaging, behavior camera image acquisition, reward delivery, aversive stimulation, and sound presentation were achieved using digital and analogue output from a National Instruments board (NI USB-6229), which was controlled by a custom-made MATLAB program. We also recorded continuous signals (sampled at 30 kHz, PCIe-6363, National Instruments) of the treadmill speed, the frame timing of two-photon imaging, the frame timing of a behavior camera, copies of command waves to the syringe pump, the stimulator, and the speaker.</p>

<title>Two-photon imaging</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> two photon imaging was performed using a table-mounted microscope (Bergamo II, Thorlabs or MOM, Sutter Instruments) and a data acquisition system. The light source was a pulsed Ti:sapphire laser (MaiTai DeepSee eHP, SpectraPhysics, or Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent) with dispersion compensation, with the laser wavelength set to 980 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>), which causes a higher fluorescent change in the GCaMP signal and less scattering in the tissue than 920 nm. The laser power at the apochromatic objective lens (16Ã, 0.80 NA, Nikon) was &lt;70 mW, and we saw no bleaching. Green fluorescent photons were filtered (ET525/70 m-2p) and collected by a hybrid photodetector (R11322U-40-01, Hamamatsu Photonics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Tischbirek et al., 2015</xref>) and a high-speed current amplifier (DHPCA-100, Femto). Imaging frames were acquired at â¼60 Hz and were downsampled offline. Images were collected at a depth of 30â100 Î¼m from the dural surface (up to â¼200 x 200 Î¼m). The small field of view at a high sampling rate makes it possible to collect weak signals from small structures, as in spine functional imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Jia et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Imaging fields were searched based on the presence of fiber morphology with at least occasional calcium transients in the fibers, not based on the behavioral correlation of the transients. Fiber morphology and spontaneous calcium transients were not reliably visible in axons deeper than 100 Î¼m in a live-view mode, possibly because of the low signal-to-noise ratio. For each mouse, imaging was performed for a single field per day in order to gain a sufficient number of repeats with a 1-min inter-trial interval. In reward/aversive preference characterization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), 1â2 sites were imaged on different days. For the classical conditioning, only a single site was imaged during the course of conditioning. Once the imaging site was determined on the first day, the reference image of two-photon imaging was captured, in addition to the surface vessel image of one-photon imaging. On subsequent days, these images were used to return to the same imaging site and depth, comparing and overlaying the reference image and the ongoing imaging view.</p>

<title>Data processing</title>
<p>Imaging data was processed for motion correction and registration. Axons were detected for region-of-interest (ROI) drawing using Suite2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>) and a custom-made MATLAB program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). A fluorescent trace for each ROI was generated, and then the trace was normalized by the baseline fluorescence (F0, set as the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile fluorescence over a 30-s sliding window in order to remove any slow drifts in the baseline) to produce a ÎF/F trace.</p>
<p>Dopamine axons were sparsely labeled in the mPFC, but the same axons needed to be excluded based on correlation analysis among pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Petreanu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>). The correlation coefficients of ÎF/F traces were calculated for axons in each plane, and pairs showing a higher correlation (&gt;0.65) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Itokazu et al., 2018</xref>) were considered to arise from the same axon. The high correlation pairs were grouped into clusters, and the ROI with the largest ÎF/F signal in each cluster was assigned to represent the cluster. The aforementioned procedure was iterated repeatedly until the correlation between all remaining pairs fell below the threshold of 0.65. Our results remained similar for different correlation threshold.</p>

<title>Reward, aversive, cue, and locomotion activity</title>
<p>For each axon, reward and aversive activity were evaluated. Reward activity was quantified as an increase in ÎF/F by comparing the average ÎF/F between the control range (â2 to 0 s from the onset of the reward TTL to a syringe pump) and the signal range (0 to 2 s). Similarly, aversive activity was quantified as an increase in ÎF/F, based on the difference between the average ÎF/F between the control range (â2 to 0 s from the onset of the electrical shock TTL) and the signal range (0 to 2 s). Axons were considered to exhibit a significant response if the magnitude of either activity was statistically larger than that of the baseline activity (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p &lt; 0.05). Significant axons were classified as either reward-preferring (cyan) or aversive-preferring clusters (magenta) based on k-means clustering, the separation of which coincided approximately with the unity line of the reward/aversive scatter plot, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>.</p>
<p>The locomotion activity was quantified as an increase in ÎF/F by comparing the average ÎF/F between the control range (â2 to 0 s from the locomotion initiation) and the signal range (0 to 2 s). The locomotion initiation is defined in the âRunning detectionâ section below.</p>
<p>During classical conditioning, activity was evaluated in a similar manner. For the conditioned cue activity, the activity increase was computed by comparing the average ÎF/F between the control range (â2 to 0 s from the onset of the predictive cue) and the signal range (0 to 2 s from the cue onset). For the unconditioned response activity (reward or aversive), we compared the control range (â2 to 0 s from the onset of the predictive cue) and the signal range (0 to 2 s from the onset of the unconditioned stimulus). To investigate the preference for reward or aversive processing, we used scatter plots (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I, J</xref>), similar to <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>. The color-coded classification (cyan/magenta) was based on k-means clustering, using the responses before classical conditioning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>).</p>

<title>Evaluation of brain movement</title>
<p>To compare the amount of brain movement between the two different microprism assemblies (<xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), we obtained x- and y-axis shifts of acquired images caused by the brain movement. The shifts were computed by the Suite2p program and used for image registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>). We quantified the brain shift using two metrics: root mean square and large transient movement. First, the root mean square was computed based on sequential shifts in pixel in x- and y-dimensions that were combined trigonometrically (<xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1â figure supplement 2B, D</xref>). Second, to detect large transient movement events, combined brain shift traces were filtered (Butterworth, at 1.5 Hz), and events larger than 5 Î¼m (16 pixels) were detected as movement events (black dots in B).</p>

The tip of the tongue, the location of the water spout and the position of the nose were labelled in randomly selected â¼200 frames from 6 animals. In frames when the tongue was inside the mouth and was not visible, we estimated its location from the lips and jaw, instead of not labelling the tongue in these frames. This estimation prevented DeepLabCut from making a completely wrong guess in labelling the tongue for these frames.</p>
<p>The learning process was divided into three equal-duration periods. We confirmed that the division into six periods resulted in a saturating discrimination curve for anticipatory licking in the fifth and sixth periods (<xref rid="figs3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Then, the initiation of the locomotion period was defined as a time point preceded by a non-locomotion period (when the running speed is below the threshold) of at least 0.5 s.</p>

<title>Error analysis</title>
<p>To investigate how the cue discrimination of the animals impacts dopamine axonal activity, we separated the trials into those with correct discriminating behavior and those with incorrect behavior for reward and aversive conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We used two types of discriminating behaviors, anticipatory licking and facial expressions (see below). We analyzed the late phase of the classical conditioning when animals showed robust anticipatory licking (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) or facial expressions (<xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2E</xref>). In one animal, anticipatory licking was not seen in the aversive condition (the fourth from the top of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) during the late phase, so we analyzed the middle phase for that animal.</p>

<title>Machine learning analysis of facial expressions, licking, and running</title>
<p>The anticipation of animals regarding upcoming unconditioned stimuli (reward or electrical shock) was quantified based on auditory predictive cues using a machine learning classifier (random forest classifier) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Breiman, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Facial expressions were filmed by an infrared camera and analyzed with a random forest classifier combined with a deep neural network (<xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A-D</xref>). First, features of facial expressions were extracted from a given temporal series of frames (i.e., a video) using a deep neural network model, the ResNet3D model. The ResNet3D model is a pretrained network consisting of 18 layers, optimized for videos and provided by PyTorch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tran et al., 2018</xref>). The output from the final convolutional layer was fed into the random forest classifier. In our study, training was performed not on the pretrained ResNet3D, but on the random forest classifier. The random forest classifier was trained and tested with independent trials by five-fold cross-validation within each day. To prevent the random forest classifier from being overfit, only the top 400 features of the input were used, which were ranked by the F-value. To train the random forest classifier equally to the reward and aversive conditions despite their imbalanced frequency (7 or 1 out of 8 trials, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), an ensemble training technique was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wallace et al., 2011</xref>). the discrimination accuracy for reward and aversive conditions was computed separately and an average was taken with equal weights as a final discrimination accuracy. The equal weights prevented the accuracy computation from being dominated by the reward condition, which occurred more frequently than the aversive condition. To investigate the time course of the discrimination accuracy, accuracy computation was performed for a 500-ms time window instead of a 2-s window, and the window was systematically shifted by 160 ms (<xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>The discrimination accuracy based on anticipatory licking was also computed (<xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To enable a comparison among facial features and licking, the random forest classifier was used. Instead of 400 features (facial expressions), the random forest classifier was fed with one feature (either the number of licking instances).</p>

<p>Animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). GCaMP or tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining was performed using standard procedures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref>). Coronal slices (thickness, 30 Âµm) were cut using a cryostat (Leica Microsystems) and blocked in carrier solution (5% bovine serum albumin; 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS) for 2 h at room temperature on a shaker. For GFP staining, slices were then incubated with anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) primary antibody (anti-GFP, 1:1000, A11122, Invitrogen) for 18 h at 4Â°C on a shaker. After three rinses with 0.1 M PBS for 30 min, sections were incubated with Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:500 in carrier solution) for 1 h at room temperature on a shaker. For tyrosine hydroxylase staining, additional incubation with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) primary antibody (anti-TH, 1:200, ab113) and Alexa-Fluor-568-conjugated donkey anti-sheep secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:500) was included. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:1000; D523, Dojindo). After a few additional rinses for 30 min in 0.1 M PBS were performed, slices were mounted on slide glasses for imaging. Images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscopy (FV3000, Olympus) and a fluorescence microscope (VS200, Olympus).</p>

(B) Brain movement during imaging with the assembly design similar to Lowâs. The brain shift was computed by the Suite2p program, and shifts in pixels in the x and y dimensions were combined trigonometrically. The frame rate was 58 Hz (200,000 frames corresponds to â¼57 minutes). Each pixel represents 0.31 Î¼m. Movement events larger than 16 pixels (4.96 Î¼m) were detected as red dots.

(E) The frequency of movement events larger than 5 Î¼m for Lowâs design (standard: n = 3) and ours (extra layer: n=5) for the initial (left panel) and latter (right panel) halves of imaging. The root mean square is statistically smaller with our design (initial half: p = 0.002, latter half: p = 0.002, t-test). (F) Similar to E, but for root mean square of the brain shift.

<p>In this manuscript, Abe and colleagues employ in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of dopaminergic axons in the mPFC. The study reveals that these axons primarily respond to unconditioned aversive stimuli (US) and enhance their responses to initially-neutral stimuli after classical association learning.

The study's significance lies in its contribution to the existing literature by offering single-axon resolution functional insights, supplementing prior bulk measurements of calcium or dopamine release. Given the current focus on neuromodulator neuron heterogeneity, the work aligns well with current research trends and will greatly interest researchers in the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to address existing differences in the literature regarding the extent of reward versus aversive dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex. To do so, the authors chose to present mice with both a reward and an aversive stimulus during different trials each day. The authors used high spatial resolution two-photon calcium imaging of individual dopaminergic axons in the medial PFC to characterize the response of these axons to determine the selectivity of responses in unique axons. They also paired the reward (water) and an aversive stimulus (tail shock) with auditory tones and recorded across 12 days of associative learning.</p>
<p>The authors find that some axons respond to both reward and aversive unconditioned stimuli, but overall, there is a preference to respond to aversive stimuli consistent with expectations from prior studies that used other recording methods. The authors find that both of their two auditory stimuli initially drive responses in axons, but that with training axons develop more selective responses for the shock associated tone indicating that associative learning led to changes in these axon's responses. Finally, the authors use anticipatory behaviors during the conditioned stimuli and facial expressions to determine stimulus discrimination and relate dopamine axons signals with this behavioral evidence of discrimination. This study takes advantage of cutting-edge imaging approaches to resolve the extent to which dopamine axons in PFC respond appetitive or aversive stimuli. They conclude that there is a bias to respond to the aversive tail shock in most axons and weaker more sparse representation of water reward.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this study is the imaging approach that allows for investigation of the heterogeneity of response across individual dopamine axons unlike other common approaches such as fiber photometry which provide a measure of the average population activity. The use of appetitive and aversive stimuli to probe responses across individual axons is another strength as it reveals response diversity that is often overlooked in reward-only studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of this study is the design of the associative conditioning paradigm. The use of only a single reward and single aversive stimulus makes it difficult to know whether these results are specific to the valence of the stimuli versus the specific identity of the stimuli. Further, the reward presentations are more numerous than the aversive trials making it unclear how much novelty and habituation account for results. Moreover, the training seems somewhat limited by the low number of trials and did not result in strong associative conditioning. The lack of omission responses reported may reflect weak associative conditioning. Finally, the study provides a small advance in our understanding of dopamine signaling in the PFC and lacks evidence for if and what might be the consequence of these axonal responses on PFC dopamine concentrations and PFC neuron activity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors image dopamine axons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using microprism-mediated two-photon calcium imaging. They image these axons as mice learn that two auditory cues predict two distinct outcomes, tailshock, or water delivery. They find that some axons show a preference for encoding of the shock and some show a preference for encoding of water. The authors report a greater number of dopamine axons in mPFC that respond to shock. Across time, the shock-preferring axons begin to respond preferentially to the cue predicting shock, while there is a less pronounced increase in the water-responsive axons that acquire a response to the water-predictive cue (these axons also increase non-significantly to the shock-predictive cue). These data lead the authors to argue that dopamine axons in mPFC preferentially encode aversive stimuli.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are beautifully executed and the authors have mastered an impressively complex technique. Specifically, they are able to image and track individual dopamine axons in mPFC across days of learning. And this technique is used the way it should be: the authors isolate distinct dopamine axons in mPFC and characterize their encoding preferences and how this evolves across learning of cue-shock and cue-water contingencies. Thus, these experiments are revealing novel information about how aversive and rewarding stimuli is encoded at the level of individual axons, in a way that has not been done before. This is timely and important.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The overarching conclusion of the paper is that dopamine axons preferentially encode aversive stimuli. However, this is confounded by differences in the strength of the aversive and appetitive outcomes. As the authors point out, the axonal response to stimuli is sensitive to outcome magnitude (Supp Fig 3). That is, if you increase the magnitude of water or shock that is delivered, you increase the change in fluorescence that is seen in the axons. Unsurprisingly, the change in fluorescence that is seen to shock is considerably higher than water reward. Further, over 40% of the axons respond to water early in training [yet just a few lines below the authors write: &quot;Previous studies have demonstrated that the overall dopamine release at the mPFC or the summed activity of mPFC dopamine axons exhibits a strong response to aversive stimuli (e.g., tail shock), but little to rewards&quot;, which seems inconsistent with their own data]. Given these aspects of the data, it could be the case that the dopamine axons in mPFC encodes different types of information and delegates preferential processing to the most salient outcome across time. The use of two similar sounding tones (9Khz and 12KHz) for the reward and aversive predicting cues are likely to enhance this as it requires a fine-grained distinction between the two cues in order to learn effectively. That is not to say that the mice cannot distinguish between these cues, rather that they may require additional processes to resolve the similarity, which are known to be dependent on the mPFC.</p>
<p>There is considerable literature on mPFC function across species that would support such a view. Specifically, theories of mPFC function (in particular prelimbic cortex, which is where the axon images are mostly taken) generally center around resolution of conflict in what to respond, learn about, and attend to. That is, mPFC is important for devoting the most resources (learning, behavior) to the most relevant outcomes in the environment. This data then, provides a mechanism for this to occur in mPFC. That is, dopamine axons signal to the mPFC the most salient aspects of the environment, which should be preferentially learnt about and responded towards. This is also consistent with the absence of a negative prediction error during omission: the dopamine axons show increases in responses during receipt of unexpected outcomes but do not encode negative errors. This supports a role for this projection in helping to allocate resources to the most salient outcomes and their predictors, and not learning per se. Below are a just few references from the rich literature on mPFC function (some consider rodent mPFC analogous to DLPFC, some mPFC), which advocate for a role in this region in allocating attention and cognitive resources to most relevant stimuli, and do not indicate preferential processing of aversive stimuli.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>The reviewers praised multiple aspects of our study. Reviewer 1 noted that âthe work aligns well with current research trends and will greatly interest researchers in the field.â Reviewer 2 highlighted the unique capability of our imaging approach, which âallows for investigation of the heterogeneity of response across individual dopamine axons, unlike other common approaches such as fiber photometry.â Reviewer 3 commented that âthe experiments are beautifully executedâ and âare revealing novel information about how aversive and rewarding stimuli is encoded at the level of individual axons, in a way that has not been done before.â</p>
<p>In addition to the positive feedback, the reviewers also provided useful criticisms and suggestions, some of which may not be fully addressed in a single study. For instance, questions regarding whether dopamine axons encode the valence or specific identity of the stimuli, or the most salient aspects of the environment, remain open. At the same time, as all the reviewers agreed, our report on the diversity of dopamine axonal responses using a novel imaging design introduces significant new insights to the neuroscience community. Following the reviewersâ recommendations, we have refrained from making interpretations that could be perceived as overinterpretation, such as concluding that âdopamine axons are involved in aversive processing.â This has necessitated extensive revisions, including modifying the title of our manuscript to make clear that the novelty of our work is revealing âfunctional diversityâ using our new imaging approach.</p>
<p>Below, we respond to the reviewersâ comments point by point.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) It's important to fully discuss the fact that the measurements were carried out only on superficial layers (30-100um), while major dopamine projections target deep layers of the mPFC as discussed in the cited literature (Vander Weele et al., 2018) and as illustrated in FigS1B,C. This limitation should be explicitly acknowledged and discussed in the manuscript, especially given the potential functional heterogeneity among dopamine neurons in different layers. This potential across-layer heterogeneity could also be the cause of discrepancy among past recording studies with different measurement modalities. Also, mentioning technical limitations would be informative. For example: how deep the authors can perform 2p-imaging through the prism? was the &quot;30-100um&quot; maximum depth the authors could get?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this important issue about layer differences.</p>
<p>It is possible that the mesocortial pathway has layer-specific channels, with some neurons targeting supra granular layers and others targeting infragranular ones. Alternatively, it is also plausible that the axons of the same neurons branch into both superficial and deep layers. This is a critical issue that has not been investigated in anatomical studies and will require single-cell labeling of dopamine neurons (Matsuda et al 2009 and Aransay et al 2015). We now discuss this issue in the Discussion.</p>
<p>As for the imaging depth of 30â100 ï­m, we were unable to visualize deeper axons in a live view mode. Our imaging system has already been optimized to detect weak signals (e.g., we have employed an excitation wavelength of 980 nm, dispersion compensation, and a hybrid photodetector). It is possible that future studies using improved imaging approaches may be able to visualize deeper layers. Importantly, sparse axons in the supragranular layers are advantageous in detecting weak signals; dense labeling of axons would increase the background fluorescence relative to signals. We now reference this layer issue in the Results and Discussion sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In the introduction, it seems that the authors intended to refer to Poulin et al. 2018 regarding molecular/anatomical heterogeneity of dopamine neurons, but they inadvertently cited Poulin et al. 2016 (a general review on scRNAseq). Additionally, the statement that &quot;dopamine neurons that project to the PFC show unique genetic profiles (line 85)&quot; requires clarification, as Poulin et al. 2018 did not specifically establish this point. Instead, they found at least the Vglut2/Cck+ population projects into mPFC, and they did not reject the possibility of other subclasses projecting to mPFC. Rather, they observed denser innervation with DAT-cre, suggesting that non-Vglut2/Cck populations would also project to mPFC. Discuss the potential molecular heterogeneity among mPFC dopamine axons in light of the sampling limitation mentioned earlier.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Genetic profiles of PFC-projecting DA neurons are still being investigated, so describing them as âuniqueâ was misleading. We have edited the Introduction accordingly, and now discuss this issue in detail in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I find the data presented in Figure 2 to be odd. Firstly, the latency of shock responses in the representative axons (right panels of G, H) is consistently very long - nearly 500ms. It raises a query whether this is a biological phenomenon or if it stems from a potential technical artifact, possibly arising from an issue in synchronization between the 2-photon imaging and stimulus presentation. My reservations are compounded by the notable absence of comprehensive information concerning the synchronization of the experimental system in the method section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The synchronization of the stimulus and data acquisition is accomplished at a sub-millisecond resolution. We use a custom-made MATLAB program that sends TTL commands to standard imaging software (ThorImage or ScanImage) and a stimulator for electrical shocks. All events are recorded as analogue inputs to a different DAQ to ensure synchronization. We have provided additional details regarding the configuration in the Methods section.</p>
<p>We consider that the long latency of shock response is biological. For instance, a similar long latency was found after electrical shock in a photometry imaging study (Kim, â¦, Deisseroth, 2016).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Secondly, there appear to be irregularities in Panel J. While the authors indicate that &quot;Significant axons were classified as either reward-preferring (cyan) or aversive-preferring (magenta), based on whether the axons are above or below the unity line of the reward/aversive scatter plot (Line 566),&quot; a cyan dot slightly but clearly deviates above the unity line (around coordinates (x, y) = (20, 21)). This needs clarification. Lastly, when categorizing axons for analysis of conditioning data in Fig3 (not Fig2), the authors stated &quot;The color-coded classification (cyan/magenta) was based on k-means clustering, using the responses before classical conditioning (Figure 2J)&quot;. I do not understand why the authors used different classification methods for two almost identical datasets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these insufficient descriptions. We classified the axons using k-means clustering, and the separation of the two clusters happened to roughly coincide with the unity line of the reward/aversive scatter plot in Fig 2J. In other words, we did not use the unity line to classify the data points (which is why the color separation of the histogram is not at 45 degrees). We have clarified this point in the Methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In connection with Point 3, conducting separate statistical analyses for aversive and rewarding stimuli would offer a fairer approach. This could potentially reveal a subset of axons that display responses to both aversive and appetitive stimuli, aligning more accurately with the true underlying dynamics. Moreover, the characterization of Figure 2J as a bimodal distribution while disregarding the presence of axons responsive to both aversive and appetitive cues seems somewhat arbitrary and circular logic. A more inclusive consideration of this dual-responsive population could contribute to a more comprehensive interpretation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We also attempted k-means clustering with additional dimensions (e.g., temporal domains as shown in Fig. 3I, J), but no additional clusters were evident. We note that the lack of other clusters does not exclude the possibility of their existence, which may only become apparent with a substantial increase in the number of samples. In the current report, we present the clusters that were the easiest/simplest for us to identify.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have revised our manuscript to reflect that many axons respond to both reward and aversive stimuli, and that aversive-preferring axons do not exclusively respond to the aversive stimulus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The contrast in initialization to novel cues between aversive and appetitive axons mirrors findings in other areas, such as the tail-of-striatum (TS) and ventral striatum (VS) projecting dopamine neurons (Menegas et al., 2017, not 2018). You might consider citing this very relevant study and discussing potential collateral projections between mPFC and TS or VS.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have now included Menegas et al., 2017, and also discuss the possibility of collaterals to these areas. In addition, we also referred to Azcorra et al., 2023 - this was published after our initial submission.</p>

<p>(6) The use of correlation values (here &gt;0.65) to group ROIs into axons is common but should be justified based on axon density in the FOV and imaging quality. It's important to present the distribution of correlation values and demonstrate the consistency of results with varying cut-off values. Also, provide insights into the reliability of aversive/appetitive classifications for individual ROIs with high correlations. Importantly, if you do the statistical testing and aversive/appetitive classifications for individual ROIs with above-threshold high correlation (to be grouped into the same axon), do they always fall into the same category?

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to address existing differences in the literature regarding the extent of reward versus aversive dopamine signaling in the prefrontal cortex. To do so, the authors chose to present mice with both a reward and an aversive stimulus during different trials each day. The authors used high spatial resolution two-photon calcium imaging of individual dopaminergic axons in the medial PFC to characterize the response of these axons to determine the selectivity of responses in unique axons. They also paired the reward (water) and an aversive stimulus (tail shock) with auditory tones and recorded across 12 days of associative learning.</p>
<p>The authors find that some axons respond to both reward and aversive unconditioned stimuli, but overall, there is a strong preference to respond to aversive stimuli consistent with expectations from prior studies that used other recording methods. The authors find that both of their two auditory stimuli initially drive responses in axons, but that with training axons develop more selective responses for the shock associated tone indicating that associative learning led to changes in these axon's responses. Finally, the authors use anticipatory behaviors during the conditioned stimuli and facial expressions to determine stimulus discrimination and relate dopamine axons signals with this behavioral evidence of discrimination. This study takes advantage of cutting-edge imaging approaches to resolve the extent to which dopamine axons in PFC respond appetitive or aversive stimuli. They conclude that there is a strong bias to respond to the aversive tail shock in most axons and weaker more sparse representation of water reward.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this study is the imaging approach that allows for investigation of the heterogeneity of response across individual dopamine axons, unlike other common approaches such as fiber photometry which provide a measure of the average population activity. The use of appetitive and aversive stimuli to probe responses across individual axons is another strength.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this positive assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of this study is the design of the associative conditioning paradigm. The use of only a single reward and single aversive stimulus makes it difficult to know whether these results are specific to the valence of the stimuli versus the specific identity of the stimuli. Further, the reward presentations are more numerous than the aversive trials making it unclear how much novelty and habituation account for results. Moreover, the training seems somewhat limited by the low number of trials and did not result in strong associative conditioning. The lack of omission responses reported may reflect weak associative conditioning. Finally, the study provides a small advance in our understanding of dopamine signaling in the PFC and lacks evidence for if and what might be the consequence of these axonal responses on PFC dopamine concentrations and PFC neuron activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions.</p>
<p>We agree that interpreting the response change during classical conditioning is not straightforward. Although the reward and aversive stimuli we employed are commonly used in the field, future studies with more sophisticated paradigms will be necessary to address whether dopamine axons encode the valence of the stimuli, the specific identity of the stimuli, or novelty and habituation. In our current manuscript, we refrain from making a conclusion that distinct groups of neurons encode different valances. In fact, many axons respond to both stimuli, at different ratios. We have removed descriptions that may suggest exclusive coding of reward or aversive processing. Additionally, we have extensively discussed possible interpretations.</p>
<p>In terms of the strength of the conditioning association, behavioral results indicated that the learning plateaued â anticipatory behaviors did not increase during the last two phases when the conditioned span was divided into six phases (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1).</p>
<p>Our goal in the current manuscript is to provide new insight into the functional diversity of dopamine axons in the mPFC. Investigating the impact of dopamine axons on local dopamine concentration and neural activity in the mPFC is important but falls beyond the scope of our current study. In particular, given the functional diversity of dopamine axons, interpreting bulk optogenetic or chemogenetic axonal manipulation experiments would not be straightforward. As suggested, measuring the dopamine concentration through two-photon imaging of dopamine sensors and monitoring the activity of dopamine recipient neurons (e.g., D1R- or D2R-expressing neurons) is a promising approach that we plan to undertake in the near future.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors image dopamine axons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using microprism-mediated two-photon calcium imaging. They image these axons as mice learn that two auditory cues predict two distinct outcomes, tailshock or water delivery. They find that some axons show a preference for encoding of the shock and some show a preference for encoding of water. The authors report a greater number of dopamine axons in mPFC that respond to shock. Across time, the shock-preferring axons begin to respond preferentially to the cue predicting shock, while there is a less pronounced increase in the water-responsive axons that acquire a response to the water-predictive cue (these axons also increase non-significantly to the shock-predictive cue). These data lead the authors to argue that dopamine axons in mPFC preferentially encode aversive stimuli.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are beautifully executed and the authors have mastered an impressively complex technique. Specifically, they are able to image and track individual dopamine axons in mPFC across days of learning. This technique is used the way it should be: the authors isolate distinct dopamine axons in mPFC and characterize their encoding preferences and how this evolves across learning of cue-shock and cue-water contingencies. Thus, these experiments are revealing novel information about how aversive and rewarding stimuli is encoded at the level of individual axons, in a way that has not been done before. This is timely and important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this positive assessment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The overarching conclusion of the paper is that dopamine axons preferentially encode aversive stimuli. This is prevalent in the title, abstract, and throughout the manuscript. This is fundamentally confounded. As the authors point out themselves, the axonal response to stimuli is sensitive to outcome magnitude (Supp Fig 3). That is, if you increase the magnitude of water or shock that is delivered, you increase the change in fluorescence that is seen in the axons. Unsurprisingly, the change in fluorescence that is seen to shock is considerably higher than water reward.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the interpretation of our results is not straightforward. Our current manuscript now focuses on our strength, which is reporting the functional diversity of dopamine axons. Therefore, we avoid using the word âencodeâ when describing the response.</p>
<p>We believe that our results could reconcile the apparent discrepancy as to why some previous studies reported only aversive responses while others reported reward responses. In particular, if the reward volume were very small, the reward response could go undetected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Further, when the mice are first given unexpected water delivery and have not yet experienced the aversive stimuli, over 40% of the axons respond [yet just a few lines below the authors write: &quot;Previous studies have demonstrated that the overall dopamine release at the mPFC or the summed activity of mPFC dopamine axons exhibits a strong response to aversive stimuli (e.g., tail shock), but little to rewards&quot;, which seems inconsistent with their own data].</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We always recorded the reward and aversive response together, which might have confused the reviewer. Therefore, there is no inconsistency in our data. We have clarified our methods and reasoning accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given these aspects of the data, it could be the case that the dopamine axons in mPFC encodes different types of information and delegates preferential processing to the most salient outcome across time.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is certainly an exciting interpretation, so we have included it in our discussion. Meanwhile, âthe most salient outcomeâ alone cannot fully capture the diverse response patterns of the dopaminergic axons, particularly reward-preferring axons. We discuss our findings in more detail in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The use of two similar sounding tones (9Khz and 12KHz) for the reward and aversive predicting cues are likely to enhance this as it requires a fine-grained distinction between the two cues in order to learn effectively. There is considerable literature on mPFC function across species that would support such a view. Specifically, theories of mPFC function (in particular prelimbic cortex, which is where the axon images are mostly taken) generally center around resolution of conflict in what to respond, learn about, and attend to. That is, mPFC is important for devoting the most resources (learning, behavior) to the most relevant outcomes in the environment. This data then, provides a mechanism for this to occur in mPFC. That is, dopamine axons signal to the mPFC the most salient aspects of the environment, which should be preferentially learned about and responded towards. This is also consistent with the absence of a negative prediction error during omission: the dopamine axons show increases in responses during receipt of unexpected outcomes, but do not encode negative errors. This supports a role for this projection in helping to allocate resources to the most salient outcomes and their predictors, and not learning per se. Below are a just few references from the rich literature on mPFC function (some consider rodent mPFC analogous to DLPFC, some mPFC), which advocate for a role in this region in allocating attention and cognitive resources to most relevant stimuli, and do not indicate preferential processing of aversive stimuli.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Distinguishing between 9 kHz and 12 kHz sound tones may not be that difficult, considering anticipatory licking and running are differentially manifested. In addition, previous studies have shown that mice can distinguish between two sound tones when they are separated by 7% (de Hoz and Nelken 2014). Nonetheless, we agree with the attractive interpretation that âthe mPFC devotes the most resources (learning, behavior) to the most relevant outcomes in the environmentâ and that dopamine is a mechanism for this. Therefore, we discuss this interpretation in the revised text.</p>

<p>Specific Suggestions and Questions on the Methods Section:</p>
<p>In general, the methods part is not well documented and sometimes confusing. Thus, as it stands, it hinders reproducible research. Specific suggestions/questions are listed in the following section.</p>
<p>(1) Broussard et al. 2018 introduced axon-GCaMP6 instead of axon-jGCaMP8m. The authors should provide details about the source of this material. If it was custom-made, a description of the subcloning process would be appreciated. Additionally, consider depositing sequence information or preferably the plasmid itself. Furthermore, the introduction of the jGCaMP8 series by Zhang, Rozsa, et al. 2023 should be acknowledged and referenced in your manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now included details on how we prepared the axon-jGCaMP8m, which was based on plasmids available at Addgene. Additionally, we have deposited our construct to Addgene ( <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/216533/">https://www.addgene.org/216533/</ext-link> ). We have also cited Janeliaâs report on jGCaMP8, Zhang et al.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors elaborate on the approach taken for experimental synchronization. Specifically, how was the alignment achieved between 2-photon imaging, treadmill recordings, aversive/appetitive stimuli, and videography? It would be important to document the details of the software and hardware components employed for generating TTLs that trigger the pump, stimulator, cameras, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now included a more detailed explanation about the timing control. We utilize a custommade MATLAB program that sends TTL square waves and analogue waves via a single National Instruments board (USB-6229) to control two-photon image acquisition, behavior camera image acquisition, water syringe movement, current flow from a stimulator, and sound presentation. We also continuously recorded at 30 kHz via a separate National Instrument board (PCIe-6363) the frame timing of two-photon imaging, the frame timing of a behavior camera, copies of command waves (sent to the syringe pump, the stimulator, and the speaker), and signals from the treadmill corresponding to running speed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The information regarding the cameras utilized in the study presents some confusion. In one instance, you mention, &quot;To monitor licking behavior, the face of each mouse was filmed with a camera at 60 Hz (CM3-U3-13Y3M-CS, FLIR)&quot; (Line 488). However, there's also a reference to filming facial expressions using an infrared web camera (Line 613). Could you clarify whether the FLIR camera (which is an industrial CMOS not a webcam) is referred to as a webcam? Alternatively, if it's a different camera being discussed, please provide product details, including pixel numbers and frame rate for clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. This was a mistake on our end. The camera used in the current project was a CM3-U3-13Y3M-CS, not a web camera. We have now corrected this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Please provide more information about the methodology employed for lick detection. Specifically, did the authors solely rely on videography for this purpose? If so, why was an electrical (or capacitive) detector not used? It would provide greater accuracy in detecting licking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Lick detection was performed offline based on videography, using DeepLabCut. As licking occurs at a frequency of ~6.5 Hz (Xu, â¦, OâConnor Nature Neurosci, 2022), the movement can be detected at a frame rate of 60 Hz. Initially, we used both a lick sensor and videography. However, we favored videography because it could potentially provide non-binary information.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer's suggestion, we conducted a comparison of individual axonal responses to both conditioned and unconditioned stimuli across the first trial and subsequent trials. Our findings reveal a notable trend: aversive-preferring axons exhibited attenuation in response to CSreward, yet enhancement in response to CSaversive. Conversely, the response of these axons to USreward was attenuated, with no significant change observed for USaversive. In contrast, reward-preferring axons displayed an invariable activity pattern from the initial trial, highlighting the functional diversity present within dopamine axons. This analysis has been integrated into Figure 3-figure supplement 4 and is elaborated upon in the Discussion section.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In line with the public review, my recommendation is for the authors to remain as objective about their data as possible. There are many points in the manuscript where the authors seem to directly contradict their own data. For example, they first detail that dopamine axons respond to unexpected water rewards. Indeed, they find that there are 40% of dopamine axons that respond in this way. Then, a few paragraphs later they state: &quot;Previous studies have demonstrated that the overall dopamine release at the mPFC or the summed activity of mPFC dopamine axons exhibits a strong response to aversive stimuli (e.g., tail shock), but little to rewards&quot;. As detailed above, I do not think these data support an idea that dopamine axons in mPFC preferentially encode aversive outcomes. If the authors wanted to examine a role for mPFC in preferential encoding of aversive stimuli, you would first have to equate the outcomes by magnitude and then compare how the axons acquire preferences across time. Alternatively, a prediction of a more general process that I detail above would predict that you could give mice two rewards that differ in magnitude (e.g., lots of food vs. small water) and you would see the same results that the authors have seen here (i.e., a preference for the food, which is the larger and more salient outcome). Without other tests of how dopamine axons in mPFC respond to situations like this, I don't think any conclusion around mPFC in favoring aversive stimuli can be made.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we have made the current manuscript as objective as possible, removing interpretation aspects regarding what dopamine axons encode and emphasizing their functional diversity. In particular, we remove the word âencodeâ when describing the response of dopamine axons.</p>
<p>Although it may have appeared unclear, there was no contradiction within our data regarding the response to reward and aversive stimuli. We have now improved the readability of the Results and Methods sections. Concerning the interpretation of what exactly the mPFC dopamine axons encode, we have rewritten the discussion to be as objective about our data as possible, as suggested. We also have edited our title and abstract accordingly. Meanwhile, we wish to emphasize that our reward and aversive stimuli are standard paradigms commonly used in the field. We believe, and all the reviewers agreed, that reporting the diversity of dopamine axonal responses with a novel imaging design constitutes new insight for the neuroscience community. Therefore, we have decided to leave the introduction of new behavioral tasks for future studies and instead expanded our discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As mentioned, I think the experiments are executed really well and the technological aspects of the authors' methods are impressive. However, there are also some aspects of the data presentation that would be improved. Some of the graphs took a considerable amount of effort to unpack. For example, Figure 4 is hard going. Is there a way to better illustrate the main points that this figure wants to convey? Some of this might be helped by a more complete description in the figure captions about what the data are showing. It would also be great to see how the response of dopamine axons changes across trial within a session to the shock and water-predictive cues. Supp Figure 1 should be in the main text with standard error and analyses across time. Clarifying these aspects of the data would make the paper more relevant and accessible to the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that the legend of Figure 4 was incomplete. We have fixed it, along with improving the presentation of the figure. We have also prepared a new figure (Figure 3â figure supplement 4) to compare CSaversive and CSreward signals for the first and rest of the trials within daily sessions, revealing further functional diversity in dopamine axons. We have decided to keep Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 as a figure supplement with an additional analysis, as another reviewer pointed out that the design is not completely new. Furthermore, as eLife readers can easily access figure supplements, we believe it is appropriate to maintain it in this way.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) What is the control period for the omission test? Was omission conducted for the shock?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The control period for reward omission is a 2-second period just before the CS onset. We did not include shock omission, because a sufficient number of trials (&gt; 6 trials) for the rare omission condition could not be achieved within a single day.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors should mention how similar the tones were that predicted water and shock.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to de Hoz and Nelken (2014), a frequency difference of 4â7% is enough for mice to discriminate between tones. In addition, anticipatory licking and running confirmed that the mice could discriminate between the frequencies. We have now included this information in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I realize the viral approach used in the current studies may not allow for an idea of where in VTA dopamine neurons are that project to mPFC- is there data in the literature that speak to this? Particularly important as we now know that there is considerable heterogeneity in dopamine neuronal responses, which is often captured by differences in medial/lateral position within VTA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Some studies have suggested that mesocortical dopamine neurons are located in the medial posterior VTA (e.g., Lammel et al., 2008). However, in mouse anterograde tracing, it is not possible to spatially confine the injection of conventional viruses/tracers. We now refer to Lammel et al., 2008 in the Introduction.</p>
