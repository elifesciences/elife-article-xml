<title>Abstract</title><p>Foraging animals optimize feeding decisions by adjusting both common and rare behavioral patterns. Here, we characterize the relationship between an animal’s arousal state and a rare decision to leave a patch of bacterial food. Using long-term tracking and behavioral state classification, we find that food leaving decisions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are coupled to arousal states across multiple timescales. Leaving emerges probabilistically over minutes from the high arousal roaming state, but is suppressed during the low arousal dwelling state. Immediately before leaving, animals have a brief acceleration in speed that appears as a characteristic signature of this behavioral motif. Neuromodulatory mutants and optogenetic manipulations that increase roaming have a coupled increase in leaving rates, and similarly acute manipulations that inhibit feeding induce both roaming and leaving. By contrast, inactivating a set of chemosensory neurons that depend on the cGMP-gated transduction channel TAX-4 uncouples roaming and leaving dynamics. In addition, <italic>tax-4-</italic>expressing sensory neurons promote lawn-leaving behaviors that are elicited by feeding inhibition. Our results indicate that sensory neurons responsive to both internal and external cues play an integrative role in arousal and foraging decisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Persistent behavioral states subdivide continuous behavior into discrete modules that accomplish adaptive goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>). An example from behavioral ecology is foraging behavior, which is composed of locomotion patterns that unfold across short and long timescales. For example, the brief darting maneuvers that drive prey capture in hunting zebrafish are embedded within persistent locomotory arousal states that last for minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marques et al., 2020</xref>). In recent years, classical ethological studies of behavioral states have been supplemented with machine vision, clustering, and classification algorithms that are well-suited to quantitative and systematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wiltschko et al., 2015</xref>). A current challenge is to identify circuit mechanisms that couple long-term behavioral states to short-term motor actions in foraging and other goal-directed behaviors.</p>
<p>Foraging behaviors and the neural mechanisms that generate them have been a fruitful subject of study in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic> While exploring a bacterial lawn, which corresponds to a food patch, <italic>C. elegans</italic> adopts two major behavioral states: roaming and dwelling (Ben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>). Roaming is an aroused state characterized by high locomotion speed with few reversals and turns, whereas dwelling is defined by low speed and high reorientation rates (Ben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>). A third behavioral state, quiescence, is induced by stress, molting, or satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gallagher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Van Buskirk &amp; Sternberg, 2007</xref>). The bistability of roaming and dwelling states is governed by neuromodulatory signaling via the neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF-1), which promotes roaming by signaling through its cognate receptor PDFR-1, and the biogenic amine serotonin, which promotes dwelling by activating the serotonin-gated chloride channel MOD-1. These modulators act through distributed circuits within the 302 neurons of the animal’s nervous system, with multiple sources of each modulator and multiple receptor-expressing sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Another foraging behavior studied in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is the decision to stay or leave a lawn of bacterial food. Leaving is infrequent on high quality food lawns but increases when feeding is impaired, the bacterial food is inedible, or food is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Milward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Olofsson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shtonda, 2006</xref>). Animals also leave more frequently from lawns of pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pujol et al., 2001</xref>) and lawns spiked with aversive or toxic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Melo &amp; Ruvkun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pradel et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The genes that regulate lawn-leaving behavior overlap with those that regulate roaming and dwelling states, although these behaviors have largely been studied separately. For example, roaming, dwelling, and leaving are all strongly influenced by sensory neurons, particularly those that express the cGMP-gated channel <italic>tax-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Davis et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McCloskey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Milward et al., 2011</xref>) (Table 1), and by endocrine DAF-7 (TGF-beta) and Insulin/DAF-2 (insulin receptor) signaling pathways whose peptide ligands are produced by sensory neurons (Ben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we characterize the behavioral patterns and circuit mechanisms that accompany lawn leaving decisions on short and long timescales. Using high-resolution imaging to monitor the behaviors of many individual animals, we find that leaving is a discrete behavioral motif that is generated probabilistically during the high-arousal roaming state. A signature of leaving behavior is a rapid acceleration in speed immediately before the leaving event. Roaming states evoked by neuromodulatory mutations, acute feeding inhibition, or optogenetic circuit manipulation all stimulate lawn leaving accompanied by the rapid acceleration motif. In addition, chemosensory neurons play an unexpectedly central role in linking internal states and behavioral dynamics.</p>

<title>Animals make foraging decisions at the boundaries of bacterial food lawns</title>
<p>To study foraging decisions at high resolution, we filmed and quantified the behavior of individual animals on small lawns of bacterial food (∼3 mm diameter) on an agar surface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A,B</xref>). During a 40-minute assay, animals spent ∼97% of their time on the lawn, and preferentially occupied the edge of the bacterial lawn where bacterial density was highest (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Fig. 1-S1A-D</xref>). As a result, the tip of the animal’s head encountered the lawn boundary approximately once per minute. A few of these encounters resulted in a lawn leaving event, in which the animal exited the bacterial lawn (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, Fig. 1 – supplemental video 1). Lawn-leaving occurred in 26% of the assays, with a mean value of one event per 100 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D,H-I</xref>, Supplementary Table 1).</p>

<p>Once an animal left the lawn, it typically remained outside of the food for 1-2 minutes before re-entering the lawn (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-S1E</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). Most edge encounters were not followed by leaving; instead, animals that poked their head outside of the lawn either continued forward locomotion (head poke-forward), paused (head poke-pause), or executed a reversal (head poke-reversal) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-G</xref>, Fig. 1 – supplemental video 1). Head poke-reversals were the most common event after lawn edge encounter (1.1 events/min), followed by head poke-forward and head poke-pause events; lawn leaving events were the least frequent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>, Supplementary Table 1).</p>
<p>High resolution analysis revealed characteristic behavioral dynamics prior to different events. Each head poke encounter with the lawn edge was preceded by an increase in speed over three seconds, and resolved by a reversal, pause, or continued forward movement within 5 seconds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). Lawn leaving events encompassed a longer acceleration that began 30 seconds before the leaving event (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). At longer time scales, the average speed over one minute before and after the edge encounter varied slightly for different classes of events, with head poke-forward events and lawn-leaving associated with the highest speeds. The different behavioral patterns preceding lawn leaving and head pokes suggest that lawn leaving is a distinct foraging decision, and not a random resolution of an edge encounter. In particular, it suggests that lawn leaving is linked to a persistent behavioral state reflected in ongoing locomotion speed.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Lawn leaving behavior is associated with high arousal states on short and long timescales</title>
<p>To gain further insight into the behavioral states preceding lawn leaving, we coarse-grained our behavioral measurements and expanded the time axis to allow analysis across different durations. On average, a slow rise in speed began two minutes before lawn leaving, with a rapid acceleration in the last minute before leaving (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We analyzed these behaviors in the context of the well-characterized roaming and dwelling states (Ben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>). Training a two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based on absolute speed and angular speed (reorientations) recovered a bifurcation of roaming and dwelling states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Fig. 2-S1A-D</xref>) (Methods). Using these criteria, wild type animals on small lawns roamed for a median of 12% of the duration of the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Fig. 2-S1C</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). Although 80% of lawn leaving events occurred within roaming states, less than 1% of roaming states contained a lawn leaving event (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). Five minutes before leaving, 34% of animals were roaming, a fraction that steadily increased such that 80% of animals were roaming immediately before leaving (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). By contrast, the fraction of animals roaming before head poke-reversals increased only slightly before the event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Fig. 2-S3C</xref>). Within roaming states, the average speed was constant until the rapid acceleration ∼30 seconds prior to lawn leaving (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>The roaming-dwelling HMM was initially developed on uniform bacterial lawns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>), which elicit more roaming than the small lawns used here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Fig. 2-S1E-G</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). We therefore generated an orthogonal HMM behavioral state model trained on our experimental conditions to validate our conclusions. An Autoregressive Hidden Markov model (AR-HMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Buchanan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Linderman et al., 2020</xref>), trained over an expanded set of locomotion parameters, converged on four states that largely reflect forward locomotion speed and related features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Fig. 2-S2A-K</xref>, Methods).</p>
<p>These four states provided an orthogonal segmentation of locomotory arousal that partly overlaps with roaming and dwelling states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Fig. 2-S2M-N</xref>). Most lawn leaving events occurred during the high speed, high arousal AR-HMM state 3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Animals spent a median of 9% of the time in state 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Fig 2-S2K</xref>, Supplementary Table 2), but five minutes before leaving, 26% of animals were in state 3, which ramped to 82% immediately before leaving (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). Like roaming, state 3 increased only slightly before head poke reversals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Fig. 2-S3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Both the two-state model and the four-state model show that arousal states increase before lawn leaving over at least two phases: an enrichment of a high arousal state 3-5 minutes before leaving, followed by a rapid acceleration in the last 30 seconds. Because the widely used two-state roaming-dwelling model captured the key features of lawn-leaving as well as these alternative methods, we applied that analysis to subsequent experiments.</p>

<title>Food intake regulates arousal states and lawn leaving</title>
<p>Animals roam more and leave lawns more frequently when bacteria are hard to ingest or have low nutritional value (Ben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Shtonda, 2006</xref>). Conversely, simply increasing food concentration suppressed roaming and leaving on small lawns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>, Supplementary Table 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>). To separate the behavioral effects deriving from sensation of food odors from ingestion of food, we treated <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 bacteria with aztreonam, an antibiotic that renders bacteria inedible to <italic>C. elegans</italic> by preventing bacterial cell septation (Ben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gruninger et al., 2008</xref>). Both lawn leaving and roaming were dramatically increased on aztreonam-treated <italic>E. coli</italic> lawns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Fig. 3-S1A-B</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Animals on aztreonam-treated lawns maintained the characteristic speed acceleration in the last 30 seconds before leaving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Fig. 3-S1C</xref>).</p>

To ascertain whether similar mechanisms affect arousal and lawn leaving, we acutely inhibited pharyngeal pumping by optogenetic activation of the red-shifted channelrhodopsin ReaChR in pharyngeal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-J</xref>). Acute feeding inhibition strongly stimulated both roaming and lawn leaving (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Fig. 3-S1D-E</xref>, Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>While roaming and head pokes began immediately upon feeding inhibition, leaving events did not occur immediately but instead accumulated throughout the 10-minute stimulation interval (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). In each case, leaving was preceded by a 30 second acceleration in speed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). Thus, feeding inhibition elicits both roaming and lawn-leaving behaviors, and lawn-leaving occur probabilistically during roaming states.</p>

<title>Parallel regulation of arousal states and leaving by neuromodulatory mutants</title>
<p>To further examine the relationship between arousal states and lawn leaving, we examined mutants with well-characterized alterations in roaming and dwelling.

We found that each of these mutants showed increased lawn leaving, strengthening the observed correlation between roaming and leaving rates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A-C, E-G</xref>). In addition, the fraction of animals roaming increased over several minutes before leaving events, as was observed in wild type animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I-K</xref>). Finally, each mutant had a brief acceleration in speed during the 30 seconds prior to leaving (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M-O</xref>). Thus, although the molecular basis of arousal is different in each of these mutants, the overall dynamics of roaming and lawn leaving are preserved across genotypes.</p>

<title>Acute circuit manipulation drives deterministic roaming and probabilistic leaving</title>

<p>RIB::BlaC stimulation also potentiated lawn leaving, with over 70% of animals leaving lawns during the stimulation period (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-E</xref>).

<title>Chemosensory neurons couple roaming dynamics, internal state, and lawn leaving</title>
<p>In addition to the neuromodulatory arousal systems, multiple food- and pheromone-sensing chemosensory neurons affect roaming, dwelling, and leaving behaviors (Table 1).

<p>Many of the 15 classes of sensory neurons that express <italic>tax-4</italic> have been implicated in roaming or leaving behaviors (Table 1). We rescued <italic>tax-4</italic> separately in AWC, which senses food odors; ASK, which senses amino acids and pheromones; ASJ and ASI, which sense pheromones, food, and toxins; and URX/AQR/PQR, which sense environmental oxygen (Ben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Milward et al., 2011</xref>). Significant effects on roaming or leaving behavior were observed upon ASJ, ASK, or AWC rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Fig. 6-S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">S2</xref>). The strongest effects resulted from <italic>tax-4</italic> rescue in the ASJ neurons, which partially restored roaming levels before lawn leaving (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Fig 6-S1</xref>), and <italic>tax-4</italic> rescue in the ASK neurons, which paradoxically suppressed leaving to a level below that of either wild type or <italic>tax-4</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Fig. 6-S2</xref>). Because ASJ and ASK showed opposite effects in these experiments, we also examined strains in which both neurons were rescued. Combined ASJ and ASK rescue normalized roaming and leaving compared to ASK rescue alone, albeit not to fully wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Fig. 6-S2</xref>). These results suggest that multiple <italic>tax-4-</italic>expressing sensory neurons have roles in arousal-related behaviors and highlight ASJ as a regulator of roaming and leaving dynamics.</p>
<p>Next, we asked how <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants responded to acute inhibition of feeding. As in wild-type animals, optogenetic inhibition of pharyngeal pumping resulted in an immediate and strong increase in roaming in <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Fig. 6-S3A</xref>). However, feeding inhibition in <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants increased leaving only slightly, unlike in the wild-type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Both of these effects were rescued by expressing <italic>tax-4</italic> in ASJ neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Fig. 6-S3B-D</xref>). Similarly, <italic>tax-4</italic> animals on inedible food roamed at the same high rate as wild type animals but produced significantly fewer lawn leaving events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Fig. 6-S4</xref>); rescuing <italic>tax-4</italic> in ASJ restored lawn leaving to wild-type levels. Thus <italic>tax-4</italic> sensory mutants uncouple leaving behavior from its normal context in multiple ways: they can leave edible food lawns without an extended roaming state, and they are less likely to leave when feeding is inhibited, even while they are roaming.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Both in the wild and in laboratory settings, foraging locomotion patterns exhibit scale invariance, meaning that similar statistics of movement displacement and duration arise on short and long timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ayala-Orozco et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Proekt et al., 2012</xref>). Long term arousal changes are regulated by neuromodulators that signal widely throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Flavell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Taghert &amp; Nitabach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Weissbourd et al., 2014</xref>), whereas moment-by-moment decision-making involves fast sensorimotor circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007</xref>). Here we show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> couples food leaving decisions, which unfold over seconds, to high arousal roaming states that last minutes. Although food intake and neuromodulatory signaling both alter the frequency of sustained <italic>C. elegans</italic> roaming states, these changes do not disrupt the coupling of roaming to food leaving decisions. Instead, sensory neurons link roaming and leaving behaviors, integrating these behavioral motifs, their dynamic properties, and their regulation by food intake.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Behavioral arousal alters probabilistic decision-making</title>
<p>From an ethological perspective, lawn-leaving is a classical foraging decision based on an animal’s assessment of the quality of a food patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Charnov, 1976</xref>). Previous studies of lawn-leaving have identified features of the environment, like food availability, population density, and toxic repellents, that affect leaving probability as predicted by foraging theory. Here, we have extended these observations using the framework of computational neuroethology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Datta et al., 2019</xref>), examining behavior in detail across time to identify rare leaving events and the behavioral context in which they occurred. We found that leaving was tightly coupled to roaming, both during spontaneous behaviors and after acute manipulations that induced roaming states. In each case, and in neuromodulatory mutants that altered roaming frequency, leaving occurred when animals were roaming, occurred probabilistically over minutes during the roaming state, and was preceded by a brief 30-second acceleration in speed. The stereotyped features of leaving behavior, which were not shared by other lawn edge encounters, suggest that it is a discrete behavioral motif associated with roaming states. Leaving can be viewed as a form of decision-making—a discrete action that drives an adaptive behavioral choice between alternatives, influenced by internal states such as arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Roaming and dwelling are a widely-used framework for defining arousal states in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> although changing experimental conditions or analysis methods can reveal sub-states or alternative classification frameworks (this work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cermak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gallagher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Van Buskirk &amp; Sternberg, 2007</xref>). Classical ethology presents such internal states as hierarchical and mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tinbergen, 1951</xref>), while molecular and circuit analysis has extended and refined these ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; Hindmarsh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Sten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Moy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pan et al., 2012</xref>). Our results indicate that lawn leaving behaviors are coupled to the roaming state, but with this state they are relatively rare and apparently probabilistic. More detailed studies may reveal additional regulators, such as an individual’s sensory experience, that shape the pattern of leaving behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Coen et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Sensory neurons integrate internal state and external sensation to guide foraging decisions</title>
<p>Our results identify two distinct biological mechanisms that regulate lawn leaving. First, leaving is coupled to arousal state. Leaving rates are 20-fold higher in roaming animals than in dwelling animals, and the leaving rates of most arousal mutants are largely explained by the fact that they spend more time roaming (Table 2). The second mechanism is controlled by <italic>tax-4</italic> sensory neurons, which shape the behavioral dynamics of roaming and leaving across a range of conditions and stimulate leaving during feeding inhibition.</p>
<p>At a straightforward level, sensory neurons are well-placed to evaluate environmental quality in the framework of foraging theory. For example, ASK and AWC neurons sense amino acids and food odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bargmann, 2006)</xref>, while ASJ neurons sense pheromones and toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>), and other sensory neurons detect distinct environmental features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bargmann, 2006)</xref>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, many sensory neurons affect roaming, dwelling, or leaving (Table 1), and their relative importance varies with context, such as the presence of chemical repellents or pheromones that signal population density (Dal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bello et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Milward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pradel et al., 2007</xref>). Under the conditions used here, ASK neurons suppressed and ASJ neurons promoted roaming and leaving, respectively. Rescuing <italic>tax-4</italic> in ASJ partially restored features of normal leaving dynamics, including roaming before leaving.</p>
<p>Others have shown that chronic feeding deprivation across hours drives lawn leaving through the action of <italic>tax-4</italic> in several sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Olofsson, 2014</xref>). An unexpected result, however, was that <italic>tax-4</italic> sensory neurons were required to drive the high leaving rates after acute inhibition of feeding. Together, these results suggest that the sensory neurons are the sites at which internal feeding cues, behavioral states, and specific foraging decisions are integrated. Additional experiments are needed to define the full set of sensory neurons that couple feeding inhibition to leaving, the nature of the interoceptive signal of pharyngeal pumping, and the readout of the sensory neurons. Pharyngeal interoception is mediated in part by the serotonergic NSM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rhoades et al., 2019</xref>), but we found that serotonin was not essential for the effects of acute feeding inhibition. With respect to interoception, some of the <italic>tax-4-</italic> expressing sensory neurons detect tyramine, one of several biogenic amines that regulate lawn leaving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bendesky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">O’Donnell et al., 2020</xref>), and many detect neuropeptides as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hapiak et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Sensory neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and other animals are most often studied in the context of rapid behavioral responses, but they also have critical roles in endocrine signaling. For example, intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells drive circadian entrainment in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hattar et al., 2002</xref>) and in cichlid fish, visual stimuli from females are sufficient to induce an endocrine androgen response in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">O’Connell et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that the combination of endocrine signals, neuropeptides, and fast transmitters released by sensory neurons couples roaming states to leaving states. The insulin peptides and DAF-7-TGF-beta protein that regulate roaming, dwelling, and leaving are primarily produced by <italic>tax-4-</italic> expressing sensory neurons, so these neurons bridge sensory and endocrine regulation of foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Expression of these genes is regulated by pheromones and metabolic conditions, providing an additional layer beyond neural activity for long-term regulation of behavioral state. Many <italic>tax-4</italic> sensory neurons also release classical neurotransmitters such as glutamate (ASK, AWC) and acetylcholine (ASJ), and therefore have the potential to modulate rapid behaviors such as the lawn-leaving motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Future studies can test this hypothesis while determining the mechanisms by which sensory neurons integrate signals to trigger lawn leaving.</p>

All experiments were performed on young adult hermaphrodites, picked as L4 larvae the evening before an experiment. Wild type controls were the PD1074 sequenced strain derived from the N2 Bristol strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yoshimura et al., 2019</xref>), except for <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>cat-2</italic> controls, which were the CX0001 isolate of the N2 Bristol strain. Mutant strains were backcrossed into wild type to reduce background mutations. Transgenic strains were always compared to matched controls tested in parallel on the same days. Full genotypes and detailed descriptions of all strains and transgenes appear in Table 3: Strain details.</p>

<title>Small lawn foraging assay</title>
<p>For all assays, <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 was grown overnight in a shaking LB liquid culture from a single colony at 37°C. On the morning of the assay, 400 μL of saturated liquid culture was diluted into 5 mL of LB and allowed to grow to OD1 at 37 °C (∼1.5 hours), as measured by spectrophotometer. The liquid culture was then spun down and resuspended in M9 buffer (3 g KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 6 g Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 5 g NaCl, 1 ml 1 M MgSO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O to 1 liter) then concentrated to a density of OD2 (and OD1 or OD4 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). To generate the test lawns, 2 μL of this concentrated bacterial resuspension was seeded onto NGM agar in the center of each well of a custom-made laser-cut multi-well plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). 50 μL of bacterial resuspension was seeded onto a separate NGM agar plate to be used as a food density acclimation plate. Lawns were grown at 20-22°C for 2 hours before the assay. Adult hermaphrodites picked as L4s 16-20 hours before the assay were then transferred to acclimation plates. After 45-90 minutes, animals were transferred to an unseeded NGM plate, cleaned of <italic>E. coli</italic>, and transferred singly into each well of the assay plates, where they were placed on bacteria-free agar and allowed to find the small food lawn on their own. Assays were recorded for 1 hour at 3 frames per second using 12 8.8 MP USB3 cameras (Pointgrey, Flea3) and 35 mm high-resolution objectives (Edmund Optics). LED backlights (Metaphase Technologies) provided uniform illumination of the assay plates. Commercial software (Flycapture, Pointgrey) was used to record the movies.</p>

<p>Animals were stimulated while navigating small food lawns described above. Experimental animals were grown on bacterial lawns containing 50 μM all-trans retinal (+ATR) overnight before assays. Control animals were placed on lawns made in parallel that did not contain retinal (-ATR). A 590 nm Precision LED with Uniform Illumination (Mightex) controlled with custom MATLAB software was used to deliver optogenetic stimuli. Animals were acclimated to small lawns (no ATR) for 20 minutes before being exposed to alternating 10-minute intervals of light OFF and light ON using 590 nm light at 60 μW/mm<sup>2</sup> strobed at 10 Hz with a 50% duty cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Fig. 4-S1</xref>).

To generate test lawns, 2 μL of this bacterial suspension was plated on NGM agar test plates containing aztreonam (10 μg/ml). Small lawn assays were performed as described above (see “Small lawn foraging assay”), except that bacteria on NGM+aztreonam plates were allowed to grow for 4 hours before assay testing. To test for any acute behavioral responses to aztreonam, we also performed a control “post-add” experiment, in which 2 μL of either 4 μg/mL aztreonam dissolved in DMSO or DMSO alone was added to normal small bacterial lawns after 4 hours of growth on NGM agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Fig. 3-S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Behavioral tracking and lawn feature detection</title>
<p>Because each video recorded the behavior of up to 6 individual animals, videos were manually cropped so each surrounded just a single animal using FFmpeg software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tomar, 2006</xref>). To extract animal positions and postures, captured movies were analyzed by custom made scripts in MATLAB (Mathworks, version 2021a) using the Image Processing Toolbox and the Computer Vision Toolbox. In each frame of the movie, the worm is segmented by background subtraction and its XY position is tracked over time using a Kalman filter. From the background-subtracted worm image, a smooth spline of 49 points was computationally applied and features relating to the movement of points along the body were derived following (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Javer et al., 2018</xref>). Disambiguation of the head versus tail was determined by assigning the head as the end of the spline that had greater cumulative displacement over the video assay, facilitating determination of times when the animal moved forward and backward.</p>

<title>Behavioral features extracted</title>
<p>Features were defined as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Javer et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, body parts were defined based on a skeletonized spline containing 49 points equally distributed along the length of the worm body. The head comprises spline points 1-8. The midbody comprises spline points 17-33. The positions of head and midbody were calculated by deriving the centroid of each of these point sets by averaging their x and y positions before subsequent analyses. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Fig. 2-S2</xref>.

<title>Lawn boundary-related metrics and Lawn boundary interaction behaviors</title>
<p>The outline of the bacterial lawn was determined by edge detectors applied to the background averaged across movie frames. Across every frame, the closest boundary point to the animal’s head was determined and used to calculate the “Lawn Boundary Distance.”</p>
<p>Lawn Boundary Distance and movement direction were used to classify a set of lawn boundary interaction behaviors. Head pokes were classified based on an excursion of the head lawn boundary distance that peaks outside the lawn before returning to the lawn interior. In the period following maximal displacement outside the lawn and before resuming locomotion inside the lawn (“recovery interval”), 3 types of head pokes were categorized: head poke forward, in which at least half of the recovery intervals is spent moving forward, head poke reversal, in which the animal executes a reversal during the recovery interval, or head poke pauses, in which an animal spends at least half of the recovery interval with speed less than 0.02 mm/sec. Lawn leaving events were marked as the first frame when the animal’s head emerged from the lawn before its entire body exited the lawn.</p>

<title>Quantitative Locomotion Analysis and HMM analyses</title>
<p>All quantitative analyses of locomotion and Hidden Markov Model building after behavioral tracking were performed in Python. For all analyses of animal locomotion and model-building, behavioral data from animals outside the food lawn was censored.</p>
<p>To classify roaming and dwelling states, speed and angular speed of animal centroid position was averaged into contiguous 10 second intervals. Roaming and dwelling states were classified as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, two classes of intervals corresponding to high angular speed / low speed and low angular speed / high speed were identified and separated by a line drawn at y (mm/sec) = x (deg/sec)/450. Behavior can then be instantaneously classified into roaming intervals when values are above the line, or dwelling intervals, when values are below the line. A 2-state categorical Hidden Markov Model was then trained on these behavioral sequences to generate roaming and dwelling hidden states using the SSM package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Linderman et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>An Autoregressive Hidden Markov Model (AR-HMM) was trained to segment animal behavioral states on food using a different set of behavioral features relating to forward body movement and head movements: fraction of time moving forward per 10-sec bin, midbody forward speed, midbody angular speed, head angular velocity relative to midbody and head radial velocity relative to midbody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Fig. 2-S2</xref>, see above for feature definitions).</p>

AR-HMMs were also trained using the SSM package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Linderman et al., 2020</xref>).

<p>Scheer and Bargmann provide an <bold>important</bold> behavioral genetics study on how behavioral context affects decision making of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The results and interpretations are overall <bold>convincing</bold>; the behavioral analysis at multiple time scales combined with genetic and neuronal manipulations revealed how arousal states affect decision making. However, alternative interpretations should be considered and statistical methods should be justified. This work will be of interest to both neuroscientists and ecologists.</p>

<p>Genetic, physiological, and environmental manipulations that increase roaming increase leaving rates. The connection between increased roaming and increased leaving is lost when tax4-expressing sensory neurons are inactivated. This study is conceptually important in its characterization of worm behaviors as time-series of discrete states, a promising framework for understanding behavioral decisions as algorithms that govern state transitions. This framework is well-established in other animals, thanks to Berman and others, but relatively new to worms.</p>
<p>A key discovery is that lawn leaving behavior is probabilistically favored in states of behavioral arousal. I like the use of response-triggered averages (triggered on leaving events) that illustrate a &quot;state-dependent receptive field&quot; of the behavioral response. Response-triggered averages are common in sensory neuroscience, used, for example, to characterize the diverse &quot;stimulus-dependent receptive fields&quot; of different retinal ganglion cell types. It's nice to adapt the idea to illustrate the state-dependence of behavioral state transitions.</p>
<p>The simplest metric of arousal state is crawling speed. When animals crawl faster, they are more likely to leave lawns. A more sophisticated metric of behavioral context is whether the animal is in a &quot;roaming&quot; or &quot;dwelling&quot; state, two-state HMM modeling from previous work (Flavell et al., 2013). Roaming animals are more likely to leave lawns than dwelling animals. Different autoregressive HMM tools can segment worm behavior into 4-states. Also with ARHMMs, the most aroused state is again the state that promotes lawn-leaving.</p>
<p>(With the AR-HMM, I have a small quibble in its characterization as &quot;orthogonal&quot; to the 2-state HMM. Orthogonal has a precise mathematical meaning, but here orthogonal is taken loosely to only mean &quot;very different&quot;. I'd prefer the authors just call them &quot;very different&quot; and not use mathematical terms so loosely.)</p>
<p>HMM analysis seems to disentangle effects that were lumped by the simpler metric of overall speed. Crawling speed before lawn leaving events, when analyzed only within roaming periods, is only higher for ¡1 min before the event. I presume that the higher speed that is observed for several minutes before lawn leaving when all states are taken into account (e.g., Fig 1J, Fig 2A, and others) reflects the tendency to be in the faster roaming state than the slower dwelling state for several minutes before lawn leaving? If this is correct, it would be nice for the authors to be explicit about this interpretation, to help the reader understand what is going on.</p>
<p>My principal worry is about the possible artifact if worms are more likely to be at lawn boundaries when moving quickly or in an arousal state (roaming in the 2-state HMM or in state 3 in the AR-HMM)? Lawn-leaving events only occur when the animal is at lawn boundaries. If animals are more likely to be at lawn boundaries when aroused, this should artificially increase the likelihood that these states precede lawn-leaving behaviors for a trivial environment-dependent reason instead of their interesting internal state-dependent reason. The authors might consider trying to disentangle the state-dependent statistics of lawn edge proximity when assessing by how much arousal states precede lawn-leaving events. I realize this is could be a formidable analytical challenge.</p>
<p>One recourse is to align speed, HMM, and AR-HMM states to the other behavioral events that only happen at lawn boundaries. When they do this for head poke-reversals in Figure 2-supplement 3, they also observe an (albeit modest) increase in arousal states before head poke-reversals. It should be easy to also compare what happens with head poke-forward and head poke-pause to better understand potential artifacts in quantifying edge-associated events. In any case, this concern and their strategies to address it should be discussed for clarity and transparency.</p>
<p>The authors use diverse environmental, genetic, and optogenetic perturbations to regulate the roaming state, thereby regulating the statistics of leaving in the expected manner. One surprise is that feeding inhibition evokes roaming and lawn-leaving in both pdfr-1 and tph-1 mutants, even though the tph-1-expressing NSM neurons have been shown to sense bacterial ingestion and food availability. I'm curious, is there anything in these new results that is inconsistent with previous claims by Rhoades et al., 2019, or did Rhoades et al. simply not do these tests?</p>
<p>Another surprise is that evoking roaming does not evoke leaving in tax-4 mutants (which is something of an internal control that argues against the worry that roaming artificially increases the likelihood of leaving, see above). Without sensory neuron activity, worms are only more likely to roam for a minute before leaving rather than roaming for several minutes before leaving like wild-type (Figure 6C). ASJ seems to be the most important sensory neuron in this coupling between roaming and leaving (which is uncoupled when sensory neurons are inactivated).</p>
<p>I'm a little puzzled why the wild-type animals shown in Figure 6C show elevated roaming for several minutes before leaving events, whereas the wild-type animals shown in Figures 4I,J,K show elevated roaming for only about a minute, not much different than tax-4 mutants. Am I missing something? What is different about these different wild-type animals?</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Scheer and Bargmann investigate how behavioral arousal state affects foraging decisions in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Previous work has shown that when placed on a lawn of bacterial food, <italic>C. elegans</italic> spontaneously switch between two behavioral states, termed roaming and dwelling, during which they exploit or explore the food environment, respectively. It has also been shown that animals spontaneously leave bacterial lawns depending on factors such as food quality or mate availability.</p>
<p>Here, the authors use quantitative behavioral analyses to describe in unprecedented detail the various behavioral choices animals make when encountering the lawn edge. They report that leaving the lawn is a rare outcome compared to other choices such as pausing or reversing back into the lawn. It occurs predominantly out of the roaming state and has a characteristic preceding fast crawling profile. They developed a refined analysis method, the result of which suggests that the arousal state of animals on food can be described by a 4-state behavior (as opposed to the 2-state roaming - dwelling classification); leaving the lawn occurs predominantly from &quot;state 3&quot;, which corresponds to the highest level of arousal during roaming. They further show that various manipulations, such as optogenetic inhibition of feeding, stimulation of RIB neurons, or mutations of neuromodulator pathways, all of which have previously been reported to affect crawling speed and/or roaming/dwelling, maintain the coupling between roaming states and leaving, suggesting a dedicated mechanism for coupling leaving to the roaming state. Finally, they use genetics to implicate chemosensory neurons as neuronal circuit elements mediating this coupling.</p>
<p>How arousal states affect decision making is an active area of neuroscience research; therefore, the current manuscript will impact the field beyond the small community of <italic>C. elegans</italic> researchers. Also, in the past, roaming/dwelling and leaving have been treated as independent behaviors; the current manuscript is very intriguing, demonstrating both the interconnectedness of different behavioral programs and the importance of the animal's behavioral context for specific decisions.</p>

<p>Scheer and Bargmann use a combination of computational and experimental approaches in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying the regulation of foraging decisions by the state of arousal. They showed that, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the decision to leave food substrates is linked to a high arousal state, roaming, and that an increase in speed at different timescale preceded the food leaving decisions. They found that mutants that exhibit increased roaming also leave food substrates more frequently and that both behaviors can be triggered if food intake is inhibited. They further identify a set of chemosensory neurons that express the transduction channel tax-4 that couple the roaming state and the food-leaving decisions. The authors postulate that these neurons integrate foraging decisions with behavioral states and internal feeding cues.</p>
<p>The strength of the paper relies on using quantitative and detailed behavioral analysis over multiple time scales in combination with the manipulation of genes and neurons to tackle the state-dependent control of behavioral decisions in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The evidence is convincing, the analysis rigorous, and the writing is clear and to the point.</p>
