<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Antibiotic resistance and tolerance present significant challenges in global healthcare, necessitating alternative strategies such as phage therapy. However, the rapid emergence of phage-resistant mutants poses a potential risk. Here, we investigated bacterial persistence against phages, characterized by heterogeneous survival, analogous to antibiotic persistence. We found that heat treatment enhanced persistence and increase bacterial survival under phage exposure, subsequently promoting the evolution of phage resistance. Further experiments demonstrated that heat stress leads to a reduction in envelope components, thereby inhibiting phage DNA injection. Additionally, this heat-induced reduction resulted in systematic alterations in envelope stress responses, rendering bacteria tolerant to the antibiotic polymyxin while making them hypersensitive to pH changes and immune clearance. Our findings provide novel insights into bacteria-phage interactions and highlight potential challenges in implementing phage therapy in clinical settings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to global public health, emphasizing the urgent need for innovative strategies to combat bacterial infections(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luong et al., 2020</xref>). Phage therapy has emerged as a promising alternative, yet the rapid emergence of phage-resistant bacterial mutants challenges its effectiveness(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oechslin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Salmond &amp; Fineran, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Strathdee et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond resistance, antibiotic tolerance presents a critical concern, enabling bacteria to survive high concentrations of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balaban et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>), which can further promote the evolution of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Levin-Reisman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Levin-Reisman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). This raises an important question: Could analogous persistence and tolerance arise in response to phage infections, thereby contributing to the development of phage resistance?</p>

<title>Bacterial Persistence Against Phage Infection</title>
<p>To address this question, we investigated the killing dynamics of <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> under treatment with the lytic phage Kp11 (GenBank: ON148528.1). In analogy with the concept of antibiotic persistence, the majority of bacteria were rapidly eliminated following lytic phage treatment, while a small fraction (~10<sup>−5</sup> to 10<sup>−6</sup>) survived, resulting in a bi-phasic killing curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). However, the bacteria survived likely comprised both persisters and resistant mutants. To quantitatively distinguish between resisters and persisters, colonies of surviving bacteria post-phage treatment were individually plated on media with and without phage. The fraction of persisters was estimated by subtracting the number of resisters from the total colony-forming units (CFU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a, 1b</xref>). Subsequent killing experiments on the descendants of persisters revealed a comparable survival fraction to the ancestral population, suggesting that this survival was not attributable to genetic mutation but rather to phenotypic heterogeneity, i.e., phage persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

<p>Canonical antibiotic persistence is characterized by an extended lag time or slow growth rate(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>). However, previous studies showed that the high antibiotic persistence <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain <italic>hipA7</italic> did not exhibit enhanced survival when exposed to lytic phages compared to its sensitive ancestor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pearl et al., 2008</xref>). As there currently lacked a well-defined high persistence variant of <italic>K. pneumoniae,</italic> we turned to the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain <italic>KLY</italic> and its high-persistence derivative <italic>metG*</italic> and challenged these two well-studied strains with T4 phage, which was known for its lytic activity against <italic>E. coli</italic>. The observed similar survival rates suggested that increased lag time does not confer protection against phage infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Supplementary Fig.SI</xref>).</p>

<title>Phage tolerance induced by heat stress</title>
<p>Given that antibiotic persistence can be triggered by stresses such as starvation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Betts et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nguyen et al., 2011</xref>), we explored whether phage persistence might similarly be affected or not. <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was subjected to various stress conditions prior to phage treatment. Remarkably, pre-treatment at elevated temperatures significantly reduced <italic>K. pneumonia’s</italic> susceptibility to lytic phage infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>). Killing assays revealed that heat-treated bacteria exhibited a reduced killing rate following phage exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b</xref>), with effects being both time- and temperature-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Supplementary Fig.S2</xref>). Moreover, infection curves indicated that heat-treated bacteria relapsed more frequently, suggesting a higher probability of resistance mutant emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>

Quantitative analysis further demonstrated a significantly higher fraction of dividing cells in the heat-treated group under phage pressure compared to untreated bacteria.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="5339906v2_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tif" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>To determine whether heat treatment directly conferred increased phage resistance or not, we quantified the fraction of phage-resistant mutants before and after heat treatment. Our analysis revealed a negligible presence of resistant mutants in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref>). Consistent with this, mutation rates estimated using Delbrück-Luria tests(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Luria &amp; Delbruck, 1943</xref>) confirmed no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref>). Furthermore, although the survival rate of heat-treated bacteria substantially increased after 2 hours of phage infection, the proportion of phage-resistant mutants remined comparatively small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref>). These findings indicated that the enhanced defense against phage infection observed following heat treatment was not due to an increase in phage-resistant mutants, but rather reflected a phenotypic boost in survival analogous to antibiotic persistence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the observed increase in resistance frequency is due to the cumulative effect of a net increase in survival, similar to how antibiotic tolerance promotes resistance.</p>
<p>Inspired by this concept, we conducted experiments using a very small bacterial inoculum (~10<sup>3</sup>) to minimize the impact of preexisting spontaneous resistant mutants, ensuring that any observed resistance would stem from division during phage infection. As expected, untreated bacteria were completely eradicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>), whereas turbidity was observed in wells containing heat-treated bacteria co-cultured with lytic phages, indicating the emergence of resistance mutants during treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2f</xref>).</p>
<p>Microscopic observations further revealed that heat-treated bacteria could divide under phage pressure, while untreated bacteria were lysed by phages before dividing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2g</xref> and <xref ref-type="suppl" rid="data1">Movie 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="suppl" rid="data2">2</xref>). This indicates that the tolerance induced by heat treatment facilitates the emergence and evolution of phage resistance, as heat-treated bacteria underwent more division events under phage pressure, ultimately increasing the likelihood of developing phage resistance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Levin-Reisman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Heat-Induced Phage Tolerance challenges phage therapy</title>
<p>We next assessed the infection of <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> by phages Kp7, Kp9, Kp10, and Kp11, as well as <italic>E. coli</italic> by phages T1 and T4, following pre-heat treatment.

<p>Phage therapy often involves combining multiple phages to minimize the risk of resistance evolution(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chan &amp; Abedon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Leon &amp; Bastias, 2015</xref>). In light of this, we extended our investigation to phage combinations and found that heat-treated bacteria exhibited reduced sensitivity even to combined phage treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>). Notably, we identified a Kp7-resistant strain, <italic>R<sup>Kp7</sup></italic>, which remained susceptible to Kp11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Supplementary Fig.S4a</xref>) and was also sensitive to the combination of Kp7 and Kp11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Supplementary Fig.S4b</xref>). This approved the effectiveness of combination therapy against spontaneous resistance-conferring mutations to a single phage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Leon &amp; Bastias, 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, however, post heat-treatment, the combination had a much higher propensity to fail due to the evolution of resistance to both phages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3d</xref>). These findings highlight the necessity of considering phage tolerance as a crucial factor in the design of effective phage therapies.</p>

<title>Reduced Phage DNA Entry and Altered Envelope Stress Response in Heat-Treated Bacteria</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanisms underlying phage tolerance in heat-treated bacteria, we first focused on the early stages of phage infection: adsorption and DNA injection. Our analysis revealed that heat treatment did not alter the phage adsorption rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4a</xref>). Additionally, the production and structure of the bacterial capsule, the primary receptor for phage Kp11, remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Supplementary Fig.S5</xref>). However, we observed a significant impairment in the entry of phage DNA into heat-treated bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4b</xref>), suggesting a hindrance in the DNA injection process.</p>

</fig>
<p>To explore this further, we employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) for total protein analysis and identified that the down-regulated proteins were predominantly associated with the bacterial envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4c, 4d</xref>). In addition to a primary receptor, phages typically require a secondary receptor, often an outer membrane component(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sueki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sun et al., 2006</xref>), to establish adsorption and initiate DNA injection. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that heat treatment may induce the loss or modification of certain envelope components, thereby inhibiting phage DNA injection and contributing to heat-induced phage tolerance.</p>
<p>The bacterial envelope serves as a barrier against environmental stresses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dehinwal et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mitchell &amp; Silhavy, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Silhavy et al., 2010</xref>).We noticed that heat stress influenced not only the components mediating phage infection but also broader bacterial envelope dynamics, suggesting that overall envelope stress responses could be altered(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eberlein et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate this, we examined the response of heat-treated bacteria to various envelope stresses, including unfavorable conditions such as pH changes and exposure to toxic compounds (metals, bile salts, and polymyxins), and found substantial changes in susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Interestingly, heat-treated bacteria exhibited increased survival against polymyxins, similar to phage tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4e</xref>). Notably, heat-treated bacteria showed significantly reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, known to mediate polymyxin adsorption(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yin et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4f</xref>). Further experiments using the LPS inhibitor CHIR-090 confirmed that bacterial survival under polymyxin treatment increased with LPS reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4g</xref>). Given that polymyxin is a last-resort antibiotic for treating carbapenem-resistant <italic>K. pneumoniae,</italic> this crosstolerance with phages might present a significant challenge to already scarce treatment options.</p>

<title>Phage Resistance in Heat-Evolved pspA Mutant</title>
<p>Heat treatment enhances bacterial tolerance to lytic phages, prompting us to investigate whether mutants surviving heat treatment could also withstand subsequent phage infections or not. To address this, we conducted a serial evolutionary experiment under selective heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5a</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous reports have demonstrated that antibiotic persistence confers a distinct advantage to lysogenic phages but does not protect bacteria from lytic phages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Pearl et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we identified bacterial persistence against lytic phages, where bacteria survived extended phage treatment without developing resistant mutations. This introduces a novel strategy for bacterial defense against phages. Notably, our research revealed that heat stress enhances phage tolerance, subsequently promoting the emergence of resistance, aligned with observations in antibiotic research(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Balaban et aL, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Levin-Reisman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Levin-Reisman et aL, 2017</xref>). This parallel emphasizes the necessity of cautious and strategic design of phage therapy.</p>
<p>Heat, as a universal stress, induces protein misfolding and aggregation, despite the activation of heat shock proteins that mitigate these effects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Feder &amp; Hofmann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mogk et aL, 2019</xref>). The accumulation of misfolded envelope proteins can become toxic, leading to cell death(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Balchin et aL, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Konovalova et aL, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Takai et aL, 1998</xref>). Correspondingly, the relatively low efficiency of translocation and assembly of envelope proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bakkes et aL, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dalbey &amp; Kuhn, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vigh et aL, 2007</xref>) renders them more vulnerable under heat treatment(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Schiffrin et aL, 2017</xref>), resulting in a decrease in abundance. This reduction in envelope protein might be an adaptive response to elevated temperatures, as evidenced by the observations following heat treatment. Consequently, this would lead to a decrease in phage receptors (such as capsule and outer membrane protein FhuA) and the receptor for polymyxin (LPS), thereby conferring tolerance.</p>
<p>This phenomenon may also occur in the heat-tolerant mutant <italic>pspA</italic>*, where the reduction in envelope components resulted in insusceptibility to phages and polymyxins, highlighting a potential regulatory balance governed by PspA. PspA, a key regulator in the phage shock protein system, functions as part of the envelope stress response system in bacteria, preventing membrane depolarization and ensuring the envelope stability(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Flores-Kim &amp; Darwin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Horstman &amp; Darwin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kleerebezem &amp; Tommassen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yamaguchi et aL, 2010</xref>). Recent studies have shown that PspA is analogous to ESCRT-III, a component of the ESCRT machinery in eukaryotic cells, which plays a crucial role in membrane remodeling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu et al., 2021</xref>),(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Junglas et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The bacterial envelope acts both as a defense barrier against external stresses and as a conduit for invaders. While it reduces the invasion of harmful substances and maintains intra-extracellular balance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Raivio, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wood, 2015</xref>), it also provides contacts for invaders; for example, capsules serve as receptors for phages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Latka et al., 2021</xref>), and LPS interacts with polymyxins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Manioglu et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, heat-induced alteration to the envelope could be a double-edged sword. Clinically, heat stress would not only impact phage susceptibility but also alters the interaction between <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and the host immune system. This dual impact underscores the complexity of bacterial adaptive responses and suggests that environmental factors can significantly influence the outcome of phage therapy. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to acidic conditions and bile salts induced by heat stress challenges bacterial survival, particularly relevant to <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> colonization sites in the human body(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gasink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, the envelope stress responses induced by heat in bacteria lead us to consider the role of fever. We found that heat-induced phage tolerance is both time- and temperature-dependent; even moderately elevated temperatures, such as 42°C, can induce phage tolerance with prolonged treatment, indicating alterations in the bacterial envelope. This suggests that elevated body temperature, akin to fever, may affect bacterial survival and colonization by modulating their responses to the host immune system and antimicrobial agents.</p>

Bacteria in each well were incubated with phages at a various MOI for 24 hours. Given the exceptionally low total bacterial load utilized in this experiment, the potential for phage-resistant bacteria due to stochastic mutations would be minimized. The high MOI guaranteed that each bacterium was likely to be infected by at least one phage particle.

<caption><title>Untreated bacteria were lysed by phages before cell division could occur.</title>
<p>Shown is the rapid lysis of untreated <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC43816 infected with phage Kp11 at an MOI of 100. The bacteria are lysed before they can undergo cell division, demonstrating the efficiency of phage-induced lysis at this infection level. Watch as bacteria are quickly disrupted following phage exposure.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Heat-treated bacteria were able to undergo cell division despite exposure to the lytic phage.</title>
<p>Shown is the infection of heat-treated <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC43816 by phage Kp11 at an MOI of 100. Unlike the untreated bacteria, these bacterial cells can be observed undergoing division before lysis occurs. The delayed lysis highlights the increased tolerance of heat-treated bacteria to phage infection under similar conditions. This increased frequency for bacterial division facilitates the evolution of phage resistance, highlighting the impact of heat treatment on bacterial survival under phage infection.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this interesting and original paper, the authors examine the effect that heat stress can have on the ability of bacterial cells to evade infection by lytic bacteriophages. Briefly, the authors show that heat stress increases the tolerance of Klebsiella pneumoniae to infection by the lytic phage Kp11. They also argue that this increased tolerance facilitates the evolution of genetically encoded resistance to the phage. In addition, they show that heat can reduce the efficacy of phage therapy. Moreover, they define a likely mechanistic reason for both tolerance and genetically encoded resistance. Both lead to a reorganization of the bacterial cell envelope, which reduces the likelihood that phage can successfully inject their DNA.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I found large parts of this paper well-written and clearly presented. I also found many of the experiments simple yet compelling. For example, the experiments described in Figure 3 clearly show that prior heat exposure can affect the efficacy of phage therapy. In addition, the experiments shown in Figures 4 and 6 clearly demonstrate the likely mechanistic cause of this effect. The conceptual Figure 7 is clear and illustrates the main ideas well. I think this paper would work even without its central claim, namely that tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance. The reason is that the effect of environmental stressors on stress tolerance has to my knowledge so far only been shown for drug tolerance, not for tolerance to an antagonistic species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I did not detect any weaknesses that would require a major reorganization of the paper, or that may require crucial new experiments. However, the paper needs some work in clarifying specific and central conclusions that the authors draw. More specifically, it needs to improve the connection between what is shown in some figures, how these figures are described in the caption, and how they are discussed in the main text. This is especially glaring with respect to the central claim of the paper from the title, namely that tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance. I am sympathetic to that claim, especially because this has been shown elsewhere, not for phage resistance but for antibiotic resistance. However, in the description of the results, this is perhaps the weakest aspect of the paper, so I'm a bit mystified as to why the authors focus on this claim. As I mentioned above, the paper could stand on its own even without this claim.</p>
<p>More specific examples where clarification is needed:</p>
<p>(1) A key figure of the paper seems to be Figure 2D, yet it was one of the most confusing figures. This results from a mismatch between the accompanying text starting on line 92 and the figure itself. The first thing that the reader notices in the figure itself is the huge discrepancy between the number of viable colonies in the absence of phage infection at the two-hour time point. Yet this observation is not even mentioned in the main text. The exclusive focus of the main text seems to be on the right-hand side of the figure, labeled &quot;+Phage&quot;. It is from this right-hand panel that the authors seem to conclude that heat stress facilitates the evolution of resistance. I find this confusing, because there is no difference between the heat-treated and non-treated cells in survivorship, and it is not clear from this data that survivorship is caused by resistance, not by tolerance/persistence. (The difference between tolerance and resistance has only been shown in the independent experiments of Figure 1B.) Figure 2F supports the resistance claim, but it is not one of the strongest experiments of the paper, because the author simply only used &quot;turbidity&quot; as an indicator of resistance. In addition, the authors performed the experiments described therein at small population sizes to avoid the presence of resistance mutations. But how do we know that the turbidity they describe does not result from persisters?</p>
<p>I see three possibilities to address these issues. First, perhaps this is all a matter of explaining and motivating this particular experiment better. Second, the central claim of the paper may require additional experiments. For example, is it possible to block heat induced tolerance through specific mutations, and show that phage resistance does not evolve as rapidly if tolerance is blocked? A third possibility is to tone down the claim of the paper, and make it about heat tolerance rather than the evolution of heat resistance.</p>
<p>A minor but general point here is that in Figure 2D and in other figures, the labels &quot;-phage&quot; and &quot;+phage&quot; do not facilitate understanding, because they suggest that cells in the &quot;-phage&quot; treatment have not been exposed to phage at all, but that is not the case. They have survived previous phage treatment and are then replated on media lacking phage.</p>
<p>(2) Another figure with a mismatch between text and visual materials is Figure 5, specifically Figures 5B-F. The figure is about two different mutants, and it is not even mentioned in the text how these mutants were identified, for example in different or the same replicate populations. What is more, the two mutants are not discussed at all in the main text. That is, the text, starting on line 221 discusses these experiments as if there was only one mutant. This is especially striking as the two mutants behave very differently, as, for example, in Figure 5C. Implicitly, the text talks about the mutant ending in &quot;...C2&quot;, and not the one ending in &quot;...C1&quot;. To add to the confusion, the text states that the (C2) mutant shows a change in the pspA gene, but in Figure 5f, it is the other (undiscussed) mutant that has a mutation in this gene. Only pspA is discussed further, so what about the other mutants? More generally, it is hard to believe that these were the only mutants that occurred in the genome during experimental evolution. It would be useful to give the reader a 2-3 sentence summary of the genetic diversity that experimental evolution generated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>An initial screening of pretreatment with different stress treatments of K. pneumoniae allowed the identification of heat stress as a protection factor against the infection of the lytic phage Kp11. Then experiments prove that this is mediated not by an increase of phage-resistant bacteria but due to an increase in phage transient tolerant population, which the authors identified as bacteriophage persistence in analogy to antibiotic persistence. Then they proved that phage persistence mediated by heat shock enhanced the evolution of bacterial resistance against the phage. The same trait was observed using other lytic phages, their combinations, and two clinical strains, as well as E. coli and two T phages, hence the phenomenon may be widespread in enterobacteria.</p>
<p>Next, the elucidation of heat-induced phage persistence was done, determining that phage adsorption was not affected but phage DNA internalization was impaired by the heat pretreatment, likely due to alterations in the bacterial envelope, including the downregulation of envelope proteins and of LPS; furthermore, heat treated bacteria were less sensitive to polymyxins due to the decrease in LPS.</p>
<p>Finally, cyclic exposure to heat stress allowed the isolation of a mutant that was both resistant to heat treatment, polymyxins, and lytic phage, that mutant had alterations in PspA protein that allowed a gain of function and that promoted the reduction of capsule production and loss of its structure; nevertheless this mutant was severely impaired in immune evasion as it was easily cleared from mice blood, evidencing the tradeoffs between phage/heat and antibiotic resistance and the ability to counteract the immune response.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experimental design and the sequence in which they are presented are ideal for the understanding of their study and the conclusions are supported by the findings, also the discussion points out the relevance of their work particularly in the effectiveness of phage therapy, and allows the design of strategies to improve their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In its present form, it lacks the incorporation of some relevant previous work that explored the role of heat stress in phage susceptibility, antibiotic susceptibility, tradeoffs between phage resistance and resistance against other kinds of stress, virulence, etc., and the fact that exposure to lytic phages induces antibiotic persistence.</p>

<p>PspA, a key regulator in the phage shock protein system, functions as part of the envelope stress response system in bacteria, preventing membrane depolarization and ensuring the envelope stability. This protein has been associated in the Quorum Sensing network and biofilm formation. (Moscoso M., Garcia E., Lopez R. 2006. Biofilm formation by Streptococcus pneumoniae: role of choline, extracellular DNA, and capsular polysaccharide in microbial accretion. J. Bacteriol. 188:7785-7795; Vidal JE, Ludewick HP, Kunkel RM, Zähner D, Klugman KP. The LuxS-dependent quorum-sensing system regulates early biofilm formation by Streptococcus pneumoniae strain D39. Infect Immun. 2011 Oct;79(10):4050-60.)</p>
<p>It is interesting and very well-developed.</p>
<p>(1) Could the authors develop experiments about the relationship between Quorum Sensing and this protein?</p>
<p>(2) It would be interesting to analyze the link to phage infection and heat stress in relation to Quorum. The authors could study QS regulators or AI2 molecules.</p>
<p>(3) Include the proteins or genes in a table or figure from lytic phage Kp11 (GenBank: ON148528.1).</p>
