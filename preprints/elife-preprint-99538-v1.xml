<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background and Objectives</title>
<p>Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is generally thought to be neuroprotective, yet results have been inconsistent. Here, we present a comprehensive study of MHT use and brain characteristics in middle-to older aged females from the UK Biobank, assessing detailed MHT data, APOE ε4 genotype, and tissue-specific gray (GM) and white matter (WM) brain age gap (BAG), as well as hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A total of 19,846 females with magnetic resonance imaging data were included (current-users = 1,153, 60.1 ± 6.8 years; past-users = 6,681, 67.5 ± 6.2 years; never-users = 12,012, mean age 61.6 ± 7.1 years). For a sub-sample (n = 538), MHT prescription data was extracted from primary care records. Brain measures were derived from T1-, T2- and diffusion-weighted images. We fitted regression models to test for associations between the brain measures and MHT variables including user status, age at initiation, dosage and duration, formulation, route of administration, and type (i.e., bioidentical vs synthetic), as well as active ingredient (e.g., estradiol hemihydrate). We further tested for differences in brain measures among MHT users with and without a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy and examined associations by APOE ε4 status.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We found significantly higher GM and WM BAG (i.e., older brain age relative to chronological age) as well as smaller left and right hippocampus volumes in current MHT users, not past users, compared to never-users. Effects were modest, with the largest effect size indicating a group difference of 0.77 years (∼9 months) for GM BAG. Among MHT users, we found no significant associations between age at MHT initiation and brain measures. Longer duration of use and older age at last use post menopause was associated with higher GM and WM BAG, larger WMH volume, and smaller left and right hippocampal volumes. MHT users with a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy showed <italic>lower</italic> GM BAG relative to MHT users without such history. Although we found smaller hippocampus volumes in carriers of two APOE ε4 alleles compared to non-carriers, we found no interactions with MHT variables. In the sub-sample with prescription data, we found no significant associations between detailed MHT variables and brain measures after adjusting for multiple comparisons.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results indicate that population-level associations between MHT use, and female brain health might vary depending on duration of use and past surgical history. Future research is crucial to establish causality, dissect interactions between menopause-related neurological changes and MHT use, and determine individual-level implications to advance precision medicine in female health care.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ovarian hormones such as estrogens and progesterone fluctuate across the female lifespan with natural declines occurring at menopause, typically between the ages 45 and 55. The cessation of ovarian function during the menopausal transition has been linked to an array of neural changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, including a decline in brain glucose metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, reductions in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and increased amyloid-beta deposition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> as well as WM lesions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. In combination with other risk factors, these neural changes might foster the emergence of neurodegenerative diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is more often diagnosed in females relative to similarly aged males, with greater cognitive decline and neuropathological burden <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is commonly prescribed to minimize vasomotor symptoms occurring during the menopausal transition, and is generally thought to be neuroprotective, with a propensity to reduce the risk for AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and improve cognition later in life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, study results are equivocal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, reporting both positive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and negative outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. A 2021 study reported that reproductive history events signaling more estrogens exposure, including MHT use, were associated with greater gray matter volume in middle-aged females <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, in line with other neuroimaging studies suggesting a protective effect of MHT on GM, WM, and ventricle size <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Conversely, MHT use has also been associated with greater atrophy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> and higher rates of ventricular expansion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> in menopausal females. Similarly, in our previous UK Biobank study of ∼16,000 females <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we found positive associations between MHT use and older GM brain age, albeit with small effect sizes.</p>
<p>Besides mixed results in observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) such as the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS) suggest an increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline with MHT use. In detail, WHIMS found negative effects of prolonged oral administration of both conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) alone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, synthetic progestin) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> among females aged 65 years or older. Similarly, the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) showed an association between 4 years of CEE + MPA treatment and lower cognitive performance in older postmenopausal females (71 ± 6 years) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In contrast, administering CEE plus micronized progesterone in recently postmenopausal females did not alter cognition in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In summary, WHIMS, HERS, and KEEPS mainly relied on orally administered CEE in older-aged or recently postmenopausal females. These mixed findings raise the question of whether a combination of timing, formulation, and route of administration might play a crucial role in the effectiveness of MHT.</p>
<p>According to the ‘<italic>critical window hypothesis</italic>’, MHT might be neuroprotective if it is initiated close to menopause <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. For example, MHT initiation during perimenopause has been associated with improved memory and hippocampal function later in life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Although emerging evidence supports this hypothesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, oral CEE use in combination with MPA seems to increase the risk for AD regardless of timing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Similarly, systemic MHT (i.e. oral and transdermal use) has been associated with a 9-17% increased risk of AD in a Finish nationwide case-control study, independent of MHT formulation and timing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, vaginal estradiol use did not show such risk, indicating differential effects of route of administration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Vaginal as well as transdermal MHT formulations are mainly composed of estradiol, and CEE is a blend of compounds, mostly estrone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Both estrogens have different affinities to bind to estrogen receptors (ER): relative to estradiol, estrone is approximately 2/3 the affinity to ER-alpha, and about 1/3 to ER-beta <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and estrone is present at higher levels post-menopause than estradiol. Furthermore, contrary to oral use, vaginal and transdermal MHT formulations bypass hepatic metabolism, resulting in steady-state concentration of estradiol (estrone:estradiol ratio of 1:1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Hence, vaginal, or transdermal estradiol-based MHT formulations might be more effective than oral estrone-based types. For instance, Gleason and colleagues found that females exposed to oral CEE exhibited poorer memory performance than either MHT-naïve or estradiol-exposed individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In addition to estrogens, progestins are commonly added in non-hysterectomized females, and, like estrogens based MHT, progestins can be administered in different forms, e.g., norethisterone acetate (synthetic progestin), micronized progesterone (bioidentical), or MPA (synthetic progestin). These progestin forms have been linked to different side-effect profiles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and can antagonize the effects of estrogens in MHT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to the impact of MHT timing, formulation, and route of administration, effects of MHT on the female brain might be modulated by apolipoprotein ε type 4 (APOE ε4) genotype. Carried by 14% of the world’s population, the APOE ε4 allele is a known dose-dependent risk factor for late-onset AD. Yaffe and colleagues found that among non-carriers, current MHT use lowered the risk of cognitive impairment by almost half compared to never-users, while there was no such effect among carriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Results from the Nurses’ Health Study found that MHT use was associated with <italic>worse</italic> rates of decline in general cognition, especially among females with an APOE ε4 allele <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Conversely, we found no significant interactions between APOE ε4 genotype and MHT use on cognition in a 2023 UK Biobank study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We did however observe that earlier MHT initiation was linked to younger GM brain age, albeit weakly, only in APOE ε4 carriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, a 2024 UK Biobank study showed smaller brain volumes in MHT users compared to never-users, specifically among females with the APOE ε4/ε4 genotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Yet, the potential of APOE ε4 to modulate effects of MHT dosage, administration, and formulation on the female brain is largely unexplored.</p>
<p>In summary, emerging evidence suggests differential effects of MHT formulation, age at initiation, route of administration, and genotype on female brain and cognition. However, studies aiming to disentangle the effects of different MHT regimes are largely missing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In this observational study, we investigated associations between MHT variables, different MHT regimes, APOE ε4 status, and brain measures in middle to older-aged females from the UK Biobank cohort. MHT variables included user status (i.e. current users, past users, never users), age at initiation, dosage and duration, formulation, route of administration, and type (i.e., bioidentical vs synthetic) as well as active ingredient (e.g., estradiol hemihydrate). MHT regimes based on prescription data were extracted from primary care records (general practice). Brain measures included GM and WM brain age gap based on brain age prediction, hippocampal volumes, and total WM hyperintensity volume as proxy of vascular disease. These measures were chosen as they have been linked to both chronological and endocrine aging as well as MHT use in our studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>MRI data acquisition and processing</title>
<p>A detailed overview of the UK Biobank neuroimaging data acquisition and protocols has been published elsewhere <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Harmonized analysis pipelines were used to process raw T1-weighted MRI data for all participants (N = 20,540), including automated surface-based morphometry and subcortical segmentation (FreeSurfer, v5.3). To remove poor-quality data likely due to motion, participants with Euler numbers ≥ 4 standard deviations (SD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> below the mean were excluded (n = 180), yielding a total of 20,360 participants with T1-weighted MRI data (see <italic>Sample characteristics</italic> for final sample size).</p>
<p>In addition to the classic set of subcortical and cortical summary statistics from FreeSurfer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, we utilized a fine-grained cortical parcellation scheme <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> to extract cortical thickness, area, and volume for 180 regions of interest per hemisphere. This yielded a total set of 1,118 structural brain imaging features (360/360/360/38 for cortical thickness/area/volume, as well as cerebellar/subcortical and cortical summary statistics, respectively), that were used to predict global GM brain age. The T1-weighted MRI data was residualized with respect to scanning site and intracranial volume using linear models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. To probe hippocampal-specific effects separately <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, we used the extracted measures of left and right hippocampus volume as additional outcome measures in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>Diffusion-weighted MRI data were processed using an optimized diffusion pipeline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Metrics from four diffusion models were utilized to predict global WM brain age (see details <bold>supplementary Note 1</bold>). In total, 98 diffusion features were included (global mean values + tract values for each diffusion metric). The diffusion-weighted data passed TBSS post-processing quality control using the YTTRIUM algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> and were residualized with respect to scanning sites using linear models.</p>
<p>Total volume of WMH was derived from T1-weighted and T2-weighted images using BIANCA (FSL, v6.0); a fully automated, supervised method for WMH detection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Preprocessed volumes per participant were exported from the UK Biobank, Field ID: 25781, and log-transformed due to a left-skewed distribution. A total of 19,538 females had data to compute WMH.</p>

<title>Brain-age prediction</title>
<p>In line with our previous studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, tissue-specific age prediction models in females only were run using <italic>XGBoost</italic> regression, which is based on a decision-tree ensemble algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboos">https://github.com/dmlc/xgboos</ext-link>). Hyper-parameters were tuned in nested cross-validations using 5 inner folds for randomized search, and 10 outer folds for model validation. Predicted age estimates were derived using the Scikit-learn library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scikit-learn.org">https://scikit-learn.org</ext-link>), and brain age gap (BAG) values were calculated for each model (predicted – chronological age) to provide estimates of global GM BAG based on T1-weighted data, and global WM BAG based on diffusion-weighted data. The age prediction models were run without a subsample with ICD10 diagnosis known to impact the brain (n = 1,739, for details see <bold>supplementary Note 3</bold>), and then applied to the respective group of participants with diagnoses to obtain brain age estimates for the whole sample. This approach was selected to base the prediction models on normative age trajectories, while also including a more representative total sample (females both with and without diagnoses) in the subsequent analyses.</p>

<title>MHT-related variables</title>
<p>For the whole sample, general MHT data included user status (never-user, current-user, or past-user), age first started using MHT, age last used MHT, and duration of MHT use (age last used – age first used). In current MHT users, age at last use was set to their age at the imaging assessment to calculate duration of use.</p>
<p>For a sub-sample, prescription MHT data was extracted from primary care records (general practice, UK Biobank Field ID: 42039) using freely available <underline>code</underline> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. We extracted formulation (i.e., estrogens only, estrogens + progestins), route of administration (i.e., oral, transdermal, vaginal, injection), and daily drug dosage (mg) from the trade names/active ingredients indicated by the treating general practitioner and duration of use (weeks) was calculated based on prescription dates. Trade names were verified using the UK Product compendium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc">https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc</ext-link>). MHT formulations were further separated into bioidentical &amp; synthetic, and progestins were stratified by generation (i.e., 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> generation), based on their chemical structures, receptor binding properties, and clinical characteristics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Although all hormones in MHTs are chemically synthesized, bioidentical hormones are structurally identical to the hormones naturally produced in the human body, whereas synthetic hormones are not. It is debated whether bioidentical and synthetic hormones might have different risk profiles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Drug duplicates, meaning the same drug issued on the same date per participant, were excluded. Individuals who switched between regimes were labeled as mixed (see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Individuals who took MHT after the imaging assessment, based on MHT prescription dates, were excluded (n = 6). In total, 538 participants had both detailed MHT and imaging data, and complete data on key demographic variables such as age, education, and menopausal status (see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Females who had missing data, or had responded “do not know”, “prefer not to answer”, “none of the above” or similar for any of the relevant variables, were excluded for the respective analyses. If possible and appropriate, missing data at the imaging time point was replaced with valid data from the baseline assessment. This was the case for the following variables: MHT user status, history of hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, and menopausal status.

<p>First, we tested for associations between MHT user status (never-user/user) and GM and WM BAG, left and right hippocampus volume, and WMH volume. We further tested whether current and past MHT use, relative to never-use, was associated with the brain measures.</p>
<p>Second, among all MHT users, we assessed associations between age at first use as well as duration of use and brain measures. Among past MHT users, we tested for associations between age at last use and brain measures. In postmenopausal MHT users, we also tested whether age at first and last use in relation to age at menopause (i.e., age started MHT – age at menopause; age last use MHT – age at menopause, respectively) was associated with the brain measures. The following regression models (<italic>lm</italic> function) were fitted for these analyses, with DV representing each MRI measure (i.e., GM BAG, WM BAG, left and right hippocampus volumes, WMH volume) as dependent variable and IV representing each MHT variable (i.e., MHT user status, age at first use, age at last use, duration of use), as independent variable:

The chosen covariates are known to influence MHT use and brain structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. The lifestyle score was calculated using a published formula <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, and included data on sleep, physical activity, nutrition, smoking, and alcohol consumption (see supplementary <bold>Note 3</bold>).

Note that Model 1 was not adjusted for menopause status in the analyses only including postmenopausal MHT users. To test for differences in brain measures between MHT users with a history of hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy (+/- hysterectomy, proxy of surgical menopause) relative to MHT users without such surgeries, we ran additional regression models within the sample of MHT users using the same model as specified above (model 1).</p>

<p>First, we tested whether MHT formulation (i.e., estrogens-only, estrogens + progestins, none) and route of administration (i.e., oral, transdermal, vaginal, injections, mixed, none) was associated with brain measures. Never-users (dummy-coded as “none”) served as a reference group.

For these analyses, we only included age, education, and menopause status as covariates to retain the largest possible sample size (n = 538; see ‘Sensitivity Analyses’ for follow-up analyses including history of hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy as an additional covariate).</p>
<p>In estrogens-only users, we tested whether different active ingredients (i.e., estradiol valerate, estradiol hemihydrate, CEE, estradiol, mixed, none) and bioidentical or synthetic estrogens forms were associated with brain measures, relative to never-users as dummy-coded reference group. We further assessed whether duration of estrogens use (weeks), and estrogens drug dosage was associated with brain measures among estrogens-only users. We used the same model as specified above (model 2).</p>
<p>In estrogens + progestin users, we also explored whether different active ingredients were associated with brain measures, relative to never-users (see model 2). For this analysis, we only included formulations with N &gt;= 10 (see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). We further tested whether bioidentical or synthetic MHT or a mix of both, and progestin generations (i.e., 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup>) were associated with brain measures, relative to never-users (see model 2). Third progestin generation users (n = 1) were excluded. Among estrogens + progestin users, we further assessed whether duration of estrogens/progestin use (weeks) and drug dosage of estrogens/progestin was differently associated with brain measures. For these models, the estrogens/progestin measures (i.e., duration of use or drug dosage) were included in the same model. The covariates specified in model 2 were included.</p>

<title>Sensitivity Analyses</title>
<p>To test whether the results were influenced by the inclusion of participants with ICD-10 diagnosis, the main analyses (models 1-2) were re-run excluding the sub-sample with diagnosed brain disorders (see supplementary <bold>Note 3</bold>). In addition, we re-ran the analyses for MHT formulation and route of administration (Model 2) adjusting for a history of hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy in addition to age, BMI, and lifestyle score (n = 460). Since estrogens only MHTs are commonly prescribed after hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy, we included surgical history as a covariate instead of excluding participants with a surgical history.</p>
<p>To adjust for the potential influence of extreme values on our results, we assessed each continuous MHT variable (i.e., age at first use, age at last use, age at menopause) for extreme values using a data-driven approach and excluded the corresponding participants before re-running the respective main analyses (model 1). To identify extreme values, we applied the median absolute deviation (MAD) method (R package <italic>Routliers</italic>), using default settings (i.e., a MAD threshold of ± 3).</p>
<p>For relevant analyses, the subsample with prescription MHT data was compared to all available never-users, to allow for a large and representative control group. However, to assess whether the results were sensitive to the control group selection, we matched the prescription MHT data sample (n = 538) to an equally sized subsample of never-users (n = 538), using genetic matching without replacement (<italic>matchit</italic> R package). Genetic matching is a form of nearest neighbor matching where distances are computed as the generalized Mahalanobis distance. The generalization of the Mahalanobis distance is achieved with a scaling factor for each covariate that represents the importance of that covariate to the distance. The groups were matched based on the covariates used in model 2, namely age, education, and menopause status. In the matched sample, for analyses comparing users relative to never-users, model 2 was rerun adjusting only for age.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study assessed detailed MHT data, APOE ε4 genotype, and brain characteristics in a large, population-based sample of females in the UK. The results showed significantly higher GM and WM BAG (older brain age relative to chronological age) as well as smaller left and right hippocampus volumes in current MHT users, but not in past users, compared to never-users. Among MHT users, we found no significant associations between age at MHT initiation, alone and in relation to age at menopause, and brain measures. However, older age at last use after age at menopause was associated with higher GM and WM BAG, higher WMH volume, and lower left and right hippocampal volumes. Similar associations were found for longer duration of MHT use. MHT users with a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy showed <italic>lower</italic> GM BAG relative to MHT users without such history. In the sub-sample with prescription data, we found no significant associations between detailed MHT variables, such as MHT formulation, route of administration, type, active ingredients, and dosage, and brain measures, after FDR correction. Lastly, although we found lower right hippocampus volumes in carriers of two APOE ε4 alleles relative to non-carriers, we found no interactions with MHT variables after FDR correction.</p>
<p>Current MHT users showed higher GM and WM BAG as well as lower left and right hippocampus volumes relative to never-users. The effects were robust but relatively modest in magnitude, with the largest effect size indicating a group difference of 0.77 years (∼9 months) for GM BAG (standardized β=0.218, <bold>Table S3</bold>). However, we found no significant differences in brain measures in past MHT users relative to never-users. Current MHT users were significantly younger than past- and never-users, and around 67 % were menopausal relative to over 80% in the past- and never-user groups. These age and menopausal status differences indicate that a larger proportion of current users might be in the perimenopausal phase, which is often associated with debilitating neurological and vasomotor symptoms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. MHT is commonly prescribed to minimize such symptoms. Although MHT initiation during perimenopause has been associated with improved memory and hippocampal function, as well as lower AD risk later in life <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, the need for MHT might in itself be an indicator of neurological changes; here potentially reflected in higher BAG and lower hippocampal volumes. After the transition to menopause, symptoms might subside and some perimenopausal brain changes might revert or stabilize in the postmenopausal phase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Although the UK Biobank lacks detailed information on menopausal symptoms and perimenopausal staging, our results might be capturing subtle disturbances during perimenopause that later stabilize. This could explain why the largely postmenopausal groups of past MHT users and never-users present with lower</p>
<p>GM and WM BAG than the current user group. Considering the critical window hypothesis emphasizing perimenopause as a key phase for MHT action <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, future longitudinal studies are crucial to clarify the interplay between neurological changes and MHT use across the menopause transition.</p>
<p>Besides age-related differences, the current user group also showed a significantly unhealthier lifestyle and higher rates of bilateral oophorectomy compared to the never-user group and the past-user group, respectively. These findings are contrary to the healthy user bias hypothesis (i.e., equating MHT use with healthy user status <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>), and might indicate that the current user group could be exposed to neurological changes prior to MHT use. According to the healthy cell bias hypothesis of estrogen action <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, MHT use might be detrimental for brain health when initiated after cells are exposed to neurological degeneration. Although MHT use might have exacerbated adverse brain changes in the unhealthier group of current users, higher BAG was also linked to longer duration of MHT use and older age at last use post menopause. Although the effect sizes were modest (<bold>Table S3</bold>), these findings might reflect subtle yet unfavorable effects of MHT on brain health in our sample, particularly when used continuously after natural menopause with uterus and ovaries still intact (i.e., all females with hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy were excluded from this analysis).</p>
<p>To the contrary, MHT users with a history of hysterectomy ± bilateral oophorectomy showed <italic>lower</italic> GM BAG relative to MHT users without such history, and we found larger hippocampal volumes in MHT users with a hysterectomy without a bilateral oophorectomy. Previous work associates these surgical interventions with accelerated cognitive decline <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, increased risk of dementia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, morphological changes in regions of the medial temporal lobe <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, and accumulation of Alzheimer’s disease pathology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. However, some of these studies relied on comparing surgery to no surgery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> without taking MHT use into account <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, or investigated the effect of surgery with MHT relative to surgery without MHT. For instance, a 2023 study highlighted that estrogen-only use in females with hysterectomy was associated with increased dementia rates relative to females with hysterectomy who never used MHT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. In the current study, we specifically compared the effect of MHT use on brain measures among females with and without surgical history and found lower GM BAG in the surgical MHT user group. These findings might be explained by differences in indication of MHT use for females with and without surgery, MHT formulation, and age at surgery. Without surgery, MHT use (i.e., often combined MHT formulation) is prescribed in females with intact uterus and ovaries to minimize menopausal symptoms that are largely neurological in nature, such as vasomotor symptoms as well as mood, cognitive, and sleep disturbances <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. After hysterectomy, estrogen only MHT might be prescribed but is not strictly needed as ovaries are still intact. Whereas after bilateral oophorectomy (= surgical menopause), combined or estrogen only MHT is indicated to compensate for the acute and chronic deficiency of hormones normally produced by the ovaries. These distinctions might entail important differences in risk and side-effect profiles of estrogen only or combined MHT in females with and without endogenous sex hormone production. It is also possible that the timing between MHT use and surgery is more tightly controlled and therefore more beneficial for brain aging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, our study also showed group differences in several demographic and MHT-related variables which might influence the results. For instance, the hysterectomy MHT user group was significantly older than the non-surgery and bilateral oophorectomy group, started MHT at a younger age than the non-surgery group, and had surgery at a younger age than the bilateral oophorectomy group. More research is needed to disentangle this complex interplay of MHT effects in females with and without intact uteri and ovaries.</p>
<p>No significant associations were observed between brain measures and MHT regimes based on prescription data. However, given the relatively small sample size and the large number of comparisons, it is possible that we were unable to detect subtle effects of factors such as MHT formulation, route of administration, type, active ingredients, and dosage. Before FDR correction, we found higher WM BAG in estrogens + progestin users, in CEE + MPA users, and in mixed active ingredients users relative to never-users. In addition, WMH volume was higher among oral MHT users and lower with longer duration of estrogens use in estrogens-only users relative to never-users. These uncorrected results are partly in line with previous findings. For instance, the 2003 Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study reported that prolonged oral use of both CEE alone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, or combined with MPA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, increased the risk of dementia and cognitive decline among females aged 65 years and older. Contrarily, prolonged use of estrogen only MHT has been linked to reduced white matter loss in aging (n = 10) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Similar to our findings, Ha and colleagues did not find an association between gray matter volumes and estrogen use <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Although uncorrected results must be interpreted with caution, our findings might indicate an unfavorable effect of mixed active ingredient use, including CEE ± MPA and oral administration, on white matter brain aging. This effect might be due to the higher estrone concentrations associated with such oral estrone-based MHT types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. In addition, over 50% of combined MHT user had mixed MHT use which suggests that it might be beneficial to examine the reasons for switching of medication. In sum, these findings highlight the need for personalized MHT regimes, and longitudinal RCTs are needed to establish how different MHT regimes, and their respective hormonal profiles are causally linked to brain aging.</p>
<p>In the current study, we found significantly smaller right hippocampus volumes in carriers of two APOE ε4 alleles relative to non-carriers, which is in line with previous work linking the APOE ε4 genotype to greater rates of hippocampal atrophy in non-demented and Alzheimer’s disease samples <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. However, after FDR correction, we did not find any interactions between APOE ε4 carrier status and MHT variables in relation to the brain measures. This finding was unexpected, as previous work has highlighted the APOE ε4 genotype as a crucial determinant of MHT effects on the female brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. For instance, one study associated MHT use with improved memory performance and larger entorhinal and amygdala volumes in female ε4 carriers versus non-carriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. A 2023 prospective longitudinal study showed that MHT was associated with smaller changes towards Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology than non-therapy and that APOE ε4 carrier status was linked to an amplified treatment outcome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. However, contrary results have also been reported. For instance, Yaffe and colleagues found lower risk of cognitive decline with estrogen only MHT use among female APOE ε4 non-carriers, but there was no such effect among carriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. To understand these discrepancies, more research on MHT by genotype interactions is needed.</p>
<p>The current work represents the most comprehensive study of detailed MHT data, APOE ε4 genotype, and several brain measures in a large population-based cohort to date. Overall, our findings do not unequivocally support general neuroprotective effects of MHT, nor do they indicate severe adverse effects of MHT use on the female brain. The results suggest subtle yet complex relationships between MHT’s and brain health, highlighting the necessity for a personalized approach to MHT use. Importantly, our analyses provide a broad view of population-based associations and are not designed to guide individual-level decisions regarding the benefits versus risks of MHT use. Furthermore, several study limitations should be acknowledged. The presented data does not enable causal inference, and observational studies are subject to different sources of heterogeneity such as switching between MHT regimes (e.g., due to side effects or availability) and variable MHT formulation and dose. In addition, utilizing prescription registry data comes with its own set of challenges. In the UK, a national system for collecting or sharing primary care data is currently missing, and the availability, completeness, and level of detail in the data might vary between systems, suppliers and over time. The primary care data used in the current study was drawn from an interim release, including data on approximately 231,000 participants. Hence, our analyses conducted on these participants’ data and the observed results might not generalize to the entire cohort.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although we extracted prescription MHT data, medications that were prescribed were not necessarily dispensed or used. Moving forward, research utilizing unified prescription registry data is needed to overcome some of these hurdles. In addition, previous studies highlight that UK Biobank participants are considered healthier than the general population based on several lifestyle and health-related factors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. This healthy volunteer bias increases with age, likely resulting in a disproportionate number of healthier older adults which might explain less apparent brain aging in the older MHT user groups. We have previously highlighted that age is negatively associated with the number of APOE ε4 carriers in the UK Biobank <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, which is indicative of survivor bias. In addition to these inherent biases in aging cohorts, the ethnic background of the sample is homogeneous (&gt; 96% white), further reducing the generalizability of the results. Lastly, although the UK Biobank has a wealth of female-specific variables, the acquired data relies on self-reports, which might not be reliable and data recording does not always align with best practice standards. For example, menopausal status in the UK Biobank is recorded based on whether the menstrual period has generally stopped, not whether it has been absent for at least 12 months, in line with the STRAW criteria <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that associations between MHT use and female brain health might vary depending on duration of use and past surgical history. Although the effect sizes were generally modest, future longitudinal studies and RCTs, particularly focused on the perimenopausal transition window, are warranted to fully understand how MHT use influences female brain health. Importantly, considering risks and benefits, decisions regarding MHT use should be made within the clinical context unique to each individual.</p>

<p>This observational study from the UK Biobank provides an <bold>important</bold> investigation into the associations between menopausal hormone therapy and brain health in a large, population-based cohort of females in the UK. A <bold>solid</bold> model of brain aging using an open source algorithm is used. While some modest adverse brain health characteristics were associated with current mHT use and older age at last use, the findings do not support a general neuroprotective effect of mHT nor severe adverse effects on the female brain. This work addresses a topic that is of grave importance since menopausal hormone therapy and its effect on the brain should be better understood in order to provide individualized effective medical support to women going through menopause.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study takes a detailed approach to understanding the effect of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in the brain aging of females. Neuroimaging data from the UK Biobank is used to explore brain aging and shows an unexpected effect of current MHT use and poorer brain health outcomes relative to never users. There is considerable debate about the benefits of MHT and estrogens in particular for brain health, and this analysis illustrates that the effects are certainly not straightforward and require greater consideration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The detailed approach to obtaining important information about MHT use from primary care records. Prior studies have suggested that factors such as estrogen/progestin type, route of administration, duration, and timing of use relative to menopause onset can contribute to whether MHT benefits brain health.</p>
<p>(2) Consideration of type of menopause (spontaneous, or surgical) in the analysis, as well as sensitivity diagnoses to rule out the effect being driven by those with clinical conditions.</p>
<p>(3) The incorporation of the brain age estimate along with hippocampal volume to address brain health.</p>
<p>(4) The complex data are also well explained and interpretations are reasonable.</p>
<p>(5) Limitations of the UK Biobank data are acknowledged</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Lifestyle factors are listed and the authors acknowledge group differences (at least between current users and never users of MHT). I was not able to find these analyses showing these differences.</p>
<p>(2) The distribution of women who were not menopausal was unequal across groups, and while the authors acknowledge this, one wonders to what extent this explains the observed findings.</p>
<p>(3) While the interpretations are reasonable, and relevant theories (healthy cell &amp; critical window) are mentioned, the discussion is missing a more zoomed-out perspective of the findings. While I appreciate wanting to limit speculation, the reader is left having to synthesize a lot of complex details on their own. A particularly difficult finding to reconcile is under what conditions these women benefit from MHT and when do they not (and why that may be).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this observational study, Barth et al. investigated the association between menopausal hormone therapy and brain health in middle- to older-aged women from the UK Biobank. The study evaluated detailed MHT data (never, current, or past user), duration of mHT use (age first/last used), history of hysterectomy with or without bilateral oophorectomy, APOEE4 genotype, and brain characteristics in a large, population-based sample. The researchers found that current mHT use (compared to never-users), but not past use, was associated with a modest increase in gray and white matter brain age gap (GM and WM BAG) and a decrease in hippocampal volumes. No significant association was found between the age of mHT initiation and brain measures among mHT users. Longer duration of use and older age at last MHT use post-menopause were associated with higher GM and WM BAG, larger WMH volumes, and smaller hippocampal volumes. In a sub-sample, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, no significant associations were found between detailed mHT variables (formulations, route of administration, dosage) and brain measures. The association between mHT variables and brain measures was not influenced by APOEE4 allele carrier status. Women with a history of hysterectomy with or without bilateral oophorectomy had lower GM BAG compared to those without such a history. Overall, these observational data suggest that the association between mHT use and brain health in women may vary depending on the duration of use and surgical history.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study has several strengths, including a large, population-based sample of women in the UK, and comprehensive details of demographic variables such as menopausal status, history of oophorectomy/hysterectomy, genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (APOE ε4 status), age at mHT initiation, age at last use, duration of mHT, and brain imaging data (hippocampus and WMH volume).</p>
<p>In a sub-sample, the study accessed detailed mHT prescription data (formulations, route of administration, dosage, duration), allowing the researchers to study how these variables were associated with brain health outcomes. This level of detail is generally missing in observational studies investigating the association of mHT use with brain health.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study has many strengths, it also has some weaknesses. As highlighted in an editorial by Kantarci &amp; Manson (2023), women with symptoms such as subjective cognitive problems, sleep disturbances, and elevated vasomotor symptoms combined with sleep disturbances tend to seek mHT more frequently than those without these symptoms. The authors of this study have also indicated that the need of mHT use which might be associated with these symptoms may be indicators of preexisting neurological changes, potentially reflecting worse brain health scores, including higher BAG and lower hippocampal volume and/or higher WMH. However, among current users, how many of these women have these symptoms could not be reported in the study. Women with these vasomotor symptoms who are using mHT are more likely to stay longer in the healthcare system compared with those without these symptoms and no MHT use history. The authors noted that the UK Biobank lacks detailed information on menopausal symptoms and perimenopausal staging, limiting the study's ability to understand how these variables influence outcomes.</p>
<p>Earlier observational studies have reported conflicting results regarding the association between mHT use and the risk of dementia and brain health. Contrary to some observational studies, three randomized trials (WHI, KEEPS, ELITE) (Espeland et al 2013, Gleason et al 2015; Henderson et al 2016) demonstrated neither beneficial nor harmful effects of mHT (with varying doses and formulations) when initiated closer to menopause (&lt;5 years). While strong efforts were made to run proper statistical analyses to investigate the association between mHT use and brain health, these results reflect mainly associations, but not causal relationships as also stated by the authors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, observational studies have intrinsic limitations, such as a lack of control over switching mHT doses and formulations, a lack of laboratory measures to confirm mHT use, and reliance on self-reported data, which may not always be reliable. The authors caution that these findings should not guide individual-level decisions regarding the benefits versus risks of mHT use. However, the study raises new questions that should be addressed by randomized clinical trials to investigate the varying effects of MHT on brain health and dementia risk.</p>

<p>In this study Barth et al. present results of detailed analyses of the relationships between menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), APOE ε4 genotype, and measures of anatomical brain age in women in the UK Biobank. While past studies have investigated the links between some of these variables (including works by the authors themselves), this new study adds more detailed MHT variables, surgical status, and additional brain aging measures. The UK biobank sample is large, but it is a population cohort and many of the MHT measures are self-reported (as the authors point out). However, the authors present a solid analysis of the available information which shows associations between MHT user status, length of MHT use, as well as surgical status with brain age. However, as the authors themselves state, the results do not unequivocally support the neuroprotective or adverse effect of MHT on the brain. I think this work strengthens the case for the need of better-designed longitudinal studies investigating the effect of MHT on the brain in the peri/post-menopausal stage.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors addressed the statistical analyses rigorously. For example, multiple testing corrections, outlier removal, and sensitivity analysis were performed carefully. Ample background information is provided in the introduction allowing even individuals not familiar with the field to understand the motivation behind the work. The discussion section also does a great job of addressing open questions and limitations. Very detailed results of all statistical tests are provided either in the main text or in the supplementary information.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>For me, the biggest weakness was the presentation of the results. As many variables are involved and past studies have investigated several of these questions, it would have helped to better clarify the analysis and questions that are addressed by this study in particular and what sets this work apart from past studies. The information is present in the manuscript but better organization might have helped. For example, a figure depicting the key questions near the beginning of the manuscript would have been very helpful for me. The Tables also contain a lot of information but I wonder if there might be a way to capture the most relevant information more succinctly (either in Table format or in a figure) for the main text.</p>
<p>
Another concern I had was the linear models investigating the effects of these MHT variables on the brain age gap. The authors have included &quot;age&quot; as one of the parameters in this analysis. I wonder if adding a quadratic age factor age2 in the model might have improved the fit since many brain phenotypes tend to show quadratic brain age effects in the 40 to 80-year age range.</p>
