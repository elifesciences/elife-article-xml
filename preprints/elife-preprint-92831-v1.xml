<title>Abstract</title><p>Excessive avoidance and slow extinction of fear are hallmarks of anxiety disorders. We have previously found that overnight fasting diminishes excessive avoidance and speeds up fear extinction by decreasing subjective relief during threat omissions. Since relief tracks the reward prediction error signal that governs safety learning, we hypothesized that these effects of fasting might be linked to a decreased activation in brain regions related to reward prediction error processing. Hence, we replicated our previous study in a 3T-MRI scanner. Overnight fasting increased effective avoidance and sped up fear extinction learning. During extinction, the fasting group showed lower activations in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens in response to threat omissions signaled by a safe cue. Nucleus accumbens activations were modulated by relief in the control group. This study provides support for overnight fasting as an adjunct to treatments for anxiety, but the effects should be investigated in anxious patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to identify and avoid cues that predict threat is essential to behavioral adaptation and, ultimately, survival. However, when former threat cues no longer predict threat, fear and avoidance should also decrease accordingly. In clients with anxiety disorders, a top leading cause of mental burden worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, fear and avoidance tend to persist even in situations of objective safety. The standard treatment for these disorders, exposure therapy, decreases excessive fear and avoidance by gradually approaching these situations and promoting safety learning. Although this therapy is considered effective, nearly half of these clients do not benefit from this intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, gaining insight in behavioral and neural mechanisms of safety learning, as well as discovering new ways to enhance safety learning, is of great clinical relevance.</p>
<p>Fear extinction studies in rodents have found that acute fasting enhances safety learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In the same vein, we recently observed in healthy humans that overnight fasting optimizes two forms of safety learning: active avoidance learning and fear extinction learning. Specifically, we found that overnight fasting reduced unnecessary avoidance during a signal of safety, while maintaining effective avoidance during a signal of upcoming threat. This decrease in unnecessary avoidance was mediated by lower levels of relief pleasantness reported by fasted versus fed participants during omissions of threat signaled by a safe cue. Interestingly, we also observed a faster decline in relief pleasantness ratings during fear extinction, suggesting faster decrease of threat expectancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Subjective relief pleasantness is the emotional experience of a better-than-expected outcome in the context of threat omission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and has therefore been related to the reward prediction error, rPE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, which is assumed to reinforce avoidance actions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, it seems that overnight fasting decreased the reward value of safety (less relief pleasantness) and decreased the motivation to achieve safety (less avoidance)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Together with the obvious fact that fasting increases the value of food as well as the motivation to achieve food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, these results may indicate fasting biases an animal or human to focus on food at the expense of safety. This trade-off may be adaptive for successful foraging: searching for food implies leaving the safe nest.</p>
<p>The current functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study was set up to examine whether the decreased relief ratings in avoidance learning and fear extinction are indeed indicative of decreased reward activations during omission of threat. Rodent studies have previously shown that unexpected, but not expected, omissions of threat trigger dopaminergic activations in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), similar to a rPE signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Via mesolimbic dopamine projections, these VTA activations probably recruit the nuclei accumbens (Nac), amygdala and hippocampus in concert to induce the valence-related plastic changes necessary for the formation of safety memories in fear extinction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and avoidance learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Accordingly, human fMRI studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> have found (patterns of) activations in the ventral striatum and the VTA during threat omissions that might contribute to establishing a new safety CS–&gt;noUS memory that reduces the initial fear responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Hence, we hypothesized, based on our previous relief findings, that overnight fasting would decrease activation in these brain areas during threat omissions in avoidance learning and fear extinction. Because overnight fasting decreased relief ratings particularly during omissions after safety signals and unnecessary avoidance actions, we focused on these events to test our central hypothesis (as preregistered on the Open Science Framework, osf.io/yx8bq).</p>
<p>As in our previous experiment, we asked a Re-feeding Group (breakfast after overnight fasting) and a Fasting Group (14 to 16 hours of overnight fasting) to perform a short version of the Avoidance Relief Task, ART<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>. This task starts with a Pavlovian fear conditioning phase, in which different visual stimuli (conditional stimuli, CSs) are paired (CS+) or not (CS-) with an unpleasant electrical stimulation (unconditioned stimulus, US). During the avoidance conditioning phase, participants can learn to press a button to avoid the unpleasant US. Finally, during the fear extinction and response prevention phase, the button is removed and the CSs are presented in the absence of the US. In all phases, subjective ratings of relief pleasantness, skin conductance reactivity (SCR), and brain activations (blood-oxygen-level-dependent, BOLD, signal) are measured during US omissions at CS offsets, to track correlates of the rPE signal that drives safety learning during differential conditioning, avoidance learning and fear extinction, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>.</p>

<caption><p>Overview of the procedures of the fMRI study and of the ART. <bold>A)</bold> During the first (day 1) and second (day 2) visits, we measured working memory capacity, psychomotor visual attention, and cognitive effort levels through the Digit Span (DS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, the Psychomotor Visual Task (PVT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and the Need for Cognition Scale (NFS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. These measurements were performed to exclude fasting effects on learning following changes in general cognitive skills. During the second visit, glucose levels were measured before and after breakfast in the Re-feeding Group and with a time interval of 20/25 minutes in the Fasting Group. Ketone levels were measured once at the beginning of the second session. After the neuropsychological assessment, participants were asked to lie inside the scanner. The intensity of the US was then calibrated following standardized procedures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The US was set to an intensity for which participants refer to the electrical stimulation as highly unpleasant but not painful. Following explanations about the task and relief ratings, the fMRI exam started for a total duration of about 75 minutes. After the acquisition of the anatomical scans, the participants performed the ART. Since we focused on the dynamics of learning, in the present fMRI study we did not include the test phases of the ART, as in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. After fMRI acquisition, an explanation of hypotheses and aims was provided to each participant. <bold>B)</bold> The ART consists of three learning phases, a Pavlovian phase that uses a block-design, an avoidance learning and fear extinction learning phases that use an event-related type of presentation of the stimuli, see <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> for details. <bold>C)</bold> We applied a jittered design to better distinguish BOLD and SCR responses during US omissions. The illustration shows an example of a trial during the avoidance learning phase, where background, CS presentation (US anticipation), and CS offset (relief) were jittered events before that the online relief rating was collected.</p></caption>

<p>We previously found that overnight fasting reduces avoidance and relief mostly to a safe CS-<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, we focused our hypotheses on fasting-induced changes to rPE-like processing of US omissions following CS-presentations. For the <bold>avoidance conditioning phase</bold>, we hypothesized that overnight fasting decreases Nac, VTA, and ventro medial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC) activations during US omissions following a CS-, as compared to US omissions following an actively avoided CS+ (Hypothesis 1-a). We further hypothesized that these weaker brain activations in the fasting group would be related to lower levels of avoidance during CS-, as compared to CS+ (Hypothesis 1-b), and also related to a reduction in subjective relief ratings (Hypothesis 1-c). For the <bold>fear extinction phase</bold>, we hypothesized that overnight fasting would decrease Nac, VTA, and vmPFC activations during US omissions following the CS-, as compared to US omissions following the CS+ (Hypothesis 2-a). We further hypothesized that these weaker brain activations would be related to a faster reduction in relief pleasantness ratings for CS-versus CS+ (Hypothesized 2-b). These a priori hypotheses (and further explorative tests) were preregistered at osf.io/yx8bq.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In this section, we only reported the principal contrasts of interest to test the pre-registered hypotheses, which include the Group by CS interactions from the (Generalized) Linea Mixed Models (GLMM, LMM) and two sample t-tests. We also included eventual main effects of Group, or Group by Trial interactions that were not pre-registered. The factor Trial was de-meaned to focus on the learning curve. Importantly, differently from the behavioral data and in line with the recent neuroimaging literature on rPE during threat omission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we did not find the expected differentiation between brain activations to US omissions signaled by the CS+av versus CS-in either the extinction or the avoidance learning phase (in any of our Regions Of Interests, ROIs) unless group effects were taken into account. In the supplementary material, we included the results from the Pavlovian, avoidance, and fear extinction learning phases of the ART that involve ratings, brain activations, and SCRs during US anticipation/expectancy. These results were in line with the results from previous fear conditioning studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. No group differences were found during anticipation.</p>
<p>We also investigated for group differences in explorative time-related analysis on the ROIs. In one type of time-related analysis, we first run a t-test on early compared to late omissions (CS-versus CS+av)early versus (CS-versus CS+av)late. For a second type of analysis, which can be intended as a growth curve modeling, we run a LMM for ROI including ‘Trial’ as covariate of interest. The results from these analyses replicated what already found in the main analysis without any significant group by time-related effect. Hence, these results are not reported here.</p>
<p>The expected effects of the fasting and re-feeding procedure on glucose and hunger levels as well as the results from the psychometric questionnaires (which -successfully-served to exclude effects of fasting on cognition) are also reported in the supplementary material. No analysis of the ketone levels was performed, since we did not detect any increase after overnight fasting (all values equal to zero).</p>

We also found an unexpected higher probability to avoid the CS+av (which button presses for this CS were used as baseline) in the Fasting Group compared to the Re-feeding Group (<italic>β</italic> = 1.108, ± 0.578, z = 2.436, <italic>p</italic> = 0.015, %95 CIs [0.285:2.573], Exp-<italic>β</italic> = 1.228). This means that the expected Group by CS interaction reported above was dependent on an increased probability to effectively avoid the CS+av in the Fasting Group compared to Re-feeding group (and not by a decreased probability in unnecessary and ineffective avoidance in the Fasting group as we found in our previous study), see left panel in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref> for models fit.</p>
<p>Since we observed a large variance for the avoidance actions during the CS-, we additionally ran the same GLMM analysis taking into account the ‘better safe than sorry’ strategy. To do this, we calculated the individual frequency to press the button for the CS-. When we added this continuous covariate to the original GLMM the results did not change, confirming that the Fasting Group, independent of individual strategy, avoided in response to the CS+av more often than the Re- feeding Group.</p>
<p>Importantly, the result of an explorative GLMM analysis (Group: FG/RG by CS: CS-/CS+av/CS+unav, by Study design: fMRI/behavioral) indicated that the present Fasting Group showed a higher general probability to avoid than the Fasting Group examined in the previous behavioral study (<italic>β</italic> = -1.644, ± 0.492, z = -3.344, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 95% CIs [- 2.655:- 0.713], Exp-<italic>β</italic> = 2.703), <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref> for models fit.</p>

<p>The result from a two sample t-test showed a trend towards a significan t expected effect in the Nac (CS- vs CS+av: t = - 1.653, df = 39.764, <italic>p</italic> = 0.053, 95% CIs [- Inf:0.001], <italic>d</italic> = 0.498), which was driven by a lower b rain activity in response to CS- offset in the Fasting Group compared to the Re-feeding Group (CS-: t = - 2.502, df = 41.675, <italic>p</italic> = 0.016, %95 CI s [- 0.153:- 0.016], <italic>d</italic> = 0.754).

In an additional sensitivity analysis, we confirmed the same significant effect of fasting when the three participants who did not show any SCR during omission for any of the CSs were excluded.

<p>We then added relief ratings to the GLMM model and found that in addition to the fasting intervention, relief was a significant positive predictor of the probability of SCRs (<italic>β</italic> = 1.147, ± 0.051, z = 2.851, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004, 95% CIs [0.047:0.256], Exp-<italic>β</italic> = 1.320).

<title>Fear extinction: voxel-based analysis within the extended mask</title>
<p>The results from a paired t-test showed that the CS+av versus CS-contrast did not yield any significant result.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the neural mechanisms by which overnight fasting decreases unnecessary/ineffective avoidance and speeds up fear extinction learning with a specific focus on the reward system (Nac, vmPFC, and VTA) and the relation with subjective relief experiences. For this purpose, we replicated our previous experiment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> in the fMRI scanner, comparing two groups that fasted 14-16 hours overnight and consumed (standard) breakfast before (Re-feeding Group) or right after the experiment (Fasting Group).</p>
<p>As in our previous study, overnight fasting led to more discrimination between the avoidance responses to the CS+av (when the US was actually avoidable, which is an adaptive behavior), and the CS+unav (when avoidance was ineffective) or the CS- (when avoidance was unnecessary). This time, however, this optimization was driven by increased effective avoidance to the CS+av, rather than decreased avoidance to the CS+unav and CS- as in our previous experiment. Against our expectations, we did not find fasting effects on neural or skin conductance responses to US omission that were of statistical relevance (although they pointed to the hypothesized direction), while the absence of any effect of fasting on US omission-induced relief did not allow a further investigation of relief as a potential modulation on the avoidance behavior, as we previously showed.</p>
<p>During subsequent fear extinction, in which CS+av and CS- were presented in a new context without the avoidance button and without the US, subjective relief during US omissions decreased at a faster rate and minimized more in their residual levels in the Fasting Group than in the Re-feeding Group (for both CS+av and CS-), in line with our previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This finding broadly supports the work of two studies in rodents which investigated the effect of acute fasting on fear extinction learning. Verma et al. found that acute fasting decreases the consolidation of fear when applied before acquisition, facilitates fear extinction when applied after conditioning and before extinction, and increases extinction recall after re-feeding when applied before extinction learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Similarly, Huang et al. found that acute fasting enhanced fear extinction and its retention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In male humans, only one behavioral study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> investigated the effects of overnight fasting on fear extinction and its retention. The authors found that the retention of extinguished fears (but not learning) is enhanced by an overnight fasting procedure applied before fear acquisition. In the same vein as Shi et al., we found no effect of overnight fasting in anticipatory SCRs during fear extinction. However, we found an effect on PE-related outcome measures which were not investigated by Shi et al. The differences between our and Shi et al. results might also depend on the protocols used (one day protocol for our fMRI study, and a two days protocol for Shi et al.), and on gender.</p>
<p>We showed here for the first time that US omissions elicited lower vmPFC and Nac activations in the Fasting Group compared to the Re-feeding Group (when contrasting CS-offsets to CS+av offsets). Moreover, Nac activations and general SCRs were positively modulated by subjective relief in the Re-feeding Group, but not in the Fasting Group, where those activations approached a minimal value. This suggests again that overnight fasting speeds up fear extinction through a reduction in responsivity to/pleasantness of US omissions.</p>
<p>The Nac exerts a ‘hub’ function integrating online PEs with reward pleasantness in classical reward-based learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Here, the Nac might exert a similar function, by integrating PEs from threat omissions with their hedonic impact (relief ‘liking’). Overnight fasting minimizes the modulation of this hedonic component as well as online PEs in Nac responses to the safest circumstance (CS- offset) and not to dangerous cues (CS+). In a fed state, instead, the magnitude of these rPEs in the Nac increases with the amount of pleasantness of the relief experienced in response to the omissions of the safe CS. This evidence further supports our theory that, while fasting increases rPEs in appetitive learning, it exerts a reverse effect on rPEs that govern fear extinction learning (at least for what concerns the CS-). Now, in a laboratory setting, changes in the responses to threat omissions signaled by the safe cue are often of less interest. In the context of clinical anxiety, however, we often observe increased avoidance and relief for the safe CS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Hence, how results suggest that overnight fasting might be a useful adjunct to psychotherapy (e.g. exposure).</p>
<p>Similarly to what was found in the Nac, overnight fasting minimizes the response of the vmPFC to the CS-. The vmPFC, is known to be central in decoding the value of a CS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and, in concert with the Nac, shows a decrease in response to food when food is devaluated via satiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Hence, we interpret the present fasting-induced reduction in vmPFC at the offset of the CS- as a potential fasting-induced reduction in the value of safety, in line with our theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. As for the Nac, we expected to find a modulation on a trial-by-trial level with relief also in the vmPFC. This was however not the case and in line with the results from a previous fMRI study investigating the neural correlates of relief within a pain omission paradigm. Specifically, Leknes and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> found a similar activation in vmPFC and Nac when comparing brain activations in response to classical rewards and unexpected omissions of painful stimulations. In their study, the vmPFC and the Nac were found active during (pain) omissions, but only the response of the Nac was positively related to relief ratings. Our paradigm deviates from that of Leknes especially in terms of its learning nature. It seems therefore that differently from the Nac, the vmPFC during learning does not compute the pleasantness of the online deviations from previous US omissions. Hence, our results show that overnight fasting has opposite effects on rPEs within the appetitive and fear extinction context. It remains to be elucidated if these opposite effects on rPE signaling is dopamine- dependent.</p>
<p>Previous animal research has established the role of prolonged fasting and food restriction in increasing midbrain dopaminergic response to rewarding stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Specifically, fasting increases the salience and reward value of food in VTA-Nac reward circuitry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and triggers motivated appetitive behaviors upon the activation of both the (mesolimbic) ‘wanting’ and the (interceptive) ‘needing’ systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. When acute, fasting also increases dopaminergic turnover in response to salient events. This increase might depend on a reduction of midbrain dopaminergic activity during rest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> or on changes in the striatal opamine reuptake transporter (DAT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In either case, acute fasting ultimately facilitates the response of midbrain dopaminergic neurons that are central to reward and safety learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Hence, our results might depend on the effects of lower tonic DA on leaving more room for a phasic dopaminergic burst if a reward is consumed, and/or on a reduced tonic DA itself. To address this question, studies with similar protocols could be used together with pharmacological manipulations of the dopaminergic system or Positron Emission Tomography using appropriate radioligands.</p>
<p>To sum up, in healthy female individuals, overnight fasting improves fear extinction learning by reducing relief pleasantness, reward-related brain areas, and electrodermal responses during threat omissions/PEs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The absence of the expected effect of fasting in decreasing unnecessary and ineffective avoidance might be explained by the change in the experimental environment. The MRI environment, compared to a regular lab setting, undoubtedly represents a more stressful context <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Stress, on top of an overnight fasting procedure, might affect avoidance learning differently from only a fasting procedure. This might be because avoidance learning involves the activation of the motivational system and behavioral engagement. The passive process of fear extinction learning might be more robust to this type of additive effect of stress and fasting instead. To test this hypothesis, it would be important to investigate the effects of stress procedures (and biomarkers of stress) in our fasting experiment.</p>
<p>Second, the effects of fasting were present across all three measurements of US omission, although related to time only in the relief ratings and stimulus-specific only at the brain level, while neither to time nor CSs in the SCR. These specificities in each type of measurement remain difficult to explain at the moment. Speculatively, the absence of trial/time-related effects at the brain level can be explained by the single- trial-based learning nature of the ART, which aspects were better captured by the individual relief ratings instead. To overcome this limit, future versions of the ART could include a partial reinforcement schedule. Nonetheless, as already recommended in a previous commentary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, we attempt this analysis to also bring more awareness to the importance of trial/time effects in learning paradigms used in neuroimaging and behavioral studies, which are currently largely neglected. Crucially, averages-based comparisons should be limited since they might hide crucial information in how learning generates and evolves.</p>
<p>Differently, the presence of a stimulus-specific effect of overnight fasting only at the brain level might specifically depend on the better ability of the MRI (compared to cognitive ratings and peripheral changes in sudoriparous glands) to capture online rPE.</p>
<p>Next, replications of this study should take into account the difficulty to find a significant discrimination in brain responses (as well as in other measures) to US omissions signaled by the two CSs when fear extinction takes place in a new context. In this case, indeed, we often observe an increase in US expectation/relief for the safe CS-. That is why differences between the two types of US omissions might not be (significantly) detectable, unless, as in our case, the homeostatic state is manipulated. Replication of our study should also investigate whether these effects of fasting hold if fasting is applied after fear conditioning and when fear extinction is performed in the conditioning context. Furthermore, we did not find group differences in VTA. The small size of such brain region (volume of 360ml) makes it difficult to capture its change in activity by a whole-brain slicing sequence during one trial- based learning, see<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Stimuli</title>
<p>Visual stimuli as well as the procedures and the delivery of the electrical stimulation were the same as those reported in our behavioral study.</p>
<p>Briefly, two different contexts were presented on the computer screen (an office room and a conference room). Both contexts contained a desk lamp that could light-up in three different colors: red, blue, and yellow, which colors served as conditional stimuli (CSs). We used an electrical stimulation as the unconditional stimulus (US). The CSs+ were followed by the US while the CS- was not. Avoidance action cancelled the electrical stimulation after the CS+avoidable, but not after the CS+unavoidable, CS+unav. In all trials, we used a jittered presentation of the stimuli to avoid learning effects, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The electric stimulation consisted of high-voltage brief 2-ms electrical pulses delivered at the forearm of the non-dominant hand of the participant. The level of the electrical stimulation was selected by the participant before the start of the task via a gradual intensifying procedure.</p>

<p>A full description of the ART task can be found in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Briefly, during the <italic>Pavlovian phase</italic>, three light colors presented in context A (office room) are used as CSs that signal the absence or the presence of an upcoming unpleasant electrical stimulation (used as US) to the non-dominant forearm: the CS+av and the CS+unav are both followed by the US, while the CS- is not. Next, during the <italic>avoidance learning phase</italic>, which takes place against the same room picture (context A), a red button appears during all CS. Clicking the button effectively prevents the US during CS+av, but not during CS+unav. Finally, in the <italic>fear extinction phase</italic> with response prevention, the context changes from an office to a study room (context A◊B) and the CS+av and CS- are presented without the presence of the red buttons and without any US. A relief rating scale is presented every time the US is omitted. Retrospective US-expectancy ratings are collected at the end of each learning phase.</p>

<title>General analysis</title>
<p>For each measure, specific exclusion criteria are reported in the supplementary material. All the variables of interest were analyzed using (generalized) linear mixed models (GLMM and LMM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> in R-studio (Version 1.4.1717©2009-2021, RStudio) and AFNI (22.0.04) (3dDeconvolve/3dREMLfit). Before reporting the planned contrasts of interest, we also reported any Group-related effect from an omnibus test (using car::anova(glmer) in rstudio with a type III Wald test for ꭓ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> GLMM, or by using anova(lmer) for LMM). The independent variables were ‘Group’, type of ‘CS’, and ‘Trial’. ‘Trial’ was used as a categorical dichotomous variable for the analysis of the retrospective US expectancy ratings [first and last presentation of each CS], and as a continuous de-meaned variable for the remaining analysis. For each measure, the planned contrast of interest refer to the Group by CS interaction. We ran post hoc Bonferroni corrected tests for any other eventual Group or Group by Trial effect (for which we did not have a priory hypothesis). We reported the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the estimate of each GLMM/LMM result of interest [lower: upper]. For the GLMMs, as a measure of effect size, we use the exponentiated estimates (Exp-<italic>β</italic>) (with Exp-<italic>β</italic> &gt;1 indicating increased occurrence of an event); for the LMMs, we used the Robust Effect Size Index, RESI, rstudio: resi_pe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> (with [0, 0.1] = small effect, [.1, 0.25] = small to medium effect, [0.25, 0.4] = medium to large effect, and large effects greater than 0.4).</p>
<p>For the brain data, we were primarily interested in Groups differences for the CS- vs CS+av contrast. For this investigations we used two sample t-tests and the Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> to quantify effects sizes (0.2 = small effect, 0.5 = moderate effect, 0.8 = large effect). We also included explorative analysis on the effect of time (early/late learning) and trial (time series analysis which can be intended as a growth curve modeling). For the first type of time-related analysis, we first run a t-test on early compared to late omissions (CS- versus CS+av)early versus (CS- versus CS+av)late (average of the beta weights calculated on the first and last four trials for each CS). For the second type of analysis, we run a LMM for each ROI by including ‘Trial’ as covariate of interest. In general, since the previous effects of fasting were found mostly on the CS-, the CS+av was here used as the reference for comparisons in the t-tests, LMMs and GLMMs. Within each LMM model, the normality of the distribution of the residuals was visually checked and corrected with a log-transformation if needed. In all the GLMM and LMM models we included random subject, random slope by subject, random CS by subject, and random slope by CS by subject only when these terms did improve the model’s fit based on the Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). Significance was set at a <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.050.</p>

<p>A bandpass filter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> was applied to the SCL data.

Each SCR was calculated by subtracting the average SCL during the 1 second prior to appearance of the CS on the screen (US-anticipation), to the peak found during the presentation of the CS (7.5-9 sec). A z-transformation was applied to each value to increase the comparability of the results. We also changed the threshold applied to the responses from 0.02 to 0.01 to reduce the number of non-responders.</p>

<p>A total of 50 T1-weighted (T1w, 1mmx1mmx1mm) images were found within the input BIDS dataset. The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, distributed with ANTs 2.3.3 (RRID:SCR_004757)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow.

<title>- Functional MRI data preprocessing</title>
<p>For each of the 3 BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <italic>fMRIPrep</italic>. Susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) was omitted. The BOLD reference was then coregistered to the T1w reference using flirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson and Smith, 2001) with the boundary-based registration (Greve and Fischl, 2009) cost-function. Co- registration was configured with nine degrees of freedom to account for distortions remaining in the BOLD reference. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatio-temporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9, Jenkinson et al., 2002). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207 (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, RRID:SCR_005927). The BOLD time-series (including slice-timing correction when applied) were resampled onto their original, native space by applying the transforms to correct for head-motion. These resampled BOLD time-series will be referred to as <italic>preprocessed BOLD in original space</italic>, or just <italic>preprocessed BOLD</italic>. The BOLD time- series (with 2mmx2mmx2mm voxel size) were resampled into standard space, generating a <italic>preprocessed BOLD run in MNI152NLin2009cAsym space</italic>. First, a reference volume and its skull- stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of <italic>fMRIPrep</italic>. Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the <italic>preprocessed BOLD</italic>: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and three region-wise global signals.</p>
<p>FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of relative motions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>,,and relative rootmean-square displacement between affines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their implementations in <italic>Nipype</italic> (following the definitions by<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>). The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and the whole-brain masks. Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to allow for component-based noise correction (<italic>CompCor</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>). Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the <italic>preprocessed BOLD</italic> time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with 128s cut-off) for the two <italic>CompCor</italic> variants: temporal (tCompCor) and anatomical (aCompCor). tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable voxels within the brain mask. For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM) are generated in anatomical space. The implementation differs from that of Behzadi et al. in that instead of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, the aCompCor masks are subtracted a mask of pixels that likely contain a volume fraction of GM. This mask is obtained by thresholding the corresponding partial volume map at 0.05, and it ensures components are not extracted from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM. Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by thresholding at .99 (as in the original implementation). Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks. For each CompCor decomposition, the <italic>k</italic> components with the largest singular values are retained, such that the retained components’ time series are sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF, WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from consideration. The head- motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also placed within the corresponding confounds file. The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and quadratic terms for each<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.9 mm FD or 2.0 standardised DVARS were annotated as motion outliers (spikes).</p>
<p>Participants with more than 15% of spikes were excluded from the extinction learning phases, while a threshold of 20% of spikes was applied to the avoidance phase (since this last phase lasts 15 minutes and includes button presses). All resamplings can be performed with <italic>a single interpolation step</italic> by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Non-gridded (surface) resamplings were performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer). We included 32 regressors to account for noise-movement related effects: 24 motion parameters that include the 6 rigid-body parameters for rotation (3) and translation (3) and 2 parameters for WM and CFS, plus their first-order associated derivatives and their square terms. We did not include global signal among these regressors. A smoothing of 4 4 4 mm was applied to the data. The images were then scaled, so that each voxel had a mean signal intensity of 100. This produces small signal detectable on a trial by trial level, but allows us to correctly compare the two groups by specifying any change relative to the mean as percent signal change.</p>

<title>- Selection of the Regions Of Interest (ROIs)</title>
<p>The vmPFC mask was obtained from AFNI (area 14/32/24, bilateral). Since we consider the pleasantness of relief from omission of a threat a type of reward, the selection was made based on an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis comparing the brain responses to monetary, erotic and food reward outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The Nac and VTA masks were obtained from the Canlab data-repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://canlab.github.io">http://canlab.github.io</ext-link>), while the masks for the sub-nuclei of the Nac (Shell and Core) were obtained from the brainnetome atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://atlas.brainnetome.org">https://atlas.brainnetome.org</ext-link>). For the analyses on the main effect of the task (e.g. brain response to US anticipation/omissions across groups), we used a ROIs analysis (averaged beta weights), as well as a voxel-based analysis on an extended mask that included our original vmPFC, Nac, VTA, and other rPE-related and reward-related brain areas, see supplementary material for details. Each mask was resampled to the original dimension of the functional images, in line with the MNI 2mmx2mmx2mm voxel size template.</p>

<title>- fMRI analysis</title>
<p>Since ART is a new paradigm in neuroimaging studies, after having addressed our primary research questions, we explore the main effects of the task during US omissions using t-tests at level of the ROIs, as well as a voxel-based analysis using the extended mask of interest.</p>
<p>The analyses were run with the 3dttest++ in combination with 3dClustSim in AFNI. For the results, we used a cluster-base correction for false positive with AFNI -3dClustSim (initial <italic>p</italic> = 0.001 and extended threshold alpha (FWE-corrected) of 0.05). A correction for a factor of 3 (VTA, Nac, and vmPFC) was applied to the alpha-value of the results from the t-tests/LMM for each ROI analysis (corrected with a factor of 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.017).</p>

<title>- First-level analysis</title>
<p>The individual smoothed and scaled brain data from the avoidance and extinction learning phase of the ART were used to extract beta averages for the t-test analyses and to obtain the time-series beta weights for the LMMs.</p>
<p>The ROI analysis was done by using 3dDeconvolve to create a regressors matrix design and by using 3dREMLfit to run a GLM for the average BOLD signal across voxels of the ROI. A correction for noise correlation (ARMA) was applied at the trial-by-trial level. We repeated this process for the three ROIs. This allowed obtaining the beta estimates for the analysis of the early-late brain activations, as well as for the time series brain activations (on a trial-by-trial level). For both the avoidance phase (hypothesis 1) and the extinction learning phase (hypothesis 2) we were interested in the differential brain response at the time of the omission of the electrical stimulation during safety (CS-) and during CS+av offset (CS- versus CS+av). For the avoidance phase, the other regressors consisted of the activations during US anticipation (calculated from the disappearance of the red button till the end of the CS), brief activation during the button press, and activation during the time of the relief ratings. For the Pavlovian and extinction phases, the other regressors consisted of brain activation during CS presentations (US anticipation) and during the time of the relief rating.</p>

<title>- Second-level analysis</title>
<p>The results from the contrasts of interest from the first level analysis (CS- versus CS+av) were used within the second-level design to test for group-related differences (independent samples t-tests). When group- related effects were significant, an amplitude modulation analysis was done in AFNI by adding relief ratings as a mean-centered modulator for the brain activity of interest. In the explorative time-related analyses, besides the (CS- versus CS+av)early versus (CS- versus CS+av)late contrast, we implemented the time-series of the betas values in a Group by CS by Trial LMM analysis.</p>

<p>This study on the effects of fasting on safety learning rests on basic premises and concepts that both reviewers found difficult to follow. If these can be clarified, the findings may well be <bold>useful</bold> and of some utility for the field of emotional learning as well as experimental clinical psychology. However, the main claims of the study are only partially supported and are therefore <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Questions and concerns:</p>
<p>The abstract is hard to follow. The authors there refer to a previous experiment showing that &quot;overnight fasting diminishes excessive avoidance and speeds up fear extinction by decreasing subjective relief during threat omissions&quot; (L26). They go on to say that &quot;relief tracks the reward prediction error signal that governs safety learning&quot; (L28). This is puzzling. While getting less relief/safety from avoidance actions will surely diminish avoidance (because avoidance actions are less reinforced), getting less relief/safety from omissions of an unconditioned stimulus (US) in fear extinction should slow down (not speed up) fear extinction. In the same vein, why are &quot;lower activations [in fMRI] in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens in response to threat omissions signaled by a safe cue&quot; (L34) associated with &quot;increased effective avoidance and sped up fear extinction&quot; (L33)? This clearly goes against the existing literature on reward prediction errors (PEs) in fear learning paradigms, where these PEs in the mesolimbic dopamine system drive extinction, that is, they are associated with better extinction (and should therefore also be associated with more avoidance). For instance, in the rodent, Luo et al., 2018 (DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-04784-7) and Salinas-Hernandez et al., 2018 (DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.388181">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.388181</ext-link> of 25RESEARCH ARTICLE) and 2023 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.08.025ll">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.08.025ll</ext-link>) have in various constellations optogenetically enhanced and diminished, respectively, the PE signal at the time of US omission in extinction in either VTA or nucleus accumbens and thereby sped up and slowed down, respectively, extinction learning. If the results of the current experiment contradict established knowledge, the reader must be clearly informed about this. By contrast, the abstract gives the impressions as if the current results were to be expected and in line with the literature (&quot;since relief tracks the reward prediction error signal ..., we hypothesized ...&quot;).</p>
<p>It would also help the reader if it was clarified that the finding of &quot;increased effective avoidance&quot; (L33) went counter to the hypothesis, e.g., by saying &quot;Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed ...&quot;.</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>L51: The presentation of exposure therapy is a bit misleading and may create confusion. While it is probably correct that exposure works by &quot;promoting safety learning&quot;, this is generally thought to be the case only for Pavlovian associations (CS-US), that is, for extinction (where safety learning creates the new association of CS and &quot;no US&quot;). It is, however, not generally considered to be the case for the instrumental action-outcome associations that underlie avoidance learning (&quot;I do this or that, then I do not have to experience the feared object or situation&quot;). Therapists try to prevent this type of learning from happening, exactly by promoting the confrontation with fear objects or situations in the absence of any avoidance action.</p>
<p>Generally, I think the introduction suffers from the absence of a short explanation of what avoidance and extinction learning are, behaviorally, and what types of mechanisms are believed to drive them, and that the one (avoidance) is thought to contribute to the maintenance of fears whereas the other (extinction) reduces fear. The non-specialist reader is somehow left in the dark.</p>
<p>In the same vein, on L63, presenting the results of their previous fasting study that serves as a discovery study for the present experiment, the authors make a distinction between &quot;unnecessary avoidance during a signal of safety&quot; and &quot;effective avoidance during a signal of upcoming threat&quot;. It is really expecting too much from the reader that they will understand at this stage that a CS can become a signal of safety through extinction or that a CS not paired with a US during conditioning (a &quot;CS-&quot;) is a safety signal and that it is not necessary to avoid such a signal, whereas a non-extinguished CS (signaling threat) may well be avoided. (At least, this is how I understood the distinction.)</p>
<p>I was then really confused by the following statement (L65) that &quot;the decrease in unnecessary avoidance was mediated by lower levels of relief ... during omissions of threat&quot;. If a CS is already extinguished (has no remaining or only little threat value, that is, is a safety stimulus), there is no longer threat omission when the US does not occur, and no relief. There should also be no relief to US omission after a CS-. More importantly even, if fasted participants reported lower levels of relief from threat omission, why did they not also show less effective avoidance (which is driven by the reinforcement provided by the relief that occurs when a successful avoidance action has prevented a US from occurring after or during the CS)?</p>
<p>L69: Also the statement &quot;a faster decline in relief ... ratings during ... extinction, suggesting faster decrease of threat expectancies&quot; can only be understood by the reader if they already know what a PE is and by what rules PE-driven learning is governed (that is, essentially, if they know Rescorla-Wagner). I think the authors must explain, in order to allow a non-specialist reader to follow their text, that the PE (supposed to be indexed by the relief rating) reflects the discrepancy between the magnitude of an outcome expectation (e.g., here, expectation of the US) and the obtained outcome (here, US or not); that, therefore, a PE is generated when a subject expects a US (as a result of prior conditioning) but does not get it; that this leads to a proportional update (reduction) of the US expectation in the next trial; and that this in turn leads to a diminished PE when the US again does not occur. Notably, the reader must be made aware that the higher the PE, the higher the reduction and the faster the extinction (proportionality).</p>
<p>The reader must also be made aware that the update is additionally determined by some multiplicatory &quot;transmission&quot; function or constant (e.g., learning rate in Rescorla-Wagner) that defines the size of the relationship between the magnitude of the PE and the magnitude of the update (reduction). Hence, in two individuals, even if the magnitude of the PE is identical, the magnitude of the update may differ because of individual differences in the learning rate (to take the Rescorla-Wagner implementation). The authors, however, seem to ignore the possibility that fasting changes the learning rate.</p>
<p>Both the dynamics of the PE and the learning rate, of course, add complexity to the interpretation of the past and present data. But I think the authors cannot avoid this when they want to make sense of a treatment (fasting) that they believe affects safety learning. Speaking of &quot;lower levels of relief&quot; (L66) must be qualified by whether these lower ratings were observed initially (when the first PEs were registered at initial threat omissions, meaning that safety learning should be relatively slowed down by fasting) or on average or later during a safety learning experiment (which could indicate that learning under fasting was relatively quicker/more successful).</p>
<p>Following upon this, in L74, the conclusion from observations of lower levels of relief during avoidance and faster decline in relief during extinction in the previous study that &quot;overnight fasting decreased the reward value of safety (less relief pleasantness)&quot; may be wrong if the faster decline and the resulting lower average levels of relief were the consequence of a higher initial PE in the fasting group, as would be expected from the Rescorla-Wagner rule. If the latter were the case, this would suggest that subjects actually registered more safety (a higher discrepancy to their threat expectation) in early trials. This could also explain why fasting sped up extinction in that study (see Abstract). It might also explain why &quot;effective avoidance&quot; (L64) was at least maintained (although it should actually also be sped up). It might make less parsimonious explanations (&quot;fasting biases .. to focus on food at the expense of safety&quot;, L79), requiring the presence of a food source and a utility function of accepting a threat in the obtainment of food, unnecessary.</p>
<p>All this, however, rests on whether I think I have understood what the authors want to say about their relief measurements and the way the operationalized avoidance in the previous study.</p>
<p>More unclarities due to not giving full information: L91: &quot;... extinction and avoidance learning. Accordingly, human fMRI studies have found ... activations in the ventral striatum and the VTA during threat omissions that might contribute to establishing a new safety CS--&gt;noUS memory that reduces the initial fear response.&quot; However, in avoidance, it is an action that is reinforced by the US omission and hence an action--&gt;noUS memory that is being formed. The CS keeps its threat value acquired during the preceding conditioning phase, and the reduction of fear during CS presentations is contingent upon the exertion of the avoidance action.</p>
<p>L99: &quot;Because overnight fasting decreased relief rating particularly during omissions after safety signals&quot;. Again, if a US is omitted after a safety signal (an extinguished CS or a CS-), there should be no PE and no relief. If there were still relief ratings at US omission after a safety signal, this would suggest extinction did not fully work or differential conditioning was not successful. In any case, it is not clear at all why relief was specifically decreased during omissions after safety signals and not (and much more so) during omissions after threat signals, where there is clearly a PE. If this was not the case, one has to wonder if something went wrong in the discovery study.</p>
<p>The paragraph starting L103 and the associated figure 1 could be a bit more precise and give a bit more information in order to provide the reader a proper understanding of key experimental manipulations, in particular the ART task. Please define abbreviations &quot;CS+unav&quot;, &quot;CS+av&quot;. L108 ff.: One gets the impression there is only one CS+, whereas there are two. Say explicitly that one CS+ remains unavoidable during the Avoidance phase (CS+unav). What is the purpose of this stimulus? Do participants learn during the Avoidance phase that the CS+unav is unavoidable and the CS+av is avoidable or is this instructed? Do participants have to press the button within a certain time after CS+unav onset in order to avoid the US, or with a certain force? Is avoidance in case of successful button pressing deterministic or probabilistic? Say that the frame with the non-lit lamp is the ITI.</p>
<p>Relief ratings (Figure 1b): The rating says &quot;How pleasant was the relief that you felt?&quot;. That is, the experimenter insinuates that the participant will have felt relief and only wants to know how pleasant that relief was. The subjects has no chance to indicate there was no relief. This may be the reason why, in the discovery study, subjects indicated relief to safe stimuli, see above. Why did the authors not simply ask about the degree of relief felt, which would give a subject the chance to say there was no relief? I think this is a major flaw.</p>
<p>L119: &quot;We previously found that overnight fasting reduces avoidance and relief mostly to a safe CS-.&quot; If this is really the only thing that the authors found, then the fasting manipulation in their previous study failed to modulate avoidance of CS+s and the PE signaling at the time of US omissions after CS+s, that is, after actual threat stimuli. The procedure then clearly is not suited to study influences of fasting on avoidance learning. Whatever it does manipulate, it is not relief-based avoidance learning.</p>
<p>L130: It makes absolutely no sense to hypothesize that a manipulation reducing relief in extinction learning will decrease activation in the neural PE circuitry at the time of US omission more after the CS- than after the CS+. Of course, the PE is highest when the US is not given after the CS+, and this is where any relief manipulation should have an effect. As said above, the authors must also specify their hypothesis with respect of timing (early or late extinction? See the animal papers cited above.)</p>

<p>The authors repeated a previous behavioural study on the effects of overnight fasting on avoidance and extinction learning in healthy female participants in the 3T MRI scanner. Previous behavioural findings were replicated only in part. Fasting related changes of fMRI signals were less than expected.</p>
<p>This paper is not without interest. Anxiety disorders are very frequent, and there is still a need to better understand ways to improve extinction and reduced avoidance. The authors follow up on previous observations of their group using overnight fasting. The findings, however, were largely negative, and it is difficult to tell how robust the observed positive findings are. The paradigm did not work as well as expected in the MR scanner.</p>
<p>Introduction/main hypothesis: The reviewer does not understand why a smaller reward prediction error should result in faster extinction learning? The opposite should be the case. Plus, how much of a reward prediction error is expected in the CS- condition in extinction training? Here the US omission is expected. The reviewer may miss a key concept of the study.</p>
<p>Results: A major part of the behavioural data of a previous pure behavioural study was not reproduced (avoidance learning), plus many of the MRI findings did not show a difference between the fasting and re-feed groups. Given the large amount of comparisons it makes one wonder how robust the presented findings are. The advances to the field are therefore limited.</p>

<p>We thank the editor and reviewers for the time they spent reviewing our manuscript entitled ‘Overnight fasting facilitates safety learning by changing the neurophysiological response to relief from threat omission’ which was sent as an original paper for a potential publication in eLife.</p>
<p>Since we take the reviewer comments at heart and recognize the very complex scenario of our previous and current results we will take more time to re-think the paper. This time will serve us to look back to the interpretation of the results of our previous behavioral study, to the preregistration plan as well as findings of our current fMRI (replication) study.</p>
<p>We aim to address the fundamental issues indicated by the reviewers as soon and as clearly as possible.</p>
