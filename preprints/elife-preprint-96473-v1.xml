<title>Abstract</title><p>Dietary factors play a pivotal role in regulating metabolism in both health and disease. Lipid metabolism is particularly important for organismal health and longevity. However, the mechanisms by which dietary factors influence lipid metabolism remain poorly understood. Here, using the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model system, we investigated the influence of distinct bacterial diets on fat metabolism. We found that dietary vitamin B12 activates the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthetic pathways. This activation leads to elevated levels of PC, which in turn suppresses the expression of the gene <italic>fat-7</italic> and modulates lipid droplet dynamics through the regulatory proteins SBP-1/SREBP1 and SEIP-1/SEIPIN, respectively. Additionally, we identified a feedback loop involving SBP-1-mediated regulation of acid sphingomyelinase ASM-3, which enhances the production of phospho-choline and further stimulates PC synthesis. Our localization studies further suggest that ASM-3 may act as a signaling mediator between the intestine and coelomocytes, coordinating their roles in vitamin B12-mediated fat regulation. Overall, our findings shed new light on the complex interplay between diet and metabolic regulation, with a particular emphasis on the central role of phosphatidylcholine.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Dietary factors are increasingly recognized as key players in the onset and prevention of major diseases, such as cancers, coronary heart diseases, and diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Recent research indicates that diet not only shapes nutrient intake but also influences the intestinal microbiome, and microbiome-derived metabolites, in turn, impact organismal metabolism and immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, the direct or indirect mechanisms through which dietary composition influences host gene expression, biological processes, and physiological states in most cases remain unclear. The nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> serves as an excellent model for dietary studies due to its well-characterized genetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, conserved metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and simplified feeding regimen consisting of a bacterial monoculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Recent work in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has uncovered several mechanisms by which diet modulates important physiological processes, such as growth rate and longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 is synthesized by some bacteria and archaea, but not by plants or animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Thus, B12 is transferred to and accumulated inside the body through dietary sources or microbial interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. B12 exerts its influence primarily through two distinct pathways to regulate physiology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Pathway I regulates the one-carbon (1C) cycle that promotes the synthesis of the methyl donor group S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). Through the methylation of DNA, histones and other proteins, SAM levels influence many physiological processes including growth rate, and fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Pathway II promotes the breakdown of toxic propionyl-CoA, an intermediate in the catabolism of odd-number fatty acids and branched-chain amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Through these metabolic effects, B12 promotes faster development and affects lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>An intricate system of lipogenesis, lipolysis, lipophagy, lipid transport, and lipid utilization contributes to lipid homeostasis, which is crucial for a wide range of physiological functions such as energy storage, membrane structure, signaling transduction, and lipid-based hormone production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Apart from direct dietary lipid intake, the mechanistic impact of other diet components on organismal lipid metabolism remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying dietary control of host lipid metabolism, using <italic>C. elegans</italic> fed one of two distinct bacteria diets. Lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses pointed to a pivotal role for <italic>fat-7,</italic> a gene encoding a Î9 fatty acid desaturase, in the striking reduction in organismal lipid content we observed when worms were fed a non-canonical bacterial diet. Mechanistically, we show that dietary vitamin B12, enriched in one bacterial diet but not the other, stimulates SAM production and phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. In turn, the SAM-PC axis negatively regulates <italic>fat-7</italic> in a SBP-1-dependent manner, leading to suppressed lipogenesis in response to dietary vitamin B12. Elevated PC levels impact intestinal lipid droplet (LD) dynamics by hindering the recruitment of SEIP-1 to peri-LD cages. We also show that signaling orchestrated by the acid sphingomyelinase, ASM-3 converges at the PC synthesis pathway to further bolster B12-mediated lipid reduction. Altogether, our data elucidate how the micronutrient B12 from bacteria utilizes PC as the convergence point for multiple regulatory pathways to tune lipid homeostasis in response to diets, providing valuable insights for dietary interventions in managing lipid related disorders.</p>

<title>Diet affects host lipid level</title>
<p>To study how host lipid homeostasis is influenced by diets, we measured the lipid content of <italic>C. elegans</italic> fed two different bacterial diets â <italic>Comamonas aquatica</italic> DA1877 (hereafter referred to as DA) or the standard <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50 (hereafter, OP) - using Oil Red O (O.R.O) staining and thin layer chromatography (TLC). We found that DA-fed worm had a significantly decreased level of neutral lipids, including triacylglycerol (TAG), in comparison to OP-fed worms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref>).</p>

<p>Decreased food intake is known to reduce organismal lipid content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. To examine whether the altered lipid level we observed in DA-fed worms is caused by a discrepancy in food intake, we measured the pharyngeal pumping rate of worms fed each of the bacterial diets and found them to be very similar (Supplementary Figure S1A). Given that <italic>C. elegans</italic> gustatory and olfactory perceptions have been shown to play active roles in regulating lipid content<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, we also tested whether the reduced lipid content is mediated by the sensing of DA by amphid neurons. The lipid content in <italic>daf-6</italic> mutants - in which the formation of amphid sheath cells is abnormal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> - is comparable with wild-type worms across both diet conditions (Supplementary Figure S1B), suggesting that neuronal sensing of bacteria was not responsible for the observed effect.</p>
<p>To understand the mechanism underlying the regulation of host lipid content triggered by DA, we examined the gene expression changes elicited by the two different bacterial diets in young adult animals by RNA-seq. Strikingly, we found 1811 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; â¥2 or â¤-2 fold; <italic>Padj</italic> &lt; 0.01) between worms fed the two different bacterial diets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). KEGG pathway analysis revealed the DEGs are enriched in fatty acid metabolism (<italic>P value</italic> = 8.84E-8). We examined a comprehensive list of 471 lipid metabolic genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and found by principal component analysis (PCA) that these genes exhibited clear separation in DA- and OP-fed worms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, 13 out of the 16 lipid metabolic pathways are affected by DA diet (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In particular, genes related to the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids showed a significant decrease in expression in DA-fed worms. For example, the delta-(9) fatty acid desaturases , <italic>fat-5</italic> and <italic>fat-7</italic>, (which convert fatty acids 16:0 to 16:1n7 and 18:0 to 18:1n9, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>) decreased to 33.6% and 13.3% of their original expression in DA-fed animals, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, E</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we assessed the fatty acid composition of worms fed the two diets using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Intriguingly, the amount of total fatty acids is not altered between the OP and DA diets-fed worms (Supplementary Figure S1C); rather, diet appears to substantially influence the relative levels of different fatty acid species. We found that DA results in a lower abundance of cyclopropane fatty acids (17:0 delta and 19:0 delta) and higher levels of odd- chain fatty acids (15:0 and 17:0) in the worms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). While the major saturated fatty acids, palmitic acid (16:0) and stearic acid (18:0), are at a similar level between DA- and OP- fed worms, the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) differs strikingly: accounting for 51.8% of the total fatty acid in DA-fed worms <italic>vs.</italic> 22.7% in OP-fed animals. Specifically, the level of monounsaturated n7 fatty acids, including 16:1n7 and 18:1n7, increase significantly, whereas the 18:1n9 species decreases in response to DA. Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> produced PUFAs from 18:1n9, as expected we also found that most polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) (18:2, 18:3, 20:3, 20:4) are at the lower level in DA-fed animals compared to OP ones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether the distinct fatty acid patterns are caused by direct ingestion of dietary lipids, we examined the fatty acid composition of DA and OP bacteria. The results indicated that the major fatty acid species present in both bacteria is 16:0 which comprises an average of 43.2% of the total fatty acid in DA, lower than its 47.0% in OP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, DA had undetectable level of cyclopropane fatty acid, while it was enriched in 16:1n7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Since cyclopropane fatty acids are only produced in bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, it is likely that the low level of these compounds in DA-fed worms are attributable to their absence in the dietary bacteria. Likewise, it is plausible that the plentiful 16:1n7 in DA worms was obtained from the diet and further elongated to 18:1n7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In contrast, both DA and OP bacteria have undetectable levels of oleic acid (18:1n9) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>), pointing to altered worm lipid metabolic pathways as the likely explanation for the observed decrease in 18:1n9 in response to DA diet. Taken together, while there are some specific instances in which dietary lipid content might explain certain observed host lipid metabolism effects, it appears that the majority of the observed changes are due to other, indirect effect of diet on organismal physiology.</p>

<title>Genetic screen for modulators of diet-mediated lipid content</title>
<p>Our combined transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed that worms have significantly reduced expression of <italic>fat-7</italic> and its product, oleic acid (18:1n9) in response to the DA diet (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, E, F), which we validated by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and in worms expressing a FAT-7::GFP translational reporter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>fat-7</italic> in the intestine of DA-fed worms increased their lipid content, while <italic>fat-7(wa36)</italic> mutant animals fed OP bacteria exhibited reduced lipid content (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These data demonstrate the sufficiency and necessity of <italic>fat-7</italic> for the observed diet-mediated changes in lipid content.</p>

<p>To dissect how <italic>fat-7</italic> responds to the DA diet to regulate lipid content, we employed a forward genetic screen to identify genes that mediate the downregulation of FAT-7::GFP in the context of the DA diet (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We used ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) to mutagenize the <italic>fat-7</italic> reporter strain, DMS303, screened â¼19,022 haploid genomes, and isolated F2 mutants with high GFP reporter intensity on the DA diet. By whole genome sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and EMS density mapping, we identified three mutants, <italic>pmp-5(tp217)</italic>, <italic>sams-1(tp219)</italic> and <italic>cept-1(tp218),</italic> that suppressed diet-mediated <italic>fat-7</italic> repression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), and verified their effect on <italic>fat-7</italic> transcript levels using the available mutants by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure S2A).</p>
<p>Our screen identified the 1C cycle gene <italic>sams-1</italic>, which converts the methionine into S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), highlighting the importance of the 1C cycle in response to DA for <italic>fat-7</italic> repression. Using LC-MS, we found that DA-fed worms contain more 1C cycle metabolites- including methionine, SAM and S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) - than OP-fed animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), in agreement with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, DA bacteria contain less methionine than OP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that direct dietary methionine supplementation is not responsible for the observed shift in 1C metabolism. Another hit from our screen, <italic>pmp-5</italic> (homolog of human ABCD4), encodes a vitamin B12 transporter that transports B12 out of lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, B12 is the critical cofactor for the enzymes involving in canonical propionyl-CoA breakdown and the 1C cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Notably, DA has been reported as a B12-rich bacterium compared to OP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, hinting at the possibility that the DA diet might boost dietary B12 levels. In addition to <italic>pmp-5</italic> and <italic>sams-1</italic>, our screen also hit the PC synthesis gene, <italic>cept-1</italic>, which encodes choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase, converting CDP-choline into phosphatidyl-choline (PC) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). SAM serves as the methyl group donor for converting phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine in the PC synthesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, promoting us to hypothesize that PC synthesis pathway might act downstream of the B12-stimulated 1C cycle to influence <italic>fat-7</italic> expression.</p>
<p>To test the involvement of our hypothesized B12-SAM-PC pathway, we supplemented B12 to OP-fed worms. Strikingly, B12 supplementation was sufficient to suppress FAT-7::GFP expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Next, we tested each phase of the B12-SAM-PC axis by supplementing B12 to the mutants we isolated from the forward genetic screen, showing that B12-mediated downregulation of FAT-7::GFP is completely abrogated in <italic>pmp-5</italic>, <italic>sams-1,</italic> or <italic>cept-1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2B). Moving beyond the screen hits, we employed mutants of a key enzyme of the PC synthesis pathway, <italic>pcyt-1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, and observed that these mutants were unable to repress <italic>fat-7</italic> mRNA expression in response to the DA diet or B12 supplementation (Supplementary Figure S2C), and had reduced PC levels under both diet regimens (Supplementary Figure S2D). Using O.R.O staining, we found that B12 supplementation further reduced lipid content in DA-fed wild-type worms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). This effect was suppressed in <italic>sams-1</italic> and <italic>pcyt-1</italic> mutants fed with DA (Supplementary Figure S2E, F), indicating a clear role for B12, the SAM pathway and PC synthesis in the dietary regulation of lipid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>).</p>

<title>Phosphatidylcholine synthesis as a central pathway in lipid metabolic control</title>
<p>Consistent with the activation of the PC synthesis pathway in DA-fed worms, we found that the total PC level - and, in particular, the level of PC32, PC34, PC36 and PC38 - is also higher in DA-fed worms compared to OP-fed animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Supplementary Figure S2D, G). To determine whether PC levels have a causal effect on organismal lipid content, we supplemented worm diets with choline, the PC precursor, and uncovered a dose-dependent decrease in lipid content as measured by O.R.O staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These data suggest that the high PC level induced by DA diet is responsible for the reduced lipid content in the worms.</p>

<p>Previous studies from other species have indicated the rate-limiting PC synthesis enzyme PCYT-1 displays dynamic subcellular localization, and its catalytic activity is known to be regulated by membrane association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. To address whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> PCYT-1 localization, and therefore catalytic activity, is regulated by diet, we tagged the endogenous <italic>pcyt-1</italic> gene by CRISPR-Cas9 technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> to observe its subcellular localization using immunofluorescence. We found that endogenous PCYT-1 localizes to the nuclear envelope and nucleolus in the intestine of OP-fed worms, but relocalizes into the nucleoplasm in response to the DA diet (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the localization of PCYT-1 is differentially regulated by diets. Although the exact functional consequences of various PCYT-1 localization patterns are still unknown, it seems likely that the differential localization patterns of PCYT-1 reflect different PC demands under different dietary states. Importantly, the intranuclear localization of PCYT-1 in response to the DA diet agrees with the high PC levels that our model would suggest.</p>

<title>SBP-1 is the key transcription factor downstream of B12-SAM-PC axis</title>
<p>We reasoned that there must be transcription factors that function downstream of the SAM-PC axis to downregulate the expression of <italic>fat-7</italic> and thereby lower organismal lipid content in response to DA. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>fat-7</italic> expression has been shown to be regulated by SBP-1, NHR-49, NHR-80 and SKN-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In particular, low PC has been shown to promote nuclear translocation of SBP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, which prompted us to hypothesize that high PC in DA-fed worms may reduce <italic>fat-7</italic> expression by inhibiting <italic>sbp-1</italic>. We found that the FAT-7::GFP reporter expression was abolished in <italic>sbp-1</italic> mutants, irrespective of diet (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), pointing to the critical role of this transcription factor in regulating <italic>fat-7</italic>. The increased <italic>fat-7</italic> expression we observed in <italic>pmp-5, sams-1,</italic> and <italic>cept-1</italic> mutants isolated from our screen was suppressed by <italic>sbp-1</italic> RNAi treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Similarly, the increased lipid content in DA-fed <italic>pcyt-1</italic> mutants is abolished in <italic>sbp-1, pcyt-1</italic> double mutants (Supplementary Figure S2H). In addition, while we observed a drastic reduction of fat content in OP-fed worms lacking <italic>sbp-1</italic>, the DA-fed <italic>sbp-1</italic> mutants did not exhibit any further decrease in lipid contents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that DA-fed worms lack <italic>sbp-1</italic>-dependent lipogenesis. Intriguingly, our RNA-seq results showed that <italic>sbp-1</italic> was more highly expressed in DA-fed worms compared to OP-fed worms (DA/OP=1.60, <italic>Padj</italic> = 0.0074), implying that the reduction of SBP-1 activity is likely regulated post-translationally. Indeed, we observed less nuclear localization of a GFP::SBP-1 fusion reporter in DA-fed worms compared to OP-fed animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the changes in lipid content that we observed across diets are orchestrated by SBP-1 and B12-SAM-PC axis mutants acts through regulation of its nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>

<title>Diet regulates lipid droplets dynamics through SEIP-1</title>
<p>In addition to the changes we observed in PCYT-1 nuclear localization, we also detected PCYT-1 on lipid droplets (LDs) in OP-fed animals but not DA-fed worms (Supplementary Figure S3A). LDs store cellular lipids and are primarily present in the intestine of <italic>C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. To understand how LDs might contribute to the dietary regulation of lipid content, we examined the abundance and size distribution of LDs using confocal microscopy of the LD marker DHS-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> in worms expressing a DHS-3::GFP reporter. As expected, DHS-3::GFP displayed the characteristic LD morphology in intestinal cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). It is noted that the DHS-3::GFP rings were distributed more evenly in OP-fed animals, whereas clusters of rings were often observed in DA-fed animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, indicated as red arrowheads). Quantitative analysis of the number and the size distribution of LDs in different diet-fed animals by image processing and analysis with MATLAB revealed that DA-fed worms possess fewer and smaller LDs compared to those fed the OP diet (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, C). Taken together, we observe that the DA diet not only reduces total lipid content but also impacts the size and number of LDs in the intestine of <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

<p>SEIP-1, the evolutionarily conserved seipin protein, controls the morphology and biogenesis of LDs, and is known to be regulated by dietary lipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. This prompted us to ask whether SEIP-1 participates in the diet-mediated effects on LD dynamics we observed. Our RNA-seq analysis revealed that the DA diet decreases host <italic>seip-1</italic> expression (DA/OP=0.78, <italic>Padj</italic> = 0.015), and <italic>seip-1</italic> mutants have decreased total lipid content and number and size of LDs, compared to wild-type worms, on both diets (Supplementary Figure S3B, S3C). To further address how the DA diet affects the biogenesis of LDs via SEIP-1, we used mRuby2::DGAT-2 to mark the LDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and found that approximately 26% of LDs in the intestinal cells of OP-fed worms are surrounded by SEIP-1::GFP as peri-LD cages while only 14% of LDs in DA-fed young adult worms showed SEIP-1::GFP colocalization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, E). The reduced colocalization of SEIP-1 to LDs in response to DA diet suggests attenuation of LD emergence or subsequent expansion from the ER subdomains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, which agrees with our characterization of LD size and number (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B, C). Interestingly, the peri-LD localization of SEIP-1::GFP in DA-fed worms was boosted by RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>pcyt-1,</italic> the PC synthesis enzyme (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, G). Together, these data reveal that the DA diet represses SEIP-1 expression, reduces its targeting to peri-LD cages in a manner dependent on the PC synthesis pathway, and thereby inhibits the biogenesis of LDs and results in decreased fat content in worms.</p>

<title>Acid sphingomyelinase regulates fat content in DA-fed worms through PC</title>
<p>Our RNA-seq data indicated that the expression of acid sphingomyelinase (<italic>asm-3</italic>) â which produces Phospho-choline, a key metabolic intermediate in the PC synthesis pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> â is increased in DA-fed worms by ten-fold compared to OP-fed worms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We hypothesized that ASM-3 may participate in DA-mediated fat reduction by providing phospho-choline. We first confirmed the increase in <italic>asm-3</italic> expression with transcriptional and translational reporters (Supplementary Figure S4A). We found that the two available mutants of <italic>asm-3</italic> suppressed DA-mediated fat reduction, which could be rescued by overexpression of <italic>asm-3</italic> (Supplementary Figure S4B, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we analyzed <italic>asm-3; pcyt-1</italic> double mutants, finding that lipid content is not further increased by <italic>asm-3</italic> mutation in <italic>pcyt-1</italic> mutants upon DA feeding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggested to us that <italic>asm-3</italic> acts in the same genetic pathway as <italic>pcyt-1</italic>. Indeed, choline supplementation was sufficient to reduce fat content in DA-fed <italic>asm-3</italic> mutants (Supplementary Figure S4C), supporting the upstream regulatory role of <italic>asm-3</italic> on the PC synthesis pathway. Interestingly, we also found higher expression of <italic>fat-1</italic>, <italic>fat-2</italic>, <italic>fat-3</italic>, <italic>fat-5, fat-6,</italic> and <italic>fat-7</italic> in <italic>asm-</italic>3 mutants, indicating that fatty acid metabolism is broadly altered in DA-fed <italic>asm-3</italic> mutants (Supplementary Figure S4D). Altogether, the high PC level in DA-fed worms, which impacts LD dynamics and total lipid composition, results from a convergence of SAM and ASM-3 levels.</p>

<p>This prompted us to ask whether <italic>asm-3</italic> expression is regulated by the B12-SAM-PC axis. We found that supplementation of B12 to OP-fed worms was sufficient to drive expression of the ASM-3::GFP reporter or endogenous <italic>asm-3</italic> to higher levels as observed in DA-fed worms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, Supplementary Figure S5A). <italic>asm-3</italic> expression was significantly reduced in B12-SAM-PC axis mutants (<italic>pmp-5(tm5497)</italic>, <italic>sams-1(ok3033), cept-1(et10),</italic> and <italic>pcyt-1(et9)</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, Supplementary Figure S5B, C). Since ASM-3 participates in PC synthesis pathway by producing the intermediate metabolite, phospho-choline, these results suggest <italic>asm-3</italic> may auto-regulate itself. Indeed, we found that <italic>asm-3</italic> expression is decreased in <italic>asm-3</italic> mutants under DA feeding when compared to wild-type worms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, we found that <italic>asm-3</italic> expression is slightly increased in <italic>sbp-1(ep79)</italic> mutants feeding DA (Supplementary Figure S5D).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results reveal the importance of the B12-SAM-PC axis for regulating <italic>asm-3</italic> expression, and suggest that <italic>asm-3</italic> constructs a positive feedback loop to potentiate PC levels. Using an ASM-3::mCherry reporter, we noted that ASM-3 protein is detectable not only in intestinal cells, exclusively in the middle and posterior sections of the intestine (Supplementary Figure S4A), but also in scavenger coelomocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Specifically, by introducing a lysosomal marker, LMP-1::GFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, we found that ASM-3 is localized in the lysosomes of coelomocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Human ASM is known to be expressed in both an endolysosomal (L-ASM) and secretory (S-ASM) form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, and we wondered whether secretion of intestinally-expressed ASM-3 could be the source of the observed coelomocyte ASM-3 localization. Using the intestine-specific <italic>vha-6</italic> promoter to drive <italic>asm-3</italic> expression, we were still able to detect ASM-3 in intestinal cells, pseudocoelomic fluid, and coelomocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, Supplementary Figure S6A), indicating that <italic>asm-3</italic> is transcribed and translated in the intestine, and later enters pseudocoelomic fluid and coelomocytes by secretion. To decipher whether ASM-3 functions in coelomocytes to regulate fat content, we expressed <italic>asm-3</italic> using the coelomocyte-specific <italic>unc-122</italic> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figure S6B), or the intestine-specific <italic>vha-6</italic> promoter. Strikingly, coelomocytes-restricted or intestine-restricted expression of <italic>asm-3</italic> were both sufficient to reduce fat content in <italic>asm-3</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These results suggest that ASM-3 may signal from the intestine to coelomocytes to regulate <italic>C. elegans</italic> lipid content in response to diet. Together, our data pointed out the importance of the coelomocyte localization of ASM-3 on fat regulation under high B12 diet in worms.</p>

Previous studies from <italic>C. elegans</italic> have illuminated that elevated dietary B12 accelerates 1C cycle activity and reroutes propionate breakdown, thus driving host metabolic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Our study corroborates and extends this understanding by pinpointing a Î9 fatty acid desaturase, <italic>fat-7,</italic> as a key factor and revealing the intricate mechanisms through which B12 regulates lipid homeostasis. These results offer valuable insights that may inform research and therapeutic strategies for metabolic disorders by targeting B12-impacted cellular pathways.</p>
<p>Our study showed that the DA diet or B12 supplementation promotes the levels of PC, which in turn exert multifaceted effects on fat regulation, such as modulating lipogenic gene expression via SBP-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-G</xref>) and affecting LD budding and expansion via SEIP-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-G</xref>). Interestingly, PC is known to be one of the primary components of lipoprotein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and is critical for very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. This suggests the intriguing possibility that high PC may also promote TAG export. In circumstantial support of this notion, our RNA-seq analysis indicated that <italic>dsc-4</italic> (the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of the large subunit of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and five apoB-like genes ( <italic>vit-2</italic>, <italic>vit-3, vit-4, vit-5,</italic> and <italic>vit-6</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> ) are upregulated in DA-fed worms compared to OP-fed ones (data not shown), suggesting the possibility that the secretion of TAG may be highly activated in response to the DA diet. Further work will be required to elucidate the effects of dietary B12 on TAG export through the lipoprotein pathway, and whether this depends on PC.</p>
<p>In addition to the regulatory effect that PC exerts on LD biogenesis, previous work has also implicated cyclopropane fatty acids (FAs) and specific PUFAs in SEIP-1 enrichment at peri-LD cages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Our LC-MS results indicated that cyclopropane FA levels are undetectable in DA bacteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Since <italic>C. elegans</italic> are unable to synthesize cyclopropane FAs and rely on dietary sources for these compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, DA-fed worms have a lower abundance of cyclopropane FAs, in addition to reduced levels of most PUFAs, compared to OP-fed worms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We therefore speculate that the decreased targeting of SEIP-1 to peri-LD cages in DA-fed worms may be partly explained by the lower levels of cyclopropane FAs and PUFAs. Further, <italic>C. elegans</italic> use cyclopropane FAs for a substantial portion of the TAGs they produce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible that lower levels of cyclopropane FAs in DA-fed worms may also impede TAG synthesis, resulting in overall reduced lipid content (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, B). Together, these results suggest the possibility that the altered lipid homeostasis we observed, while principally driven by the high B12 level provided by DA, may also be influenced by other dietary components like cyclopropane FAs and PUFAs contributed by DA.</p>
<p><italic>sams-1</italic>, responsible for the conversion of methionine to SAM, is upregulated in worms fed DA, leading to higher SAM levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). SAM serves as a universal methyl donor, providing a methyl group for PC synthesis, DNA, and histone methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Loss of <italic>sams-1</italic> significantly increases fat content by more than three-folds (Supplementary Figure S2E); given its pleiotropic role in many metabolic pathways, this suggests that <italic>sams-1</italic> likely modulates fat content in DA-fed worms through multiple pathways beyond the PC synthesis. Indeed, this is further supported by our observation that mutants of histone methyltransferases SET-2 and SET-30 (which install H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, respectively) exhibited elevated lipid content on DA diet (data not shown). Notably, while both <italic>set-2</italic> and <italic>set-30</italic> mutants had this effect, only <italic>set-2</italic> appears to control <italic>fat-7</italic> expression (data not shown), implying a vast network of lipid metabolism regulatory mechanisms governed by SAM.</p>
<p>Through our implication of <italic>asm-3</italic> coelomocyte activity in regulating lipid content, our findings established a role for coelomocytes in diet-mediated lipid homeostasis. Earlier studies have indicated the engagement of coelomocytes in starvation-induced fat mobilization and lifespan extension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Together, these findings support the notion that coelomocytes can integrate nutritional cues to influence fat metabolism. We also provided evidence for inter-tissue communication of ASM-3 signaling from expression in intestinal cells to action in coelomocytes, opening up new avenues of research into intercellular communication in the dietary control of metabolism.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results reveal that dietary vitamin B12, enriched in the DA bacteria diet, stimulates the SAM-PC axis to inhibit lipogenesis in a <italic>sbp-1</italic>-dependent manner and upregulate <italic>asm-3</italic> expression, together resulting in reduced lipid content and reduced LD biogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). The diet-induced metabolic rewiring underscores the complex networks of cellular and organismal metabolic control, highlights the major effect of micronutrients on primary metabolism, and paves the way for future insights into dietary supplementation and metabolic disease.</p>

<title>EMS mutagenesis and mutation identification</title>
<p>The whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based mutation identification strategy was followed according to Zuryn <italic>et al</italic>. 2010 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In brief, DA-fed L4 worms were collected into 15 mL centrifuge tubes and washed with ddH<sub>2</sub>O for three times to reduce bacterial contaminants. The worms were then incubated in 50mM Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) (Sigma, M0880) under room temperature (RT) with constant rotation for four hours. After EMS treatment, the worms were recovered for two hours. Then the recovered worms were placed on new large DA1877-seeded NGM plate (P0s, two worms on each plate). After 16 hours, P0s were removed from the plates, and their offspring were incubated under 20 Â°C until F2 progenies (F2s) reached adulthood. F2s with high GFP intensity were selected and cloned. The F3 progeny were scored to remove the false positives. Then, the isolated mutants were subjected to complementation tests. The endogenous <italic>fat-7</italic> mRNA level of the mutants was further validated using qRT-PCR. Next, the selected mutants were backcrossed to the non-mutagenized parental strain, DMS303, for 4-5 times to remove the background mutations.</p>
<p>For mutation identification, recombinants were collected after the backcross processes and their genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted by using DNeasyÂ® Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, #69504) following the manufacturerâs protocol. The gDNA libraries were constructed by using Illumina TruSeqÂ® Nano DNA Library Preparation kit (#FC-121-9010DOC) according to the manufacturerâs protocol, with two amplification cycles. The paired-end WGS (2 x 150 bp) was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina).

<p>Oil Red O (O.R.O) staining was conducted as previously described with some modification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. In brief, O.R.O solution (Sigma, O1391) was pre-filtered by 0.22 um filter and rocked on platform shaker, then diluted to 60% with water and placed on shaker overnight at room temperature. Next day, young adult worms were harvested into 1.5 mL tubes using S buffer (0.1 M NaCl, 0.0065 M K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 0.0435 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and washed 3 times to reduce bacterial contamination. 500 Î¼L of 60% isopropanol was added to fix the worms and let them settle to the bottom by gravity in order to remove the supernatant. Subsequently, 500 Î¼L of 60% O.R.O solution, which was filtered again using 0.22 um filter to prevent precipitation before adding into worm samples, was added into worm pellet. After gentle inversion, worm samples were placed in a wet chamber away from light on a shaker at 25Â°C for 8-10 hours. Then, the O.R.O solution was substituted by 250 Î¼L of S buffer with 0.01% Triton-X 100 and the samples were stored at 4Â°C. Worms were mounted on glass slides directly and the images were captured by Zeiss Axioplan microscopy within three days.

Next, the worm pellet was washed using 30mM NaN3 for three times and collected into the homogenizer tube with 100 Î¼L of Zirconia beads (BioSpec, #11079110zx), followed by immediate immersion in liquid nitrogen for at least 1 hour. The samples were homogenized using Precellys Evolution (Bertin) with a program setting containing three cycles of 6400 rpm 20 seconds, 10 second rest and 6400 rpm 20 seconds again; whereas for bacteria OP50 or DA1877, samples were transferred into VK01 microorganism lysis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and homogenized with a program setting consisting of 10 cycles of 9500 rpm for 30 seconds, rest in machine for 60 seconds, 9500 rpm for 30 seconds and rest on ice for 60 seconds. After homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 mins (worms) or 4000 rpm for 20 minutes (bacteria) at 4Â°C. Worm lysates were transferred into glass tube and a small portion of lysate was used to measure the concentration of total protein by BCA<sup>TM</sup> Protein Assay Kit (PIERCE). Next, 2 mL ice-cold (-20Â°C) chloroform-methanol mixture (2:1, v/v) and 20ul of the internal control (FA13:0) were added to samples for lipid extraction.

For GFP::SBP-1, Leica Stellaris 8 confocal microscopy was used and Tau-gating function is applied to reduce autofluorescence interference in the intestine.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence staining</title>
<p>Immunofluorescence staining was performed using the whole-mount fixation method previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> with formaldehyde solution (Sigma, F8775). Primary antibodies used were anti-FLAG (Sigma, F3165) at 1:250 and anti-GFP (abcam, ab6556) at 1:200. Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen A11001), anti-mouse Rhodamine Red-X (RRX)-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 715-296-150), anti-rabbit Fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 711-095-152), and all were used at 1:200. Samples were mounted using VECTASHIELD Plus antifade mounting media (Vector Labs, H-1900) with DAPI at the final concentration of 2ug/ml. The images were acquired using Zeiss LSM780 Confocal Microscopy System and processed using Image J<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Identical exposure time and setting for brightness and contrast adjustment were applied for the same set of experiments.</p>

<title>RNA interference</title>
<p>RNA interference (RNAi) was performed by feeding worms with bacteria expressing dsRNA as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> with some modification. In brief, the NGM plates for an RNAi experiment contains 25ug/ml ampicillin and 1 mM IPTG. RNAi clones were obtained from the Ahringer RNAi library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> or by cloning the genomic region of the target gene into RNAi vector L4440, followed by transformation of the RNAi-compatible OP50(xu363) strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> and culturing in LB medium with 25ug/ml ampicillin until the OD600 reached 1.5 to 1.8. Then, 200 Î¼L of the bacteria was spread onto each RNAi- NGM plate and left at RT for two days before use. For DA-fed RNAi knockdown experiments, we cultured DA1877 to the OD600 of 1.5 to 1.8 and then homogenized DA1877 by Precellys Evolution (Bertin) using the VK01 microorganism kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10 cycles of 9500 rpm for 30 seconds, resting for 60 seconds, 9500 rpm for 30 seconds and resting on ice for 60 seconds. The DA1877 lysate was mixed with RNAi clone-containing OP50<italic>(xu363)</italic> at a ratio of 1:1. 400 Î¼L of the mixture were seeded on each RNAi- NGM plate.</p>

<title>B12 and Choline supplementation</title>
<p>Choline Chloride (Sigma, 26978) was freshly dissolved in ddH2O at a concentration of 3 M and sterilized through a 0.22Î¼m filter. The choline solution was then added into autoclaved NGM at a final concentration of 15 mM, 30 mM or 60 mM. Choline plates were placed at RT overnight and seeded with bacterial culture before use. The worms were cultured on choline-supplemented NGM plates for 3 generations before analysis.</p>
<p>Vitamin B12 was dissolved in ddH2O to make a stock solution of 64mM (Sigma, V2876). The B12 stock was then diluted to 32nM with water and 200ul were spread on each 6 cm NGM plate with seeded bacteria. The plates were allowed to dry for 30 mins in a laminar flow hood until the B12 solution was completely absorbed by NGM. Notably, B12 is photodegradable and therefore all B12 experiments were performed in the dark.</p>

<title>CRISPR-Cas-9 Knock-in</title>
<p>The CRISPR-Cas-9 genomic knock-in method was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. In brief, the crRNA, tracrRNA (#1072532) and Cas9 protein (#1081060) were all purchased from IDT, Coralville, Iowa, USA. The crRNA sequence for PCYT-1::3xFLAG is ATATGAAGTTAATACTCCAA and for GFP::SBP-1 is CAGAATGAACGAAGAATTCG.</p>
<p>The crRNA and tracrRNA were dissolved in IDTE (10mM Tris, 0.1mM EFTA) and IDT- duplex buffer (30mM HEPE, pH7.5; 100mM potassium acetate), respectively, at a concentration of 0.4ug/ul. Regarding to the insertion template, single-stranded DNA oligos were used for PCYT-1::3xFLAG. The sequence was <italic>C. elegans-</italic>codon optimized and ordered from IDT (standard desalting; 4 nmol Ultramer) as the following: GAATCAAAAAAATACGTTTTTAGGTCAAGAGCTGAAAAATATGAAGTTACTTATCATCGTCATCCTTATAGTCGATATCGTGGTCTTTATAGTCACCATCGTGATCTTTGTAGTC ATACTCCAAAGGAGTCTTTGCCTTATTTCTAGAGGACCTTTTCTTCACG. For GFP::SBP-1, an asymmetric-hybrid dsDNA cocktail was generated using pYW1808 as the template and amplified with two sets of primers : sbp-1_repair_F / sbp-1_repair_R and 97.75_gfp_F / 95.75_gfp_R.</p>

<p>This a <bold>useful</bold> study that reports a genetic regulatory network that accounts for altered lipid metabolism in response to two different bacterial diets of C. elegans. The proposed mechanism, linking vitamin B12, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and neutral lipid levels, is <bold>solid</bold> but has been previously demonstrated by other studies using similar assays. The evidence to support a new layer of regulation, via the production of phospho-choline by ASM-3/acid sphingomyelinase, requires further substantiation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper reports the finding that less fat accumulates in C. elegans that are feeding on Comamonas aquatica DA1877 (DA) vs the standard lab diet of Escherichia coli OP50 (OP50). While these bacteria are likely to be different in many ways, the authors found that fat accumulation phenotype depends on the vitamin B12 content of the bacterial diet and the involvement of B12 in the methionine cycle, affecting SAMS-1 and phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. They report that low PC levels activate SREBP-1 (SBP-1 in C. elegans) and that an important target of SBP-1 is the delta 9 desaturase FAT-7. Finally, they describe a role for ASM-3, an acid sphingomyelinase, in influencing PC synthesis and fat accumulation in the worm.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a comprehensive story about how a dietary change affects fat accumulation in C. elegans. Their experimental evidence is convincing. The most novel aspect of this paper is that the coelomecyte expression of asm-3 contributes to PC/TAG homeostasis in C. elegans, which most likely occurs through the production of phosphocholine by the enzymatic breakdown of sphingomyelin by ASM-3. The phosphocholine will provide precursors for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, contributing to the PC synthesis pathway.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the way the story is presented, the authors tend to imply that they discovered the pathways of B12, PC, SBP-1, and FAT-7, ignoring some important studies describing the relationship between PC synthesis and TAG accumulation in both the mammalian lipid metabolism field (liver) as well as in C. elegans. Many previous studies with similar results are not cited appropriately. Thus, the pathways reported in the paper are not new, and in this sense, the work is mostly confirmatory.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Han et al. present a manuscript focusing on difference metabolism and the regulatory circuits controlling it in C. elegans fed two bacterial diets. In the first three figures and a half figures, using a combination of methods, they investigate lipid levels, changes in gene expression and genetic assays to come to the conclusion that vitamin B12 acts through the S-adenosylmethioine synthase sams-1 to perturb phosphatidylcholine levels, which in turn stimulate the C. elegans ortholog of the SREBP transcription factors to activate fatty acid synthesis genes such as fat-7/SCD1. Thus, while connections between diet, metabolic pathways and gene regulation is of general interest, this study largely confirms the work of others without direct credit in many instances, then fails to develop a more novel cell non-autonomous link between the pathways in the last two figures. Thus, this study would be expected to have a useful impact on the field, if it can be placed in context of previously published work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Connections between diet, metabolic pathways and gene regulation is of general interest</p>
<p>
(2) Figures 1-4 confirm data/observations from previously published work from MacNeil, et al. Cell 2015; Walker, et al. Cell 2011; Svensk, et al. PLoS Genetics 2013; Smulan, et al. Cell Reports, 2016; Giese, et al. eLife 2020 and Qin, et al. Cell Reports 2022..</p>
<p>
(3) The data in figures 5 and 6 showing importance of non-cell autonomous effects on metabolism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In order to differentiate their study from previous work, it seems that the authors try to make the argument that PC is higher in Comomonas than E. coli, therefore they are looking at repression of SBP-1-dependent function, however, the pairing of the diets is arbitrary, and the comparisons could easily be reversed. They are simply comparing a higher to a lower level of PC, rather than a basal to a lower, thus the concepts are the same. In addition, they fail to cite the larger body of literature linking phospholipid balance to SREBP function. For example, multiple studies in mammalian models link phospholipid balance, not just lowered PC, to SREBP function: Lim, Genes and Dev 2011; Wang, et al. Cell Stem Cell, 2018; Rong, et al. J Clin Invest 2017; Smulan et al, Cell Reports, 2016; Dobrosotskaya, Science. 2002 and recently, Rong, et al. Cell Met 2024.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 1: For example, the data in figure 1, shows measures of lipid content, RNA seq showing changes in metabolic enzymes such as fat-7/SCD-1 and lipid levels have already been shown in MacNeil, et al. Cell 2013 (lipid levels and gene expression changes) and the lipid levels in Comomonas vs E. coli were published in Ditot, et al. Nature Communications 2022 by Dr. Marian Walhout's lab.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 2/3: In Figure 2 and 3, they use a genetic screen to find regulators of fat-7/scd1 expression, and unsurprisingly, pull out genes with known to regulate this pathway. The authors go on to show that changes in SAM lead to changes in PC, and affect SBP-1/SREBP-1-dependent lipogenesis. This is a well described pathway from publications by the Walhout lab, Dr. Amy Walker's lab and Dr. Marc Pilon's lab (Walker, et al. Cell 2011; Svensk, et al. PLoS Genetics 2013; Smulan, et al. Cell Reports, 2016; Giese, et al. eLife 2020) in addition to a recent publication, Qin, et al. Cell Reports 2022. While some of these studies are cited in other places in the manuscript, the authors describe their results as &quot;discovery&quot;, then fail to cite the relevant studies at those points (selected examples below</p>
<p>(4) Selected examples of citation issues:</p>
<p>a) Selected example: pg 6: &quot;To understand the mechanism underlying the regulation of host lipid content triggered by DA, we examined the gene expression changes elicited by the two different bacterial diets in young adult animals by RNA-seq...In particular, genes related to the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids showed a significant decrease in expression in DA-fed worms. For example, the delta-(9) fatty acid desaturases, fat-5 and fat-7, (which convert fatty acids 16:0 to 16:1n7 and 18:0 to 18:1n9, respectively32) decreased&quot;</p>
<p>MacNeil et al Cell 2013 published a transcriptomics comparing young adult DA and Op50, which demonstrated decreases in fat-5 and fat-7. While MacNeil is cited in other parts of the paper, since the authors have performed a highly similar experiment and obtained similar results, this should be described as confirming the MacNeil study rather than as new data.</p>
<p>b) Selected Example: pg 10: &quot;To determine whether PC levels have a causal effect on organismal lipid content, we supplemented worm diets with choline, the PC precursor, and uncovered a dose-dependent decrease in lipid content as measured by O.R.O staining (Figure 3B).&quot;</p>
<p>Addition of choline to supplement defects in PC synthesis was first shown by Brendza, et al. Biochem J 2007. It was confirmed in Walker, et al. 2011, and further confirmation of PC rescue show in Ding, et al. 2015. The Brendza study is not cited at all and while studies from the Walker lab are cited in other places, the authors omit that changes in the DA diet are the same as changes seen when choline rescues PC loss from other perturbations.</p>
<p>c) Selected Example: pg 9: &quot;Notably, DA has been reported as a B12-rich bacterium compared to OP16, hinting at the possibility that the DA diet might boost dietary B12 levels.&quot;</p>
<p>Reference 16 is Watson, et al. Cell 2015 where the Walhout lab demonstrates that DA does in fact act through the diet to alter the Met/SAM cycle and other B12 dependent processes in C. elegans. This paper, along with MacNeil above broke ground in linking B12 and the Met/SAM cycle to specific phenotypes in C. elegans, which was followed up by extensive work from the Walhout lab on this cycle, thus, it seems odd that the authors describe their own data as &quot;hinting&quot; at this connection.</p>
<p>d) Selected example: pg 17: &quot;Indeed, this is further supported by our observation that mutants of histone methyltransferases SET-2 and SET-30 (which install H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, respectively) exhibited elevated lipid content on DA diet (data not shown). Notably, while both set-2 and set-30 mutants had this effect, only set-2 appears to control fat-7 expression (data not shown)&quot;. Extensive work from Dr. Anne Brunet's lab (Greer, et al. Nature 2010; Greer, et al. Nature 2011; Han, et al. Nature 2017) link set-2 and H3K4 methylation to lipid accumulation and fat-7. The authors fail to cite these studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors presented data that linked vitamin B12, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis to lipid homeostasis in C. elegans. They confirmed mechanisms previously shown by other labs, including the regulation of FAT-7 expression by SBP-1, and the targeting of SEIP-1 by PC levels. The authors also attempted to link the synthesis of phospho-choline by the ASM-3 sphingomyelinase to PC synthesis and lipid homeostasis. However, the relative contribution of phospho-choline by ASM-3 versus the canonical Kennedy pathway was not elucidated. Therefore, the significance of the ASM-3-dependent mechanism to PC synthesis requires further investigation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used a wide range of biochemical and cell biological methods to measure fatty acid composition, neutral lipid levels, and lipid droplet dynamics in C. elegans. The quality of the data is generally high.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Data interpretation and the construction of the working model did not seem to take into account the two well-established pathways for PC synthesis. The Kennedy pathway generates PC from phospho-choline and DAG via a cytidine-based intermediate. The second PC synthesis pathway entails the methylation of PE by PEMT, with the donor methyl groups provided by the vitamin B12-dependent 1-carbon cycle. The authors' model seemed to overlook part of the Kennedy pathway that involves choline kinase (and not ASM-3) as the canonical enzyme that generates phospho-choline. The authors also did not explicitly consider DAG as a precursor of triacylglycerol (TAG), which was directly or indirectly measured as a readout of organismal fat content in the paper. Therefore, alternative models should be entertained. For example, the proposed genetic and dietary effects on lipid homeostasis could stem from the competition for a limiting pool of precursors that were shared by PC and TAG synthesis. PC itself may not have a deterministic role, as depicted by the authors' model. Finally, the claim that &quot;coelomocytes regulate diets-induced lipid homeostasis through asm-3&quot; was not well supported. In the absence of quantitative analysis of phospho-choline in mutants, it was unclear how much ASM-3 contributed to the overall phospho-choline, and ultimately PC level. The proposed inter-tissue regulation of PC synthesis also requires coelomocytes-specific knock-down/depletion of asm-3 for verification.</p>
