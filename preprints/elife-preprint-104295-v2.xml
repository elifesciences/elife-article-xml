<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The maintenance and control of the differentiation of adult stem cells are indispensable for living animals. In this decade, the relationship between the stem cell system and translation activity control has been revealed. Compared with that of differentiating progenitor cells, the global translation activity is relatively lowered in most adult and embryonic stem (ES) cells, and low translation activity is required for stem cells to maintain undifferentiated status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ni and Buszczak, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Saba et al., 2021</xref>). Despite this common feature of low translational activity, differences in the state of ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) have been observed across stem cell types. ES cells, hair follicle stem cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline stem cells (GSCs) are characterized by high levels of RiBi, whereas quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) express low levels of ribosomal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015</xref>). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have higher RiBi levels than differentiated bone marrow cells, but they have lower levels than their immediate progenitors, suggesting that cell type-specific mechanisms may regulate RiBi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jarzebowski et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, phenotypes of RiBi defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic> GSCs appear to be controversial; attenuation of Pol I activity and the U3 snoRNP complex member <italic>wiched</italic> (<italic>wcd</italic>) mutant show premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fichelson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), while knockdown of ribosome assembly and loss of DExD/H-box proteins that govern RiBi result in a loss of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Martin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the mechanisms by which RiBi is coupled to low translational activity and proper stem cell differentiation are still obscure.</p>
<p>By using an ENU mutagenesis screen to identify gonadogenesis defects in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Saito et al., 2011</xref>), we isolated a unique mutant, <italic>minamoto</italic> (<italic>moto</italic>), in which germ cells arrest at the early stage of spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kawasaki et al., 2016</xref>). By whole genome sequencing, we found that the <italic>moto</italic> phenotype is tightly linked to a mutation within a gene (ENSDARG00000090664) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bowen et al., 2012</xref>), which encodes the coiled-coil domain-containing protein Meioc. Database analysis shows orthologs of MEIOC in vertebrates and most invertebrates, but not in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The mouse MEIOC functions to maintain an extended meiotic prophase I with its binding partner YTHDC2 (YTH-domain containing 2), which is a 3’-5’ RNA helicase containing an RNA helicase motif and YT521-B homology (YTH) RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Soh et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, a complex of <italic>Drosophila bam</italic> (<italic>bag of marbles</italic>), a functional homolog of <italic>Meioc,</italic> and <italic>bgcn</italic> (<italic>benign gonial cell neoplasm</italic>), a paralog of <italic>Ythdc2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jain et al., 2018</xref>), plays a pivotal role in promoting stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Perinthottathil and Kim, 2011</xref>). Although zebrafish <italic>meioc</italic> (<italic>moto</italic>) is orthologous to the mice gene, it appears to be functionally similar to <italic>Drosophila bam</italic>, making it interesting to see how it controls the development of germ cells.</p>
<p>The present study revealed that zebrafish had spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) with low rRNA transcription, a characteristic that differed from many other stem cells, and that Meioc was required for upregulation of rRNA transcription and SSC differentiation. Independently of Ythdc2, Meioc regulated intracellular localization of the Argonaute/Piwi family protein Piwil1 (Piwi-like protein 1) that interacted with transcriptional silencing proteins, Setdb1 (Eggless) and HP1α (Cbx5). Our results suggested that low rRNA transcription maintained the undifferentiated state of zebrafish SSCs, providing a new insight on the relationship between the stem cell system and the RiBi control.</p>

<title>Failure to differentiate spermatogonia in the zebrafish <italic>meioc</italic> mutant</title>
<p>In fish testes, germ cells are surrounded by Sertoli cells within a basement membrane compartment and develop synchronously in cysts. Thus, the developmental stage of spermatogonia can be determined by the number of cells within the cyst (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Wild-type spermatogonial cells undergo 9 rounds of cell division before entering meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Leal et al., 2009</xref>), however <italic>moto<sup>t31533</sup></italic>mutant testes had only up to 3 rounds of division, containing 2-8 spermatogonia per cyst (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutant spermatogonia were positive for the undifferentiated spermatogonia marker, Plzf, which is expressed in single- to 8-cell (1-8-cell) cyst spermatogonia in the wild-type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ozaki et al., 2011</xref>), but negative for meiotic prophase I markers, Sycp1 and Sycp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Saito et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">2011</xref>). Histone H3 phospho-S10 immunostaining indicated that mutant spermatogonia proliferated, but apoptotic cells were increased in the mutant spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1A</xref>). In zebrafish, mutants disrupting early stages of oocyte development become male sex type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Saito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Houwing et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kamminga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rodríguez-Marí et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shive et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, no females and no oocytes developed in <italic>moto</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table S1 and Figure S1B</xref>), as completion of the pachytene stage of meiosis I are a pre-requisite for follicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Elkouby and Mullins, 2017</xref>). These results suggested that the <italic>moto<sup>t31533</sup></italic> mutant germ cells remained in an undifferentiated state.</p>

<p>By whole genome sequencing and genetic analysis, we found that the <italic>moto<sup>t31533</sup></italic> mutant phenotype was tightly linked to a mutation within the ortholog of mouse <italic>meioc</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bowen et al., 2012</xref>). Fish harboring the <italic>moto<sup>t31533</sup></italic> mutantion inherited the <italic>moto</italic> phenotypes described above for more than 10 generation. Furthermore, fish homozygous for another allele, <italic>moto<sup>sa13122</sup></italic>, exhibited the same gonadal phenotype as <italic>moto<sup>t31533</sup></italic> homozygotes, and <italic>moto<sup>sa13122</sup></italic> failed to complement <italic>moto<sup>t31533</sup></italic> confirming that these mutations disrupt the same gene (hereafter denoted <italic>meioc<sup>mo</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1D</xref>). Both mutations encode a truncated protein that lack the conserved coiled-coil domain (PF15189). We searched for paralogues of <italic>meioc</italic> gene using PF15189 domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1C</xref>) but were not able to find another gene in the zebrafish reference genome assembly GRCz11 (version 111.11). We then generated an antibody against the N-terminus of Meioc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S1E and F</xref>) and could not detect the expression of truncated Meioc in the mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1G</xref>).</p>
<p>Zebrafish <italic>meioc</italic> RNA and protein signals were observed in a portion of 1-2-cell cyst germ cells in juvenile gonads at 25 days post-fertilization (dpf), adult ovaries and testes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2A</xref>). The cells exhibited a large nucleolus, characteristics of presumed germline stem cells (GSCs) in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kawasaki et al., 2016</xref>) and stem-type self-renewing type I germ cells in medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nishimura et al., 2015</xref>). Both clear RNA and protein signals were detected in premeiotic germ cell clusters, and the protein was detected as granular structures in the cytoplasm with increasing sizes among cells until meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S2A-C</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Upregulation of translation is required for the differentiation of spermatogonia</title>
<p>Since the global translation activity is generally inhibited in stem cells, we analyzed global translational activities of zebrafish spermatogonia using the O-propargyl-puromycin (OP-Puro) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In wild-type, we observed two populations, with low levels and high levels of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis in 1-2-cell cyst spermatogonia. Whereas almost all large cysts with more than 32 cells (32≤-cell) of differentiated spermatogonia had high levels of <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C and D</xref>). <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic>spermatogonia showed similarly low levels as that of 1-2-cell cysts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C and D</xref>). These results suggested that some germ cells within 1-2 cell cysts had low translation activity and that <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic>spermatogonia had low translation activity.</p>
<p>In order to know if translational upregulation is required for differentiation of spermatogonia, we examined the effect of cycloheximide on the development of spermatogonia <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cycloheximide decreased OP-Puro fluorescence intensities in differentiating spermatogonia with a dose-dependent manner in testis organ culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2D</xref>). At 1.0 µM cycloheximide that reduced OP-Puro fluorescence to approximately 60%, BrdU incorporation decreased in 32≤-cell cysts of spermatogonia, while it was not affected in 1-4-cell spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2E and G</xref>). We then examined the effect on differentiation of SSCs using a culture system, in which differentiation can be induced on the Sertoli cell line, ZtA6-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kawasaki et al., 2016</xref>). After propagation of SSCs for 1 month, we transferred the cells onto ZtA6-12 and treated with lower concentration of cycloheximide at 0.2 μM, which reduced OP-Puro fluorescence to approximately 70%. The treatment maintained SSCs with a large nucleolus and not expressing Sycp3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E and F</xref>). Bmp2 secretion of ZtA6-12 cells was not affected at 0.2 μM cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S2F</xref>), suggesting that the effect on Sertoli cell function was minimized. These results suggested that a certain level of translational activity was required for the differentiation of zebrafish SSCs.</p>

<title><italic>meioc</italic> mutants do not upregulate rRNAs in 1-2-cell cyst spermatogonia</title>
<p>To estimate the state of ribosome biogenesis, we examined the expression patterns of rRNAs and the ribosomal protein Rpl15 in zebrafish spermatogonia development. Interestingly, the signal intensities of 5.8S, 18S, 28S rRNAs, and Rpl15 were low in a portion of wild-type 1-2-cell cyst spermatogonia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting the presence of two populations also in the rRNA concentrations (Low and High) in the 1-2-cell stage. We did not observe a low intensity of 5S rRNA. Those rRNA signals intensities increased in almost all 32≤-cell cysts and declined in spermatocytes. To distinguish between cytoplasmic and nucleolar signals, we performed fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization of 28S rRNA. We found 1-2-cell cysts with low cytoplasmic signals also had low nucleolar signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B-D</xref>). Although cytoplasmic 28S rRNA signals increased to 32≤-cell cysts, the highest nucleolar signals were detected in portion of 1-2-cell cysts and declined at 32≤-cell cysts. These results suggest that 1-2-cell cysts contain populations with low and high rRNA transcriptional activity.</p>

<p>Features of silenced rDNA loci, DNA methylation, methylation of histone H3K9, and association of HP1α, are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Grummt, 2007</xref>). In eukaryotes, the transcription of each rDNA locus is regulated by DNA methylation and histone modifications in promoter and enhancer regions in the intergenic spacer (IGS) region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Santoro, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we examined DNA methylation state in the region. Since the regulatory sequence of rDNA was not identified in teleosts, we identified tandem repeats of 90, 120 and 318 bp in the IGS region of 45S-S rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Locati et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S4</xref>), similar to carp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vera et al., 2003</xref>).

<title>Meioc interacts with Piwil1 and affects its intracellular localization</title>
<p>To explore partners of Meioc on regulation of rRNA transcription, we performed LC/MS/MS for the Meioc-immunoprecipitate (IP) of SSC-enriched hyperplastic testes. The hyperplastic testes, which are occasionally found in adult wild-type zebrafish, contain cells at all stages of spermatogenesis. Hyperplasia-derived SSCs self-renewed and differentiated in transplants of aggregates mixed with normal testicular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kawasaki et al., 2016</xref>). The results showed the enrichment of germ granule (nuage) components, compared with normal testis (Supplemental Tables S2 and S3). By immunostaining, Meioc colocalized with the germ granule components, Tdrd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Huang et al., 2011</xref>), Tdrd6a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Roovers et al., 2018</xref>), Piwil1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Houwing et al., 2007</xref>), Piwil2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Houwing et al., 2008</xref>), and Ddx4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Houwing et al., 2007</xref>) in wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S6A and B</xref>). In <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic>, Piwil1 was strongly detected in the nucleolus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A arrowhead</xref>), whereas others exhibited the perinuclear localization characteristic of germ granules observed by Ddx4 staining as in the wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, we were able to detect low levels of Piwil1 in nucleoli of wild-type 1-4-cell spermatogonia with overexposed detection after the co-staining of the nucleolar marker Fibrillarin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The signals of Piwil1 in Ddx4-positive granules were decreased in <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic>spermatogonia, compared with wild-type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

<title>Meioc expression is correlated with the upregulation of 28S rRNA</title>
<p>To further investigate the relationship with Meioc and upregulation of rRNA in SSCs, we compared the expression patterns of Meioc, 28S rRNA and Piwil1 in isolated <italic>sox17::egfp</italic> spermatogonia. Meioc expression ranged from barely detectable to more than 51 (51≤) granular dots (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref>). Nuclear localization of Meioc was observed only in some <italic>sox17::egfp</italic> spermatogonia with 51≤ Meioc granules, while in other spermatogonia and spermatocytes Meioc was detected exclusively in the cytoplasm (Figure S2C, S8A). Therefore, we analyzed <italic>sox17::egfp</italic> spermatogonia with 51≤ Meioc granules by separating those in the nucleus from those in the cytoplasm. The 28S rRNA intensity increased in cells with 11-50 Meioc granules and more (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref>). On the other hand, Piwil1 expression levels were apparently the same across most cells, except cells with 51≤ nuclear Meioc granules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figures S8B</xref>). Since nucleoli were difficult to observe in the isolated cells probably due to the isolation procedure, which takes several hours, it was difficult to verify whether Piwil1 was present in the nucleolus when Meioc expression was low. Therefore, we also examined the expression of Piwil1 in 1-2-cell spermatogonia in wild-type testis sections. Piwil1 was detected at almost same levels in all cells similar to the isolated cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The large nucleolus was observed in the cells with 11-50 Meioc granules and more, and nucleolar localization of Piwil1 was observed in the cells with 11-50 Meioc granules, but not in the cells with 51≤ Meioc granules. These results support the idea that Meioc inhibits localization of Piwil1 in nucleoli and that Meioc functioned on upregulation of rRNA transcripts by preventing localization of Piwil1 in nucleoli.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study showed that zebrafish had SSCs with low rRNA transcription activity, and that increased activity correlated with differentiation. The state of low rRNA transcription activity is not similar to high RiBi of ES cells or <italic>Drosophila</italic> GSCs, but is closer to the low expression of ribosomal gene of quiescent NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015</xref>). Since zebrafish SSCs has long term BrdU-retaining cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nóbrega et al., 2010</xref>), low RiBi may be one of the states in quiescent cells, although quiescent HSCs have significant RiBi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jarzebowski et al., 2018</xref>). Zebrafish 1-2-cell cyst spermatogonia had low and high nucleolar 28S rRNA subpopulations, and the high rRNA cells were not found in <italic>meioc</italic> mutants. Therefore, high rRNA is considered to be an activated state for differentiation. The progenitor 32≤-cell cysts had highest translational activity and lower rRNA transcriptional activity than high rRNA 1-2-cell cysts.</p>
<p>Our results also revealed that Meioc was required for the reduction of H3K9me3 levels and demethylation of CpG at rDNA loci. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>, Meioc prevented nucleolar localization of Piwil1. Piwil1 interacted with Setdb1 and both proteins could be found in the nucleolus. Furthermore, high levels of H3K9me3 and HP1α correlated with higher levels of nucleolar Piwil1. This is similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Piwi in piRNA-dependent gene silencing for Pol II transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jia et al., 2022</xref>). These data support the model that nucleolar Piwil1 interacts with Setdb1 in the nucleolus to maintain low levels of rRNA transcription via H3K9me3 and recruiting HP1α while Meioc promotes differentiation by blocking Piwil1 nucleolar localization and allowing rRNA transcription. The epigenetic state of tandem repeats of the zebrafish rDNA IGS region was similar to human silenced rDNA with CpG hypermethylation, levels of H3K9me3, and HP1α association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Grummt, 2007</xref>). The tandem repeats have been reported as enhancers of rRNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pikaard and Reeder, 1988</xref>), and the methylation status of the region is accompanied by rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bird et al., 1981</xref>). Since Setdb1 associates with Tip5, which is known to interact with DNA methyltransferase as a component of nucleolar remodeling complex (NoRC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yuan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bersaglieri and Santoro, 2019</xref>), the Setdb1 that is interacted with nucleolar Piwil1 in this study is presumed to lead to CpG methylation in rDNA IGS region.</p>
<p>The phenotypes of the zebrafish <italic>meioc</italic> mutants and <italic>ythdc2</italic> mutants are different from those of mouse <italic>Meioc</italic> KO and <italic>Ythdc2</italic> KO, which arrest at meiotic prophase I or immature follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Soh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wojtas et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to different timing of phenotype expression between mice and zebrafish, the amino acid sequence of Meioc between mice and zebrafish is not well conserved (28.5%), while that of Ythdc2 is well conserved (65.5%). It is likely that zebrafish Meioc have different binding partners and regulate different processes of germ cell development from mouse MEIOC, causing the distinct phenotypes between these mutants. Many unique partners of Meioc, such as RNA binding proteins, myosin proteins, Tudor domain proteins, heat shock proteins and Cnot1 were found in the present study.</p>
<p>In this study, we revealed the function of Piwil1 in regulating rRNA transcription. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> nucleolar localization of Piwi and impairment of its localization by inhibition of RNA pol I in ovarian somatic cells and nurse cells, and accumulation of undifferentiated GSC, delay of GSC proliferation and upregulation of R1, R2 and rRNA transcripts in <italic>piwi</italic> mutants have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fefelova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mikhaleva et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yakushev et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the nuclear Argonaute protein NRDE-3 binds to ribosomal siRNAs (risiRNA) and is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus, in which the risiRNA/NRDE complex associates with pre-RNAs and reduces the level of pre-rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, Argonaute proteins appear to have a conserved function on controlling RiBi. This study showed that zebrafish Piwil1 used the analogous machinery for rRNA transcription as Piwi-dependent silencing Pol II transcription in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Since Meioc was identified as a component of germ granules, the novel function of Piwil1 will open new insights into the interactions of germ granules and nucleoli to regulate RiBi and SSC differentiation.</p>

<title>DNA methylation analysis</title>
<p>Because there was no information of the structure of IGS region in zebrafish, we analyzed IGS sequence of known active locus of 45S-S rDNA (Ch5: 831,755-826,807 in GRCz11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Locati et al., 2017</xref>) using Tandem repeats finder software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Benson, 1999</xref>). The result was summarized in the schema of Supplemental Figure S3B. The undifferentiated spermatogonia of <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup>;sox17::egfp</italic> and <italic>sox17::egfp</italic> wild-type were sorted using JSAN cell sorter (Bay Bioscience) and used for bisulfite conversion using MethylEasy Xceed Rapid DNA Bisulfite modification kit (Takara). The tandem repeat region of 45S-S rDNA IGS was amplified by PCR with EpiTaq HS (Takara) using the primer sets (Supplemental Table S5). The primers were designed using Meth primer software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li and Dahiya, 2002</xref>). All PCR products were subcloned into the pCRII vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used for sequencing analysis using online QUMA software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kumaki et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Comparison of RNA expression levels</title>
<p>After sorting spermatogonia of <italic>vas::egfp; meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic>and <italic>sox17::egfp</italic> wild-type that expresses EGFP at the equivalent stage to <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic> spermatogonia using JSAN cell sorter (Bay Bioscience), total RNA were extracted and used for RT-qPCR analysis as described in “Immunoprecipitation” section using primer sets (Supplemental Table S5). Relative gene expression levels were calculated using the comparative Ct method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schmittgen and Livak, 2008</xref>) and normalized to the expression of <italic>gapdh</italic>. The experiments were repeated three times.</p>

<title>Northern blot analysis</title>
<p>Northern blot analysis was performed using DIG northern starter kit (Roche). cDNA fragments of 5’ETS and ITS1 region of 45S-S rDNA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Locati et al., 2017</xref>) and 7SL were amplified from RT-PCR of testicular RNA using the primers containing T7 and T3 promoter sequence (Supplemental Table S5) and used for cRNA probe synthesis with T3 RNA polymerase using DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche). Signals of 45S pre-rRNA, pre-rRNA intermediates and 7SL were detected with a Chemidoc XRS Plus (Bio-Rad), and quantified using quantity tools of ImageLab software version 6.0.1 (Bio-Rad). For the quantification, three wild-type and <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic>testes were individually used. Signal intensities of 45S pre-rRNA, pre-rRNA intermediates were normalized with signal intensities of 7SL.</p>

<title>Chromatin IP (ChIP)-qPCR analysis</title>
<p>Chip assay was performed with slight modifications as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Imai et al., 2017</xref>). Ten testes were used for 6 ml of chromatin suspension. Sonication was carried out with a Bioruptor® Standard apparatus (Diagenode) at high power for four series of 7 cycles (30 s on, 30 s off). For IP, 1 ml of chromatin suspension was incubated with 20 μl of Dynabeads® Protein A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) pre-incubated with 3 μg of rabbit anti-histone H3 tri-methyl K9 (Abcam, ab8898) and Piwil1 antibodies. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara) using LightCycler480 (Roche) using primer sets (Supplemental Table S5). Fold enrichment was calculated with -ddCt by normalization with 10% input sample using Sigma RIP-qRT-PCR Data Analysis Calculation Shell, associated with the Sigma Imprint RIP kit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/epigenetics/imprint-rna.html">http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/life-science/epigenetics/imprint-rna.html</ext-link>). The experiments were repeated six times.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation of at least three independent experiments as indicated in each method and figure legend. Statistical difference between two groups was determined using unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test when the variance was heterogeneous between the groups, and Welch’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used when the variance was heterogeneous. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Graphical presentations were made with the R package ggplot2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wickham, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> paper describes the regulatory pathway of rRNA synthesis by Meioc-Piwil1 in germ cell differentiation in zebrafish. Using the molecular genetic and cytological approaches, the authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that Meioc antagonizes Piwil1, which downregulates the 45S pre-rRNA synthesis by heterochromatin formation for spermatocyte differentiation. The results will be of use to researchers in the field of germ cell/meiosis as well as RNA biosynthesis and chromatin.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper Kawasaki et al describe a regulatory role for the PIWI/piRNA pathway in rRNA regulation in Zebrafish. This regulatory role was uncovered through a screen for gonadogenesis defective mutants, which identified a mutation in the meioc gene, a coiled-coil germ granule protein. Loss of this gene leads to redistribution of Piwil1 from germ granules to the nucleolus, resulting in silencing of rRNA transcription.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Most of the experimental data provided in this paper is compelling. It is clear that in the absence of meioc, PiwiL1 translocates in to the nucleolus and results in down regulation of rRNA transcription. the genetic compensation of meioc mutant phenotypes (both organismal and molecular) through reduction in PiwiL1 levels are evidence for a direct role for PiwiL1 in mediating the phenotypes of meioc mutant.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Questions remain on the mechanistic details by which PiwiL1 mediated rRNA down regulation, and whether this is a function of Piwi in an unperturbed/wildtype setting. There is certainly some evidence provided in support of the a natural function for piwi in regulating rRNA transcription (figure 5A+5B). However, the de-enrichment of H3K9me3 in the heterozygous (Figure 6F) is very modest and in my opinion not convincingly different relative to the control provided. It is certainly possible that PiwiL1 is regulating levels through cleavage of nascent transcripts. Another aspect I found confounding here is the reduction in rRNA small RNAs in the meioc mutant; I would have assumed that the interaction of PiwiL1 with the rRNA is mediated through small RNAs but the reduction in numbers do not support this model. But perhaps it is simply a redistribution of small RNAs that is occurring. Finally, the ability to reduce PiwiL1 in the nucleolus through polI inhibition with actD and BMH-21 is surprising. What drives the accumulation of PiwiL1 in the nucleolus then if in the meioc mutant there is less transcription anyway?</p>
<p>Despite the weaknesses outlined, overall I find this paper to be solid and valuable, providing evidence for a consistent link between PIWI systems and ribosomal biogenesis. Their results are likely to be of interest to people in the community, and provide tools for further elucidating the reasons for this link.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors report that Meioc is required to upregulate rRNA transcription and promote differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells in zebrafish. The authors show that upregulated protein synthesis is required to support spermatogonial stem cells' differentiation into multi-celled cysts of spermatogonia. Coiled coil protein Meioc is required for this upregulated protein synthesis and for increasing rRNA transcription, such that the Meioc knockout accumulates 1-2 cell spermatogonia and fails to produce cysts with more than 8 spermatogonia. The Meioc knockout exhibits continued transcriptional repression of rDNA. Meioc interacts with and sequesters Piwil1 to the cytoplasm. Loss of Meioc increases Piwil1 localization to the nucleolus, where Piwil1 interacts with transcriptional silencers that repress rRNA transcription.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is fundamental study that expands our understanding of how ribosome biogenesis contributes to differentiation and demonstrates that zebrafish Meioc plays a role in this process during spermatogenesis. This work also expands our evolutionary understanding of Meioc and Ythdc2's molecular roles in germline differentiation. In mouse, the Meioc knockout phenocopies the Ythdc2 knockout, and studies thus far have indicated that Meioc and Ythdc2 act together to regulate germline differentiation. Here, in zebrafish, Meioc has acquired a Ythdc2-independent function. This study also identifies a new role for Piwil1 in directing transcriptional silencing of rDNA.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper describes the molecular pathway to regulate germ cell differentiation in zebrafish through ribosomal RNA biogenesis. Meioc sequesters Piwil1, a Piwi homolog, which suppresses the transcription of the 45S pre-rDNA by the formation of heterochromatin, to the perinuclear bodies.</p>
<p>Strong points:</p>
<p>The authors nicely provided the molecular evidence on the antagonism of Meioc to Piwil1 in the rRNA synthesis, which supported by the genetic evidence that the inability of the meioc mutant to enter meiosis is suppressed by the piwil1 heterozygosity. The authors nicely address my previous points.</p>
<p>Weak points:</p>
<p>Although the authors made an effort to revise the text. However, there are still some points that the authors need to check their text. Some of them are shown in &quot;Minor points&quot; below. I am sorry that some of them should have been pointed in my previous review.</p>

<p>The amount of cytoplasmic rRNA in <italic>piwi+/-</italic> was increased by 26% on average (figure 5A+5B), the amount of ChiP-qPCR of H3K9 was decreased by about 26% (Figure 6F), and ChiP-qPCR of Piwil1 was decreased by 35% (Figure 6G), so we don't think there is a big discrepancy. On the other hand, the amount of ChiP-qPCR of H3K9 in <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic> was increased by about 130% (Figure 6F), while ChiP-qPCR of Piwil1 was increased by 50%, so there may be a mechanism for H3K9 regulation of Meioc that is not mediated by Piwil1. As for what drives the accumulation of Piwil1 in the nucleolus, although we have found that Piwil1 has affinity for rRNA (Fig. 6A), we do not know what recruits it. Significant increases in the 18-35nt small RNA of 18S, 28S rRNAs and R2 were not detected in <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic> testes enriched for 1-8 cell spermatogonia, compared with <italic>meioc<sup>+/mo</sup></italic> testes. The nucleolar localization of Piwil1 has revealed in this study, which will be a new topic for future research.</p>

<p>There are limited details on the stem cell-enriched hyperplastic testes used as a tool for mass spec experiments, and additional information is needed to fully evaluate the mass spec results. What mutation do these testes carry? Does this protein interact with Meioc in the wildtype testes? How could this mutation affect the results from the Meioc immunoprecipitation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Stem cell-enriched hyperplastic testes came from wild-type adult <italic>sox17::GFP</italic> transgenic zebrafish. Sperm were found in these hyperplastic testes, and when stem cells were transplanted, they self-renewed and differentiated into sperm. It is not known if the hyperplasias develop due to a genetic variant in the line. We added the following comment in L201-204.</p>
<p>“The SSC-enriched hyperplastic testes, which are occasionally found in adult wildtype zebrafish, contain cells at all stages of spermatogenesis. Hyperplasia-derived SSCs self-renewed and differentiated in transplants of aggregates mixed with normal testicular cells.”</p>

Meioc sequesters Piwil1, a Piwi homolog, which suppresses the transcription of the 45S pre-rDNA by the formation of heterochromatin, to the perinuclear bodies.

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Although the paper provides very convincing evidence for the authors' claim, the scientific contents are poorly written and incorrectly described. As a result, it is hard to read the text. Checking by scientific experts would be highly recommended. For example, on line 38, &quot;the global translation activity is generally [inhibited]&quot;, is incorrect and, rather, a sentence like &quot;the activity is lowered relative to other cells&quot; is more appropriate here. See minor points for more examples.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing that out. I corrected the parts pointed out.</p>

<p>When testicular tissue culture was performed at 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 250, and 500mM, abnormal strong OP-puro signals including nuclei were found in cells at 10mM or more. We added the results in the Supplemental Figure S2G. In addition, at 1mM, growth was perturbed in fast-growing 32≤-cell cysts of spermatogonia, but not in 1-4-cell spermatogonia, as described in L127-130.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>I don't have any recommendations for improvement. While I have outlined some of the weaknesses of the paper above. I don't see addressing these questions as pertinent for publication of this paper.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The manuscript uses the terms 1-2 cell spermatogonia, GSC, and SSC throughout the figures and text. For example, 1-2 cell spermatogonia is used in Figure 1C, GSC is used in Figure 1F, and SSC is used in Figure 1 legend. The use of all three terms without definitions as to how they each relate with one another is confusing, particularly to those outside the zebrafish spermatogenesis field. It would be best to only use one term if the three terms are used interchangeably or to define each term if they represent different populations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>GSC is a writing mistake. In this study, <italic>sox17</italic>-positive cells, which have been confirmed to self-renew and differentiate (Kawasaki et al., 2016), are considered SSCs. On the other hand, a comparison of <italic>meioc</italic> and <italic>ythdc2</italic> mutants revealed differences in the composition of each cyst, so we describe the number of cysts confirmed. We added new data that 1-2 cell spermatogonia are <italic>sox17</italic>-positive in Supplemental Figure S3 (L157-158).</p>

<p>(3) Fig 7B and S7B show incongruent results, and the text implies that Fig S7B data better reflects in vivo biology. It is not clear how the authors interpret the different results between 7B and S7B.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing that out. Fig 7A and 7B were obtained by isolating sox17-positive cells. Because it was difficult to detect nucleoli in the isolated cells, probably due to the isolation procedure, we added S7B, which was analyzed in sectioned tissues. As this reviewer pointed out, S7B reflects the <italic>in vivo</italic> state better, so we changed S7B to 7B and 7B to S7B.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) For general readers, it is nice to add a scheme of zebrafish spermatogenesis (lines 77-78) together with Figure 1A.</p>

<p>All <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic> zebrafish were males, and the <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic> cells in Fig. S1B are spermatogonia. No spermatocytes or oocytes were observed. To show this, we added &quot;no oocytes&quot; in L90.</p>

<p>We think that it is important to note that we were unable to find cells with upregulated rRNA signals, and therefore changed to “could not find cells with high signals of rRNAs and Rpl15 in <italic>meioc<sup>mo/mo</sup></italic> spermatogonia”.</p>
