<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> accounts for the majority of over 600’000 malaria-associated deaths annually. Parasites resistant to nearly all antimalarials have emerged and the need for drugs with alternative modes of action is thus undoubted. The FK506-binding protein <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 has gained attention as a promising drug target due to its high affinity to the macrolide compound FK506 (tacrolimus). Whilst there is considerable interest in targeting <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 with small molecules, a genetic validation of this factor as a drug target is missing and its function in parasite biology remains elusive. Here, we show that limiting <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels are lethal to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and result in a delayed-death phenotype that is characterized by defective ribosome homeostasis and stalled protein translation. We furthermore show that FK506, unlike the role of this drug in model organisms, exerts its anti-proliferative activity in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-independent manner and, using cellular thermal shift assays, we identify FK506-targets beyond <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. In addition to revealing first insights into the function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, our results show that FKBP-binding drugs can adopt non-canonical modes of action – with major implications for the development of FK506-derived molecules active against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites and other eukaryotic pathogens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite considerable progress in recent years, malaria remains one of the major global health threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The apicomplexan parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for the vast majority of the over 600’000 malaria deaths in 2020. Most of this burden is carried by infants and children under the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria deaths increased by 12% compared to 2019, which can at least in part be explained by the COVID-19 related suspension of malaria control and treatment measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In addition, the emergence of parasites resistant to most antimalarials, including artemisinin-based combination therapies, endangers current and future disease elimination efforts and underscores the need for developing drugs with alternative modes of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>FK506 (tacrolimus), a well-characterized immunosuppressant, shows considerable activity against asexual blood stage parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes a single FK506-binding protein (FKBP) dubbed <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 (PF3D7_1247400), which is considered to be a promising drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). FKBPs belong to the immunophilin family and are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In contrast to the malaria parasite, most other eukaryotes encode several FKBPs that, besides showing high affinity for the FK506 drug, exert peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity. The PPIase moiety catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of proline residues – an event thought to be rate-limiting for the folding of many proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Independent of their PPIase activity, FKBPs act as chaperones to prevent protein aggregation under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Furthermore, some FKBP variants play a role in cellular signaling or gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Human FKBP12 for instance is best-known for its ability to form a complex with the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin. These complexes inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and the kinase activity of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Amongst many other effects, this inhibition results in decreased T-cell activation. Of note, the regulatory role of <italic>Hs</italic>FKBP12 depends on the presence of rapamycin or FK506. In absence of drugs, this immunophilin neither interacts with mTOR nor with calcineurin and does hence not affect activity of these key components of eukaryotic cells. Due to the conserved nature of FKBPs, rapamycin and FK506 have also gained attention as potential antimicrobial drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to its homologs in model organisms, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 harbors PPIase and chaperoning activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Despite sharing key features with FKBPs of other eukaryotes, its role in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> remains elusive. <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is believed to interact with heat shock proteins (HSPs) and co-immunoprecipitates with cytoskeletal factors of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). While <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is inhibiting the phosphatase activity of recombinant calcineurin in a FK506-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), it does not co-localize with calcineurin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The protein is expressed throughout the 48-hour intra-erythrocytic development of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and is found within the cytosol of ring stage parasites. In the older trophozoite and the replicating schizont stages, the protein was reported to also localize to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). While a transposon-based mutagenesis screen suggests that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is essential for intra-erythrocytic replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), neither its cellular function nor its essentiality was confirmed experimentally in live parasites. The unknown role in parasite biology notwithstanding, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is considered to be a viable drug target and, given the fact that <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> encode FKBP homologs that exhibit comparable PPIase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), future FKBP-targeted therapies may be effective across different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species.</p>
<p>Crystal structures of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in complex with FK506 and rapamycin revealed high affinity interactions with the FK506-binding domain of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Consistent with these observations, <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme activity assays showed that FK506 inhibits the PPIase activity of recombinant <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Previous research aimed at exploiting structural differences between human and parasite-encoded FKBPs to circumvent the immunosuppressive activity of drug-bound <italic>Hs</italic>FKBP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). These efforts include investigation of non-covalent FKBP inhibitors such as adamantyl derivatives, macrocycles, the small molecule D44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and the synthetic ligand for FKBP (SLF) as well as derivatives thereof designed to covalently bind <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). While D44 shows promising antimalarial activity, it fails to alter thermostability of the FK506-binding domains of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and <italic>Hs</italic>FKBP12 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), suggesting that this compound does not directly interact with <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. Up until now, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 has not been validated as a drug target using reverse genetics, and the link between <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-interacting drugs and their antimalarial activity remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we generated inducible <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 knock-out, knock-down as well as over-expression cell lines and show that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is essential for asexual replication of blood forms. We demonstrate that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is vital for ribosome homeostasis on the post-transcriptional level and likely acts as a chaperone during the biogenesis of ribosomes in the nucleus. As a result, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 knock-out parasites stall protein translation prior to dying at the early schizont stage, which underpins the potential of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 as a drug target. Using cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA), we corroborate the high affinity binding of FK506 to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and reveal interactions of the <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35/FK506 pair with ribosome-associated proteins. Importantly, however, our data demonstrate that FK506 fails at inhibiting the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and exerts its antimalarial activity in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-independent manner. While this has major implications for the development of future FK506-based antimalarials and/or <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-inhibiting drugs, we identify putative targets of FK506 beyond <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p>

<p>In a first step, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we engineered a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cell line allowing for a conditional knock-down of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 using the DD/Shield system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1A-B</xref>). Despite the efficient depletion of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 under knock-down conditions, parasites did not show apparent growth defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figs. S1C-D</xref>). Immunofluorescence assays (IFA) showed that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 localizes to distinct foci within the parasite nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we generated a cell line allowing for the conditional knock-out of the endogenous coding sequence using a dimerizable Cre recombinase (DiCre)-based system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Specifically, we introduced two <italic>loxP</italic> sites – one within a synthetic intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) downstream of the start codon and one after the stop codon of the <italic>fkbp35</italic> coding region – and added a <italic>green fluorescent protein</italic> (<italic>gfp</italic>) sequence downstream of this expression cassette (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2A</xref>). As a result, these NF54/iKO-FKBP35 parasites express tag-free, wild-type (WT) <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 protein under control conditions (FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold>). Upon DiCre activation, the <italic>loxP</italic> sites are recombined and the <italic>fkbp35</italic> locus is excised from the parasite genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2B</xref>). Under these knock-out conditions (FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold>), parasites express cytosolic GFP under control of the endogenous <italic>fkbp35</italic> promoter. This setup allows monitoring knock-out efficiency at the single cell level and revealed that DiCre successfully deleted <italic>fkbp35</italic> in the vast majority of parasites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>In a first attempt, we induced the <italic>fkbp35</italic> knock-out in synchronous ring stage NF54/iKO-FKBP35 parasites at 0-6 hours post erythrocyte invasion (hpi), i.e. prior to the expected peak transcription of <italic>fkbp35</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). These FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites showed a delayed death phenotype: parasites completed intra-erythrocytic development in the first generation (G1) without noticeable effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and entered the next generation (G2) with a multiplication rate similar to that of the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). In G2, however, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites arrested at the late trophozoite/early schizont stage (approximately 30-36 hpi) with many cells failing to enter DNA replication in the S-phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). To investigate this phenomenon in more detail, we induced the <italic>fkbp35</italic> knock-out at three different time points during the IDC. Similar to DiCre activation at 0-6 hpi, knocking out <italic>fkbp35</italic> at 12-18 hpi resulted in parasite death at the trophozoite/schizont stage of the subsequent generation. However, when induced at 24-30 hpi or 34-40 hpi in G1, parasites did not only complete the current IDC but also successfully passed through G2 before they eventually arrested in G3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Considering that low <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels are sufficient to maintain the essential function of the protein, as observed with the NF54/iKD-FKBP35 parasites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C-D</xref>), it is conceivable that proteins expressed between 0 and 24hpi, i.e. prior to deleting <italic>fkbp35</italic> from the genome, allow parasites to enter G3.</p>
<p>The delayed death of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> is reminiscent of a phenotype observed in apicoplast-deficient parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). We therefore tested if <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is involved in apicoplast biology, but did not find evidence for an association with this organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2C</xref>). Furthermore, given the reported interaction of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 with heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), we also tested the parasitès response to heat stress, but could not detect altered heat-susceptibility between FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2D</xref>).</p>

<title>The knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 causes accumulation of pre-ribosome components in G1</title>
<p>Consistent with the efficient deletion of <italic>fkbp35</italic> on the genomic level, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> schizonts of G1 showed a 19-fold (18.9 +/−5.7 s.d.) reduction of FKBP35 and GFP levels were increased by 84-fold (83.7 +/−38.5 s.d.) when compared to the control population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). Besides <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and GFP, 50 parasite proteins were significantly deregulated in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> schizonts and 34 of them found at elevated levels compared to the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control conditions. A gene ontology analysis using PANTHER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) indicated enrichment of the “<italic>pre-ribosome</italic>” (fold enrichment = 30.4, p-value = 1.46E-5, 4/34 proteins) and “<italic>nucleolus</italic>” (fold enrichment = 6.77, p-value = 8.85E-4, 5/34 proteins) terms among these factors. While the pre-ribosome is a large subunit precursor of mature ribosomes, the nucleolus represents the primary site for the biogenesis of ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>).

Despite being phenotypically silent in G1, the accumulation of pre-ribosome and nucleolar components hints at perturbed ribosome maturation in these cells. Specifically, it is conceivable that the observed buildup of ribosome intermediates results from reduced anabolic activity, i.e. the stalling of nucleolar pre-ribosome assembly.</p>

<title><italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is essential for maintaining normal levels of functional ribosomes in G2</title>
<p>In the following generation (G2, 24-30 hpi), the proteome of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> trophozoites showed substantial differences. Despite the absence of morphological changes at this point in time, 216 proteins were significantly deregulated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Among these, 50 proteins were found at higher abundance compared to FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> and their gene ontology terms point towards an effect on processes involved in energy metabolism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of deregulated factors (166 of 216) in G2, however, were less abundant in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> compared to the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control cells. Very prominently, 20 of the top 50 hit molecules are ribosomal proteins that, on average, show a two-fold reduction (2.0 +/− 0.4 s.d.) in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that PANTHER identified the knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 to mainly affect ribosome-related processes, such as “<italic>cytoplasmic translation”</italic>, “<italic>ribosome assembly”</italic>, and “<italic>ribosomal large subunit biogenesis”</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess if the reduced levels of ribosomal proteins result in lower protein translation rates, we employed the “surface sensing of translation” (SUnSET) technique. SUnSET is based on incorporation of the tyrosyl-tRNA analogue puromycin into nascent peptide chains and thereby allows monitoring newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). As expected, we found that FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> trophozoites in G2 (24-30 hpi) showed reduced translation rates compared to the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Further, protein synthesis was not affected in parasites of the parental line NF54/DiCre following DiCre activation using rapamycin (S2E), demonstrating that translation is impaired in response to knocking out <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that, under knock-out conditions, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels become limiting for ribosome maturation late during schizogony of G1, without having immediate effects on the steady-state levels of mature ribosomes. The knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is thus phenotypically silent in G1. In absence of a continuous supply of mature ribosomes under FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> conditions, however, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites fail at synthesizing protein at levels that would support normal parasite development in the next generation (G2).</p>

<p>As expected, the transcriptome of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> showed a prominent reduction of steady-state <italic>fkbp35</italic> transcripts already in TP1 (11.3-fold +/−2.0 s.d.) compared to the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). During peak transcription at 30-36 hpi (TP2), this difference increased to 240-fold (238.4 +/−20.0 s.d.) and, consistent with the efficient recombination at the <italic>fkbp35</italic> locus, these cells started transcribing <italic>gfp</italic>. Notwithstanding the prominent depletion of <italic>fkbp35</italic> transcripts, the transcriptome of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> is only marginally affected up to and including 24-30 hpi in G2 (TP6). By contrast, at 30-36 hpi (TP7) the transcription of knock-out parasites shows major changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Considering the appearance of morphological changes in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> at this time point, effects on the transcriptome are unlikely to represent specific activities of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in gene regulation. Indeed, mapping the transcriptome of individual time points to a high resolution reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), revealed a significant slow-down of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> compared to FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites at TP7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3C</xref>). This indicates aborted cell cycle progression in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites during a phase that is characterized by a rapid increase in biomass – possibly due to a translation and/or size-dependent cell cycle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). At earlier time points (TP1-TP6), the transcriptomes of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> are comparable and the differences observed on the level of individual genes clearly fail at explaining the proteomic changes observed in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites at 24-30 hpi in G2 (TP6), reiterating that the essential activity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is linked to post-transcriptional processes.</p>

<title>FKBP-targeting drugs fail at inhibiting the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35</title>
<p><italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 emerged as a promising antimalarial drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and considerable efforts were made to define interactions of this immunophilin with small molecules in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Several studies conclusively demonstrated that FK506 – the most well-known ligand of mammalian FKBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>) – binds to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and kills asexual blood stage parasites with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the low micromolar range at 1.9 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the proposed direct interaction between FK506 and FKBP35 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we expected that FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites show altered sensitivity to the drug. Consistent with published data, FK506 killed FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> cells with an IC50 of 1942 nM (+/−193 nM s.d.) when administered at 0-6 hpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Surprisingly however, and despite the prominent depletion of the protein under knock-out conditions, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites were equally sensitive to FK506 (IC50 = 1741 +/− 187) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Similarly, neither the efficient knock-down of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in NF54/iKD-FKBP35 parasites (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C</xref>), nor its over-expression (OE) in NF54/iOE-FKBP35 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A-C</xref>), resulted in the expected sensitivity change to FK506 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In addition to this apparent independence of the drug to varying <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels, and in agreement with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), FK506 unfolds its antimalarial activity fairly quickly, i.e. within the same cycle after treatment. Standing in stark contrast to the delayed death phenotype of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-G</xref>), this immediate activity on parasite survival substantiates the notion that FK506 must target essential parasite factors other than <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35.</p>

<p>To rule out that the timing of drug exposure is masking expected links between FK506 and <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, we tested whether administering FK506 at 30-36 hpi (instead of 0-6 hpi) affects parasite survival in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-dependent manner.

Further, to account for a scenario in which the activity of FK506 on <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is masked by a temporal delay between drug exposure and parasite killing, we induced the knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 at 34-40 hpi (instead of 0-6 hpi) and allowed FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites to proceed to G2, before exposing them to different FK506 concentrations.

<title>Probing FK506 interactions in Cellular Thermal Shift Assays (CETSA)</title>
<p>Considering the unaltered activity of FK506 in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> compared to FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites, we reasoned that FK506 must target proteins other than <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. To identify potential targets of the drug in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we used the <italic>cellular thermal shift assay followed by mass spectrometry</italic> (MS-CETSA). This approach exploits the fact that, once drug-protein complexes are formed, thermostability of the target protein is altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). We applied the so-called <italic>isothermal dose-response</italic> variant of CETSA using FK506 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Here, target proteins are identified based on their dose-dependent stabilization by drugs under thermal challenge (different temperatures) when compared to a non-denaturing condition (37 °C), using the change in the area under the curve (ΔAUC) and the dose-response curve goodness of fit (R<sup>2</sup>) as metrics (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>).</p>

<title>CETSA identifies targets of FK506</title>
<p>In a first step, we performed CETSA in combination with drug-exposed protein extracts. Since proteins lose their physiological context during the process of protein extraction, this variant of the CETSA approach is designed to identify direct protein-drug interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Not surprisingly, we found <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 to be stabilized by FK506 in a dose-dependent manner when challenged at 60 °C with an EC50 of 152.0 nM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The fact that FK506 exhibits its stabilizing activity already in the low nanomolar concentration range indicates high affinity interactions between the protein-drug pair. This FK506-mediated stabilization of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is thus achieved at drug concentrations that are magnitudes below the IC50 of FK506 in parasite survival assays (1942 nM +/−193 nM s.d.) (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In line with several previous reports on the <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35/FK506 pair <italic>in vitro</italic>, our results show that, indeed, FK506 is binding to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, but in contrast to previous assumptions this interaction fails at explaining the antimalarial activity of FK506.</p>
<p>Besides <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, FK506 stabilizes a number of other proteins in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6</xref>). A few of these factors show pronounced sigmoidal stabilization profiles and are predicted to be essential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Amongst others, N6-methyl transferase MT-A70 (PF3D7_0729500), histone deacetylase HDA2 (PF3D7_1008000), pre-mRNA-splicing factor CEF1 (PF3D7_1033600), FeS cluster assembly protein SufD (PF3D7_1103400) and the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 1 (PF3D7_1309500) showed most pronounced stabilization profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Table S3</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, most of these likely essential candidates are stabilized at FK506 concentrations close to the drug’s IC50 (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the binding of FK506 to at least one of these factors is responsible for the antimalarial activity of the drug.</p>

<p>Given the high-affinity interaction of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 with FK506 and its association with ribosomal proteins, we set out to describe the native context of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 using the live cell variant of CETSA. In contrast to focusing exclusively on direct protein-drug interactions, live cell CETSA allows capturing drug-induced shifts in protein stability beyond those of direct binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) and amongst others allows identifying factors present in the same protein complex as the target protein. To do so, CETSA takes advantage of the fact that factors within complexes have similar denaturation temperatures due to their co-aggregation upon heat-induced denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). As a consequence, this CETSA variant generally identifies more factors compared to the protein extract-based CETSA approach (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>As expected, and confirming the results above, live cell CETSA shows that FK506 alters the thermal stability of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 already at very low drug concentrations when challenged at 60 °C with an EC50 of 286.7 nM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). Interestingly, and in contrast to the protein lysate-based approach, live cell CETSA revealed that more than 50 ribosomal proteins are stabilized in presence of FK506 when challenged at 55°C, with a median EC50 of 45.9 nM (25<sup>th</sup> percentile = 34.2, 75<sup>th</sup> percentile = 58.9). Of note, these ribosomal proteins were stabilized at virtually identical FK506 concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7</xref>), indicating that the drug – directly or indirectly – interacts with ribosomal complexes. This is in further agreement with the fact that these ribosomal factors were not identified by protein lysate-based CETSA (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6</xref>).</p>
<p>Worth mentioning, we observed a drug dose-dependent increase in soluble protein abundance of ribosomal factors also under non-denaturing conditions, i.e. at 37 °C, with a median EC50 of 1.94 µM (25<sup>th</sup> percentile = 1.85, 75<sup>th</sup> percentile = 2.1) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7</xref>). Generally, due to the absence of a denaturing heat challenge, such a drug-dependent enrichment in soluble protein levels does not indicate binding-induced thermal stabilization of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Instead, this can be the result of increased protein synthesis, altered protein conformation or, alternatively, occur in response to factors disengaging from larger protein complexes. The fact that FK506 solubilizes a high number of ribosomal proteins within a very narrow concentration window also at 37 °C, implies that these factors are liberated from the same ribosomal complex or from complexes that interact with each other and shows that FK506 negatively affects stability of ribosomal structures in live cells. However, these effects are limited to high, presumably saturating FK506 concentrations, likely explaining why the drug fails at killing parasites in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-dependent manner. Importantly, the vast majority of ribosomal proteins identified in live cell CETSA are shared with those de-regulated in <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 knock out cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), providing conclusive evidence for a shared localization of FK506 and its <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 target in live parasites.</p>
<p>Together with the above-described importance of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in ribosome homeostasis, these results strongly suggest that FK506 is recruited to the activity site of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 – most probably the nucleolar maturation sites of ribosomes – where it leads to a destabilization of ribosomal complexes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Members of the FKBP family are involved in regulating diverse cellular processes in eukaryotic as well as in prokaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). In contrast to most other eukaryotes, the human malaria parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes a single FKBP only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The enzymatic activity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, as well as the interactions of the protein with FKBP-targeting drugs, was subject to considerable drug-focused research <italic>in vitro</italic>. Besides demonstrating the drug’s affinity to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 by co-crystallization, these efforts uncovered that FK506 inhibits enzymatic activity of the protein’s PPIase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Together with the anti-malarial activity of FK506, these data offered compelling evidence for an essential but yet uncharacterized role of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 during blood stage development of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p>
<p>Here, we set out to investigate the role of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in parasite biology. Using an inducible knock-out approach, we show that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is indeed essential for intra-erythrocytic development of asexually replicating <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites and FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells die during the late trophozoite/early schizont stage. Surprisingly, these parasites display a delayed-death phenotype that is independent of apicoplast function and only manifests in the cycle following knock-out induction without affecting cell cycle progression in the first generation (G1) or multiplication rates from G1 to G2. This contradicts the known effects of FK506 and other <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-targeting drugs for two main reasons. First, these drugs exert their parasiticidal activity within the same IDC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Second, neither the conditional knock-out, knock-down nor the overexpression of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 altered the parasite’s sensitivity to FK506, even though levels of the <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 target are profoundly deregulated in the respective mutant lines. Together, these data show that the parasite-killing activity of FK506 is independent of the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. We hence aimed at the identification of other FK506 targets using CETSA, as discussed further down.</p>
<p>Knocking out <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 early during intra-erythrocytic development has no effect on parasite morphology in G1 and provokes only moderate changes on the protein level compared to FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites. While the effects in G1 are relatively subtle, it is noticeable that nucleolus-associated factors are found at higher abundance in knock-out cells. In the next cycle, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites show a dramatic decrease of factors associated with ribosome- and translation-related processes during trophozoite development (G2, 24-30 hpi). Consistently, protein translation in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites is reduced considerably. Importantly, at this point in time, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells still show ordinary morphology and their transcriptional activity remains largely unaffected. The observed changes in the abundance of ribosomal factors must therefore result from post-transcriptional activity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. While ribosomal components are present at higher levels in G1, they are drastically reduced in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells in G2. These opposing effects are peculiar, but likely result from <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 activity in a shared cellular process. Specifically, it is conceivable that low <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels inhibit ribosome maturation in G1, explaining the accumulation of (pre-) ribosomal factors. While the levels of functional ribosomes are sufficient to support continued translation in G1, ribosomes likely become limiting in the next generation (G2), which eventually results in stalled translation activity and concomitant parasite death at the onset of schizogony; i.e. at a time when protein synthesis is required for facilitating the steep increase in biomass.</p>
<p>In contrast to the significant effects on the protein level, the transcription of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> remains largely unaffected by the loss of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and becomes apparent only during late trophozoite/early schizont development in G2 (30-36 hpi); i.e. at a time during which cell cycle progression is slowed down in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites. In fact, at this stage the transcriptional signature of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites is dominated by the slowed progression through intra-erythrocytic development, rather than resulting from specific gene regulatory events. While this stalling is consistent with the observed effects on ribosome homeostasis and protein translation, it demonstrates that, in contrast to certain FKBP family members in other organisms, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 does not have apparent roles in transcriptional control.</p>
<p>As discussed above, binding of FK506 to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 cannot explain the drug’s antimalarial activity and our attempts to identify targets of FK506 using resistance selection failed. This indicates that parasites do not readily acquire resistance mutations, possibly due to drug action on multiple targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). We hence aimed at identifying other FK506 targets using CETSA. In line with previous work on the drug <italic>in vitro</italic>, CETSA on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> protein extracts confirmed that FK506 is targeting <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 with exceptionally high affinity in the low nanomolar range. Considering this well-characterized FK506-<italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and the resulting inhibition of its PPIase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>), unaltered drug sensitivity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 mutants indicates that PPIase activity is dispensable for blood stage parasites. Noteworthy, PPIase-independent functions of FKBPs have been described in other systems. For instance, PPIase activity of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> trigger factor (TF), a ribosome-associated FKBP, is not required for protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Similarly, human FKBP52 maintains its function as a chaperone under PPIase-inhibiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). While it is conceivable that PPIase activity is dispensable for intra-erythrocytic development of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the enzymatic activity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 may be compensated by other factors, e.g. by PPIase domain-harboring members of the cyclophilin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>).</p>
<p>CETSA performed on protein lysates identified a number of parasite factors binding to FK506. Compared to the <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35/FK506 pair, however, these interactions are of considerably lower affinity. The adenosine-methyltransferase MT-A70 (PF3D7_0729500) and the pre-mRNA-splicing factor CEF1 (PF3D7_1033600), for instance, were stabilized by FK506 with EC50 concentrations of 2.0 and 3.1 µM, respectively. While this affinity is relatively poor compared to the strong interaction formed between <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and FK506, one should be cautious designating the binding of FK506 to these proteins as irrelevant “<italic>off target</italic>” effects. In fact, their inhibition may well be masked by high-affinity binding of FK506 to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 – a possibility that shall briefly be discussed in the following section.</p>
<p>Assuming that FK506 is inhibiting the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, one would expect parasites to show a delayed-death phenotype similar to that observed in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites. In contrast to this delayed killing, the effect of FK506 on other essential targets likely manifests in the same cycle and would hence mask the effect of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-inhibition. Consistent with this possibility, FK506 kills <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites at 1.9 µM (+/−0.2 µM s.d.), i.e. at concentrations similar to those required for stabilizing MT-A70 and CEF1 under thermal challenge in CETSA. Our attempts to prove that FK506 indeed inhibits essential functions of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 failed: Neither knocking out <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 at different time points nor adding FK506 to different stages of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites could provide evidence for a scenario in which <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-dependent effects are simply masked by “<italic>off target</italic>” effects (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). This indicates that either the binding of FK506 does not interfere with the essential role of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, or that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is inhibited only at high FK506 concentrations that also inhibit other essential factors. In this context it is worth mentioning that parasites remain unaffected by a highly efficient knock-down of endogenous <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 (observed with NF54/iKD-FKBP35; compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figs. S1C-D</xref>), which demonstrates that very low protein levels are sufficient to maintain the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. It is thus conceivable that high FK506 concentrations are required to fully inhibit <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 – a view that is further supported by data obtained with the live cell CETSA approach.</p>
<p>Besides identifying direct binding of drugs to their target, live cell CETSA allows capturing indirect effects on factors that act in the same pathway or in the same protein complex as the drug-bound target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). While this approach confirmed the high affinity binding of FK506 to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, it also revealed that more than 50 ribosomal proteins share a very prominent CETSA signature: First, they are thermally stabilized by FK506 within a narrow concentration window of the drug. Second, higher levels of FK506 increase the solubility of these ribosomal components also at 37 °C. These results indicate that the FK506/<italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 pair interacts with ribosomal complexes and that FK506 is able to induce the dissociation of these ribosomal structures under physiological conditions. Importantly, and in contrast to the binding of FK506 to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, this effect on ribosomes is only observed at high concentrations of the drug. Together, these data likely explain the discrepancy observed between the high binding affinity of FK506 for <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and the low or even absent effect of the drug on <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 function in blood stage parasites.</p>
<p>In line with our data, previous biochemical approaches revealed potential links between <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and ribosomes. Using co-immunoprecipitation, Leneghan and colleagues revealed that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is interacting with 480 proteins, of which 31 are ribosomal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Indeed, FKBP family members are essentially involved in controlling ribosomes in other systems. The human FKBP variant <italic>Hs</italic>FKBP25, for instance, is recruited to the pre-ribosome where its chaperone activity appears to be required for the assembly of the ribosomal large subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). While the FKBP variant of yeast, Fpr4, interacts with the ribosome biogenesis factor Nop53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> trigger factor (TF) is part of the ribosomal complex and crucial for the folding of nascent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Considering the marked reduction of ribosomal factors in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is chaperoning ribosome biogenesis similar to Fpr4 and FKBP25 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>humans</italic>, respectively.</p>
<p>The fact that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 localizes to distinct nuclear foci and its depletion causes dysregulation of ribosomes points towards a role within the nucleolus – the nuclear compartment driving ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Using IFAs, we found that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 does not co-localize with the nucleolar marker fibrillarin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8</xref>). However, its localization appears to be intertwined with that of this rRNA methyltransferase. Specifically, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is mostly found in close vicinity to fibrillarin-rich regions. Nucleoli in eukaryotic cells generally consist of two or, in higher eukaryotes, three sub-compartments. Of those, the granular component (GC) represents the site of pre-ribosome assembly and encompasses fibrillarin-enriched central regions of nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). The spatial correlation observed between <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and fibrillarin may thus indicate localization to different sub-nucleolar compartments, with <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 occupying the GC area of the nucleolus.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate that limiting <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels are lethal to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and result in a delayed-death phenotype that is characterized by perturbed ribosome homeostasis and defective protein translation, which is likely linked to the reduced biogenesis of functional ribosomes in the nucleolus. We further show that FKBP-binding drugs, including FK506, exert their parasiticidal activity in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-independent manner, urging strong caution for the future development of FKBP-targeting antimalarials, especially when based on FK506 and structural derivatives thereof. In addition to revealing first insights into the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in ribosome homeostasis of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we are convinced that the presented data offer valuable information for target-based efforts in malaria drug discovery.</p>

To quantify parasite survival based on hypoxanthine incorporation into DNA, compounds were dissolved in DMSO (10 mM), diluted in hypoxanthine-free culture medium and titrated in duplicates over a 64-fold range (6 step twofold dilutions) in 96 well plates. 100 μl asexual parasite culture (prepared in hypoxanthine-free medium) were added to each well and mixed with the compound to obtain a final haematocrit of 1.25% and a final parasitemia of 0.3%. After incubation for 48 hrs, 0.25 μCi of [3H]-hypoxanthine was added per well and plates were incubated for an additional 24 hrs. Parasites were then harvested onto glass-fiber filters using a Microbeta FilterMate cell harvester (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, US) and radioactivity was counted using a MicroBeta2 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, US). The results were recorded and expressed as a percentage of the untreated controls. Curve fitting and IC50 calculations were performed using a non-linear, four-parameter regression model with variable slope (Graph Pad Prism, version 8.2.1).</p>

<p>Parasite cultures were split at 0-6 hpi in G1 and treated for 4 h with 100 nM rapamycin. Saponin lysis of paired FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> populations at 36-42 hpi in G1 and 24-30 hpi in G2 was performed as described above. Samples were collected in three independent biological replicates. The washed parasite pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, parasites were resuspended in 25 µL of lysis buffer (5% SDS, 100 mM tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB), 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphin (TCEP), pH 8.5) and sonicated (10 cycles, 30 sec on/off at 4 °C, Bioruptor, Diagnode). Lysates were subsequently reduced for 10 minutes at 95 °C. Samples were then cooled down to RT and 0.5 µL of 1M iodoacetamide was added to the samples. Cysteine residues were alkylated for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. Digestion and peptide purification was performed using S-trap technology (Protifi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, samples were acidified by addition of 2.5 µL of 12% phosphoric acid (1:10) and then 165 µL of S-trap buffer (90% methanol, 100 mM TEAB pH 7.1) was added to the samples (6:1). Samples were briefly vortexed and loaded onto S-trap micro spin-columns (Protifi) and centrifuged for 1 min at 4000 g. Flow-through was discarded and spin-columns were then washed 3 times with 150 µL of S-trap buffer (each time samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 4000 g and flow-through was removed). S-trap columns were then moved to the clean tubes and 20 µL of digestion buffer (50 mM TEAB pH 8.0) and trypsin (at 1:25 enzyme to protein ratio) were added to the samples. Digestion was allowed to proceed for 1h at 47 °C. Then, 40 µL of digestion buffer were added to the samples and the peptides were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g for 1 minute. To increase the recovery, S-trap columns were washed with 40 µL of 0.2% formic acid in water (400g, 1 min) and 35 µL of 0.2% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile. Eluted peptides were dried under vacuum and stored at - 20 °C until further analysis.</p>
<p>Peptides were resuspended in 0.1% aqueous formic acid and peptide concentration was adjusted to 0.25 µg/µL. 1 µL of each sample was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using an Orbitrap Elicpse Tribrid Mass Spectrometer fitted with an Ultimate 3000 nano system (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a custom-made column heater set to 60 °C. Peptides were resolved using a RP-HPLC column (75 μm × 30 cm) packed in-house with C18 resin (ReproSil-Pur C18–AQ, 1.9 μm resin; Dr. Maisch GmbH) at a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min. The following gradient was used for peptide separation: from 2% buffer B to 12% B over 5 min, to 30% B over 40 min, to 50% B over 15 min, to 95% B over 2 min followed by 11 min at 95% B then back to 2% B. Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid in water and buffer B was 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water.</p>
<p>The mass spectrometer was operated in DDA mode with a cycle time of 3 seconds between master scans. Each master scan was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 240,000 FWHM (at 200 m/z) and a scan range from 375 to 1600 m/z followed by MS2 scans of the most intense precursors in the linear ion trap at “Rapid” scan rate with isolation width of the quadrupole set to 1.4 m/z. Maximum ion injection time was set to 50 ms (MS1) and 35 ms (MS2) with an AGC target set to 1e6 and 1e4, respectively. Only peptides with charge state 2-5 were included in the analysis. Monoisotopic precursor selection (MIPS) was set to Peptide, and the Intensity Threshold was set to 5e3. Peptides were fragmented by HCD (Higher-energy collisional dissociation) with collision energy set to 35%, and one microscan was acquired for each spectrum. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The acquired raw-files were imported into the Progenesis QI software (v2.0, Nonlinear Dynamics Limited), which was used to extract peptide precursor ion intensities across all samples applying the default parameters. The generated mgf-file was searched using MASCOT against a <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (isolate 3D7) database (Uniprot, 11.2019) and 392 commonly observed contaminants using the following search criteria: full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues, unless followed by proline); 3 missed cleavages were allowed; carbamidomethylation (C) was set as fixed modification; oxidation (M) and acetyl (Protein N-term) were applied as variable modifications; mass tolerance of 10 ppm (precursor) and 0.6 Da (fragments). The database search results were filtered using the ion score to set the false discovery rate (FDR) to 1% on the peptide and protein level, respectively, based on the number of reverse protein sequence hits in the dataset. Quantitative analysis results from label-free quantification were processed using the SafeQuant R package v.2.3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>) to obtain peptide relative abundances. This analysis included global data normalization by equalizing the total peak/reporter areas across all LC-MS runs, data imputation using the knn algorithm, summation of peak areas per protein and LC-MS/MS run, followed by calculation of peptide abundance ratios. Only isoform specific peptide ion signals were considered for quantification. To meet additional assumptions (normality and homoscedasticity) underlying the use of linear regression models and t-Tests, MS-intensity signals were transformed from the linear to the log-scale. The summarized peptide expression values were used for statistical testing of between condition differentially abundant peptides. Here, empirical Bayes moderated t-Tests were applied, as implemented in the R/Bioconductor limma package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). The resulting per protein and condition comparison <italic>p</italic>-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>
<p>Gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using the PANTHER Overrepresentation Test with the correction method “False Discovery Rate”, the test type “Fisher’s Exact”, and the annotation data set “PANTHER GO-Slim” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>

<p>The mass spectrometry-based isothermal dose-response cellular thermal shift assay (ITDR-MS-CETSA) was performed according to the protocol developed by Dziekan and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Briefly, live parasites (10<sup>7</sup> MACS-purified trophozoites per condition) were exposed to a FK506 (MedChemExpress HY-13756) concentration gradient (100 µM to 1.5 nM) and a DMSO control for 1 h. Subsequently, the parasites were washed in PBS and exposed to the denaturing temperatures 50 °C, 55 °C and 60 °C as well as to a non-denaturing temperature 37 °C for 3 min, before they were cooled down to 4 °C for 3 min. Afterwards, the cells were lysed by resuspending in a lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM TCEP, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)), three freeze/thaw cycles, and mechanical shearing using a syringe with a 31-gauge needle.

<p>To prepare the protein lysate, saponin-lysed parasites were lysed in the afore-mentioned buffer by three freeze/thaw cycles and mechanical shearing.

<p>Data analysis was performed using the Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the R package “mineCETSA” (v 1.1.1). Only proteins identified by at least three peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) were included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>).</p>

<p>Fastqc was run on all raw fastq files.

Read counts for each gene and for each sample were then counted using featureCount (gff file from PlasmoDB v58 modified to include the added GFP and FBPK35). TPM (Transcripts Per Kilobase Million) were then calculated from the raw count matrix.</p>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the R (version 4.2.1) function prcomp using log transformed TPMs. PCA revealed that the rapamycin-treated replicate B of TP 3 (“3B.R”) was a clear outlier and is different from any other replicate at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3D</xref>). For this reason, it was excluded from further analysis.

<p>DESeq2 (version 1.36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>) was used for normalization and differential expression analysis. Paired differential expression tests where done for each time point using DESeq2 LRT (likelihood ratio test) using the full model ∼ Treatment + Replicate (Treatment is DMSO or Rapamycin and Replicate is the clone, added as the data is paired) and the reduced model ∼ Replicate.

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Dose-response effect of FK506 on FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites. The knockout was induced at 0-6 hpi and parasites were exposed to FK506 at 30-36 hpi. Survival rates were measured by flow cytometry in G2. n=3, error bars represent the standard error of the mean. <bold>(B)</bold> Dose-response effect of FK506 on FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites. The knockout was induced at 34-40 hpi in G1. Ring stage parasites of G2 were exposed to FK506 for 48 hours and survival rates were measured by flow cytometry in G3. Data points represent survival rates measured in a single experiment performed in technical duplicates. <bold>(C)</bold> Dose-response effect of FK506 on FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites over two IDCs. Parasites at 0-6 hpi were exposed to FK506 and incubated for 96 hours. Parasitaemia was measured by flow cytometry after 48 hours and 96 hours. Medium containing the appropriate drug concentrations was changed after 48 hours. n=3, error bars represent the standard error of the mean. <bold>(D)</bold> Dose-response effect of cyclosporin A on FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites. Cylocsporin A, a known inhibitor of calcineurin when complexed with FKBP in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>), did not alter drug susceptibility between FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites, suggesting that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is not involved in regulating calcineurin activity. The knockout was induced at 0-6 hpi.

The knockout was induced at 0-6 hpi. Parasites were subsequently exposed to cyclosporin A and 1.5 µM FK506 for 48 h. n=3, error bars represent the standard error of the mean. <bold>(F)</bold> Dose-response effect of D44 on FKBP35<sup>KO</sup> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold>. The knockout was induced at 0-6 hpi and parasites were exposed to D44 for 48 hours thereafter. Survival rates were determined using flow cytometry. n=3, error bars represent the standard error of the mean. <bold>(G)</bold> Dose-response effect of D44 on NF54 WT, K1 and NF54/iKO-FKBP35 parasites after 72 h exposure. Survival rates were determined using a hypoxanthine incorporation assay. Data points represent the mean of two technical replicates. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.</p></caption>

<p>In this study, the authors investigate the biological function of the FK506-binding protein FKBP35 in the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Like its homologs in other organisms, PfFKBP35 harbors peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) and chaperoning activities, and has been considered a promising drug target due to its high affinity to the macrolide compound FK506. However, PfFKBP35 has not been validated as a drug target using reverse genetics, and the link between PfFKBP35-interacting drugs and their antimalarial activity remains elusive. The manuscript is structured in two parts addressing the biological function of PfFKBP35 and the antimalarial activity of FK506, respectively.</p>
<p>The first part combines conditional genome editing, proteomics and transcriptomics analysis to investigate the effects of FKBP35 depletion in P. falciparum. The work is very well performed and clearly described. The data provide definitive evidence that FKBP35 is essential for P. falciparum blood stage growth. Conditional knockout of PfFKBP35 leads to a delayed death phenotype, associated with defects in ribosome maturation as detected by quantitative proteomics and stalling of protein synthesis in the parasite. The authors propose that FKBP35 regulates ribosome homeostasis but an alternative explanation could be that changes in the ribosome proteome are downstream consequences of the abrogation of FKBP35 essential activities as chaperone and/or PPIase. It is unclear whether FKBP35 has a specific function in P. falciparum as compared to other organisms. The knockdown of PfFKBP35 has no phenotypic consequence, showing that very low amounts of FKBP35 are sufficient for parasite survival and growth. In the absence of quantification of the protein during the course of the experiments, it remains unclear whether the delayed death phenotype in the knockout is due to the delayed depletion of the protein or to a delayed consequence of early protein depletion. This limitation also impacts the interpretation of the drug assays.</p>
<p>In the second part, the authors investigate the activity of FK506 on P. falciparum, and conclude that FK506 exerts its antimalarial effects independently of FKBP35. This conclusion is based on the observation that FK506 has the same activity on FKBP35 wild type and knock-out parasites, suggesting that FK506 activity is independent of FKBP35 levels, and on the fact that FK506 kills the parasite rapidly whereas inducible gene knockout results in delayed death phenotype. However, there are alternative explanations for these observations. As mentioned above, the delayed death phenotype could be due to delayed depletion of the protein upon induction of gene knockout. FK506 could have a similar activity on WT and mutant parasites when added before sufficient depletion of FKBP35 protein. In some experiments, the authors exposed KO parasites to FK506 later, presumably when the KO is effective, and obtained similar results. However, in these conditions, the death induced by the knockout could be a confounding factor when measuring the effects of the drug. Furthermore, the authors show that FK506 binds to FKBP35, and propose that the FK506-FKBP35 complex interferes with ribosome maturation, which would point towards a role of FKBP35 in FK506 action. In summary, the study does not provide sufficient evidence to rule out that FK506 exerts its effects via FKBP35.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Thomen et al. FKBP secures ribosome homeostasis in Plasmodium falciparum and focuses on the importance of PfKBP35 protein, its interaction with the FK506 compound, and the role of PfKBP35 in ribosome biogenesis. The authors showed the interaction of the PfKBP54 with FK506, but the part of the FK506 and PfKBP54 in ribosome biogenesis based on the data is unclear.</p>
<p>The introduction is plotted with two parallel stories about PfKBP35 and FK506, with ribosome biogenesis as the central question at the end. In its current form, the manuscript suffers from two stories that are not entirely interconnected, unfinished, and somewhat confusing. Both stories need additional experiments to make the manuscript(s) more complete. The results from PfFBP35 need more evidence for the proposed ribosome biogenesis pathway control. On the other hand, the results from the drug FK506 point to different targets with lower EC50, and other follow-up experiments are needed to substantiate the authors' claims.</p>
<p>The strengths of the manuscript are the figures and experimental design. The combination of omics methods is informative and gives an opportunity for follow-up experiments.</p>

<p>The study by Thommen et al. sought to identify the native role of the Plasmodium falciparum FKBP35 protein, which has been identified as a potential drug target due to the antiplasmodial activity of the immunosuppressant FK506. This compound has multiple binding proteins in many organisms; however, only one FKBP exists in P. falciparum (FKBP35). Using genetically-modified parasites and mass spectrometry-based cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA), the authors suggest that this protein is in involved in ribosome homeostasis and that the antiplasmodial activity of FK506 is separate from its activity on the FKBP35 protein. The authors first created a conditional knockdown using the destruction domain/shield system, which demonstrated no change in asexual blood stage parasites. A conditional knockout was then generated using the DiCre system. FKBP35KO parasites survived the first generation but died in the second generation. The authors called this &quot;a delayed death phenotype&quot;, although it was not secondary to drug treatment, so this may be a misnomer. This slow death was unrelated to apicoplast dysfunction, as demonstrated by lack of alterations in sensitivity to apicoplast inhibitors. Quantitative proteomics on the FKBP35KO vs FKBP35WT parasites demonstrated enrichment of proteins involved in pre-ribosome development and the nucleolus. Interestingly, the KO parasites were not more susceptible to cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor, in the first generation (G1), suggesting that mature ribosomes still exist at this point. The SunSET technique, which incorporates puromycin into nascent peptide chains, also showed that in G1 the FKBP35KO parasites were still able to synthesize proteins. But in the second generation (G2), there was a significant decrease in protein synthesis. Transcriptomics were also performed at multiple time points. The effects of knockout of FKBP35 were transcriptionally silent in G1, and the parasites then slowed their cell cycles as compared to the FKBP35WT parasites.</p>
<p>The authors next sought to evaluate whether killing by FK506 was dependent upon the inhibition of PfKBP35. Interestingly, both FKBP35KO and FKBP35WT parasites were equally susceptible to FK506. This suggested that the antiplasmodial activity of FK506 was related to activity targeting essential functions in the parasite separate from binding to FKBP35. To identify these potential targets, the authors used MS-CETSA on lysates to test for thermal stabilization of proteins after exposure to drug, which suggests drug-protein interactions. As expected, FK506 bound FKBP35 at low nM concentrations. However, given that the parasite IC50 of this compound is in the uM range, the authors searched for proteins stabilized at these concentrations as putative secondary targets. Using live cell MS-CETSA, FK506 bound FKBP35 at low nM concentrations; however, in these experiments over 50 ribosomal proteins were stabilized by the drug at higher concentrations. Of note, there was also an increase in soluble ribosomal factors in the absence of denaturing conditions. The authors suggested that the drug itself led to these smaller factors disengaging from a larger ribosomal complex, leading to an increase in soluble factors. Ultimately, the authors conclude that the native function of FKBP35 is involved in ribosome homeostasis and that the antiplasmodial activity of FK506 is not related to the binding of FKBP35, but instead results from inhibition of essential functions of secondary targets.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study has many strengths. It addresses an important gap in parasite biology and drug development, by addressing the native role of the potential antiplasmodial drug target FKBP35 and whether the compound FK506 works through inhibition of that putative target. The knockout data provide compelling evidence that the KBP35 protein is essential for asexual parasite growth after one growth cycle. Analysis of the FKBP35KO line also provides evidence that the effects of FK506 are likely not solely due to inhibition of that protein, but instead must have secondary targets whose function is essential. These data are important in the field of drug development as they may guide development away from structure-based FK506 analogs that bind more specifically to the FKBP35 protein.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are also a few notable weaknesses in the evidence that call into question the conclusion in the article title that FKBP35 is definitely involved in ribosomal homeostasis. While the proteomics supports alterations in ribosome biogenesis factors, it is unclear whether this is a direct role of the loss of the FKBP35 protein or is more related to non-specific downstream effects of knocking down the protein. The CETSA data clearly demonstrate that FK506 binds PfKB35 at low nM concentrations, which is different than the IC50 noted in the parasite; however, the evidence that the proteins stabilized by uM concentrations of drug are actual targets is not completely convincing. Especially, given the high uM amounts of drug required to stabilize these proteins. This section of the manuscript would benefit from validation of a least one or two of the putative candidates noted in the text. In the live cell CETSA, it is noted that &gt;50 ribosomal components are stabilized in drug treated but not lysate controls. Similarly, the authors suggest that the -soluble fraction of ribosomal components increases in drug-exposed parasites even at 37{degree sign}C and suggests that this is likely from smaller ribosomal proteins disengaging from larger ribosomal complexes. While the evidence is convincing that this protein may play a role in ribosome homeostasis in some capacity, it is not sure that the title of the paper &quot;FKBP secures ribosome homeostasis&quot; holds true given the lack of mechanistic data. A minor weakness, but one that should nonetheless be addressed, is the use of the term &quot;delayed death phenotype&quot; with regards to the knockout parasite killing. This term is most frequently used in a very specific setting of apicoplast drugs that inhibit apicoplast ribosomes, so the term is misleading. It is also possible that the parasites are able to go through a normal cycle because of the kinetics of the knockout and that the time needed for protein clearance in the parasite to a level that is lethal.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors set out to identify the native role of FKB35 in the P. falciparum parasites and to identify whether this is, in fact, the target of FK506. The data clearly demonstrate that FKBP35 is essential for parasite growth and provide evidence that alterations in its levels have proteomic but not transcriptional changes. However, the conclusion that FKBP35 actually stabilizes ribosomal complexes remains intermediate. The data are also very compelling that FK506 has secondary targets in the parasite aside from FKBP35; however, the high uM concentrations of the drug needed to attain results and the lack of biological validation of the CETSA hits makes it difficult to know whether any of these are actually the target of the compound or instead are nonspecific downstream consequences of treatment.</p>

<p>This important study addresses both the native role of the Plasmodium falciparum protein PfFKBP35 and whether this protein is the target of FK506, an immunosuppressant with antiplasmodial activity. The genetic evidence for the essentiality of FKBP35 in parasite growth is compelling. However, the conclusion that the role of FKBP35 is to secure ribosome homeostasis and the claim that FK506 exerts its antimalarial activity independently of FKBP35 rely on incomplete evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewers and Editors for their careful evaluation of our manuscript and the constructive criticism. We realized that some of our conclusions may be regarded/misunderstood as overstatements. This was by no means our intention and we apologize for the unnecessary inconvenience. The phenotype of FKBP35 knock-out parasites clearly centers on failing ribosomes and protein synthesis, which in our opinion, provides an important leap towards understanding the role of this drug target in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> biology. It is however correct that, at this point, we can only make evidence-based hypotheses about direct interaction partners and we will emphasize this more clearly in a revised version of the manuscript. In order to prevent misinterpretation of our work, and as detailed in the point-by-point responses to the reviewer comments, we propose changing the manuscript title to “Genetic validation of _Pf_FKBP35 as an antimalarial drug target”. To address the criticism regarding the effects of FK506, we will perform specific additional experiments. We are convinced that this new data set will resolve any remaining ambiguities and allows for a conclusive assessment of FK506 drug activity in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, the authors investigate the biological function of the FK506-binding protein FKBP35 in the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Like its homologs in other organisms, PfFKBP35 harbors peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) and chaperoning activities, and has been considered a promising drug target due to its high affinity to the macrolide compound FK506. However, PfFKBP35 has not been validated as a drug target using reverse genetics, and the link between PfFKBP35-interacting drugs and their antimalarial activity remains elusive. The manuscript is structured in two parts addressing the biological function of PfFKBP35 and the antimalarial activity of FK506, respectively.</p>
<p>The first part combines conditional genome editing, proteomics and transcriptomics analysis to investigate the effects of FKBP35 depletion in P. falciparum. The work is very well performed and clearly described. The data provide definitive evidence that FKBP35 is essential for P. falciparum blood stage growth. Conditional knockout of PfFKBP35 leads to a delayed death phenotype, associated with defects in ribosome maturation as detected by quantitative proteomics and stalling of protein synthesis in the parasite. The authors propose that FKBP35 regulates ribosome homeostasis but an alternative explanation could be that changes in the ribosome proteome are downstream consequences of the abrogation of FKBP35 essential activities as chaperone and/or PPIase. It is unclear whether FKBP35 has a specific function in P. falciparum as compared to other organisms. The knockdown of PfFKBP35 has no phenotypic consequence, showing that very low amounts of FKBP35 are sufficient for parasite survival and growth. In the absence of quantification of the protein during the course of the experiments, it remains unclear whether the delayed death phenotype in the knockout is due to the delayed depletion of the protein or to a delayed consequence of early protein depletion. This limitation also impacts the interpretation of the drug assays.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for the compliments regarding our experimental setup and the clarity of our manuscript. We agree that the link between FKBP35 knock-out and ribosome homeostasis is indirect and we now emphasize this more clearly in the revised manuscript. To prevent a general misinterpretation of our manuscript, we will adapt the title accordingly.</p>
<p>We would still like to reiterate that the phenotype of FKBP35 knock-out parasites is best described by their defects in maintaining functional ribosomes. It is for several reasons that we believe the links between FKBP35 and ribosome function are purely evidence driven: First, pre-ribosomal and nucleolar factors are the first proteins (in generation 1 schizonts) to be affected upon knock-out of <italic>fkbp35</italic> (Figure 2A, Table S1). We realized that Figure 2A falls short in showing this observation, which is why will update the figure accordingly. Second, the dysregulation of ribosomal factors and the general stall in protein synthesis is dominating the phenotype of FKBP35 knock-out parasites in generation 2. We thus believe it is appropriate to say that knock-out cells are most likely killed in response to defective ribosome maintenance – which is a consequence of reduced FKBP35 levels. We are aware that our experiments (and possibly any other reverse genetics approach) cannot rule out that FKBP35 affects ribosomal factors indirectly. Clearly, more work is required to disentangle this question in more detail in the future.</p>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that it is not possible to tell if the delayed death-like phenotype is due to a “delayed protein depletion”. We would however like to note that the DiCre/loxP approach allows for an immediate knock-out at the genome level and is thus as precise as possible. Further, in addition to the substantial depletion of FKBP35 in knock-out cells during the phenotypically silent generation, knocking out of <italic>fkbp35</italic> at earlier time points (TPs 24-30 and 34-40 hpi in the preceding generation) resulted in the very same phenotype cycle (Figure 1). Here, parasite death was delayed substantially longer, i.e. more than one complete cycle. Together with the dysregulation of early ribosome maturation in generation 1, these findings point towards a delayed death phenotype. It is of course still possible to explain the delayed death-like phenotype by remnant activity of proteins synthetized prior to the genomic knock-out. We address this possibility and describe the two scenarios mentioned by the Reviewer in lines 141-144. Disentangling the two possibilities in future experiments will be difficult, not only with regards to FKBP35, but regarding “delayed death” phenotypes in general.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the second part, the authors investigate the activity of FK506 on P. falciparum, and conclude that FK506 exerts its antimalarial effects independently of FKBP35. This conclusion is based on the observation that FK506 has the same activity on FKBP35 wild type and knock-out parasites, suggesting that FK506 activity is independent of FKBP35 levels, and on the fact that FK506 kills the parasite rapidly whereas inducible gene knockout results in delayed death phenotype. However, there are alternative explanations for these observations. As mentioned above, the delayed death phenotype could be due to delayed depletion of the protein upon induction of gene knockout. FK506 could have a similar activity on WT and mutant parasites when added before sufficient depletion of FKBP35 protein. In some experiments, the authors exposed KO parasites to FK506 later, presumably when the KO is effective, and obtained similar results. However, in these conditions, the death induced by the knockout could be a confounding factor when measuring the effects of the drug. Furthermore, the authors show that FK506 binds to FKBP35, and propose that the FK506-FKBP35 complex interferes with ribosome maturation, which would point towards a role of FKBP35 in FK506 action. In summary, the study does not provide sufficient evidence to rule out that FK506 exerts its effects via FKBP35.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Noteworthy, we were also very much surprised by data indicating that the antimalarial activity of FK506 is independent of FKBP35. It is for this reason that we conducted a comprehensive set of experiments to disprove our initial observations, but couldn`t find any evidence for an FKBP35-dependent mode of action of FK506:</p>
<p>We were not able to see altered FK506 sensitivity in (i) inducible knock-down parasites, (ii) inducible overexpression parasites and (iii) inducible knock-out parasites. Parasites with altered FKBP35 levels (as assessed by Western blot and quantitative proteomics at 36-42 hpi, respectively) were equally sensitive to FK506. Importantly, at no sub-lethal FK506 concentration did lower FKBP35 levels lead to an altered response of FKBP35<bold>KO</bold> compared to the wild-type control population. Furthermore, (iv) induction of the knock-out in the cycle preceding FK506 exposure also had no effect on parasite sensitivity. As mentioned by the Reviewer, we also exposed the parasites to FK506 at 30-36 hpi and (v) did not see any effect, even though we measured a 19-fold difference in FKBP35 protein levels between the parasite populations at 36-42 hpi. At this point, parasite death induced by the knock-out cannot be a confounding factor (as it was mentioned by the Reviewer), because the FKBP35 knock-out has no effect on parasite survival in generation 1 in the absence of FK506 (Figure 1F). This demonstrates that the observed effect is only due to drug-mediated killing and not due to the FKBP35 knock-out.</p>
<p>To account for a scenario in which the drop in FKBP35 levels only occurs after 36 hpi, we will perform an additional set of experiments, in which we induce the knock-out at 0-6 hpi and treat the parasites at 36-42 hpi (i.e. the time point at which the 19-fold difference in protein levels was measured by quantitative proteomics). This setup will allow determining whether or not the parasite killing activity of FK506 depends on FKBP35 levels.</p>
<p>So far, our experiments cannot support any scenario in which FK506 kills <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites via inhibiting the essential role of FKBP35 and we would therefore want to insist that this statement is based on highly solid evidence. In this context, it is important to note that our conclusion includes two scenarios: “This indicates that either the binding of FK506 does not interfere with the essential role of _Pf_FKBP35, or that _Pf_FKBP35 is inhibited only at high FK506 concentrations that also inhibit other essential factors.” While this phrase is already present in our initial submission, we will emphasize this point more clearly in the revised manuscript. We are convinced that this information is of high importance for ongoing and future drug development.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Thomen et al. FKBP secures ribosome homeostasis in Plasmodium falciparum and focuses on the importance of PfKBP35 protein, its interaction with the FK506 compound, and the role of PfKBP35 in ribosome biogenesis. The authors showed the interaction of the PfKBP54 with FK506, but the part of the FK506 and PfKBP54 in ribosome biogenesis based on the data is unclear.</p>
<p>The introduction is plotted with two parallel stories about PfKBP35 and FK506, with ribosome biogenesis as the central question at the end. In its current form, the manuscript suffers from two stories that are not entirely interconnected, unfinished, and somewhat confusing. Both stories need additional experiments to make the manuscript(s) more complete. The results from PfFBP35 need more evidence for the proposed ribosome biogenesis pathway control. On the other hand, the results from the drug FK506 point to different targets with lower EC50, and other follow-up experiments are needed to substantiate the authors' claims.</p>
<p>The strengths of the manuscript are the figures and experimental design. The combination of omics methods is informative and gives an opportunity for follow-up experiments.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for the evaluation of the manuscript. We apologize for the fact that the Reviewer found the manuscript to be inaccessible. We will use the comments as an incentive to restructure the manuscript and do our best to clarify the presentation, interpretation and conclusion of the presented data in the revised version. We believe that the FKBP35 data are strongly interlinked with the findings on FK506. We will emphasize these links more clearly and are convinced that the complementary nature of the datasets are a particular strength of the presented work.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the detailed and valuable suggestions to improve the manuscript. We agree that CETSA could only identify potential targets of FK506 in the micromolar range, while FK506 showed a high affinity for FKBP35, consistent with earlier reports (2). We would however like to point out that FK506 kills <italic>P. falciparum</italic> at exactly these relatively high concentrations and not at those presumed from the high affinity interactions between FK506 and FKBP35. The relatively high FK506 concentration required to stabilize potential off target proteins is therefore not a concerning observation, but rather corroborates our conclusion that FK506 fails to inhibit the essential function of FKBP35 at concentrations that leave off targets unaffected. As mentioned in response to Reviewer 1, we will describe and discuss these data more clearly in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out the potential issues regarding the use of the term “delayed death phenotype”. We now refer to the FKBP35 phenotype as “delayed death-like” in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We believe that follow-up work on specific FK506 CETSA hits is out of scope of the current and already quite complex manuscript.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the response to Reviewer 1, we realize that the short title of the manuscript can be regarded as an overstatement. Again, this was clearly not our intention and we apologize that the Reviewers had to indicate this issue. While we believe that the message of the title holds true (see response to Reviewer 1), we recognize the misconception that might arise from it, which is why we propose the new title: “Genetic validation of _Pf_FKBP35 as an antimalarial drug target”.</p>
