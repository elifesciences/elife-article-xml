<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Every large multicellular organism studied so far, including plants, interacts with a plethora of microorganisms in its environment. The plant microbiota, which includes bacteria, fungi, protists, nematodes, and viruses, can form complex co-associations with its host. Plant microbial communities have been shown to promote plant growth, nutrient uptake, as well as pathogen resistance, thus promoting plant health in its natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Richardson and Simpson, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pieterse et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Trivedi et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Backer et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gouda et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>). However, our understanding of plant-microbial alliances’ functional mechanisms and broad ecological implications is still in its early stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Martin et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the bacterial communities interacting with plants, a subset known as the root-associated bacteria (RAB) colonizes root compartments, such as the rhizosphere (i.e. the narrow zone surrounding and influenced by plant roots growth and metabolic activity) and intraradical regions and has the ability to modulate plant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mendes et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Qu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dobbelaere et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Walker et al., 2003</xref>). It has been suggested that the holobiont, defined as the host and its associated microbiome, forms a discrete symbiotic ecological unit that has co-evolved to maintain host function and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hassani et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Uroz et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Plants selectively recruit RAB depending on different factors such as host genotype, metabolic profiles, root exudates, and soil physicochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Bulgarelli et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hassani et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liu et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Uroz et al., 2019</xref>). Although the plant and its exudates mostly influence this microenvironment, environmental influences also significantly shape its composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Vives-Peris et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Najera et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, diverse endophytic bacteria possess the ability to produce bioactive compounds of usually low molecular mass, with a wide range of reported functions, as part of their secondary metabolism. These compounds, which are not crucial for the fundamental cellular processes of bacteria in controlled laboratory conditions, often confer selective advantages within natural ecosystems. Such secondary metabolites (SMs) include antibiotics, pigments, toxins, enzyme inhibitors, immunomodulators, effectors of ecological competition or symbiosis, as well as compounds with hormonal activity or particular effects on lipids or carbohydrate metabolism (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fouillaud and Dufosse, 2022</xref>)). Many RABs have been reported to enhance plant growth through processes such as nutrient acquisition, hormonal regulation, protection against pathogens, and mitigation of abiotic stresses (reviewed and discussed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Narayanan and Glick, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Glick, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Olanrewaju et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Glick, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hassani et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mendes et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Qu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Trivedi et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Uroz et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Vandenkoornhuyse et al., 2015</xref>)). These RAB, conferring growth benefits to plant hosts, are collectively referred to as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), which typically belong to the <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Santoyo et al., 2016</xref>). Within these phyla, genera such as <italic>Rhizobium</italic>, <italic>Bacillus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> are prominently recognized as PGPR and have demonstrated functional contributions in mediating seed germination, plant growth and biocontrol of plant disease, notably by conveying secondary metabolites inclusive of antibiotics, volatile compounds, phytohormones and siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Glick, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kang et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Walia et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bloemberg and Lugtenberg, 2001</xref>). Notably, the publication of whole-genome sequences of rhizosphere-inhabiting bacteria facilitates the identification of genes involved in the regulation and production of SMs by comparative and functional genomics. However, despite the established knowledge that symbiotic associations between roots and PGPR provide multiple growth benefits to host plants, little is known regarding the role of PGPR and other RAB in shaping plant ecology through their secondary metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Siefert et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kaur and Sharma, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Orchids, which account for approximately 10% of all seed plants, exhibit intricate associations with diverse microorganisms in their natural habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Givnish et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Givnish et al., 2015</xref>). One example is mycoheterotrophy, an alternative nutritional strategy observed in certain plant species, particularly orchids, which derive sugars and essential nutrients from symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Timilsena et al., 2023</xref>). The marsh orchid <italic>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri</italic> is an allotetraploid (2<italic>n</italic> = 80), mainly found in the eastern hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Paun et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri</italic> is part of the <italic>D. majalis</italic> complex, which has evolved polytopically from unidirectional hybridization between the diploid species <italic>Dactylorhiza fuchsii</italic> and <italic>D. incarnata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Pillon et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Brandrud et al., 2020</xref>). It is slender, usually low-grown with narrow leaves and a lax few-flowered inflorescence, has narrow soil moisture and pH tolerance, and grows in calcareous fens, typically on naturally open sites associated with seepage zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kull and Hutchings, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Soó, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baumann and Künkele, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Delforge, 2001</xref>). The species occurs in low-nutrient soils, characterized in particular by very low levels of available nitrate and other macro and micronutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wolfe et al., 2023</xref>). A recent study documented, at two different localities, a high diversity of fungi associated with the roots of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic> in its natural environment, in comparison to its sibling <italic>D. majalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Emelianova et al., 2024</xref>). Although hybrids and allopolyploids are known to be more resistant to environmental changes due to their larger genomic potential, <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic> is classified as endangered by several organizations in Europe and has proven challenging to grow and maintain under artificial environmental conditions, which is a requirement for ex-situ conservation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Paun et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Blinova and Uotila, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bartók et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Paun et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the rhizosphere-associated bacterial microbiome of <italic>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri</italic>. Our community analysis, based on 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-targeted sequencing, identified <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Myxococcota</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidota</italic>, and <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> as the predominant phyla within the <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic> rhizosphere. Leveraging deep shotgun metagenomics and de novo metagenome assembly, we extracted 47 MAGs, unveiling significant metabolic and biosynthetic capabilities of the orchid’s RAB. Notably, this study represents the first comprehensive investigation into the microbial community of the <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic> rhizosphere, highlighting a potential novel source of critical bioactive substances. Our findings illuminate previously uncharacterized PGPR SM pathways and the discovery of “dark matter” biosynthetic gene clusters, underscoring the rhizosphere’s untapped potential for biotechnological and ecological applications. This research advances our understanding of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>’s microbial interactions and sets the stage for future studies to exploit these microbial consortia for conservation and bioprospecting efforts.</p>

<title>Sampling and sample processing</title>
<p><italic>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri</italic> individuals (from the <italic>turfosa</italic> subspecies) were isolated from the Kitzbühel alpine town region, in the western Austrian province of Tyrol on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2018. The average temperatures recorded in this region during summer are between 13°C and 26°C, and between 0°C and 6°C during winter, with an annual total rainfall estimated to 1,443 mm, the majority occurring primarily during summer in June (average 188 mm). The individuals were potted and maintained at the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna under conditions mimicking those of the sampling region. The sampling of the rhizosphere soil was performed on 03.02.2020 under sterile laboratory conditions. The plantlets were carefully uprooted, the soil discarded by shaking the roots, and the adherent soil directly in contact with the root system collected. Additionally, the roots of the plantlets were washed for 5 min with sterile DNA-free laboratory-grade Sartorius avium® filtered water. Samples were collected in sterile 50 ml Cellstar tubes. Both samples were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -80°C until the metagenomic DNA extraction was performed.</p>

<title>Metagenomic DNA extraction</title>
<p>Isolation of the metagenomic DNA was performed from the rhizosphere soil and the plantlet wash lyophilized samples in a sterile environment. The root wash samples were lyophilized using the FreeZone Freeze Dryer system [LabConco; Cat. 700201000]. 500 mg of lyophilized mass from each sample was transferred to a 2 mL screw cap reaction tube with sterile glass beads. Samples were first disrupted using the FastPrep-24 Classic homogenizer [MPBio; Cat. 116004500] at setting level 6 for 30 seconds. 1 mL of 2xCTAB buffer (pH 8.0) [100 mM Tris (pH 8.0); 20 mM EDTA (pH 8.0); 1.4 M NaCl; 2% (w/v) CTAB] with 4 mL β-mercaptoethanol, was preheated at 55°C and added to the samples, before disrupting the biomass a second time using the FastPrep-24 Classic homogenizer, twice for 30 seconds at setting level 5. The samples were then incubated for 20 minutes at 65°C and centrifuged for 1 minute at 10,000 rpm before transferring the supernatant and foam to fresh, sterilized 2 mL reaction tubes. Next, 400 µL Phenol and 400 µL SEVAG [4% (v/v) isoamyl alcohol; 96% (v/v) chloroform] were added to the samples before vigorous mixing and incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. The aqueous phases were transferred to fresh, sterilized 2 mL reaction tubes, and 800 µL chloroform was added to the samples. The samples were mixed vigorously and centrifuged for 1 minute at 10 000 rpm, before transferring the aqueous phase to fresh sterilized 2 mL reaction tubes. 2 µL RNase A [10 mg/ml [ThermoFisher; Cat: EN0531]] were then added, and the samples mixed by inversion and incubated for 15 minutes at 60°C.</p>
<p>Next, 2 volumes of ice-cold 96% ethanol were added to the samples and incubated overnight at -20°C for RNase A inactivation and DNA precipitation. Following overnight incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatants were discarded, and the DNA pellets were washed once in 500 µL 96% ethanol. The samples were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C, and the DNA pellets washed twice with 500 µL 70% ethanol. After centrifuging for an additional 10 minutes at 10,000 rpm at 4°C, the DNA pellets were dried and resuspended in 100 µL ultra-pure water and incubated overnight at 4°C, before quality assessment. Samples were stored at 4°C.</p>

<title>16<italic>S</italic> rDNA amplicon sequencing and analysis</title>
<p>For bacterial community composition analysis, the V3-V4 fragment of the 16S rDNA gene was amplified from the genomic DNA extracted from the soil and root wash samples. 16S rRNA fragment concentrations in the DNA extracts were quantified using domain-specific quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fontaine et al., 2023</xref>). DNA extracts were normalized based on the 16S rRNA gene concentrations to ensure 16S rRNA gene template molarity for amplification and a two-step barcoding procedure. A first amplification reaction was performed using the 16S rDNA 341F and 805R primer set, containing adapters for the introduction of Illumina adapters (341F + adapter: ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTNNNNCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG; 805R + adapter: AGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC), using Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase [New England Biolabs; Cat: M0491] and the following cycling conditions: 98°C for 1 minute, followed by 20 cycles of 98°C for 10 seconds, 62°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds, and a final extension at 72°C for 2 minutes. The 16S rRNA gene copy concentrations in DNA extracts were determined through quantitative PCR and normalized to equal 16S rRNA fragment copy number to enhance comparability and reduce PCR bias, and purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP [Beckman; Cat: B23319] purification system. Sequencing indexes were introduced in a second amplification reaction with sample-specific barcodes (FWD: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-[index]-ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACG; REV: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT-[index]-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT) using Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase and the following cycling conditions: 98°C for 1 minute, followed by 15 cycles of 98°C for 10 seconds, 66°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds, and a final extension at 72°C for 2 minutes. Amplicon libraries were purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP purification system and quantified using PicoGreen kit [ThermoFisher; Cat: P7589]. The libraries were pooled and diluted to 4 nM before being sequenced for 300 cycles pair-end on the Illumina MiSeq system using the MiSeq® Reagent Kit v2 [Illumina; Cat: MS-102-2002].</p>
<p>Following sequencing, the quality of the 16S amplicon sequences was verified using FastQC (v.0.11.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andrews, 2010</xref>) and sequencing adapter sequences, as well as low-quality reads, were removed from the raw read data using Trimmomatic v.0.40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) with the following parameters: <italic>ILLUMINACLIP:TruSeq3-PE-2.fa:2:30:10:2:keepBothReads LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36</italic>. 16S amplicon sequencing data analysis has been performed using the R package dada2 (v.1.26.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Callahan et al., 2016</xref>), which includes quality filtering, dereplication, dataset-specific error model determination, ASV interference, chimeral removal, as well as taxonomic assignment, as part of its standard workflow.</p>

<p>Shotgun metagenomics sequencing was conducted on the genomic DNA extracted from the soil and root samples. Evaluation of the initial DNA concentrations in the prepared samples was carried out using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit [ThermoFisher; Cat: Q32851]. The libraries were prepared using 1000 ng of genomic DNA, which was fragmented using the Bioruptor sonication device [Diagenode; Cat: B01020001]. Fragments were cleaned up using the GeneJet PCR Purification Kit [ThermoFisher; Cat. #K0701] and size-selected for a 300 bp using Agencourt AMPure XP beads. Sequencing libraries were prepared following the standard NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep with Sample Purification Beads [New England Biolabs; Cat: E7103] procedure. The final library concentrations were determined using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit and the average size of the library was determined using the Agilent 5200 Fragment Analyzer System [Agilent; Cat: M5310AA]. The libraries were pooled and diluted to 4 nM before being sequenced for 600 cycles pair-end on the Illumina MiSeq system using the MiSeq® Reagent Kit v3 [Illumina; Cat: MS-102-3303].</p>

<title>16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing/taxonomic identification</title>
<p>To gain insights into the rhizosphere of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>, a potted orchid (Individuum 1 from Kitzbühel, sampled on 25.05.2018), maintained in the botanical garden of the University of Vienna (Universität Wien), has been transferred to our laboratory environment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). To taxonomically characterize the predominant bacterial and archaeal community inhabiting the rhizosphere of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>, we conducted PCR amplification and sequencing of the V3-V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene from the soil and root wash samples in technical duplicates. Following paired-end sequencing, a total of 240,935 reads were generated, each with a read length of 300 bp (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). After rigorous processing steps, including trimming, filtering of low-quality reads, merging of forward and reverse reads, and removal of chimeric sequences, 106,648 sequences were clustered into 2350 amplicon sequence variants (ASV) with taxonomic assignments spanning 31 phyla and over 84 classes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In total, we identified 2349 bacterial and 1 archaeal ASVs. The prevalence of the five major bacterial phyla ranged from 38.43% to 41.33% for <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, 11.09% to 13.55% for <italic>Actinobacteriota</italic>, 9.40% to 11.90% for <italic>Myxococcota</italic>, 9.72% to 11.37% for <italic>Bacteriodota</italic>, and from 8.72% to 9.26% for <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic> (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Comparisons of ASV abundances across the four samples using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) with the R package vegan revealed no significant differences (similarity p-value &lt; 0.09), indicating a consistent sampling and sequencing approach. Encouraged by the stability of the bacterial composition in the soil surrounding the roots of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic> and the bacteria adhering to the roots themselves (root wash samples), we opted to analyze and process the shotgun metagenomic sequences as a unified sample.</p>

<p>The obtained contigs were binned using Autometa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Miller et al., 2019</xref>), resulting in 37 predicted MAGs, as well as a group of unclustered contigs, which was further binned using MetaBAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kang et al., 2015</xref>), thus resulting in 10 additional MAGs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Overall, from the 248,298 contigs that were binned as Bacteria, 44,138 contigs could be grouped into 47 MAGs, from which 36 MAGs could successfully be reassembled using SPAdes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bankevich et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nurk et al., 2017</xref>). These MAGs represent 359 Mbp of assembled reads, while 14.86% of all reads mapped back to the sequences contained in the combined bacterial MAGs (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). MAG size ranges from 361 kbp to 45.81 Gbp, with N50 ranging from 0.9 kbp to 221 kbp (Table 6).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through comprehensive 16S rDNA profiling, a total of 2,349 bacterial and one archaeal ASVs were identified within the rhizosphere of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>. The predominant bacterial phyla detected included <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Myxococcota</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidota</italic>, and <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>, which collectively accounted for 95% of the sequences identified. Importantly, there were no significant differences in the bacterial community composition between the soil and the root-adhering bacteria associated with <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>. This consistency underscores the robustness and reproducibility of our sample preparation and sequencing methodologies. Moreover, in our review of existing literature on orchid RAB ecology, we validated that our approach successfully recovered representatives from all phyla previously reported in orchid rhizospheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kaur and Sharma, 2021</xref>). Notably, the scientific documentation of orchid RAB through culture-independent methods is relatively scarce. Previous studies have predominantly utilized conventional Sanger sequencing methods, while others employing high-throughput sequencing technologies have primarily focused on 16S rDNA profiling of bacterial communities directly extracted from root samples. Nevertheless, the field of orchid RAB research is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of innovative methodologies. In this context, we introduce a pioneering approach that leverages shotgun metagenomics, followed by the reconstruction of MAGs. This cutting-edge technique promises to offer deeper insights into the complex ecosystem of the orchid rhizobiome, providing unparalleled understanding of its microbial diversity and functional potential. Utilizing shotgun sequencing and <italic>de novo</italic> metagenomic assembly, we successfully obtained 47 bacterial MAGs from the rhizobiome of <italic>D. traunsteineri.</italic> Our detailed analysis focused on four high-quality MAGs: MAG_Dt_01, MAG_Dt_03, MAG_Dt_23, and MAG_Dt_26. Specifically, MAG_Dt_01 was taxonomically assigned to <italic>Actinobacteria bacterium</italic> (taxid 1883427), MAG_Dt_03 to <italic>Acidobacteria bacterium</italic> (taxid 1978231), and MAG_Dt_23 and MAG_Dt_26 to <italic>Dongia</italic> sp. URHE0060 (taxid 1380391) and <italic>Steroidobacter</italic> (taxid 469322), respectively, both belonging to the phylum <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>.</p>
<p>The phyla <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, generally enriched in the rhizosphere, alongside <italic>Acidobacteria</italic>, typically enriched in bulk soil, play pivotal roles in soil carbon and nitrogen cycles as well as the decomposition of organic matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichorst et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Song et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ling et al., 2022</xref>). The <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> phylum represents one of the largest and most diverse bacterial group, inhabiting soil, water and plant tissue (Diab et al., 2024, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Boubekri et al., 2022</xref>), and are prolific producers of SMs including well-known antibiotics such as streptomycin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berdy, 2005</xref>). Beyond antibiotics, they produce a wide array of SMs with potential applications as biopesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barka et al., 2016</xref>). For example, polyketides, such as macrolides, exhibit antifungal activity, while non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), like cyclopeptides, demonstrate insecticidal properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gaynor and Mankin, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Quiroz-Carreno et al., 2022</xref>). The <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> phylum, although highly prevalent within soil ecosystems, is characterized by its challenging cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kalam et al., 2020</xref>). This phylum fulfills crucial ecological functions through its significant involvement in carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur biogeochemical processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Ward et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Eichorst et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hausmann et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> possess genes conducive to survival and competitive colonization within the rhizosphere, thereby facilitating the formation of symbiotic relationships with plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kalam et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). Members of the <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> phylum, such as the <italic>Dongia</italic> and <italic>Steroidobacter</italic> genera, have been frequently isolated from rhizosphere soil and display the potential to degrade complex organic compounds, including various polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ikenaga et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Huang et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Liu et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baik et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kim et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Liu et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Palla et al., 2022</xref>). The high-quality MAGs obtained in this study present a promising opportunity to elucidate in greater detail the roles of these phyla in plant microbiome interactions, particularly regarding their secondary metabolite potential and their impact on plant health and development.</p>
<p>Given that our sampling and sequencing efforts were confined to the rhizobiome of a solitary specimen of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>, caution must be exercised in generalizing the presence and prevalence of the identified MAGs across all populations of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>. However, it is important to note that the sampled individual originated from an extant population and has been maintained under conditions that closely simulate its natural habitat at the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna. These conditions include soil composition, humidity, and temperature, which are critical for mimicking the plant’s natural environment. The controlled yet naturalistic setting in which the specimen was studied provides a valuable context for our findings. Despite the inherent limitations of a single-sample study, our research offers a foundational framework for future interaction studies between RABs and <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>. This study lays the groundwork for more extensive investigations into the microbiome of this orchid species across different populations and environmental conditions. Furthermore, our findings open new avenues for exploring the complex processes involved in the adaptation, ecology, and evolution of this allopolyploid orchid. Understanding the interactions between <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic> and its associated microbiome can shed light on the mutualistic relationships that facilitate plant health, nutrient acquisition, and stress resilience. Such insights are crucial for conservation strategies, especially for orchids that are often sensitive to environmental changes and habitat disturbances. Additionally, the use of advanced metagenomic techniques in our study underscores the potential for discovering novel microbial taxa and functional genes that contribute to the unique ecology of orchid rhizospheres. This approach not only enhances our understanding of plant-microbe interactions but also provides a deeper comprehension of the evolutionary dynamics within the orchid family. Our study, therefore, serves as a stepping stone for future research aimed at unraveling the intricate web of interactions that sustain and influence the biodiversity and ecological success of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>.</p>

<p>This study provided a comprehensive overview of the microbiome inhabiting the rhizosphere of the endangered orchid <italic>Dactylorhiza traunsteineri</italic>. By conducting an in-depth bacterial community composition analysis through 16S rDNA-targeted sequencing, we identified <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, <italic>Myxococcota</italic>, <italic>Bacteroidota</italic>, and <italic>Acidobacteria</italic> as the most abundant phyla within the <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic> rhizosphere. This foundational data highlights the complexity and diversity of the microbial communities associated with this orchid species. Our investigation extended beyond community profiling to include deep shotgun metagenomics sequencing and subsequent <italic>de novo</italic> metagenome assembly. This approach enabled us to extract high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), providing a rich resource for further functional analysis. Each MAG was meticulously analyzed for metabolic pathway enrichment and secondary metabolite (SM) biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), revealing a previously unexplored niche of the rhizobiome. These analyses uncovered potential metabolic capabilities and biosynthetic potentials that are integral to the rhizosphere’s ecological dynamics.</p>
<p>The insights gained from this study not only enhance our understanding of the microbial diversity within the <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic> rhizosphere but also lay the groundwork for future research aimed at unravelling the intricate interconnections between the rhizobiome and its host. The high-quality MAGs we have made available serve as a valuable resource for further exploration of microbial functions and their contributions to the health, adaptation, and survival of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of employing advanced metagenomic techniques to study plant-associated microbiomes, particularly for endangered species. By elucidating the functional roles of key microbial players, we can develop more effective conservation strategies and foster a deeper understanding of the symbiotic relationships that underpin plant resilience and ecological success. In conclusion, our study represents a significant step forward in orchid microbiome research, providing novel insights and a robust platform for future investigations into the dynamic interactions within the rhizosphere of <italic>D. traunsteineri</italic>. These efforts are crucial for advancing our knowledge of plant-microbe interactions and supporting the conservation of this and other endangered orchid species.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The microbiota of Dactylorhiza traunsteineri, an endangered marsh orchid, forms complex root associations that support plant health. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we identified dominant bacterial phyla in its rhizosphere, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidota. Deep shotgun metagenomics revealed high-quality MAGs with rich metabolic and biosynthetic potential. This study provides key insights into root-associated bacteria and highlights the rhizosphere as a promising source of bioactive compounds, supporting both microbial ecology research and orchid conservation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents an investigation of the bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of D. traunsteineri using advanced metagenomic approaches. The topic is relevant, and the techniques are up-to-date; however, the study has several critical weaknesses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Title: The current title is misleading. Given that fungi are the primary symbionts in orchids and were not analyzed in this study (nor were they included among other microbial groups), the use of the term &quot;microbiome&quot; is not appropriate. I recommend replacing it with &quot;bacteriome&quot; to better reflect the scope of the work.</p>
<p>(2) Line 124: The phrase &quot;D. traunsteineri individuals were isolated&quot; seems misleading. A more accurate description would be &quot;individuals were collected&quot;, as also mentioned in line 128.</p>
<p>(3) Experimental design: The major limitation of this study lies in its experimental design. The number of plant individuals and soil samples analyzed is unclear, making it difficult to assess the statistical robustness of the findings. It is also not well explained why the orchids were collected two years before the rhizosphere soil samples. Was the rhizosphere soil collected from the same site and from remnants of the previously sampled individuals in 2018? This temporal gap raises serious concerns about the validity of the biological associations being inferred.</p>
<p>(4) Low sample size: In lines 249-251 (Results section), the authors mention that only one plant individual was used for identifying rhizosphere bacteria. This is insufficient to produce scientifically robust or generalizable conclusions.</p>
<p>(5) Contextual limitations: Numerous studies have shown that plant-microbe interactions are influenced by external biotic and abiotic factors, as well as by plant age and population structure. These elements are not discussed or controlled for in the manuscript. Furthermore, the ecological and environmental conditions of the site where the plants and soil were collected are poorly described. The number of biological and technical replicates is also not clearly stated.</p>
<p>(6) Terminology: Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to the &quot;microbiome,&quot; though only bacterial communities were analyzed. This terminology is inaccurate and should be corrected consistently.</p>
<p>Considering the issues addressed, particularly regarding experimental design and data interpretation, significant improvements to the study are needed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to provide an overview of the D. traunsteineri rhizosphere microbiome on a taxonomic and functional level, through 16S rRNA amplicon analysis and shotgun metagenome analysis. The amplicon sequencing shows that the major phyla present in the microbiome belong to phyla with members previously found to be enriched in rhizospheres and bulk soils. Their shotgun metagenome analysis focused on producing metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), of which one satisfies the MIMAG quality criteria for high-quality MAGs and three those for medium-quality MAGs. These MAGs were subjected to functional annotations focusing on metabolic pathway enrichment and secondary metabolic pathway biosynthetic gene cluster analysis. They find 1741 BGCs of various categories in the MAGs that were analyzed, with the high-quality MAG being claimed to contain 181 SM BGCs. The authors provide a useful, albeit superficial, overview of the taxonomic composition of the microbiome, and their dataset can be used for further analysis.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are not well-supported by the data, as the paper only superficially discusses the results, and the functional interpretation based on taxonomic evidence or generic functional annotations does not allow drawing any conclusions on the functional roles of the orchid microbiota.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors only used one individual plant to take samples. This makes it hard to generalize about the natural orchid microbiome.</p>
<p>The authors use both 16S amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to analyse the microbiome. However, the authors barely discuss the similarities and differences between the results of these two methods, even though comparing these results may be able to provide further insights into the conclusions of the authors. For example, the relative abundance of the ASVs from the amplicon analysis is not linked to the relative abundances of the MAGs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the authors discuss that phyla present in the orchid microbiome are also found in other microbiomes and are linked to important ecological functions. However, their results reach further than the phylum level, and a discussion of genera or even species is lacking. The phyla that were found have very large within-phylum functional variability, and reliable functional conclusions cannot be drawn based on taxonomic assignment at this level, or even the genus level (Yan et al. 2017).</p>
<p>Additionally, although the authors mention their techniques used, their method section is sometimes not clear about how samples or replicates were defined. There are also inconsistencies between the methods and the results section, for example, regarding the prediction of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).</p>
<p>The BGC prediction was done with several tools, and the unusually high number of found BGCs (181 in their high-quality MAG) is likely due to false positives or fragmented BGCs. The numbers are much higher than any numbers ever reported in literature supported by functional evidence (Amos et al, 2017), even in a prolific genus like Streptomyces (Belknap et al., 2020). This caveat is not discussed by the authors.</p>
<p>The authors have generated one high-quality MAG and three medium-quality MAGs. In the discussion, they present all four of these as high-quality, which could be misleading. The authors discuss what was found in the literature about the role of the bacterial genera/phyla linked to these MAGs in plant rhizospheres, but they do not sufficiently link their own analysis results (metabolic pathway enrichment and biosynthetic gene cluster prediction) to this discussion. The results of these analyses are only presented in tables without further explanation in either the results section or the discussion, even though there may be interesting findings. For example, the authors only discuss the class of the BGCs that were found, but don't search for experimentally verified homologs in databases, which could shed more light on the possible functional roles of BGCs in this microbiome.</p>
<p>In the conclusions, the authors state: &quot;These analyses uncovered potential metabolic capabilities and biosynthetic potentials that are integral to the rhizosphere's ecological dynamics.&quot; I don't see any support for this. Mentioning that certain classes of BGCs are present is not enough to make this claim, in my opinion. Any BGC is likely important for the ecological niche the bacteria live in. The fact that rhizosphere bacteria harbour BGCs is not surprising, and it doesn't tell us more than is already known.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. Our original intention was to present the BGC predictions as a resource for future exploration, which is why multiple tools were used. However, we understand how this approach may lead to confusion, particularly regarding the confidence level of the predicted clusters and the potential inflation of counts due to assembly fragmentation or tool sensitivity. In the revised manuscript, we will thoroughly revise this section to clearly distinguish highconfidence predictions from more exploratory findings. We will focus on results supported by stronger evidence, explicitly qualify lower-confidence predictions as putative, and temper any functional interpretations accordingly.</p>
