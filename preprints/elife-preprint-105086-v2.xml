<abstract>
<p>Fluorescent biosensors toggle between two states and for the vast majority of biosensors one state is bright and the other state is dim. As a consequence, there is a substantial difference in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the two states. The dim state has a low signal-to-noise ratio, which is problematic when precise, quantitative measurements are needed. During the engineering of a red-shifted variant of an mTurquoise-based calcium sensor, we serendipitously generated a green-emitting sensor that shows high brightness in both the calcium-bound and -unbound state, while still showing a calcium dependent lifetime change of &gt;1 nanosecond. This sensor, named G-Ca-FLITS, is comparable in brightness to the bright state of GCaMP3 and jGCaMP7c in mammalian cells. The calcium induced loss in fluorescence intensity is only around 30% and therefore we observe little variation in the SNR when calcium levels change. G-Ca-FLITS shows negligible sensitivity to pH in the physiological range, like its turquoise parent. Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM), we measured the calcium concentration with G-Ca-FLITS in various organelles and observed in HeLa cells transient and spatially heterogeneous calcium elevations in mitochondria. Finally, we evaluated the use of G-Ca-FLITS and its turquoise predecessor for two-photon FLIM in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECIs) are by far the largest family of biosensors, with over 100 members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Greenwald et al., 2018</xref>) including the well-known GCaMP series. Many GECIs harboring a single fluorescent protein (FP), like GCaMPs, are optimized for a large intensity change, and have a (very) dim state when calcium levels are below the KD of the probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). This feature is advantageous when using the probe is as a binary detector for increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. However, it makes robust quantification of low, or even intermediate, calcium concentrations extremely challenging.</p>
<p>To enable more precise measurements of low calcium concentrations, a biosensor with an inverted response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barykina et al., 2016</xref>) is a better alternative, as these biosensors are bright in the calcium-free state. However, this only partially addresses the issue, as the measurement precision for high calcium concentrations is compromised since the intensity is low in the calcium saturated state.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage for quantification with intensity-based biosensors is that the fluorescence intensity is affected by many factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Culley et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Waters, 2009</xref>), complicating the measurement of absolute calcium concentrations with biosensors that use intensity contrast as a read-out. Therefore, we and others have engineered genetically encoded biosensors that use other read-outs. New biosensors that report with a change in photochromic behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bierbuesse et al., 2022</xref>), anisotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Laskaratou et al., 2021</xref>), or fluorescence lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Díaz-García et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klarenbeek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>) have been developed.</p>
<p>Despite the more robust read-outs, the measurement precision of all approaches depends on the number of detected photons. For instance, the turquoise lifetime sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS that we developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>) shows a 3-fold intensity change. Yet, the ideal lifetime biosensor would be bright in both states, enabling high measurement precision across its entire dynamic range. Such a biosensor could be used for imaging low concentrations of calcium and subsequent increases, for example in organelles of mammalian cells, including mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Parry et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Calcium signaling in mitochondria is reported to be linked with several pathophysiological processes including inflammatory responses, diabetes, heart failure, neurological diseases and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Delierneux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>). Over the years, mitochondrial calcium concentrations have been measured with imaging techniques; however, there are discrepancies between the reported concentrations. Accurate determination of the affinity of a sensor is important and there are several issues that need to be considered during the calibration and the measurements: (i) the concentrations can only be measured with sufficient precision when it is in the range between 10×K<sub>D</sub> and 1/10×K<sub>D</sub>, (ii) the calibration is only valid when the two extremes are reached during the calibration procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fernandez-Sanz et al., 2019</xref>), (iii) the sensor’s kinetics should be sufficiently fast enough to be able to track the calcium changes, and (iv) the biosensor should be compatible with the high mitochondrial pH of 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cano Abad et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Llopis et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a need for robust biosensors that satisfy all criteria discussed above, enabling quantitative imaging of intracellular calcium concentrations. In this paper we document the development of a green calcium sensor by an optimized bacterial screening method. The biosensor displays a strong lifetime contrast and at the same time remains bright in the calcium-free and -saturated states. We report the spectroscopic properties of the purified sensor and show its use for robust measurements of calcium levels in mitochondria of HeLa cells and endothelial cells by lifetime imaging.</p>

<title>A high throughput method to screen sensors in bacterial lysate</title>
<p>Before creating sensor variants, we developed a high-throughput method to screen different calcium sensors in bacterial lysate. The aim was to grow and isolate 96 bacterial cultures in parallel in a deep well plate. A previously developed lysis buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Danilevich et al., 2008</xref>) served as a starting point for optimization of the protocol. Bacteria expressing the sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS were used to compare the lysis efficiency. The following variables were tested in a 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer: 1) presence or absence of a freeze/thawing cycle, 2) presence or absence of lysozyme, 3) different concentrations of urea (0, 0.5 and 1 M), 4) different concentrations of deoxycholic acid (DOC, 1, 2 and 3%). After lysis, the fluorescence intensity of the bacterial lysates was compared (Figure S1).</p>
<p>In general, a freezing and thawing cycle resulted in a higher fluorescence intensity for most conditions. However, this doubled the duration of the protocol. A high concentration of DOC and urea combined was too harsh for the fluorescent sensor: no intensity was detected. All other conditions were comparable. We favored a buffer without urea to maintain the native state of the proteins, and without lysozyme to omit the need to freshly add this component before each use. Therefore, we chose a protocol with 2% DOC and without a freezing step. The obtained lysates were of sufficient brightness and purity to use for spectral measurements and lifetime measurements.</p>
<p>We explored the possibility of replacing the 2% DOC with other detergents, but no improvements were found. Triton-X100 (0.1-1%) gave lower intensities compared to DOC and caused a problematic amount of foam during handling. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 0.1-0.5%), an anionic surfactant in contrast to non-ionic Triton-X100 and DOC, also gave lower intensities and poses the risk of denaturation of the proteins (Figure S2). Therefore, we chose the 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer with 2% DOC for further experiments.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Creating a red shifted calcium sensor with lifetime contrast</title>
<p>We aimed to generate a green biosensor with lifetime contrast. Therefore, we used the previously developed turquoise sensor (Tq-Ca-FLITS) and mutated residues that potentially induce a red-shift. We subjected the Tq-Ca-FLITS to directed mutagenesis of residues T203 (mTurquoise2 numbering, T81 in the full sensor) and I167 (mTurquoise2 numbering, I45 in the full sensor) to aromatic amino acids. Both residues are located close to the chromophore. The mutation T203Y is known to cause a red shift in green fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ormö et al., 1996</xref>) and mTurquoise2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gorbachev et al., 2017</xref>). We anticipated that π-π stacking of the aromatic residue with the chromophore would result in the color shift in Tq-Ca-FLITS as well. The candidate sensors were expressed in bacteria and the bacteria were subjected to the optimized bacterial lysis protocol. The lysates were screened for a lifetime change and a change in excitation and emission spectra, measured in both the calcium-bound and calcium-free states by addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub> or EDTA (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Figure S3).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Mutations T203Y and T203F both resulted in a red-shifted excitation and emission spectrum in both calcium states, but the shift was more pronounced for the T203Y mutation. This Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y variant also showed a large phase lifetime contrast of Δτ<sub>φ</sub> = -0.9 ns. Surprisingly, this change is inverted compared to Tq-Ca-FLITS (Δτ<sub>φ</sub> = 1.1 ns). The T203F mutation also inverted the lifetime response; however, the contrast was about half of the Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y variant. A mutation of I167F or I167H in the background of the T203Y variant, or a separate I167F mutation on Tq-Ca-FLITS reduced the lifetime contrast and did not result in a (further) red shift.</p>
<p>We also tested the T203Y and T203H mutations on different circular permutations (cp) of Tq-Ca-FLITS, which we created in during the development of the turquoise sensor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>). In almost all cp variants with the T203Y mutation, the same red shift in both the excitation and emission spectra was observed as for Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y. An exception was the cp150-T203Y variant, where we observed a red shift only for the calcium-bound state in both excitation and emission spectra (Table S1, Figure S3). This variant differs from Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y by only a F146Y mutation. A T203H mutation did not cause a red shift in any of the cp variants.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Improving the green lifetime sensor by mutagenesis</title>
<p>We aimed to further improve Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y by mutagenesis in the regions linking the calcium binding domains to the FP. Using a PCR approach, we created a library of sensors with any possible amino acid on positions V27 and N271 (numbering according to the sensor, see Figure S4). Bright green fluorescent colonies on an agar plate were selected for the bacterial lysis test. We found three sensors with an improved lifetime contrast: with alanine or valine on position 27, and aspartic acid or serine at position 271 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The sensor with V27A and N271D gave the best results with a contrast of Δτ<sub>φ</sub> = -1.4 ns. Notably, the lifetime contrast of Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y is larger than measured in the previous screen (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which is due to a difference in temperature: the first screen was performed at 37 °C while this second one was performed at room temperature.</p>

<p>Next, we measured the lifetime response of the three improved variants in HeLa cells (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), before and after saturation of the sensor with ionomycin and calcium. Again, the variant with V27A and N271D gave the best results, with a lifetime change of -1.2 ns (both Δτ<sub>φ</sub> and Δτ<sub>M</sub>, high calcium minus low calcium), which is an improvement of ∼0.3 ns in lifetime change with respect to the parental sensor Tq-Ca-FLITs.

<title>Characterization of G-Ca-FLITS</title>
<p>The G-Ca-FLITS has three mutations relative to its parent Tq-Ca-FLITS (Figure S4). In order to characterize its biophysical properties, we isolated G-Ca-FLITS from bacteria and purified the protein by a Ni-NTA column. The intermediate sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y and a mTurquoise2 with T203Y mutation (mTq2_T203Y) were also purified for comparison (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Figure S5). G-Ca-FLITS shows excitation and emission spectra that are evidently red-shifted when compared to the Turquoise variant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We determined the quantum yield (QY) of G-Ca-FLITS to be 41% for the calcium-free state, and 26% for the calcium-bound state (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Figure S6). This difference of 15% is slightly higher than in the intermediate variant Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y (13%). Interestingly, the quantum yield of mTq2_T203Y is 24%, comparable to the calcium-bound state of G-Ca-FLITS.</p>
<p>For G-Ca-FLITS, the extinction coefficient is for both states around 30,000 M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>, which is slightly higher than mTq2_T203Y (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Figure S7).</p>
<p>We measured the pH sensitivity of G-Ca-FLITS and mTq2_T203Y (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Figure S8). In the calcium-free state the G-Ca-FLITS an increase in fluorescence lifetime in the range pH 4-6, followed by a stable lifetime above pH = 6. In contrast, in the calcium-bound state, the lifetime increases until pH = 5.5, followed by a drop and a stable lifetime above pH = 7. The mTq2_T203Y protein also shows a maximum of fluorescence lifetime at a low pH (pH = 4) followed by a drop and a stable lifetime above pH = 6.</p>

<p>The calcium affinity of the lifetime readout of G-Ca-FLITS was determined at 37°C. To this end, we measured the lifetime of the sensor in a range of calcium buffers using Frequency-Domain FLIM (FD-FLIM) and plotted this in a polar space (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, Figure S9). The two extreme values (zero calcium and 39 μM free calcium) are located on different coordinates in the polar plot and all intermediate concentrations are located on a straight line between these two extremes. Based on the position in the polar plot, we determined the fraction of sensor in the calcium-bound state, while considering the intensity contribution of both states (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Little change in intensity between the two states</title>
<p>During engineering and characterization of G-Ca-FLITS, we noted a low intensity contrast for the two extreme states. For a quantitative brightness analysis in cells, we co-expressed G-Ca-FLITS and the red fluorescent protein mScarlet-I in HeLa cells from a single plasmid, using a P2A sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We determined the ratio of green fluorescence over red fluorescence, to mitigate the effects of transfection efficiency, timing and cell thickness. The measurement was performed on both unstimulated cells, with a low intracellular calcium level, and cells stimulated with ionomycin and extra calcium to raise the calcium concentration to saturation of the sensor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). To normalize the GFP/RFP ratio, we used EGFP-mScarlet-I and a construct without a green FP. G-Ca-FLITS and all its intermediate variants showed a higher intensity in both states compared to mTq2_T203Y. We measured a 0.70-fold change in GFP/RFP ratio for G-Ca-FLITS between the calcium saturated cells and the unstimulated cells.</p>

<p>To compare G-Ca-FLITS to other green GECIs, we repeated the experiment with G-GECO and several variants of GCaMP (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast to G-Ca-FLITS, these sensors show a high GFP/RFP ratio in the calcium saturated state and a low ratio in resting cells, resulting in a large ratio difference between the two states. The fold change was 5.6, 3.1, 4.6 and 6.3 for GCaMP3, GCaMP6s, jGCaMP7c and G-GECO1.1 respectively. The relative intensity of the GCaMPs/GECO in resting cells is much lower compared to the dimmest state of G-Ca-FLITS. We also found a larger standard variation in GFP/RFP in resting cells expressing GCaMP/G-GECO compared to G-Ca-FLITS.</p>
<p>The precision of the fluorescence lifetime depends on the number of photons. We hypothesized that the fluorescence lifetime of G-Ca-FLITS would have a similar precision in both low and high concentrations of calcium, given the small change in intensity. To examine this, we determined the signal to noise ratio (SNR = mean / standard deviation) of the fluorescence lifetime of G-Ca-FLITS in cells, measuring an area of 400 pixels. The absolute SNR is not relevant here, as it will depend on the expression level and acquisition time. But since we have measured the two extremes in the same cells, we can evaluate how the SNR changes between these states for each separate probe (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Figure S11). Indeed, the SNR of G-Ca-FLITS is on average only 13% lower for the high calcium state. In comparison, the SNR of Tq-Ca-FLITS increases more than 2-fold when going from the low to high calcium state, in agreement with its 3-fold change in intensity. In all cases, the variation of the average lifetime of all cells is similar, meaning the average lifetime in the 400 pixels could be properly determined.</p>

<p>Several tags were added to G-Ca-FLITS to target different organelles: the cytosol, the nucleus, the mitochondrial matrix, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

<p>Next, we measured the calcium concentration in the various organelles in the same two cell types, using widefield FD-FLIM. Without stimulation, Hela cells showed an average calcium concentration of 57 nM in the cytosol, 79 nM in the nucleus and 148 nM in the mitochondria. After addition of 5 μg/mL ionomycin and 5 mM calcium, the average concentration was raised above 1 μM. In the ER the concentration was above 1 μM in all experiments. BOECs showed the same pattern, with average concentrations of 73 nM in the cytosol, 101 nM in the nucleus, 119 nM in the mitochondria and above 1 μM in the ER. After stimulation, the concentration in all organelles was elevated to above 1 μM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>In both cell types, no spatial differences were observed in unstimulated cells, except for the mitochondria of HeLa cells. Here, about 20% of the cells, had in peripheral parts a higher calcium concentration, comparable to the concentration in mitochondria after stimulation with ionomycin. These areas are not included in the calculations of the aforementioned averages.</p>
<p>HeLa cells expressing G-Ca-FLITS in the cytosol were stimulated with 1 μM histamine. We observed various patterns of oscillating calcium concentrations, confirming that binding of calcium to G-Ca-FLITS is reversible (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). The calcium concentration was elevated to about 1 μM after addition of ionomycin and calcium, as seen before. The same experiment was repeated with HeLa cells expressing G-Ca-FLITS in the mitochondria (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Stimulation with histamine resulted in either no reaction or an elevation of the calcium concentration followed by a drop to basal level. Addition of ionomycin and calcium resulted in high concentrations as expected.</p>
<p>Since confocal imaging of fluorescence lifetime results in images with a better spatial resolution, we used a confocal microscope with a Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) detector to examine the heterogeneity that we observed in mitochondria. From the confocal lifetime images, it is evident that several cells have mitochondria that show a decreased lifetime in the periphery of the cell (Figure S12). This indicates that mitochondria show heterogeneity and that a pool of mitochondria has increased calcium levels.</p>
<p>The confocal TCSPC system needs relatively long integration times (several minutes) and we turned to a Leica Stellaris system which allows for a &gt;10-fold higher temporal resolution to study calcium dynamics. We introduced the 4mts-G-Ca-FLITS into HeLa cells and acquired a timelapse of lifetime images. At the end of the experiment digitonin was added to acquire the minimal lifetime, reflecting maximal calcium. Using the calibration curve that was generated using purified protein incubated with different calcium buffers (Figure S13) we transformed the FLIM data into calcium concentration images as we did before. The calcium concentration images show the heterogeneity in calcium concentration and its dynamics over time (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). The elevated calcium concentrations are reversible but can last several minutes. Intriguingly, there is substantial difference in the dynamics between patches of mitochondria.</p>

<p>jGCaMP7f exhibited large changes in fluorescence intensity several minutes after we elevated external [K<sup>+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). After a number of minutes (with the exact number varying from fly to fly), calcium levels fluctuated between low and high states synchronously across the field of view (including the EPG neurites visible in the middle of <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref> and the neurites of off-target cells in the bottom corners of the same images). The sample with jGCaMP7f showed only a very small change in lifetime in response to elevated calcium (0.030 nanoseconds ± 0.003, mean ±sd) despite the many-fold shift in fluorescence intensity (5.79 ΔF/F ± 0.503 (mean ± sd).</p>
<p>Tq-Ca-FLITS fluorescence was higher than that of jGCaMP7f at baseline (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>). In contrast, despite the high brightness of G-Ca-FLITS in the apo state in other systems, the baseline intensity of G-Ca-FLITS in these fly neurons was much lower than both jGCaMP7f and Tq-Ca-FLITS, for unclear reasons. Even with increased laser power, G-Ca-FLITS was dimmer than jGCaMP7f at baseline (see Methods) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>, top row).</p>
<p>We evaluated the relative brightness of purified Tq-Ca-FLITS and G-Ca-FLITS on beads by either 1-Photon Excitation (1PE) (at 460 nm) or 2-Photon Excitation (2PE) (at 920 nm) and observed a similar brightness between the two modes of excitations (Figure S14). This shows that the two probes have similar efficiencies in 2PE and suggest that the low brightness of G-Ca-FLITS in Drosophila is due to lower expression or poor folding.</p>
<p>In response to elevated [K<sup>+</sup>], Tq-Ca-FLITS showed large increases in fluorescence (1.672 ΔF/F ± 0.299, mean ± sd) and empirical lifetime (0.893 nanoseconds ± 0.043, mean ± sd) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F-G</xref>). The response of G-Ca-FLITS was also consistent with increases in intracellular calcium: this sensor exhibited large decreases in empirical lifetime (-0.465 nanoseconds ± 0.101 (mean ± sd)), and a modest decrease in intensity (-0.339 ΔF/F ± 0.043, mean ± sd) after perfusion of elevated external [K<sup>+</sup>] (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F-H</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, all three fluorophores exhibit calcium-dependent signals in an intact brain using 2P-FLIM. The Tq-Ca-FLITS lifetime response is particularly large and shows much higher brightness under 2P excitation than G-Ca-FLITS in both the baseline and high calcium states.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most fluorescent biosensors toggle between a dim and a bright state. The dim fluorescence decreases the SNR, thereby increasing the measurement error in quantitative imaging. Here, we present a green calcium biosensor, G-Ca-FLITS, that maintains a consistent brightness over its full dynamic range. The calcium-dependent lifetime decrease of 1.2 ns when calcium is elevated can be used to quantify calcium concentrations in cells. In comparison, the cyan/turquoise sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>) shows a 3-fold change in intensity combined with a similar change in lifetime. The intensity of G-Ca-FLITS is higher than the dim (calcium-free) state of several popular green GCaMPs, and comparable to the bright state of most tested sensors, as determined by ratio imaging with co-expression of mScarlet-I. Of the tested GCaMPs, GCaMP6s seems to have a fairly bright calcium-free state, and we believe this is due to the higher calcium affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 144 nM) of this sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the affinities are 339 nM, 298 nM and 618 nM at room temperature, for G-Ca-FLITS, jGCaMP7c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dana et al., 2019</xref>) and G-GECO1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), respectively.</p>
<p>The minimal change in fluorescence intensity compared to other commonly used calcium biosensors results in a similar SNR for both states of G-Ca-FLITS. Another advantage of a consistently bright probe is that cells and structures labeled with the biosensor can be readily visualized. Therefore, low concentrations of calcium can be precisely measured in unstimulated mammalian cells, as well as increased concentration after stimulation. The quantitative measurements require calibration of the biosensor response to different calcium concentrations. Although the calibration is equipment independent under ideal conditions, and theoretically only needs to be performed once, we do see differences between different set-ups. Therefore, it is necessary to repeat the calibration for different set-ups. We prefer to use the phasor analysis (which can be used for both frequency- and time-domain FLIM), as it makes no assumptions about the underlying decay kinetics.</p>
<p>Our measured concentrations in resting cells agree with literature, 20 - 100 nM is reported for cytoplasm and nucleus, and a slightly higher concentration of 50 - 300 nM in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnaudeau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berridge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dalal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rotrosen and Gallin, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Worthen and Nollert, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>We note that the underlying assumption of the quantification of organellar calcium concentrations is that the lifetime contrast is the same in each organelle. This is broadly true for most of the measurements (Figure S15). Yet, there are also differences. It is currently unclear whether the discrepancies are due to differences in the physicochemical properties of the compartments, or whether there is a technical reason (the efficiency of ionomycin for saturating the biosensor in the different compartments is unknown, as far as we know). This is something that is worth revisiting. A related issue that deserves attention is the level of agreement between in vitro and in vivo calibrations.</p>
<p>All calcium indicators also act as buffers, and this limits the accuracy of the absolute measurements, especially for the lower calcium concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rose et al., 2014</xref>), as the expression of the biosensor is usually in the low micromolar range. Free calcium in the ER is reported to be &gt;300 µM, well above saturation of G-Ca-FLITS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnaudeau et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Using G-Ca-FLITS, we were able to detect various (oscillating) patterns of calcium in HeLa cells after stimulation with histamine. These data show that the sensor is suitable for detection of repeated transient calcium elevations. Importantly, G-Ca-FLITS gives a stable read-out at the high pH of 8.0 in mitochondria. We observed high calcium level in some peripheral mitochondria in HeLa cells, but not in endothelial cells. Others have shown heterogenous responses of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Greotti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>) and electrical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Collins et al., 2002</xref>) in mitochondria. However, this is different from the sustained high levels we observed in exclusively peripheral parts of the cells, without any stimulation. Studies show that mitochondria can be distinguished in different pools based on their location and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ngo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Park et al., 2001</xref>). Peripheral mitochondria are one of these groups and have less connections to the ER compared to other pools. These connections play an important role in calcium signaling of the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Giorgi et al., 2018</xref>). In cancerous cells, like HeLa cells, the mitochondrial calcium homeostasis can be dysregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Delierneux et al., 2020</xref>). We speculate that this leads to the sustained high levels of calcium in some peripheral mitochondria, possibly linked to aberrant connections to the ER.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the sustained high levels we observed in mitochondria have not been reported yet. The types of probes used so far might be a contributing factor. Detecting the sustained high levels without stimulation is hardly possible with a probe that only shows an intensity response, like the widely used Rhod-2 or Aequorin. It is possible by using filterFRET/sensitized emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gadella, 2009</xref>), but this requires extensive controls. Also, much research in mitochondria has been focused on the rise in calcium after stimulation, and therefore probes with a high K<sub>D</sub> (over 1 μM) have been used preferably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnaudeau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fernandez-Sanz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fonteriz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>). This low affinity might be too low to detect the effect we have seen.</p>
<p>G-Ca-FLITS shares its &gt;1 ns lifetime contrast and pH stability with the cyan/turquoise sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS we previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>), but the green emission is advantageous for several reasons: 1) excitation for green FPs is installed on virtually every lifetime microscope, while excitation for cyan FPs is less common, 2) the phototoxicity will be less and the penetration depth will be improved, and 3) it provides possibilities for multiplexing with Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-FLIM sensors that often harbor a cyan-yellow FP pair, for example EPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Klarenbeek et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Since biosensors with a CFP-like chromophore are largely pH insensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">van der Linden et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhong et al., 2024</xref>), and we show here that the pH independence is retained for the Green Ca-FLITS, we expect that adding the T203Y mutation to a cyan sensor is a good approach for generating pH-insensitive green lifetime-based sensors.</p>
<p>The unique properties of the new green calcium sensor are evident from its photophysical properties. The extinction coefficient of the calcium-bound and -free states of G-Ca-FLITS is very similar, but the difference in QY is significant. Interestingly, the lower QY is observed in the calcium-bound state and is very similar to the QY of mTq2_T203Y, the FP that is used in this probe. This, combined with the resemblance in spectral shape and pH sensitivity, indicates that in the calcium-bound state the FP-barrel is probably in roughly the same closed conformation as mTq2_T203Y. When calcium is removed, a more open state is assumed with a more favorable QY, and a higher lifetime. Possibly, the lifetime contrast could be further improved by increasing the QY of the calcium-free state</p>
<p>Usually, a higher QY results in a higher intensity; however, in G-Ca-FLITS the open state has a differential shaped excitation spectrum which leads to a decreased excitation efficiency. These effects combined have resulted in a sensor where the two different states have a similar intensity despite displaying a large lifetime contrast. We note that this effect is dependent on the excitation wavelength. The smallest intensity change is obtained when the calcium-bound state is preferably excited (i.e. near 450 nm) and the effect is less pronounced when the probe is excited near its peak at 474 nm.</p>
<p>We evaluated the use of Tq-Ca-FLITS and G-Ca-FLITS for 2P-FLIM and observed a surprisingly low brightness of the green variant in an intact fly brain. This result is consistent with a study finding that red-shifted fluorescent-protein variants that are much brighter under one-photon excitation are, surprisingly, dimmer than their blue cousins in multi-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Molina et al., 2017</xref>). The responses of both probes were in line with their properties in single photon FLIM, but given the low brightness of G-Ca-FLITS under 2-photon excitation in Drosphila, the Tq-Ca-FLITS is a better choice in this system. Yet, the brightness of G-Ca-FLITS with 2PE at 920 nm is comparable to Tq-Ca-FLITS, so we expect that 2P-FLIM with G-Ca-FLITS is possible in tissues that express it well.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we developed a green fluorescent GECI, named G-Ca-FLITS, with a lifetime contrast of over 1 ns, and a modest intensity change. This sensor does not have one (very) dim state unlike other green GECIs, therefore the variation in the measurement is comparable in both states. In addition, the lifetime response is stable above pH 7. We successfully measured the calcium concentration in various organelles in both HeLa cells and BOECs, including the mitochondria. A portion of HeLa cells show sustained high levels of calcium in some peripheral mitochondria, but further research is required to determine the origin of this heterogeneity. We anticipate that the G-Ca-FLITS will be a valuable tool to examine the heterogeneity of calcium concentrations in mitochondria and other cellular compartments.</p>

<p>DNA fragments were generated by PCR, using Pfu DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies) unless otherwise indicated. DNA fragments were visualized by gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, run for 30 min at 80 V. PCR fragments were purified using the GeneJET PCR purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and digested with restriction enzymes to generate sticky ends. Restriction enzymes were heat inactivated at 80 °C for 20 min if necessary.

Each spectrum was correct for background by subtraction of the spectrum of a well with only buffer. The same plate was used for determination of the fluorescence lifetime of the lysates as described under ‘<bold>Lifetime imaging</bold>.<bold>’</bold> Spectra and lifetimes were recorded after addition of 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (10 µl of 2 mM) to saturate the sensors, and again in the same wells after addition of 9.5 mM EDTA (10 µl of 0.2 M) to remove all calcium from the sensors.

In addition, mTq2_T203Y was measured diluted in a 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). First, a quartz cuvette was filled with 1 mL of the required buffer and the absorbance spectrum (250 - 550 nm, 1 nm step size) was measured using a spectrophotometer (Libra S70, Biochrom). The cuvette was transferred to a JASCO FP-8500 spectrofluorometer and the emission spectrum was recorded at 460 - 700 nm with a 2.5 nm bandwidth and 1 nm intervals, while exciting at 450 nm with 2.5 nm bandwidth, using a scan speed of 500 nm/min, 1 s response time and a medium sensitivity. A small amount of purified protein was added, and the absorbance and emission spectra were recorded again. This was repeated for in total 4 dilutions per protein and while the absorbance at 450 nm was always below 0.05 for the highest concentration. An additional absorbance spectrum was recorded with a peak absorbance “<italic>A</italic><sub>peak</sub>” of 0.5. The same procedure was followed for rhodamine as a reference in 1 mM NaOH.</p>
<p>Absorbance spectra were corrected by subtraction of the offset of the spectrum between 541 and 550 nm, followed by subtraction of the spectrum of only buffer. The resolution of the spectrophotometer is too low for the low protein levels, so the resulting spectra are not smooth. Therefore, the additionally taken absorbance spectrum with <italic>A</italic><sub>peak</sub> = 0.5 were fitted to the low-resolution spectra. From this fit, the absorbance at 450 nm (<italic>A</italic><sub>450</sub>) was determined for each dilution of protein. Emission spectra were corrected for spectral sensitivity of the detector and the spectrum of the only buffer sample was subtracted. The spectral area “<italic>I</italic><sub>em</sub>” under corrected emission spectra was calculated by integration between 460 - 700 nm.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> calibration</title>
<p>Purified G-Ca-FLITS were diluted 1000× in calcium buffers ranging from 0 to 39 µM, using the Calcium Calibration Buffer Kit #1 according to manufacturers’ instructions. Dilutions were made in triplicate in a 96-well plate with black walls and flat glass bottom (89626, Ibidi). Fluorescence lifetime was recorded of each well as described under ‘<bold>lifetime imaging’</bold>, first at RT and later at 37 °C, using the same plate. The average phase and modulation lifetime (<italic>τ</italic><sub>ϕ</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>M</sub>) of the full view were determined per well. The average <italic>τ</italic><sub>ϕ</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>M</sub> were determined for 0 and 39 µM free Ca<sup>2+</sup>, these are “min” and “max”. The Phase (Φ) and modulation (<italic>M</italic>) were calculated from the recorded lifetimes and displayed in a polar plot as <italic>G</italic> and <italic>S</italic> coordinates:

<p>The angular frequency of modulation, <italic>2πf</italic>, is given by “<italic>ω</italic>”, and we used <italic>f</italic> = 40 MHz.

<p>The line fraction was corrected of for the intensity contribution of the two states to find the true fraction “<italic>F</italic>”, with <italic>F</italic> = 1 representing all sensors in the calcium-bound state (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. 4</xref>). The intensity ratio (<italic>R</italic>) between states in vitro was determined to be <italic>R</italic> = 0.836, based on the theoretical ratio calculated from the spectra of the sensor and the instrument settings, see Supplemental Note 1).

<p>The 95% confidence interval (CI) of the fraction of the two extremes was determined from the data. The mean of the low calcium state plus the CI was determined to be the lowest measurable fraction, the mean of the high calcium state minus the CI was determined to be the highest measurable fraction.

<title>pH sensitivity</title>
<p>A series of buffers ranging from pH 2.8 to 10.1 were prepared, using 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 2.8 - 5.8), MOPS buffer (pH 6.3 - 7.9) and glycine/NaOH buffer (pH 8.2 - 10.1). Buffers additionally contain 0.1 M KCl and 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> or 5 mM EGTA. The pH of each buffer was determined including all components shortly before use. Purified G-Ca-FLITS or mTq2_T203Y was diluted 520× in the prepared buffers, using a predilution of 40× and a total volume of 200 µL. The dilutions were made in triplicate in a 96-well plate with black walls and flat glass bottom (89626, ibidi).

<title>Ratiometric imaging</title>
<p>HeLa cells co-expressing a green calcium sensor (or green FP) and mScarlet-I form a single plasmid (pFR) were imaged 24 h after transfection at 37 °C, using an Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon) equipped with a Spectra X Light Engine (Lumencor) for excitation and an Orca flash 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu). Cells were imaged using a Plan Apo ×10 NA 0.45 air objective. For imaging of GFP, a 470 nm LED, a 470/24 nm excitation filter and a quad band cube (MXU 71640, Nikon) were used. For RFP, a 575 nm LED, a 575/25 nm excitation filter and the same quad band cube were used. Only the middle of the field of view was used, to minimize the unequal illumination. A 4×4 tile scan was performed and channels were imaged sequentially.</p>
<p>Fluorescence was recorded without stimulation and directly after stimulation with a mix of ionomycin (5 μg/mL, I-6800, LClaboratories) and calcium (5 mM). Background was subtracted from the images and the average green and red fluorescence intensity of individual cells was measured using ImageJ (version 1.52k). The ratio GFP/RFP was calculated for each cell. As a control, we used a sample with only mScarlet-I (ratio GFP/RFP = 0) and a sample with EGFP and mScarlet-I (ratio GFP/RFP = 1). The ratio of all cells was normalized to the controls. The experiment was performed twice per construct.</p>

<title>Confocal imaging</title>
<p>Confocal images of HeLa cells and BOECs expressing G-Ca-FLITS were taken with a Leica Sp8 system (Leica) with a ×63 objective (HL PL Apo, C2S NA 1.40 oil) at 37 °C and 7% (HeLa cells) or 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (BOECs). HeLa cells were imaged in MM and BOECs in growth medium, as stated before. A 488 nm Argon laser was used for imaging, combined with an Acousto-Optical Beam Splitter (AOBS), and fluorescence was collected with a HyD at 500 - 780 nm. The pinhole was set to 1 AU.</p>

<title>Confocal TCSPC imaging - Picoharp TCSPC module</title>
<p>Confocal fluorescence lifetime images of G-Ca-FLITS expressed in mitochondria of Hela cells were acquired at an FV1000 (Olympus) confocal microscope equipped with a Picoharp TCSPC module (PicoQuant). A field of view of 256×256 pixels (207 - 331 nm per pixel) was illuminated with a pulsed 485 nm Picoquant diode laser (20 MHz, 0.4 kW∙cm<sup>-2</sup>) using an Olympus UPLS Apo 60x water NA1.2 objective lens. The fluorescence signal was detected in confocal mode with the pinhole diameter set at 130 µm. The fluorescence passed a 405/480/560/635 dichroic mirror, was filtered by a 505 - 540 nm emission filter and detected by avalanche photodiodes (MPD).</p>
<p>In order, to obtain a reliable fluorescence lifetime the measurement times of the sample channel was set such that at least 10<sup>5</sup> photons were collected. An image of the median arrival times per pixel was inspected for heterogeneity. Based on the image, one or more regions were manually selected for fitting of a decay curve. The full fluorescence decay curves (5-6 minutes integration time) were fitted in the Symphotime64 software (PicoQuant) using a bi-exponential decay model including an instrumental response function generated from the same dataset. On basis of visual inspection of the fit, the fit residuals and the minimal Chi square the fitted results were accepted or discarded. The fitting of the decay curves was repeated for all areas, but now an integration time of 1 minute was used. The fitting was repeated for every minute, to obtain information about temporal variation.</p>

<title>Confocal TCSPC imaging – Leica Stellaris</title>
<p>Confocal fluorescence lifetime images of G-Ca-FLITS expressed in mitochondria of Hela cells were acquired with a Leica Stellaris8 equipped with a pulsed white light laser set to 40 MHz and a 40x NA 0.95 air PL APO objective. The excitation was at 474 nm and the emission was detected between 490 nm and 600 nm by the HyDX2 detector. The pinhole was set to 4.4 airy units, the imaging speed to 400 Hz per line (pixel dwell time 3.16 µs) with 8 line repetitions and a frame size of 512×512 (pixel size 0.259 µm). For live-cell imaging, the images were acquired every minute.</p>
<p>The data was saved as .ptu file and a custom script was used to convert these data into G and S images. The G and S data, together with the K<sub>D</sub> determined by the calibration, were used to convert the data into calcium concentration.</p>

<title>Imaging and analysis of 2P-FLIM of Drosophila</title>
<p>We imaged the brain of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> females attached to a custom physiology platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Maimon et al, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mussells Pires et al., 2024</xref>). This platform keeps the fly’s body dry and in air, with the brain exposed to an experimentally determined saline. The flies were freely dangling and we did not track their behavior. We removed the superior cuticle of the head (the frons and anterior ocellar cuticle) to access the brain dorsally for optical imaging. Extracellular saline was prepared as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mussells Pires et al., 2024</xref>), consisting of (in mM): 103 NaCl, 3 KCl, 5 TES, 10 trehalose dihydrate, 10 glucose, 2 sucrose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub> titrated with Milli-Q water to an osmolarity of 280-285 mOsm. The high [K+] solution exchanged the concentrations of NaCl with KCl, keeping the osmolarity and [Cl-] unchanged.</p>
<p>The saline was kept at ∼21°C for the duration of all experiments using a Warner Instruments temperature controller (CL-100) driving a Peltier device (SC-20). The Peltier device was placed in-line with tubing (Tygon 2375) that perfused the preparation with saline at a rate of ∼3 mL per minute. A thermistor in the bath was used to regulate the Peltier device in closed loop. The high [K+] solution was applied by allowing flow through the perfusion line to exchange with the extracellular solution, which was gradually aspirated out of the chamber using a glass pipette attached to a vacuum. Each recording was given ∼10 minutes to respond to the new solution and we estimate that the saline composition of the preparation was fully replaced within ∼1 min.</p>
<p>The 2P-FLIM setup uses an Olympus 20x 1.0 NA water immersion objective (XLUMPLFLN) on a customized Sutter MIMMs to be detailed in a later manuscript by SCT and GM. A Coherent Discovery NX laser’s tunable beam set to 920 nm (with -12,500 fs2 of dispersion compensation) was used to excite all three fluorophores.</p>
<p>Frames were collected at a resolution of 256 × 256 pixels and the time series data shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> are plotted at ∼1 Hz. Flies expressing jGCaMP7f or Tq-Ca-FLITS were imaged with ∼20 mW of laser power measured after the objective, while flies expressing G-Ca-FLITS were imaged with ∼30 mW laser power.</p>
<p>The fluorescence lifetime was computed by fitting the first 1200 frames to a biexponential distribution convolved with a Gaussian plus randomly distributed uniform noise by minimizing the chi-squared statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Thornquist et al., 2020</xref>). The offset of this fit was used to adjust the mean photon arrival time within each frame (empirical lifetime), and the contribution of the estimated noise was subtracted out. Explicitly, the arrival time histogram was fit to the equation:

<p>This manuscript reports on an FLIM-based calcium biosensor, G-CaFLITS. It represents an <bold>important</bold> contribution to the field of genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensors, and will serve as a practical tool for the FLIM imaging community. The paper provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence of G-CaFLITS's photophysical properties and its advantages over previous biosensors such as Tq-Ca-FLITS. Although the benefits of G-Ca-FLITS over Tq-Ca-FLITS are limited by the relatively small wavelength shift, it presents some advantages in terms of compatibility with available instrumentation and brightness consistency.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>van der Linden et al. report on the development of a new green-fluorescent sensor for calcium, following a novel rational design strategy based on the modification of the cyan-emissive sensor mTq2-CaFLITS. Through a mutational strategy similar to the one used to convert EGFP into EYFP, coupled with optimization of strategic amino acids located in proximity of the chromophore, they identify a novel sensor, G-CaFLITS. Through a careful characterization of the photophysical properties in vitro and the expression level in cell cultures, the authors demonstrate that G-CaFLITS combines a large lifetime response with a good brightness in both the bound and unbound states. This relative independence of the brightness on calcium binding, compared with existing sensors that often feature at least one very dim form, is an interesting feature of this new type of sensors, which allows for a more robust usage in fluorescence lifetime imaging. Furthermore, the authors evaluate the performance of G-CaFLITS in different subcellular compartments and under two-photon excitation in Drosophila. While the data appears robust and the characterization thorough, the interpretation of the results in some cases appears less solid, and alternative explanations cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The approach is innovative and extends the excellent photophysical properties of the mTq2-based to more red-shifted variants. While the spectral shift might appear relatively minor, as the authors correctly point out, it has interesting practical implications, such as the possibility to perform FLIM imaging of calcium using widely available laser wavelengths, or to reduce background autofluorescence, which can be a significant problem in FLIM.</p>
<p>The screening was simple and rationally guided, demonstrating that, at least for this class of sensors, a careful choice of screening positions is an excellent strategy to obtain variants with large FLIM responses without the need of high-throughput screening.</p>
<p>The description of the methodologies is very complete and accurate, greatly facilitating the reproduction of the results by others, or the adoption of similar methods. This is particularly true for the description of the experimental conditions for optimal screening of sensor variants in lysed bacterial cultures.</p>
<p>The photophysical characterization is very thorough and complete, and the vast amount of data reported in the supporting information is a valuable reference for other researchers willing to attempt a similar sensor development strategy. Particularly well done is the characterization of the brightness in cells, and the comparison on multiple parameters with existing sensors.</p>
<p>Overall, G-CaFLITS displays excellent properties for a FLIM sensor: very large lifetime change, bright emission in both forms and independence from pH in the physiological range.</p>
<p>Comment on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have significantly improved the manuscript, and overall I fully agree in maintaining the assessment as it is now.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Van der Linden et al. describe the addition of the T203Y mutation to their previously described fluorescence lifetime calcium sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS to shift the fluorescence to green emission. This mutation was previously described to similarly red-shift the emission of green and cyan FPs. Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y behaves as a green calcium sensor with opposite polarity compared with the original (lifetime goes down upon calcium binding instead of up). They then screen a library of variants at two linker positions and identify a variant with slightly improved lifetime contrast (Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y_V27A_N271D, named G-Ca-FLITS). The authors then characterize the performance of G-Ca-FLITS relative to Tq-Ca-FLITS in purified protein samples, in cultured cells, and in the brains of fruit flies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work is interesting as it extends their prior work generating a calcium indicator scaffold for fluorescent protein-based lifetime sensors with large contrast at a single wavelength, which is already being adopted by the community for production of other FLIM biosensors. This work effectively extends that from cyan to green fluorescence. While the cyan and green sensors are not spectrally distinct enough (~20-30nm shift) to easily multiplex together, it at least shifts the spectra to wavelengths that are more commonly available on commercial microscopes.</p>
<p>The observations of organellar calcium concentrations were interesting and could potentially lead to new biological insight if followed up.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present a variant of a previously described fluorescence lifetime sensor for calcium. Much of the manuscript describes the process of developing appropriate assays for screening sensor variants, and thorough characterization of those variants (inherent fluorescence characteristics, response to calcium and pH, comparisons to other calcium sensors). The final two figures show how the sensor performs in cultured cells and in vivo drosophila brains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is presented clearly and the conclusion (this is a new calcium sensor that could be useful in some circumstances) is supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are probably few circumstances where this sensor would facilitate experiments (calcium measurements) that other sensors would prove insufficient.</p>
<p>Comment on revised version:</p>
<p>I think the manuscript has been significantly improved and I concur with the eLife Assessment statement.</p>
<p>[Editors' note: There are no further requests by the reviewers. All of them expressed their approval of the new version of the manuscript.]</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper demonstrates the application of G-CaFLITS in various cellular subcompartments without providing direct evidence that the sensor's response is not affected by the targeting. Showing at least that the lifetime values in the saturated state are similar in all compartments would improve the robustness of the claims.</p>
<p>In some cases, the interpretation of the results is not fully convincing, leaving alternative hypotheses as a possibility. This is particularly the case for the claim of the origin of the strongly reduced brightness of G-CaFLITS in Drosophila. The explanation of the intensity changes of G-CaFLITS also shows some inconsistency with the basic photophysical characterization.</p>
<p>While the claims generally appear robust, in some cases they are conveyed with a lack of precision. Several sentences in the introduction and discussion could be improved in this regard. Furthermore, the use of the signal-to-noise ratio as a means of comparison between sensors appears to be imprecise, since it is dependent on experimental conditions.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for a thorough evaluation and for suggestions to improve our manuscript. We are happy with the recognition of the strengths of this work. The list with weaknesses has several valid points which will be addressed in a point-by-point reply and a revision.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Van der Linden et al. describe the addition of the T203Y mutation to their previously described fluorescence lifetime calcium sensor Tq-Ca-FLITS to shift the fluorescence to green emission. This mutation was previously described to similarly red-shift the emission of green and cyan FPs. Tq-Ca-FLITS_T203Y behaves as a green calcium sensor with opposite polarity compared with the original (lifetime goes down upon calcium binding instead of up). They then screen a library of variants at</p>
<p>two linker positions and identify a variant with slightly improved lifetime contrast (TqCa-FLITS_T203Y_V27A_N271D, named G-Ca-FLITS). The authors then characterize the performance of G-Ca-FLITS relative to Tq-Ca-FLITS in purified protein samples, in cultured cells, and in the brains of fruit flies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work is interesting as it extends their prior work generating a calcium indicator scaffold for fluorescent protein-based lifetime sensors with large contrast at a single wavelength, which is already being adopted by the community for production of other FLIM biosensors. This work effectively extends that from cyan to green fluorescence. While the cyan and green sensors are not spectrally distinct enough (~20-30nm shift) to easily multiplex together, it at least shifts the spectra to wavelengths that are more commonly available on commercial microscopes.</p>
<p>The observations of organellar calcium concentrations were interesting and could potentially lead to new biological insight if followed up.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The new G-Ca-FLITS sensor doesn't appear to be significantly improved in performance over the original Tq-Ca-FLITS, no specific benefits are demonstrated.</p>
<p>(2) Although it was admirable to attempt in vivo demonstration in Drosophila with these sensors, depolarizing the whole brain with high potassium is not a terribly interesting or physiological stimulus and doesn't really highlight any advantages of their sensors; G-Ca-FLITS appears to be quite dim in the flies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for a thorough evaluation and for suggestions to improve our manuscript. Although the spectral shift of the green variant is modest, we have added new data (figure 7) to the manuscript that demonstrates multiplex imaging of G-Ca-FLITS and Tq-Ca-FLITS.</p>
<p>As for the listed weaknesses we respond here:</p>
<p>(1) Although we agree that the performance in terms of dynamic range is not improved, the advantage of the green sensor over the cyan version is that the brightness is high in both states.</p>
<p>(2) We agree that the performance of G-Ca-FLITS is disappointing in Drosophila. We feel that this is important data to report, and it makes it clear that Tq-Ca-FLITS is a better choice for this system. Depolarization of the entire brain was done to measure the maximal lifetime contrast.</p>

The final two figures show how the sensor performs in cultured cells and in vivo drosophila brains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is presented clearly and the conclusion (this is a new calcium sensor that could be useful in some circumstances) is supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are probably few circumstances where this sensor would facilitate experiments (calcium measurements) that other sensors would prove insufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the evaluation of our manuscript. As for the indicated weakness, we agree that the main application of genetically encoded calcium biosensors is to measure qualitative changes in calcium. However, it can be argued that due to a lack of tools the absolute quantification has been very challenging. Now, thanks to large contrast lifetime biosensors the quantitative measurements are simplified, there are new opportunities, and the probe reported here is an improvement over existing probes as it remains bright in both states, further improving quantitative calcium measurements.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>While the science in the paper appears solid, the methods well grounded and excellently documented, the manuscript would benefit from a revision to improve the clarity of the exposition. In particular:</p>
<p>Part of the introduction appears like a patchwork of information with poor logical consequentiality. The authors rapidly pass from the impact of brightness on FLIM accuracy, to mitochondrial calcium in pathology, to the importance of the sensor's affinity, to a sentence on sensor's kinetics, to fluorescent dyes and bioluminescence, to conclude that sensors should be stable at mitochondrial pH. I highly recommend rewriting this part.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for the comment and we have adjusted to introduction to better connect the parts and increase the logic. The updated introduction addresses all the feedback by the reviewers on different aspects of the introductory text, and we have removed the section on dyes and bioluminescence. We feel that the introduction is better structured now.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The reference to particular amino acid positions would greatly benefit from including images of the protein structure in which the positions are highlighted, similar to what the same authors do in their fluorescent protein development papers. While in the case of sensors a crystal structure might be lacking, highlighting the positions with respect to an AlphaFold-generated structure or the structure of mTq2 might still be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this remark and we have added a sequence alignment of the FLITS probes to supplemental Figure S4. This shows the residues with number, and we have also highlighted the different domains, linkers and mutations. We think that this linear representation works better than a 3D structure (one issue is that alphafold fails to display the chromophore and it has usually poor confidence for linker residues).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The use of SNR, as defined by the authors (mean of the lifetime divided by standard deviation) appears a poorly suited parameter to compare sensors, as it depends on the total number of collected photons and on the strength of the algorithms used to retrieve the lifetime value. In an extreme example, if one would collect uniform images with millions of photons per pixel, most likely SNR would be extremely good for all sensors in all states, irrespective of the fact that some states are dimmer (within reasonable limits). On the other hand, if the same comparison would be performed at a level of thousands or hundreds of photons per pixel, the effect of different brightness on the SNR would be much more dramatic. While in general I fully agree with the core concept of the paper, i.e. that avoiding low-brightness forms leads more easily to experiments with higher SNR, I would suggest to stick to comparing the sensors in terms of brightness and refer to SNR (if needed) only when describing the consequences on measurements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is right that in absolute terms the SNR is not meaningful. In addition to acquisition time, it depends on expression levels. Yet, it is possible to compare the change in SNR between the apo- and saturated states, and that is what is shown in figure 5. We have added text to better explain that the change in SNR is relevant here:</p>
<p>“The absolute SNR is not relevant here, as it will depend on the expression level and acquisition time. But since we have measured the two extremes in the same cells, we can evaluate how the SNR changes between these states for each separate probe”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some statements from the authors or aspects of the paper appear problematic:</p>
<p>(1) &quot;Additionally, the fluorescence of most sensors is a non-linear function of calcium concentration, usually with Hill coefficients between 2 and 3. This is ideal when the probe is used as a binary detector for increases in Ca2+ concentrations, but it makes robust quantification of low, or even intermediate, calcium concentrations extremely challenging.&quot;</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, for all sensors the fluorescence response is a nonlinear function of calcium concentrations. If the authors have specific examples in mind in which this is not true, they should cite them specifically. Furthermore, the Hill coefficient defines the range of concentrations in which the sensor operates, while the fact that &quot;low concentrations&quot; might be hard to detect depends only on the dim fluorescence of some sensors in the unbound form.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this part is not clearly written and confusing, as the sentence “Additionally, the fluorescence of most sensors is a non-linear function of calcium concentration, usually with Hill coefficients between 2 and 3” was not relevant in this section and so we removed it. Now it reads:</p>
<p>“Many GECIs harboring a single fluorescent protein (FP), like GCaMPs, are optimized for a large intensity change, and have a (very) dim state when calcium levels are below the KD of the probe (Akerboom et al., 2013; Dana et al., 2019; Shen et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2011). This is ideal when the probe is used as a binary detector for increases in Ca2+ concentrations, but it makes robust quantification of low, or even intermediate, calcium concentrations extremely challenging”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) &quot;The affinity of a sensor is of major importance: a low KD can underestimate high concentrations and vice versa.&quot;</p>
<p>It is not clear to me why the concentrations would be underestimated, rather than just being less precise. Also, if a calibration curve is plotted in linear scale rather than logarithmic scale, it appears that the precision problem is much more severe near saturation (where low lifetime changes result in large concentration changes) than near zero (where low concentration changes produce large lifetime changes).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this could be better explained, what we meant to say that concentrations that are ~10x lower or higher than the KD cannot be precisely measured. See also our reply to the next comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) &quot;Differences can also arise due to the method of calibration, i.e. when the absolute minimum and maximum signal are not reached in the calibration procedure (Fernandez-Sanz et al., 2019).&quot;</p>
<p>Unless better explained, this appears obvious and not worth mentioning.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What may be obvious to the reviewer (and to us) may not be obvious to the reader, and that’s why this is included. To make it clearer we rephrased this part as a list of four items:</p>
<p>“Accurate determination of the affinity of a sensor is important and there are several issues that need to be considered during the calibration and the measurements: (i) the concentrations can only be measured with sufficient precision when it is in the range between 10x K<sub>D</sub> and 1/10x K<sub>D</sub>, (ii) the calibration is only valid when the two extremes are reached during the calibration procedure (Fernandez-Sanz et al., 2019), (iii) the sensor’s kinetics should be sufficiently fast enough to be able to track the calcium changes, and (iv) the biosensor should be compatible with the high mitochondrial pH of 8 (Cano Abad et al., 2004; Llopis et al., 1998).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In the experiments depicted in Figure 6C the underlying assumption is that the sensor behaves in the same way independently of the compartment to which it is targeted. This is not necessarily the case. It would be valuable to see the plots of Figure 6C and D discussed in terms of lifetime. Is the saturating lifetime value the same in all compartments?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a valid point and we have now included a plot with the actual lifetime data for each of the organelles (figure S15).</p>
<p>We have also added text to discuss this point: “We note that the underlying assumption of the quantification of organellar calcium concentrations is that the lifetime contrast is the same. This is broadly true for most of the measurements (Figure S15). Yet, there are also differences. It is currently unclear whether the discrepancies are due to differences in the physicochemical properties of the compartments, or whether there is a technical reason (the efficiency of ionomycin for saturating the biosensor in the different compartments is unknown, as far as we know). This is something that is worth revisiting. A related issue that deserves attention is the level of agreement between in vitro and in vivo calibrations.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) A similar problem arises for the observation of different calcium levels in peripheral mitochondria. In figure S11b, the values of the two lifetime components of a biexponential fit are displayed. Both the long and short components seem to be different. This is an interesting observation, as in an ideal sensor (in which the &quot;long lifetime conformation&quot; is the same whether the sensor is bound to the analyte or not, and similarly for the short lifetime one) those values should be identical. While it is entirely possible that this is not the case for G-CaFLITS, since the authors have conducted a calibration experiment using time-domain FLIM, could they show the behavior of the lifetimes and preamplitudes? Are the trends consistent with their interpretation of a different calcium level in the two mitochondrial populations?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have analyzed the calibration data from TCSPC experiments done with the Leica Stellaris. From these data (acquired at high photon counts as it is purified protein in solution), we infer that both the short and long lifetime do change as a function of calcium concentration. In particular the long lifetime shows a substantial change, which we cannot explain at this moment. We agree that this is interesting and may potentially give insight in the conformation changes that give rise to the lifetime change.</p>
<p>The lifetime data of the mitochondria has been acquired with a different FLIM setup, but the trend is consistent, both the long and short lifetime decrease in the peripheral mitochondria that have a higher calcium concentration.</p>

<p>(6) &quot;The lifetime response of Tq-Ca-FLITS and the ΔF/F response of jGCaMP7f resembled each other, with both signals gradually increasing over the span of 3-4 minutes after we increased external [K+]; the two signals then hit a plateau for ~1 min, followed by a return to baseline and often additional plateaus (Figure 8B-C). By comparison, G-Ca-FLITS responses were more variable, typically exhibiting a smaller ramping phase and seconds-long spikes of activity rather than minutes-long plateaus (Figure 8C).&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This statement does not appear fully consistent with the data in Figure 8. While in figure 8B it looks like GCaMP and mTq-CaFLITS have very similar profiles, these curves come from one single experiment out of a very variable dataset (see Figure 8C). If one would for example choose the second curve of GCaMP in Figure 8C, it would look very similar to the response of G-CaFLITS in figure 8B, and the argument would be reversed. How do the averages look like?</p>
<p>Indeed, the dynamics of the responses are very variable and we do not want to draw attention to these differences in the dynamics, so we have removed the comparison. Instead, the difference in intensity change and lifetime contrast are of importance here. To answer the question of the reviewer, we have added a new panel (D) which shows the average responses for each of the GECIs.</p>

<p>(7) &quot;Although the calibration is equipment independent under ideal conditions, and only needs to be performed once, we prefer to repeat the calibration for different setups to account for differences in temperature or pulse frequency.&quot;</p>
<p>While I generally agree with the statement, it is imprecise. A change in temperature is generally expected to affect the Kd, so rather than &quot;preferring to repeat&quot;, it is a requirement for accurate quantification at different concentrations. I am not sure I understand what the pulse frequency is in this context, and how it affects the Kd.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for pointing out that our text is imprecise and confusing. What we meant to say is that we see differences between different set-ups and we have clarified this by changing the text. We have also added that it is “necessary” to repeat the calibration:</p>
<p>“Although the calibration is equipment independent under ideal conditions, and only needs to be performed once, we do see differences between different set-ups. Therefore, it is necessary to repeat the calibration for different set-ups.”</p>

<p>(8) &quot;A recent effort to generate a green emitting lifetime biosensor used a GFP variant as a template (Koveal et al., 2022), and the resulting biosensor was pH sensitive in the physiological range. On the other hand, biosensors with a CFP-like chromophore are largely pH insensitive (van der Linden et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2024).&quot;</p>
<p>The dismissal of the use of T-Sapphire as a pH independent template is inaccurate. The same group has previously reported other sensors (SweetieTS for glucose and Peredox for redox ratio) that are not pH sensitive. Furthermore, in Koveal et al. also many of the mTq2-based variants showed a pH response, suggesting that the pHdependence for the Lilac sensor might be more complex. Still, G-CaFLITS present advantages in terms of the possibility to excite at longer wavelengths, which could be mentioned instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We only want to make the point that adding the T203Y mutation to Turquoise-based lifetime biosensors may be a good approach for generating pH insensitive green biosensors. There is no point in dismissing other green biosensors and we have changed the text to: “Since biosensors with a CFP-like chromophore are largely pH insensitive (van der Linden et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2024), and we show here that the pH independence is retained for the Green Ca-FLITS, we expect that adding the T203Y mutation to a cyan sensor is a good approach for generating pH-insensitive green lifetime-based sensors.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) &quot;Usually, a higher QY results in a higher intensity; however, in G-Ca-FLITS the open state has a differential shaped excitation spectrum which leads to a decreased intensity. These effects combined have resulted in a sensor where the two different states have a similar intensity despite displaying a large QY and lifetime contrast.&quot;</p>
<p>This statement does not seem to reflect the excitation spectra of Figure 1. If this explanation would be true, wouldn't there be an isoemissive point in the excitation spectrum (i.e. an excitation wavelength at which emission intensity would not change)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The excitation spectra in figure 1 are not ideal for the interpretation as these are not normalized. The normalized spectra are shown in figure S10, but for clarity we show the normalized spectra here below as well. For the FD-FLIM experiments we used a 446 nm LED that excites the calcium bound state more efficiently. Therefore, the lower brightness due to a lower QY of the calcium bound state is compensated by increased excitation. So the limited change in intensity is excitation wavelength dependent. We have added a sentence to the discussion to stress this:</p>
<p>“The smallest intensity change is obtained when the calcium-bound state is preferably excited (i.e. near 450 nm) and the effect is less pronounced when the probe is excited near its peak at 474 nm”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) &quot;We evaluated the use of Tq-Ca-FLITS and G-Ca-FLITS for 2P-FLIM and observed a surprisingly low brightness of the green variant in an intact fly brain. This result is consistent with a study finding that red-shifted fluorescent-protein variants that are much brighter under one-photon excitation are, surprisingly, dimmer than their blue cousins in multi-photon microscopy (Molina et al., 2017). The responses of both probes were in line with their properties in single photon FLIM, but given the low brightness of G-Ca-FLITS under 2-photon excitation, the Tq-Ca-FLITS may be a better choice for 2P-FLIM experiments.&quot;</p>
<p>The differences appear strikingly high, and it seems improbable that a reduction in two-photon absorption coefficient might be the sole cause. How can the authors rule out a problem in expression (possibly organism-specific)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewers are correct that the changes in brightness between G-Ca-FLITS and Tq-Ca-FLITS may arise from changes in expression levels. It is difficult to calibrate for these changes explicitly without a stable reference fluorophore. However, both the G-Ca-FLITS and Tq-Ca-FLITS transgenic flies produced used the same plasmid backbone (the Janelia 20x-UAS-IVS plasmid), landed in the same insertion site (VK00005) of the same genetic background and were crossed to the same Janelia driver line (R60D05-Gal4), so at the level of the transcriptional machinery or genetic regulatory landscape the two lines are probably identical except for the few base pair differences between the G-Ca-FLITS and Tq-Ca-FLITS sequence. But the same level of transcription may not correspond to the same amount of stable protein in the ellipsoid body. So, we cannot rule out any organism-specific problems in expression. To examine the 2P excitation efficiency relative to 1P excitation efficiency, we have measured the fluorescence intensity of purified G-Ca-FLITS and Tq-Ca-FLITS on beads.

<p>Suggestions</p>
<p>(1) The underlying assumption of any experiment using a biosensor is that the concentration of the biosensor should be roughly 2 orders of magnitude lower than the concentration of the analyte, otherwise the calibration equations do not hold. When measuring nM concentrations of calcium, this problem can be in principle very significant, as the concentration of the sensor in cells is likely in the low micromolar range. Calcium regulation by the cell should compensate for the problem, and the equations should hold. However, this might not hold true during experimental conditions that would disrupt this tight regulation. It might be a good thing to add a sentence to inform users about the limitations in interpreting calcium concentration data under such conditions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Good point. We have added this to the discussion: “All calcium indicators also act as buffers, and this limits the accuracy of the absolute measurements, especially for the lower calcium concentrations (Rose et al., 2014), as the expression of the biosensor is usually in the low micromolar range.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Different methods of lifetime &quot;averaging&quot;, such as intensity or amplitude-weighted lifetime in time domain FLIM or phase and modulation in frequency domain might lead to different Kd in the same calibration experiment. This is an underappreciated factor that might lead to errors by users. Since the authors conducted calibrations using both frequency and time-domain, it would be useful to mention this fact and maybe add a table in the Supporting Information with the minima, maxima and Kds calculated using different lifetime averaging methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To avoid biases due to fitting we prefer to use the phasor plot, this can be used for both frequency and time-domain methods and we added a sentence to the discussion to highlight this: “We prefer to use the phasor analysis (which can be used for both frequency- and time-domain FLIM), as it makes no assumptions about the underlying decay kinetics.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The origin of the redshift observed in G-CaFLITS is likely pi-stacking, similar to the EGFP-to-EYFP case. While previous studies suggest that for mTq2 based sensors a change in rigidity would lead to a change in the non-radiative rate, which would result in similar changes in quantum yield and (amplitude-weighted average) lifetime. If pi-stacking plays a role, there could be an additional change in the radiative rate (as suggested also by the change in absorption spectra). Could this play a role in the relation between brightness and lifetime in G-CaFLITS? Given the extensive data collected by the authors, it should be possible to comment on these mechanistical aspects, which would be useful to guide future design.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do appreciate this suggestion, but we currently do not have the data to answer this question. The inverted response that we observe, solely due to the introduction of the tyrosine is puzzling. Perhaps introduction of the mutation that causes the redshift in other cyan probes will provide more insight.</p>

<p>Specific points:</p>
<p>The first section of Results is basically a description of how they chose the lysis conditions for screening in bacteria.

<p>In the Results section Characterization of G-Ca-FLITS, the authors state &quot;Here, the calcium affinity was KD = 339 nM, higher compared to the calibration at 37{degree sign}C.

<p>2P FLIM / Fig 8 / Fig S4: The lack of brightness of G-Ca-FLITS in the 2P FLIM of fruit fly brain could have been predicted with a 2P cross section of the purified protein. If the equipment to perform such measurements is available, it could be incorporated into Fig S4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not have access to equipment that measures the 2P cross section. As an alternative, we compared the 2P excitation efficiency with 1P excitation efficiency. To this end, we have used beads that were loaded with purified G-Ca-FLITS or Tq-Ca-FLITS. We have evaluated the fluorescence intensity of the beads using 1P (460 nm) and 2P (920 nm) excitation. Although the absolute intensity cannot be compared (the G-Ca-FLITS beads have a lower protein concentration), we can compare the relative intensities when changing from 1P to 2P. The 2P excitation efficiency of G-Ca-FLITS is comparable (if not better) to that of Tq-Ca-FLITS. This excludes the option that the G-Ca-FLITS has poor 2P excitability. We will include this data as figure S12.</p>
<p>We also have added text to the results: “We evaluated the relative brightness of purified Tq-Ca-FLITS and G-Ca-FLITS on beads by either 1-Photon Excitation (1PE) (at 460 nm) or 2-Photon Excitation (2PE) (at 920 nm) and observed a similar brightness between the two modes of excitations (figure S14). This shows that the two probes have similar efficiencies in 2PE and suggest that the low brightness of GCa-FLITS in Drosophila is due to lower expression or poor folding.” and discussion: “The responses of both probes were in line with their properties in single photon FLIM, but given the low brightness of G-Ca-FLITS under 2-photon excitation in Drosphila, the Tq-Ca-FLITS is a better choice in this system. Yet, the brightness of G-Ca-FLITS with 2PE at 920 nm is comparable to Tq-Ca-FLITS, so we expect that 2P-FLIM with G-Ca-FLITS is possible in tissues that express it well.”</p>
