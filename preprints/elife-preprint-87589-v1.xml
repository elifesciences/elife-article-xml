<abstract>
<p>Astrocytes exert multifarious roles in the formation, regulation, and function of synapses in the brain, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Interestingly, astrocytes abundantly express neuroligins, postsynaptic adhesion molecules that bind to presynaptic neurexins. A pioneering recent study reported that loss-of-function of neuroligins in astrocytes impairs excitatory synapse formation and astrocyte morphogenesis. This study suggested a crucial synaptic function for astrocytic neuroligins but was puzzling given that constitutive neuroligin deletions do not decrease excitatory synapse numbers. Thus, we here examined the function of astrocytic neuroligins using a rigorous conditional genetic approach with deletion of all major neuroligins (<italic>Nlgn1-3</italic>) in astrocytes. Our results show that early postnatal deletion of neuroligins from astrocytes has no effect on cortical or hippocampal synapses and does not alter the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes. Thus, astrocytic neuroligins are unlikely to shape synapse formation or astrocyte development but may perform other important functions in astrocytes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Astrocytes play a vital role across the lifespan of a synapse, with important functions at every point from synapse formation to synaptic transmission to synapse elimination (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Farhy-Tselnicker and Allen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Eroglu and Barres 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lyon and Allen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Nagai et al., 2021</xref>). The emergence of novel tools to genetically access and interrogate astrocytes has paved the way for a new field dedicated to understanding the molecular mechanisms by which astrocytes influence synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, recent RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies have revealed astrocytic expression of cell-adhesion molecules that were traditionally viewed as specifically <italic>synaptic</italic> in nature. The astrocytic expression of these synaptic cell-adhesion molecules gives rise to a parsimonious and attractive hypothesis that accounts for how astrocytes form interactions with synapses at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Saint-Martin and Goda, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tan and Eroglu, 2021</xref>). This hypothesis posits that astrocytes are integrated into tripartite synapses via these adhesion molecules and that positive or negative signaling mediated by these adhesion molecules regulates synapse formation, synaptic function, and synapse elimination. Prominent among synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are expressed by astrocytes are neuroligins, a family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules that bind to presynaptic neurexins, presynaptic LAR-type receptor tyrosine phosphatases, and postsynaptic MDGA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Connor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Qin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Südhof 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bemben et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yoshida et al., 2021</xref>) (see below, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Mice express four neuroligin genes (<italic>Nlgn1-4</italic>) that encode homologous proteins with an identical domain structure and a high degree of sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ichtchenko et al., 1995</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bolliger et al. 2008</xref>). Despite their similarity, however, neuroligins display different localizations in brain and perform distinct non-redundant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; Chanda et al., 2018). Specifically, <italic>Nlgn1</italic> protein is found only at glutamatergic excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Song et al., 1999</xref>), <italic>Nlgn2</italic> at GABAergic inhibitory and cholinergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Graf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Panzanelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hoon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patrizi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Takacs et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2018</xref>), and <italic>Nlgn3</italic> at both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Budreck and Scheiffele, 2007</xref>). <italic>Nlgn4</italic>, conversely, is present in glycinergic synapses in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hoon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) but is expressed only at lower levels in brain and in human neurons functions at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Marro et al., 2019</xref>), making a definitive assignment of <italic>Nlgn4</italic> to synapse types difficult.</p>
<p>Since astrocytes physically interact with synapses and carry out important functions at synapses, astrocytic neuroligins are ideally positioned to control synapses, which neuroligins could do via binding to other cell-adhesion molecules and regulating astrocyte-neuron interactions at tripartite synapses. Indeed, a landmark study showed that astrocytic expression of neuroligins controls synapse formation in mice and that one specific neuroligin isoform in particular, <italic>Nlgn2</italic>, plays a central role in enabling excitatory synapse formation in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> revealed that <italic>Nlgn2</italic> and other neuroligins control the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes since a loss-of-function of <italic>Nlgn2</italic> and other neuroligins greatly reduced astrocytic branching in mixed cortical cultures of glia and neurons and in the visual cortex in vivo, leading even to a complete loss of astrocyte arborization. Although the dramatic results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> have guided all recent reviews on tripartite synapses, they were puzzling because <italic>Nlgn2</italic> protein has only been detected in inhibitory but not in excitatory synapses by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Graf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Panzanelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hoon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patrizi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Takacs et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2018</xref>). It was thus difficult to understand how astrocytic <italic>Nlgn2</italic> could control excitatory synapses since <italic>Nlgn2</italic> appears to be absent from excitatory synapses. Moreover, deletions of <italic>Nlgn2</italic> that remove the protein from both neurons and glia cells did not alter the number of strength of excitatory synapses but severely impaired inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chubykin et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the constitutive knockout (KO) of Nlgn1-3 had no effect on excitatory or inhibitory synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Varoqueaux et al. 2006</xref>). Viewed together, these results are difficult to reconcile with each other, prompting fundamental questions about the role of astrocytic neuroligins in synapses.</p>
<p>The importance of understanding the potential role of astrocytic neuroligins in synapse formation, the high level of neuroligin expression in astrocytes, and the discrepancies between previous results motivated us in the present study to examine the fundamental functions of astrocytic neuroligins. Using a rigorous genetic approach, we show that early postnatal deletions of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> selectively in astrocytes does not significantly alter excitatory or inhibitory synapse numbers or functions (<italic>Nlgn4</italic> was not targeted owing to its low expression levels). Moreover, <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> deletions had no effect on the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes. Thus, astrocytic neuroligins likely do not function to shape the morphology of astrocytes or the contribution of astrocytes to tripartite synapses but probably have other important non-synaptic roles.</p>

<title>Astrocytes abundantly express <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic></title>
<p>For a gene to be involved in a particular physiological process, it must be expressed in the right place at the right time. To assess the expression of neuroligins in astrocytes in comparison with other cell types in brain, we examined the mRNA levels of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in various brain cells by analysis of published RNA sequencing (RNAseq) datasets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, S1). <italic>Nlgn4</italic> mRNAs were not detected in these datasets, possibly because of the low expression levels or high GC content of <italic>Nlgn4</italic> mRNAs. We quantified <italic>Nlgn1</italic>, <italic>Nlgn2</italic>, and <italic>Nlgn3</italic> mRNA transcripts in astrocytes and other cell types in the mouse hippocampus and cortex in the single-cell RNAseq datasets from the McCaroll Lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Saunders and Macosko et al., 2018</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dropviz.org">www.dropviz.org</ext-link>), Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schaum et al. 2018</xref>), Wu lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Zhang et al. 2014</xref>), and Linnarson lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mousebrain.org">www.mousebrain.org</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>). Interestingly, these quantifications showed that all three neuroligins were abundantly expressed in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in addition to neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>). The relative expression levels of <italic>Nlgn1</italic>, <italic>Nlgn2</italic>, and <italic>Nlgn3</italic> in different cell types differed, probably because different RNAseq procedures and data analysis algorithms were used, but all datasets revealed similarly high neuroligin expression levels in neurons and astrocytes and generally even higher expression levels in OPCs. <italic>Nlgn3</italic> was consistently the most astrocyte-enriched neuroligin isoform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). A prominent expression of neuroligins in astrocytes was further supported by bulk RNAseq experiments performed by the Khakh lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.astrocyternaseq.org">www.astrocyternaseq.org</ext-link>) using astrocytic mRNAs purified via the RiboTag approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>) from the cortex, hippocampus, or striatum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Again, all three isoforms were detected across these brain regions, with <italic>Nlgn3</italic> identified as the most enriched isoform compared to the input.</p>
<p>In mice, the major period for developmental synaptogenesis occurs over the first three weeks of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Semple et al., 2013</xref>), although synapses are continuously eliminated and reformed throughout life. Measurements of the expression of neuroligins in brain as a function of postnatal development showed that neuroligin expression parallels the process of synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Irie et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, comparative analysis of RNAseq data from the Barres lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Clarke et al., 2018</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brainrnaseq.org">www.brainrnaseq.org</ext-link>) indicates that during this period, astrocytes in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum also express <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>), consistent with a role in the establishment of neural circuits. Thus, neuroligins are expressed in the right place and time for a role as astrocytic drivers of synapse formation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Conditional deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in astrocytes</title>
<p>To assess the fundamental functions of astrocytic neuroligins in synaptogenesis and astrocyte development, we generated mice that enable the inducible conditional deletion of astrocytic <italic>Nlgn1</italic>, <italic>Nlgn2</italic>, and <italic>Nlgn3</italic>. We targeted the conditional deletion specifically to astrocytes by crossing Aldh1l1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> BAC transgenic mice that exhibit astrocyte-specific expression of tamoxifen-activatable Cre-recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Winchenbach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) with <italic>Nlgn1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> conditional KO (cKO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We then bred homozygous female triple <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> cKO mice with male triple cKO mice carrying the Aldh1l1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> allele to generate littermate male and female Cre-positive test mice and Cre-negative control mice. Mice were injected with tamoxifen intraperitoneally at postnatal days 10 and 11 (P10 and P11) or subcutaneously at postnatal day 1 (P1), and were analyzed at P35 – P48 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). These two Cre activation timepoints were chosen because manipulation of astrocytic neuroligins at P10-11 has been previously reported to reduce astrocyte morphogenesis and excitatory synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. 2017</xref>), and because we also wanted to ensure that we could capture a possible earlier function of astrocytic neuroligins during the major phase of developmental synaptogenesis that occurs around P6-12 in mice.</p>

<p>(<bold>D</bold> &amp; <bold>E</bold>) To confirm the specificity and efficiency of the deletion of target genes in astrocytes using the Aldh1l1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> BAC transgenic mouse line via tamoxifen injection at P1, Cre-recombination was visualized in the hippocampus (<bold>D</bold>) and primary visual cortex (<bold>E</bold>) via expression of tdT in reporter mice (magenta).

<p>To confirm the efficacy of CreER<sup>T2</sup> induction, we focused on the subcutaneous tamoxifen injections at P1 since this condition was used for most of our experiments as the most rigorous approach and was not validated in detail previously. We crossed Aldh1l1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> BAC transgenic mice with Cre-dependent tdTomato (tdT) reporter mice (Ai14), injected the resulting double-transgenic mice subcutaneously with tamoxifen at P1, and analyzed the mice at P35 by staining brain sections for tdTomato (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In the CA1 region of the hippocampus of these mice, we observed tdTomato-labeling in over 80% of astrocytes in the <italic>S. oriens</italic>, <italic>S. pyramidale</italic>, <italic>S. radiatum</italic>, or <italic>S. lacunosum</italic>-<italic>moleculare</italic>. We found no neuronal recombination except for low levels in the dentate gyrus that is populated by adult-born neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). In layer IV (L4) of the primary visual cortex (V1), we also detected Cre-dependent tdTomato expression only in astrocytes without non-specific recombination in neurons. Again, approximately 90% of astrocytes expressed tdTomato as an indicator of Cre activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>).

Given that astrocytes account for only ∼20% of cells in brain, the absence of a significant decrease in neuroligin proteins in brain after the <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> deletion in astrocytes is not surprising as one would expect maximally a ∼20% decrease in neuroligin levels if mRNA and protein levels perfectly correlated.

The finding of a ∼25% decrease in <italic>Nlgn3</italic> levels in cortex after the P1 induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>) is consistent with this assessment since <italic>Nlgn3</italic> is the most abundantly expressed neuroligin isoform in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Astrocytic neuroligins are dispensable for hippocampal synapse formation</title>
<p>Measurements of synaptic proteins are a relatively insensitive approach to assessing synapse numbers. For a more direct measurement, we labeled cryosections from the brains of littermate astro-<italic>Nlgn123</italic> cKO and control mice at P35 after P1 induction of Cre-recombinase with antibodies to the excitatory presynaptic marker vGluT1, the excitatory postsynaptic marker Homer1 and the dendritic marker MAP2, and counterstained the sections with DAPI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Because excitatory synapses in the hippocampus are too dense to be individually resolved by confocal imaging, we used the overall staining intensity as a proxy for synapse density.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Astrocytes are integral to shaping neural circuits. In the gray matter of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Halassa et al. 2007</xref>), hippocampus (CA1 <italic>S. radiatum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bushong et al. 2001</xref>), and cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Spacek 1985</xref>), astrocytes (or their cousins, the Bergmann glia in the cerebellum) occupy non-overlapping territories, effectively “tiling” the neuropil. Within their territories, astrocytes not only contact all other cells in brain, but also associate with axons and dendrites and ensheath synaptic junctions, thus forming tripartite synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Saint-Martin and Goda, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Oliveira and Araque, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lyon and Allen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Arizono and Nägerl, 2022</xref>). Astrocytes exhibit an exceptionally complex cytoarchitecture that includes thousands of fine processes infiltrating the neuropil where these processes likely perform multiple essential functions. At tripartite synapses, astrocyte functions include the removal of released glutamate from the perisynaptic area via glutamate transporters, thereby facilitating input specificity and preventing neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ventura and Harris 1999</xref>). Astrocytes express numerous neurotransmitter receptors, enabling them to contribute to synaptic signaling and to respond to synaptic activity in a dynamic and activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allen and Eroglu, 2017</xref>). Moreover, astrocytic processes contain an array of ion channels that regulate their activity and contribute to ionic homeostasis not only at synapses but also at other cellular locations, such as the nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Black and Waxman, 1988</xref>) and blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Attwell et al., 2010</xref>). The molecular mechanisms by which astrocytes interact with synapses and other brain components, however, are incompletely understood.</p>
<p>Recent transcriptomic studies revealed that, in addition to neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, astrocytes express multiple cell-adhesion molecules that are known to function at synapses, suggesting that synaptic cell-adhesion molecules may mediate the integration of astrocytes into tripartite synapses and that astrocytes may regulate synapses via signals that are transmitted by such cell-adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Saint-Martin and Goda, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tan and Eroglu, 2021</xref>). Indeed, our analysis of multiple independent RNAseq datasets showed that astrocytes express high levels in particular of neuroligins, canonical postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are known to be essential for synaptic function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The absolute and relative expression levels of different neuroligin isoforms in astrocytes varied among studies, but all studies concurred in the conclusion that the mRNA levels of the three major neuroligins (<italic>Nlgn1-3</italic>) are overall similar in astrocytes and neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <italic>Nlgn4</italic> was not captured in the RNAseq studies owing to its low abundance and/or the high GC content of its mRNA). Thus, neuroligins are clearly not neuron-specific, which is consistent with the possibility that neuroligins in astrocytes function to embed astrocytes in tripartite synapses and to enable astrocytes to contribute to the formation and performance of synapses, a hypothesis that was proposed in a pioneering paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref>.</p>
<p>Motivated by this paper that has since guided all reviews on the subject, we here investigated the function of neuroligins expressed in astrocytes. We aimed to achieve two related goals. First, to test the hypothesis inherent in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> paper that neuroligins as synaptic cell-adhesion molecules perform a critical role in astrocytes by promoting synapse formation. Second, to address a major contradiction arising from a comparison of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> paper with previous studies. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> showed that astrocytic neuroligins in general are essential for excitatory synapse formation and for the normal morphology of astrocytes, and that <italic>Nlgn2</italic> in particular is required for excitatory synapse formation. Inconsistent with this conclusion, however, numerous earlier studies detected <italic>Nlgn2</italic> protein only in inhibitory but not in excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Graf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Panzanelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hoon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patrizi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Takacs et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">2018</xref>). Moreover, extensive earlier experiments showed that constitutive deletion of <italic>Nlgn2</italic> in both neurons and glia caused a dysfunction of only inhibitory but not of excitatory synapses (Vareauqueaux et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chubykin et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether neuroligins expressed in astrocytes, as opposed to neuroligins expressed in neurons, perform an essential function in synapse formation, we used a rigorous genetic approach. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model that enables conditional deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in all astrocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and analyzed the effect of such deletion in depth in the hippocampal CA1 region and the visual cortex. Using two different time points of induction of the deletion of astrocytic neuroligins (P1 and P10-11; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), we made two principal observations.</p>
<p>First, deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> from astrocytes has no detectable effect on the density of excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus or cortex, or on the properties of spontaneous excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. We established this conclusion by extensive immunocytochemical analyses using a panel of antibodies to synaptic markers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), by electrophysiology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), and by quantification of the synaptic proteome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, astrocytic <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> are not required for synapse formation or maintenance.</p>
<p>Second, deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> from astrocytes does not cause a measurable change in the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This was assessed by monitoring the astrocyte protein composition, GFAP staining in the hippocampus, and three-dimensional reconstruction of astrocytes in the hippocampus or cortex. Thus, <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> are not required for the morphogenesis or cell shape maintenance of astrocytes.</p>
<p>Two questions arise at this point. First, is it possible that the genetic deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in astrocytes for some reason was ineffective? To assess the efficiency of the tamoxifen-induced deletion of floxed genes, we quantified Cre-activity using the P1 induction protocol, which is the approach used for most experiments in this paper since it aims to permanently delete (not just knock down) neuroligins at a time early in development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref>). We observed Cre-mediated recombination in &gt;80% of astrocytes but in &lt;5% of neurons except for the dentate gyrus in which neurons are continuously replenished by adult neurogenesis. This finding confirms that the genetic approach efficiently induces Cre-recombinase activity, which in turn we previously demonstrated using the same conditional triple <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> alleles employed here quantitatively deletes all three neuroligin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chanda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, how can we explain that our results are inconsistent with those of the pioneering study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref>, although they are consistent with other previous studies? There are multiple differences between our approach and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> that may contribute to the differences in results. We used a purely genetic approach, whereas most data in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> paper were obtained with RNA-interference (RNAi). RNAi is prone to side effects because of off-target effects and, more importantly, because RNAi interferes with the entire microRNA processing machinery of a cell.</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> also used conditional <italic>Nlgn2</italic> KO mice (the same alleles that we originally generated and that were used in the present study) for analyses of spontaneous synaptic transmission. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> employed the tamoxifen-induced deletion of astrocytic <italic>Nlgn2</italic> at P10-11 using the GLAST-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mouse line, which led led to an impairment in the function of excitatory synapses in the layer V of the primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. 2017</xref>). This suggests that at least for some of their findings, off-target effects by RNAi cannot completely explain the differences with our results. Another feature in which the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> differs from ours is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> largely employed ‘sparse’ deletions of neuroligins in a subset of astrocytes, whereas we used a global deletion of neuroligins in nearly all astrocytes. The phenotypes of sparse deletions is often difficult to interpret functionally because a mutant cell with a deletion can be at a competitive disadvantage with surrounding wild-type cells, leading to changes that are not directly related to the function of the deleted gene but are caused by this competitive disadvantage. It is thus possible, maybe even likely, that neuroligins perform a non-synaptic function in astrocytes, and that owing to indirect downstream effects induced by the competition with surrounding wild-type astrocytes, the shape of the mutant astrocytes and the formation of excitatory synapses may have been compromised even though astrocytic neuroligins are not important for the formation of synapses.</p>
<p>Astrocytes tile the neuropil by engaging in competition with neighboring astrocytes for individual territories through a mechanism similar to that of dendritic tiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Freeman 2010</xref>). Thus, we might expect that a sparse manipulation would produce an exaggerated phenotype over that of a global manipulation. An indirect effect produced by a competitive disadvantage induced with a sparse deletion has been recently reported in astrocytes for hepatocyte cell-adhesion molecule (hepaCAM). In this study, sparse deletion of hepaCAM led to a reduction in the volume of the astrocyte territory, while global deletion of hepaCAM had no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baldwin et al. 2021</xref>). Additionally, it has been reported that while global deletion of Nlgn1 <italic>in vivo</italic> has no effect on synapse number in cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, sparse deletion via electroporation of shRNA targeting <italic>Nlgn1</italic> results in a reduction of spine density and synapse number, although it was unclear from that study whether the shRNA acted by a <italic>Nlgn1</italic>-specific mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A further difference between our study and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> is the timepoint of quantification. Our analyses were performed at P35-42, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> examined synapses at P21, prior to completion of synaptic and astrocytic morphological refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Freeman 2010</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the phenotype observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> is developmentally transient in nature and recovers upon completion of brain maturation. A transient effect of this type has been described for loss of astrocytic <italic>Nlgn2</italic> in Drosophila. Here, RNAi knockdown of astrocytic <italic>Nlgn2</italic> delayed motor circuit closure during development but did not result in robust, lasting behavioral phenotypes after the critical period had passed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackerman et al. 2021</xref>). It is important to note that, in agreement with our data indicating that astrocytic neuroligins do not control astrocyte morphogenesis, astrocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Nlgn2</italic> in drosophila has also been shown to have no effect on astrocyte volume or tiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackerman et al. 2021</xref>). Furthermore, in a screen investigating astrocyte diversity across the nervous system, neuroligins were not identified among the genes driving differences in astrocyte morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Endo et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, it seems likely that expression of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in astrocytes has no direct function in synapse formation or in shaping the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes, but that <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> perform other important roles in astrocytes that remain to be identified. Continual advances in the tools available to access astrocytes, in concert with genetic models that allow temporally-defined manipulation of genes, will be key to discovering these roles that may provide new insights into astrocyte biology.</p>

<title>Tamoxifen Injections</title>
<p>To prepare tamoxifen for injection, 1g of tamoxifen (Sigma, Cat # T5648-1G) was mixed with 10 ml of 200 proof ethyl alcohol (Gold Shield) at room temperature for 15 minutes while protected from light with foil. This mixture was then combined with 90 ml of corn oil (Sigma, Cat# C8267) and agitated at 37°C for 1-2 hours until fully dissolved, while continuing to protect from light. Aliquots of 1 ml were stored at −20°C. On the day of injections, tamoxifen aliquots (10mg/ml) were thawed to room temperature. Tamoxifen solution was injected with an insulin syringe intraperitoneally/subcutaneously with a series of two 30 µl injections at P10 and P11 or one 20 µl injection subcutaneously in the neck at P1.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then decapitated. Hippocampus and cortex were collected in RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA) with cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Cat# 11873580001) on ice. Tissue samples were homogenized with a dounce tissue grinder on ice, rotated at 4°C for 30 min, and finally centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min. Supernatant was collected from the samples and protein content was quantified using a BCA assay (Thermo, Cat# 23225). Protein lysates were stored at −80°C until use.</p>
<p>Quantified protein lysates were added to Laemmli sample buffer with DTT. Samples were boiled at 95°C for 5 min, except in the case of immunoblotting for multi-pass transmembrane proteins, for which samples were not heated. Samples were run on 4-20% Criterion TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad, Cat# 5671094 &amp; 5671095) to separate proteins by molecular weight. Proteins were transferred from gels to 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Cat# 1620112) using the Trans-blot turbo system (Bio-Rad) for 7 min at 25V. For detection of proteins, membranes were first blocked in 5% non-fat milk (Carnation) in TBST for one hour at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat milk (Carnation) in TBST overnight at 4°C Membranes were washed with TBST three times for 10 min per wash prior to incubation with LI-COR secondary antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat milk (Carnation) in TBST at a concentration of 1:10,000. Membranes were subsequently imaged with the Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR) with quantification carried out in Image Studio Lite 5.2. Protein quantifications were normalized to beta-actin and to protein levels of controls, as described in applicable figure legends.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then pericardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 min followed by ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 7 min at a rate of 1 µl/min. PBS and PFA were filtered through a 0.2 µm filter prior to perfusion. Brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. PFA was removed, followed by thee washes with PBS. Brains were then placed in 30% sucrose (dissolved in PBS) for 24-48 hours and subsequently frozen in cryomolds (Tissue-Tek) in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek). Brains were then sectioned coronally at 35 µm on a CM3050-S cryostat (Leica). To stain, free floating sections were first blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100) and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The next day, sections were washed three times for 15 min per wash in PBS at room temperature. Free floating sections were then incubated in secondary antibodies diluted at 1:1000 in blocking buffer for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were washed three times for 15 min per wash in PBS at room temperature and then mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisherbrand) in 10% PBS. Once the sections were dry, slides were dipped in water and allowed to dry again. Coverslips (#1.5, VWR) were affixed with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images of the hippocampus and primary visual cortex were taken with a Nikon confocal microscope using either the 20X air objective or 60X oil objective. Imaging conditions were consistent between control and Astro-NL123 cKO animals. Confocal images were analyzed, while blinded, using NIS-Elements Analysis Software (Nikon).</p>

<title>Slice Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Acute coronal brain slices (300 μm) containing the dorsal hippocampus were prepared from P45-50 Nlgn123 astrocyte conditional knockout mice and littermate controls, both of which had been injected with tamoxifen at P1. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The brain was rapidly removed and placed into oxygenated, ice cold cutting solution containing the following (in mM): 228 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 11 glucose,7 MgSO4-7H2O, and 0.5 CaCl2. Slices were recovered at 32°C for 30 minutes in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing the following (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 2.5 CaCl2 and 1.3 MgCl2 in ddH2O adjusted to a final osmolarity of 300 mOsm. Slices were then recovered at RT in oxygenated ACSF for at least another 30 minutes. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed on CA1 pyramidal neurons with the cells clamped at −70 mV and perfused continuously with room temperature, oxygenated ACSF at 1-2 ml / minute. Electrical signals were recorded at 5 kHz with a two channel MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments), digitalized with a Digidata 1440 digitizer (Molecular devices) that was in turn controlled by Clampex 10.7 (Molecular Devices). Recording pipettes were pulled from thin-walled borosilicate glass pipettes to resistances of 3-5 MΩ. mEPSCs were recorded with an internal solution containing (in mM): 135 cesium methanesulfonate, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.2 Na2-GTP, 0.1 spermine, 7 phosphocreatine, and 0.3 EGTA with a pH of 7.3 and adjusted to a final osmolarity of 300 mOsm. mIPSCs were recorded with an internal solution containing (in mM): 140 mM CsCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, 0.3 mM Na3-GTP, and 4 mM Na2-ATP at pH 7.35 and adjusted to a final osmolarity of 300 mOsm. For mIPSC recordings, the calcium levels were reduced to 1 mM owing to the extremely high frequency observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons. mEPSCs were recorded in the presence of 0.5 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX; Cayman Chemical, Cat. 14964) and 50 μM picrotoxin (Tocris, Cat. 1128). mIPSCs were recording in the presence of 10 μM CNQX (Tocris, Cat. 1045), 50 μM D-AP5 (Tocris, Cat. 0106), and 0.5 μM TTX. Miniature events were analyzed blindly using Clampfit 10.7 via a template search and selected manually based on trained templates. Rise time and decay kinetics were calculated automatically as 10%-90% and 90%-10% peak amplitude of currents. Cumulative plots were generated based on the first 50 events from each recordings session that was either 5 minutes long or had at least 300 events.</p>

<p>To assess astrocyte morphology, the following plasmids were used: pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mVenus and the helper plasmids pHelper and pAA5. The pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mVenus construct was generated using PCR stitching to include the GfaABC1D promoter and a membrane targeting domain as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chai et al., 2017</xref>) and fused with mVenus in order to mark astrocyte membranes for analysis of astrocyte morphology.</p>

<title>AAV Preparation</title>
<p>For production of AAV (serotype AA5), HEK293T cells were co-transfected using the calcium phosphate method with pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mVenus and the helper plasmids (pHelper and pAA5) at 4 µg per plasmid per 30 cm<sup>2</sup> culture area. Approximately 12 hours after transfection, media was changed. At, ∼72 hours after the transfection, the HEK293T cells were collected using PBS with 10 mM EDTA and then spun down at 1500 x g. The cell pellets were resuspended in freezing buffer and subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles, alternating between 37C and a dry ice bath. Lysates were then incubated with 50 units / ml of benzonase nuclease at 37C for 30 minutes followed by a spin at 3000 x g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was loaded into discontinuous iodixanol gradient and centrifuged at 65,000 rpm for 3 hours. The 40% iodixanol fraction was collected and concentrated using 100,000 MWCO centricon columns. Filtrate was washed with several charges of MEM and then aliquoted and stored at −80C until use. Although viral titer was not determined, purified AAV was injected in vivo at various dilutions in order to identify a dilution that allowed sparse targeting of astrocytes for morphological reconstruction; thus, final viral titer was relatively low.</p>

<title>Stereotactic Injections</title>
<p>Prior to surgery, P21 mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (Avertin) at a dosage of 125-300 mg/kg and Buprenorphine Sustained Release was administered at 0.5 mg/kg to provide analgesia. Mouse heads were shaved and then cleaned with Betadine prior to incision of the scalp. Using a stereotactic rig (Kopf) for targeting, AAV expressing membrane-targeted mVenus under the control of the GFAP promoter was injected into CA1 (coordinates from bregma: A-P −1.8, M-L ±1.15, D-V −1.4) or V1 (coordinates from bregma: A-P −3.99, M-L ±2.6, D-V - 1.5). Virus was injected through a glass pipette attached to a syringe pump (SP101i, World Precision Instruments) at a speed of 0.15 µl/min at a volume that was empirically determined to sparsely infect astrocytes (0.5 µl). Following injection, the incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures (Unify). Mice were allowed to recover in a clean cage on a heating pad prior to transfer to a clean home cage. Sutures were removed 10 days post-surgery.</p>

Sections were counterstained with DAPI (D8417, Sigma) and mounted on gelatin-coated slides (FD Neurotechenologies, Cat# PO101) in 10% PBS. Once sections were dry, slides were dipped in water and again allowed to dry. Coverslips (#1.5, VWR) were affixed with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech).

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study examines whether synaptic cell adhesion molecules neuroligin 1-3 resident on astrocytes, rather than neurons, exert effect on synaptic structure and function. With <bold>convincing</bold> evidence, the authors report that deletion of neuroligins 1-3 specifically in astrocytes does not alter synapse formation or astrocyte morphology in the hippocampus or visual cortex. This study highlights the specific role of neuronal neuroligins rather than their astrocytic counterparts in synaptogenesis.</p>

<p>Astrocytes are known to express neuroligins 1-3. Within neurons, these cell adhesion molecules perform important roles in synapse formation and function. Within astrocytes, a significant role for neuroligin 2 in determining excitatory synapse formation and astrocyte morphology was shown in 2017. However, there has been no assessment of what happens to synapses or astrocyte morphology when all three major forms of neuroligins within astrocytes (isoforms 1-3) are deleted using a well characterized, astrocyte specific, and inducible cre line. By using such selective mouse genetic methods, the authors here show that astrocytic neuroligin 1-3 expression in astrocytes is not consequential for synapse function or for astrocyte morphology. They reach these conclusions with careful experiments employing quantitative western blot analyses, imaging and electrophysiology. They also characterize the specificity of the cre line they used. Overall, this is a very clear and strong paper that is supported by rigorous experiments. The discussion considers the findings carefully in relation to past work. This paper is of high importance, because it now raises the fundamental question of exactly what neuroligins 1-3 are actually doing in astrocytes. In addition, it enriches our understanding of the mechanisms by which astrocytes participate in synapse formation and function. The paper is very clear, well written and well illustrated with raw and average data.</p>

<p>In the present manuscript, Golf et al. investigate the consequences of astrocyte-specific deletion of Neuroligin family cell adhesion proteins on synapse structure and function in the brain. Decades of prior research had shown that Neuroligins mediate their effects at synapses through their role in the postsynaptic compartment of neurons and their transsynaptic interaction with presynaptic Neurexins. More recently, it was proposed for the first time that Neuroligins expressed by astrocytes can also bind to presynaptic Neurexins to regulate synaptogenesis (Stogsdill et al. 2017, Nature). However, several aspects of the model proposed by Stogsdill et al. on astrocytic Neuroligin function conflict with prior evidence on the role of Neuroligins at synapses, prompting Golf et al. to further investigate astrocytic Neuroligin function in the current study. Using postnatal conditional deletion of Neuroligins 1, 2 and 3 specifically from astrocytes, Golf et al. show that virtually no changes in the expression of synaptic proteins or in the properties of synaptic transmission at either excitatory or inhibitory synapses are observed. Moreover, no alterations in the morphology of astrocytes themselves were found. The authors conclude that while Neuroligins are indeed expressed in astrocytes and are hence likely to play some role there, this role does not include any direct consequences on synaptic structure and function, in direct contrast to the model proposed by Stogsdill et al.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a strong study that addresses an important and highly relevant question in the field of synaptic neuroscience. Neuroligins are not only key regulators of synaptic function, they have also been linked to numerous psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the need to precisely define their mechanisms of action. The authors take a wide range of approaches to convincingly demonstrate that under their experimental conditions, no alterations in the levels of synaptic proteins or in synaptic transmission at excitatory or inhibitory synapses, or in the morphology of astrocytes, are observed.</p>
<p>One caveat to this study is that the authors do not directly provide evidence that their Tamoxifen-inducible conditional deletion paradigm does indeed result in efficient deletion of all three Neuroligins from astrocytes. Using a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line, they show that tdTomato expression is efficiently induced by the current paradigm, and they refer to a prior study showing efficient deletion of Neuroligins from neurons using the same conditional Nlgn1-3 mouse lines but a different Cre driver strategy. However, neither of these approaches directly provide evidence that all three Neuroligins are indeed deleted from astrocytes in the current study. In contrast, Stogsdill et al. employed FACS and qPCR to directly quantify the loss of Nlgn2 mRNA from astrocytes. This leaves the current Golf et al. study somewhat vulnerable to the criticism, however unlikely, that their lack of synaptic effects may be a consequence of incomplete Neuroligin deletion, rather than a true lack of effect of astrocytic Neuroligins.</p>

<p>This study investigates the roles of astrocytes in the regulation of synapse development and astrocyte morphology using conditional KO mice carrying mutations of three neuroligins1-3 in astrocytes with the deletion starting at two different time points (P1 and P10/11). The authors use morphological, electrophysiological, and cell-biological approaches and find that there are no differences in synapse formation and astrocyte cytoarchitecture in the mutant hippocampus and visual cortex. These results differ from the previous results (Stogsdill et al., 2017), although the authors make several discussion points on how the differences could have been induced. This study provides important information on how astrocytes and neurons interact with each other to coordinate neural development and function. The experiments were well-designed, and the data are of high quality.</p>
