<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Extracellular matrices surrounding eggs in fish (chorion) and mammals (zona pellucida, ZP) regulate gamete recognition before fertilization, though their mechanisms differ. Mouse sperm bind and cross the ZP at any site, while fish sperm cross the chorion through a funnel-shaped opening, the micropyle. To explore these divergent processes, we established cross-species insemination assays, mixing zebrafish eggs with mouse sperm. While mouse sperm could not bind to the chorion, a subpopulation successfully located and crossed the fish micropyle. Confocal and electron microscopy revealed that sperm entered the micropyle and accumulated in the zebrafish inter-chorion space. However, transgenic mouse sperm with mCherry-labeled acrosomes failed to undergo acrosome exocytosis efficiently in the micropyle, with both acrosome-intact and reacted sperm found in the inter-chorion space. Sperm entry and crossing were dependent on the CatSper channel, as sperm from <italic>CatSper1<sup>Null</sup></italic> mice did not interact with or cross the micropyle. These findings suggest a conserved mechanism for sperm entry into the micropyle, providing a novel platform to investigate cross-species gamete interactions and uncover novel steps in fertilization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Studies of interspecific gamete interaction have been historically important for elucidating the mechanisms regulating fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">VACQUIER, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Vieira &amp; Miller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Yanagimachi et al., 1976</xref>), which is required for the successful development of fish and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhakta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Deneke &amp; Pauli, 2021</xref>). Despite decades of investigation, however, the understanding of the molecular basis of sperm-egg interaction remains incomplete.</p>
<p>In mice, upon mating, hundreds to thousands of sperm leave the uterus and cross the uterotubal junctions, which separate the uterus from the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ded et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Suarez, 2016</xref>). These sperm bind to the epithelial cells of the isthmus in the oviduct until eggs are released from the ovary during ovulation into the ampulla of the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hunter, 1993</xref>), where fertilization occurs. A portion of these sperm undergoes hyperactivation, which consists of a sudden change in the motility pattern of the sperm flagella, generating an asymmetrical beat that mediates the sperm release from the isthmus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Han et al., 2016</xref>). Hyperactive sperm enter the ampulla of the oviduct and traverse the cumulus mass, a hyaluronic-interspersed mass of cells, remnant of the granulosa cells from the follicle. Each cumulus mass in the ampulla may enclose a single Metaphase II (MII) egg, mature and competent for fertilization. Upon reaching the egg, sperm bind to the zona pellucida, an extracellular glycoprotein matrix composed of three glycoproteins defined as ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3. After binding, the fertilizing sperm cross the zona and fuse with the oolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhakta et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In fish, the sperm do not bind to the chorion surrounding the ovulated egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mold et al., 2001</xref>). Instead, sperm cross the chorion through a narrow, funnel-shaped canal defined as the micropyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). Early studies in the Pacific herring (<italic>Clupea sp.</italic>) show that, once released into seawater, sperm are virtually motionless until they come near the micropyle area of an egg, whereupon they become motile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yanagimachi, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yanagimachi et al., 2017</xref>). In bitterling, zebrafish, and other fish species, sperm contact with water is sufficient to activate their motility, yet, as they pass near the micropyle area, their motility increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Suzuki, 1958</xref>).</p>
<p>Because fish sperm bypass binding to the chorion using the micropyle, fish zona proteins have always been assumed to lack the ability to support sperm binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mold et al., 2001</xref>). Zebrafish chorion is composed of two proteins, ZP2 and ZP3, homologs to the mammalian zona proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mold et al., 2001</xref>). Like other external fertilizing species, zebrafish sperm cross the chorion through the micropyle before fusing with the egg. On the other hand, mammalian eggs do not present a micropyle in the zona pellucida. Hence, sperm can cross at any binding site of the zona matrix, as shown by the presence of vesiculated acrosomal shrouds in multiple sites of the zona surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">VandeVoort et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wakayama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yanagimachi &amp; Phillips, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The abovementioned observations raise the predictions that mouse sperm may not recognize zebrafish ZP2 or ZP3 and would not be able to bind to the zebrafish chorion. Additionally, mouse sperm may not recognize the micropyle, as no micropyle exists in mammalian zonae pellucidae. To test these predictions, we have established a mouse-fish gamete insemination assay that consists of mixing fish eggs with mouse sperm. We show that mouse sperm could not bind to individual zebrafish ZP2/ZP3 nor to the chorion. Yet, unexpectedly, a subpopulation of mouse sperm recognized and entered the micropyle and accumulated in the oocyte inter-chorion space (ICS; the space between the inner aspects of the chorion and the oocyte). To capitalize on such discoveries, we used mouse genetics to show that only hyperactive mouse sperm could enter and cross the micropyle. We also documented that the zebrafish micropyle could not effectively induce acrosome exocytosis. Our studies provide a novel platform for cross-species insemination experiments and have implications for the mechanisms by which sperm can locate and enter micropyle of the egg.</p>

<title>Zebrafish zona pellucida proteins are not sufficient to support mammalian sperm binding</title>
<p>Zebrafish chorion is composed of two proteins defined as ZP2 and ZP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mold et al., 2001</xref>). It is still unknown whether each of these two proteins individually or together can be recognized by sperm capable of binding and penetrating zona pellucidae, such as mammalian sperm. Hence, we investigated the abilities of ZP2 and ZP3 to support sperm binding by using mouse sperm. Zebrafish ZP2 isoforms present 31.09-33.09% identity to mouse ZP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The first 6-cysteine residues of zebrafish ZP2 are organized into a trefoil domain, and zebrafish ZP2 lacks the homologous domain to the mammalian N-terminal region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), which has been reported to be necessary and sufficient to support mouse and human sperm binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Avella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tokuhiro &amp; Dean, 2018</xref>). Recombinant baculovirus encoding zebrafish ZP2 and ZP3 were generated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Each recombinant protein presented at the N-terminus a gp67 signal peptide from <italic>Autographa californica</italic> nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) (38 aa) to ensure proper secretion, and at the C-terminus, a 6-His tag to enable purification. Zebrafish ZP2<sup>25-405</sup> and ZP3<sup>22-396</sup> start at the N-terminus of the secreted ectodomains and include an even number of cysteine residues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Confocal images and quantification with boxplots showed that mouse sperm bound sparsely to beads coated with either zebrafish ZP2 or ZP3 and to beads coated with both zebrafish ZP2 and ZP3, yet bound efficiently to beads coated with mouse ZP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avella et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we could conclude that beads coated with individual zebrafish ZP2 or ZP3, or with both ZP2 and ZP3, cannot support sperm binding <italic>in vitro</italic> as efficiently as mouse ZP2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Mouse sperm do not bind to the zebrafish chorion</title>
<p>To further validate these observations, we used native zebrafish chorion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mold et al., 2001</xref>). First, to test whether zebrafish chorion remains intact under mouse <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) conditions, zebrafish ovulated eggs (n = 100, 3 replicates) were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in HTF/HSA (mouse IVF conditions) and observed over time (0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes) for morphological signs of deterioration of the VE. Control eggs (n = 30, 3 replicates) were maintained in Hank’s solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Westerfield, 2007</xref>) at room temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Figure 1</xref>). Under mouse IVF conditions, zebrafish oocytes presented no signs of zona deterioration within the first 60 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, we used 60 minutes as the time limit for incubating zebrafish chorion or eggs with mouse sperm (previously incubated for 45 min at 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in HTF/HSA).</p>
<p>Zebrafish ovulated eggs were collected and preserved in Hank’s saline solution to prevent egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Westerfield, 2007</xref>). As HTF contains water, it may induce activation of zebrafish oocytes, which may result in post-fertilization biochemical modification of the ZP proteins of the chorion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Masuda et al., 1991</xref>). Thus, we mechanically isolated the chorion from zebrafish eggs in Hank’s, moved them to HTF/HSA, and inseminated them with 10<sup>5</sup> progressive motile mouse sperm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The isolated chorion was found to not support mouse sperm binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, top-left). To quantify these observations that involve gametes of considerably different sizes (∼80 µm for mouse egg/2-cell embryo vs. ∼700 µm for zebrafish egg), we acquired z maximum intensity projections of inseminated eggs/embryos by confocal microscopy (LSM800, Zeiss), and calculated the number of sperm bound per 20-µm<sup>2</sup> area using the ZEN 3.2 software (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Our quantitative analyses using boxplots showed that mouse sperm bind to the fish chorion (0.025 ± 0.11, s.e.m.) with significantly lower efficiency to mouse zonae (0.76 ± 0.05, s.e.m.) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, top-right), and with comparable efficiency to the zonae surrounding mouse 2-cell embryos (0.041 ± 0.01, s.e.m.) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, bottom-right).</p>
<p>In addition, whole ovulated zebrafish oocytes surrounded by a chorion were placed in HTF/HSA and inseminated with 10<sup>5</sup> progressive motile mouse sperm (37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in HTF/HSA) for 60 minutes. Inseminated zebrafish oocytes showed very few sperm bound to the chorion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, bottom-left). Quantification of these observations found that mouse sperm bind to the chorion surrounding zebrafish eggs with comparable efficiency (0.06 ± 0.02 s.e.m.) as to the chorion only (no oocyte within) isolated from zebrafish eggs in Hank’s solution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). From these observations, we conclude that mouse sperm cannot bind to the zebrafish VE.</p>

<title>Mouse sperm recognize the micropylar region of fish oocytes</title>
<p>Although the chorion does not support mouse sperm binding, the micropyle region of ovulated oocytes is known to attract fish sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yanagimachi, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yanagimachi et al., 2013</xref>). This is due to the presence of still unidentified glycosylated protein(s) present in the micropylar region of fish eggs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Previous literature reported contradictory findings on the absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yanagimachi et al., 2017</xref>) or presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dingare et al., 2018</xref>) of glycoprotein(s) in the zebrafish micropyle that, here, we define as the micropyle glycoprotein (MP). To test for the presence of the MP in zebrafish, we stained freshly ovulated oocytes with fluorescently conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-633). We confirmed the presence of a positive signal in the micropylar region of zebrafish oocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dingare et al., 2018</xref>).

<p>IVF conditions, we inseminated zebrafish ovulated eggs with zebrafish sperm and imaged sperm around the micropylar area and within the inner opening of the micropyle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The presence of sperm after insemination was found to depend on the presence of the MP. Indeed, when the MP was biochemically removed with trypsin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), the number of zebrafish sperm surrounding the micropylar region or entering the micropyle significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), which also led to a reduction in the fertilization rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>While performing our cross-species insemination assay, upon <italic>in vitro</italic> insemination of zebrafish ovulated oocytes with mouse sperm (37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, HTF/HSA), we could observe the accumulation of mouse sperm to the chorion area surrounding the micropyle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, left panel). This binding persisted after extensive washes with a glass pipette, which was able to detach loosely bound mouse sperm to mouse 2-cell embryos (negative control; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<p>To capture live mouse sperm entering the micropyle, we inseminated 20 zebrafish ovulated eggs in 300 µl HTF (Merck Millipore, USA) with 3,000 progressive motile sperm and performed 4 different independent experiments using mouse sperm from three different fertile males. Mouse sperm reached the zebrafish oocytes 48.5 ±10.6 seconds post insemination and entered the micropyle canal within 24.5 ± 7.1 seconds after approaching the zebrafish oocyte, attempting to cross the micropylar opening (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and suppl videos 1-2).</p>
<p>Then, to assess the ability of the zebrafish micropyle to support mouse sperm binding independently from the oocyte, we mechanically isolated the chorion in Hank’s solution to prevent oocyte activation. The micropylar region of the isolated chorion supported mouse sperm binding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). The binding pattern of the mouse sperm was comparable with zebrafish sperm binding around the micropyle region (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Upon quantification of these observations with boxplots, we found that mouse sperm bound the micropylar region (1.11 ± 0.1, s.e.m.) with comparable efficiency to mouse zonae pellucidae (1.07 ± 0.07, s.e.m.) surrounding ovulated eggs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Trypsin digestion of the chorion virtually eliminated the MP as shown by the absence of WGA-633 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Figure 2A</xref>). When inseminated with mouse sperm, trypsin-treated micropyle regions did not support sperm binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Figure 2B</xref>). From these observations, we concluded that mouse sperm can recognize the fish micropyle <italic>in vitro</italic>, and such recognition is dependent on the presence of the MP.</p>
<p>It is conceivable that, if the MP exerts a chemotactic effect on zebrafish and mouse sperm, it would be expected that this factor produces a concentration gradient. To measure if a fluorescence gradient may exist from the periphery towards the micropyle inner opening, via ImageJ/Fiji, we measured the raw integrated density (RID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brazill et al., 2018</xref>) of the zebrafish WGA-633-stained chorion encompassing the micropyle (n = 10) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We found that fluorescence density increases from the periphery towards the central 40 µm area encompassing the micropyle region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, left-Y axis). Of note, we observed an increasing number of mouse sperm bound to the chorion from the periphery towards the micropyle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, right-Y axis). The direct correlation between the increasing fluorescence density and the number of sperm bound from the periphery towards the micropyle is consistent with the potential role of the MP as a chemoattractant to guide sperm towards the micropyle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yanagimachi, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yanagimachi et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Mouse sperm cross the fish micropyle opening</title>
<p>In mammalian fertilization, after binding, sperm cross the zona to enter the perivitelline space (PVS). Consequently, we aimed to study whether, after binding, mouse sperm could cross the chorion in the micropyle region. Using confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 800), we found that multiple mouse sperm entered the micropyle canal and crossed the micropyle opening, accumulating in the ICS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; n = 12-14 eggs, 3 replicates). After crossing, sperm concentrated either around the micropyle region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> left and mid panels) or away from the micropyle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, right panel). Quantifications of these observations revealed a comparable, yet significantly higher, number of ICS mouse sperm around the micropyle than away from the micropyle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>We, then, wondered at what site of the micropyle region mouse sperm crossed the VE. Previous studies have shown that, after zona binding, mammalian sperm can cross the matrix at any binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">VandeVoort et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wakayama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yanagimachi &amp; Phillips, 1984</xref>), whereas fish sperm cross the chorion only at the micropyle inner opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Yi et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether mouse sperm cross the chorion at any site of the micropyle region or, like fish sperm, use the inner opening of the micropyle. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we observed mouse sperm within the micropyle canal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, left). However, no mouse sperm were found mid-way through the chorion in the micropyle region, indicating that mouse sperm, likely, used the micropyle inner opening to cross the fish VE. To validate this thesis, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study mouse sperm in the micropyle canal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, mid and right). TEM analyses confirmed that mouse sperm did not cross the chorion at the binding site. From this, we concluded that the interaction between mouse sperm and the zebrafish micropyle may differ from the mechanism of sperm binding with the zona pellucida. To that end, we used sperm from transgenic mice to further characterize the nature of this interaction.</p>

<title>Ineffective induction of mouse sperm acrosome exocytosis during interaction with the fish micropyle</title>
<p>The acrosome is present in the sperm of only a few chondrostean species, such as the sturgeon fish. In these species, sperm undergo acrosome exocytosis in the micropyle canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Psenicka et al., 2010</xref>). Sperm from teleost fish species like zebrafish, however, lack an acrosome. Thus, one may hypothesize that the zebrafish micropyle lacks the ability to induce acrosome exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hirohashi &amp; Yanagimachi, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether the zebrafish micropyle can induce mouse sperm acrosome exocytosis, we used TEM and confocal microscopy to track the status of the acrosomes of mouse spermatozoa during cross-species insemination. We used transgenic mouse sperm that accumulate mCherry in the acrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avella et al., 2016</xref>) (<italic>Acrosin<sup>Tg</sup></italic>). Acrosome-intact sperm present a visible fluorescent acrosome beneath the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avella et al., 2016</xref>). During acrosome exocytosis, mCherry is released upon fusion of the sperm plasma membrane with the outer acrosomal membrane (7). This results in the loss of fluorescent signal and marks these sperm as ‘acrosome-reacted’, as documented by fluorescent and electron microscopy analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avella et al., 2016</xref>). Through confocal microscopy, we found 86 ± 4 % (n = 10, s.e.m) of sperm surrounding the micropyle to be acrosome intact (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Sperm could cross the micropyle inner opening irrespective of their acrosomal status (reacted or intact; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, mid and right, respectively). Additionally, both acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted sperm were found in the ICS via confocal and TEM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, we concluded that mouse sperm can recognize the micropylar region of zebrafish oocytes and cross the micropyle inner opening regardless of the acrosome status, though passage through the micropyle does not appear to induce acrosome exocytosis.</p>

<title>Mouse CatSper is necessary to mediate sperm crossing the zebrafish micropyle</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By establishing a mouse-fish gamete interaction assay, we report that, although the chorion cannot support mouse sperm binding, a subpopulation of mouse sperm can find and enter the fish micropyle. Mouse sperm cross the micropyle and accumulate in the fish PVS. Using sperm from different transgenic mouse lines, we found that the recognition of the micropyle by mouse sperm is dependent on the CatSper channel and that the zebrafish micropyle failed to effectively induce acrosome exocytosis.</p>
<p>By Clustal Ω sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Sievers et al., 2011</xref>), it appears that zebrafish zona proteins lack an N-terminal domain with conserved sequence identity to the mammalian ZP2 N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Avella et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the observed absence of mouse sperm binding to zebrafish ZP2 or the chorion is consistent with a model that envisions the N-terminal region of mammalian ZP2 to be required for mouse sperm binding to an extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Avella et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhakta et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The ability of sperm to effectively localize eggs is vital for external fertilizing species that emit their gametes in the water column. In sea urchins, small peptides such as Resact have been identified as the molecule mediating the sperm attracting stimulus to the unfertilized egg. In zebrafish, and other teleost fish species, sperm contact with water is sufficient to activate their motility, yet as they pass near the micropyle area, their motility increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Suzuki, 1958</xref>). Such a gain in motility appears to be elicited by exposure to the MP that guides the fertilizing sperm into the micropyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yanagimachi et al., 1992</xref>). We and others have shown that removal of the MP by trypsin digestion significantly decreases egg fertilization rate, indicating the important role of MP in fish fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yanagimachi et al., 2013</xref>). Sea urchin Resact induces a cGMP signaling pathway that mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup> bursts via the CatSper channel, and the increased cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>concentrations confer sperm chemotactic steering towards the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Seifert et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, it has been hypothesized that the fish CatSper channel may also play a role in activating fish sperm motility during fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yanagimachi et al., 2017</xref>). Upon binding with motile sperm, the MP may activate sperm proton pumps, leading to an increase in intracellular pH; this, in turn, would activate CatSper channels, resulting in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and higher levels of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Higher concentrations of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> would make the sperm tail beating pattern change from symmetrical to asymmetrical, directing sperm entry into the micropyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yanagimachi et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these hypotheses, our data demonstrates that CatSper is necessary to mediate mouse sperm entering and crossing the zebrafish micropyle. Like fish sperm, it is conceivable that the MP may elicit an attractant stimulus towards a subpopulation of mouse sperm. However, recent findings have shown successful cross-species fertilization of evolutionary-distant fish species, such as with female common carp and male blunt snout bream (S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) or Russian Sturgeon with American Paddlefish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Káldy et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that such a stimulus may not act with species-specificity. This is consistent with findings that show how sperm from other fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yanagimachi et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2017</xref>) may reach and cross the micropyle of different fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yanagimachi et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The potential existence of a mammalian sperm chemoattraction mechanism has been the focus of considerable research efforts. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> assays to quantify chemoattraction in mammalian sperm (e.g., Zigmond chamber), several studies have shown evidence of a putative attraction mechanism coming from the egg microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Eisenbach &amp; Giojalas, 2006</xref>), with subpopulations of sperm that responded to chemical gradients obtained from egg extracts or oviductal fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fabro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Giojalas &amp; Rovasio, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Oliveira et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). However, no follow-up studies with genetic loss-of-function assays could characterize such a mechanism further. Hence, it is still uncertain whether mammalian sperm may respond to attracting stimuli from an egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yanagimachi, 2022</xref>). Our data suggests the presence of a conserved mechanism that attracts mouse sperm towards eggs. Although such stimulus comes from a fish egg, it is plausible to reason that a mammalian protein homologous to the fish MP may play a similar role towards a subpopulation of mouse sperm that swim near an ovulated egg in the ampulla. Unfortunately, studies using mass spectrometry, together with cloning, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization, were unable to identify the nature of the fish MP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Oda et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vines et al., 2002</xref>, p. 202). Therefore, this factor is still unidentified.</p>
<p>To successfully fertilize an egg, mammalian sperm must undergo acrosome exocytosis, as only acrosome-reacted sperm can fuse with the oolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bhakta et al., 2019</xref>). Typically, fish sperm do not present an acrosome. However, in fish species whose sperm do possess an acrosome, such as sturgeon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Psenicka et al., 2010</xref>), exocytosis occurs as sperm migrate into the micropyle prior to fusion with the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alavi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Psenicka et al., 2010</xref>). Zebrafish are teleost and do not develop spermatozoa with acrosomes. In our studies, mouse sperm found in the micropyle or the PVS of zebrafish eggs were often observed to be acrosome-intact. Failed acrosome exocytosis has been observed in previous cross-species insemination studies in rodents, where sperm could penetrate zonae of different species while remaining acrosome-intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">VandeVoort et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wakayama et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Yanagimachi &amp; Phillips, 1984</xref>), indicating putative species-specific oocyte mechanisms of induction of acrosome exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avella &amp; Dean, 2011</xref>). As zebrafish sperm do not present an acrosome, it is conceivable that, unlike sturgeon, zebrafish oocytes may lack the ability to induce acrosome exocytosis in the micropyle.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the existence of a MP mediating fish and mouse sperm raises the prediction for the potential existence of a mouse ortholog for the fish MP and of a cognate sperm receptor. Future studies will focus on identifying the fish MP, looking for mammalian orthologs, and characterizing its expression during fish and mouse oogenesis. In addition, mutant-null fish or mouse models will aid in characterizing the role(s) of these proteins in regulating fish and mouse fertilization.</p>

<title>Mouse gamete collection and <italic>in vitro</italic> insemination</title>
<p>Female mice were stimulated with 5 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) (ProspecBio) and 48 hrs later with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (Sigma-Aldrich). Twelve hours after hCG injection, eggs in cumulus were collected and incubated (37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in HTF/HSA under mineral oil before insemination with mouse sperm. Alternatively, eggs were denuded from the cumulus mass with hyaluronidase (Millipore) and washed in HTF/HSA before insemination with mouse sperm. Fertilization was scored 24 hours post-insemination by quantifying the number of two-cell embryos. To assess <italic>in vivo</italic> female fertility, mutant female mice (n ≥3) were co-caged with one control fertile female and one fertile male mouse, and litters were recorded until females gave birth to at least three litters.</p>
<p>Epididymal sperm from 10-14 weeks old male mice were incubated under capacitating conditions in human tubal fluid (HTF) supplemented with 0.4% Human Serum Albumin (HSA; Cooper Surgical) for 45 min (37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Avella et al., 2014</xref>). Sperm were added to oocytes or embryos in 50 µl of HTF/HSA drops under mineral oil at a final concentration of 10<sup>5</sup>/ml progressive motile sperm quantified by hemocytometer. Upon coincubation, inseminated oocytes/embryos were washed by gently pipetting with a 200 µl microcapillary pipette (Cooper Surgical) to remove loosely bound sperm. Samples were, then, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoechst and WGA-633 (ThermoFisher) to identify the nuclei and the glycoproteins of the zona pellucidae. To assess mouse sperm binding, mouse eggs and two-cell embryos were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.</p>

<title>Zebrafish gamete collection and <italic>in vitro</italic> insemination</title>
<p>Zebrafish females or males (separated from tank mates the night prior) were anesthetized with tricaine (3-amino benzoic acidethylester) solution (Sigma). After being gently dried with a kimwipe, each female was moved to a dry petri dish, and mild pressure on the fish belly was applied, stroking from anterior to posterior. Released oocytes were separated from the female using flat forceps and inseminated with zebrafish sperm. Alternatively, zebrafish oocytes were preserved in Hank’s saline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Westerfield, 2007</xref>) and, then, were gently acclimated to HTF/HSA (Cooper Surgical) and inseminated with mouse sperm previously incubated under capacitating conditions (HTF/HSA, 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Avella et al., 2014</xref>). Before insemination with mouse sperm, zebrafish oocytes were, in some instances, treated with 0.001% trypsin (crystalline, VWR) in Ringer’s solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Westerfield, 2007</xref>) for 1 – 5 min, and rinsed twice in Hank’s solution before cross-species insemination (HTF/HSA, 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Zebrafish oocytes and mouse sperm were incubated for 60 min (HTF/HSA, 37 °C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), washed in HTF/HSA to remove loosely bound sperm, and then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Zebrafish males were dried with a kimwipe, and both sides of the body were firmly stroked to collect sperm out of their genital pore with a microcapillary pipette (Cooper Surgical). Sperm were preserved in ice-cold, full-strength Hank’s saline until oocyte insemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Westerfield, 2007</xref>). Upon oocyte insemination, samples were immediately fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoechst and Wheat Germ Agglutinin, Alexa Fluor™ 633 Conjugate (WGA-633, ThermoFisher) to identify the nuclei and the micropyle, respectively. Fluorescence intensity of the micropyle was measured as Raw integrated density using Fiji/ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brazill et al., 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Live imaging of mouse sperm attraction to the micropyle of zebrafish mature eggs</title>
<p>Ovulated zebrafish oocytes were collected, acclimated as described above, and immediately transferred to the imaging dish containing 300 µl of HTF/BSA under mineral oil. The micropyle area was identified and brought into focus. Mouse sperm, collected and capacitated as previously described, were prepared for imaging. Images were captured using an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti) equipped with a 12MP camera. After focusing on the micropyle, 3,000 progressively motile sperm were introduced into the imaging dish, and time-lapse live imaging was performed to record gamete interactions.</p>

<title>Gamete or embryo quantifications and statistics</title>
<p>Mouse sperm bound to oocytes or beads were quantified from z maximum intensity projections obtained by confocal microscopy (LSM800, Zeiss). The number of sperm bound per mouse oocyte/embryo or per 20-µm<sup>2</sup> area (mouse and zebrafish oocytes/embryos) was obtained using the ZEN 3.2 software (Blue Edition, Zeiss). Descriptive statistics were used for comparisons of mouse sperm bound to oocytes, embryos, or agarose beads and for mouse sperm that have crossed the zonae with One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference) post-hoc test analyses. The number of sperm was represented as bars or boxplots reflecting the median (horizontal line) and data points within the 10<sup>th</sup> and 90<sup>th</sup> percentiles (error bars) for at least three independent experiments. Boxes included the middle two quartiles, and outliers, when present, were indicated by dots. All statistical analyses were performed using R Studio (v. 3.6.3).</p>

<title>The entry of mouse sperm into the micropyle of an ovulated zebrafish egg.</title>
<p>This time-lapse video captures the moment the first sperm enters the micropyle of a freshly ovulated zebrafish egg. At the 1-second mark, two sperm are visible in the field of view. One sperm displays an abnormal structure, with a partially coiled tail, while the other sperm is attracted to the micropyle. Within 6 seconds, the structurally normal sperm successfully navigates to and enters the micropyle canal.</p>

<title>Sperm Behavior in Response to Zebrafish Eggs: Observations Across Four Videos</title>
<p>This study investigates the behavior of mouse sperm interacting with zebrafish eggs using live imaging techniques, with a specific focus on the region surrounding the micropyle. To capture sperm-egg interactions, four separate video recordings were taken. The recordings spanned a total period of 63 minutes and 17 seconds, with each video lasting an average of 16 ± 2 minutes.</p>
<p>In total, 546 sperm were observed across the four videos. The results showed that only a subpopulation of sperm was able to enter the micropyle canal (8.25 ± 3.63, 5.92 % ± 2.38 %), while the majority were found not entering the micropyle and either swimming close to the micropyle without entering (110.5 ± 44.04, 79.20% ± 5.42 %) or passing by and completely ignoring the zebrafish oocyte (17.75 ± 4.22, 15.00% ± 6.28%)(quantification performed as displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper is well written and investigates the cross-species insemination of fish eggs with mouse sperm. I have a few major and minor comments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are well executed and could provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms of fertilization in both species. I found the information presented to be very interesting,</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The rationale of some of the experiments is not well defined.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 5</p>
<p>
I do not understand the rationale for performing experiments using CatSper-null sperm and CD9-null oocytes. It is well established that CatSper-null sperm are unable to penetrate the zona pellucida (ZP), so the relevance of this approach is unclear.</p>
<p>(2) Micropyle penetration and sperm motility</p>
<p>
CatSper-null sperm are reportedly unable to cross the micropyle, but this could be due to their reduced motility rather than a lack of hyperactivation per se. Were these experiments conducted using capacitated or non-capacitated spermatozoa? What was the observed motility of CatSper-null sperm during these assays? Clarifying these conditions is essential to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions from the results.</p>
<p>(3) Rheotaxis and micropyle navigation</p>
<p>
Previous studies have shown that CatSper-null sperm fail to undergo rheotaxis. Could this defect be related to their inability to locate and penetrate the micropyle? Exploring a potential shared mechanism could be informative.</p>
<p>(4) Lines 61-74</p>
<p>
This paragraph omits important information regarding acrosomal exocytosis, which occurs prior to sperm-egg fusion. Including this detail would strengthen the discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Garibova et al. investigated the conservation of sperm recognition and interaction with the egg envelope in two groups of distantly related animals: mammals (mouse) and fish (zebrafish). Previous work and key physiological differences between these two animal groups strongly suggest that mouse sperm would be incapable of interaction with the zebrafish egg envelope (chorion) and its constituent proteins, though homologous to the mammalian zona pellucida (ZP). Indeed, the authors showed that mouse sperm do not bind recombinant zebrafish ZP proteins nor the intact chorion. Surprisingly, however, mouse sperm are able to locate and bind to the zebrafish micropyle, a specialized canal within the chorion that serves as the egg's entry point for sperm. This study suggests that sperm attraction to the egg might be highly conserved from fish to mammals and depends on the presence of a still unknown glycosylated protein within the micropyle. The authors further demonstrate that mouse sperm are able to enter the micropyle and accumulate within the intrachorionic space, potentially through a CatSper-dependent mechanism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that mouse sperm do not bind zebrafish ZP proteins or the chorion. Furthermore, they make the interesting observation that mouse sperm are able to locate and enter the zebrafish micropyle in an MP-dependent manner, which is quite unexpected given the large evolutionary distance between these species, the many physiological differences between mouse and zebrafish gametes, and the largely different modes of both fertilization and reproduction in these species. This may indicate that the sperm chemoattractant in the egg is conserved between mammals and fish; however, whether zebrafish sperm are attracted to mouse eggs was not tested.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The key weakness of this study lies in the rationale behind the overall investigation. In mammals, the zona pellucida (ZP) has been implicated in binding sperm in a taxon-specific manner, such that human sperm are incapable of binding the mouse ZP. Indeed, work by the corresponding author showed that this specificity is mediated by the N-terminal region of the ZP protein ZP2 (Avella et al., 2014). The N-termini of human and mouse ZP2 share 48% identity, which is higher than the overall identity between mouse and zebrafish ZP2, with the latter ortholog entirely lacking the N-terminal domain that is essential for sperm binding to the ZP. Given this known specificity for mouse vs. human sperm-ZP binding, it does not follow that mouse sperm would bind ZP proteins from not only a species that is much more distantly related, but also one that is not even a mammal, the zebrafish. Furthermore, the fish chorion does not play a role in sperm binding at all, while the mammalian ZP can bind sperm at any location. On the contrary, the zebrafish chorion prevents polyspermy by limiting sperm entry to the single micropyle.</p>
<p>In addition, though able to provide some information regarding the broad conservation of sperm-egg interaction mechanisms, the biological relevance of these findings is difficult to describe. Fish and mammals are not only two very distinct and distantly related animal groups, but also employ opposite modes of fertilization and reproduction (external vs. internal, oviparous vs viviparous). Fish gametes interact in a very different environment compared to mammals and lack many typically mammalian features of fertilization (e.g., sperm capacitation, presence of an acrosome, interaction with the female reproductive tract), making it difficult to make any physiologically relevant claims from this study. While this study may indicate conserved mechanisms of sperm attraction to the egg, the identity of the molecular players involved is not investigated. With this knowledge, the reader is forced to question the motivation behind much of the study.</p>
<p>During fertilization in fish, the sperm enters the micropyle and subsequently, the egg, as it is simultaneously activated by exposure to water. During egg activation, the chorion lifts as it separates from the egg and fills with water. This mechanism prevents supernumerary sperm from entering the egg after the successfully fertilizing sperm has bound and fused. In this study, the authors show that mouse sperm enter the micropyle and accumulate in the intrachorionic space. Whether any sperm successfully entered the egg is not addressed, and the status of egg activation is not reported. In Supplementary Videos 3-4, the egg shown has been activated for some time, as evident by the separation of yolk and cytoplasm, yet the chorion is only partially expanded (likely due to mouse IVF conditions). How multiple sperm were able to enter the micropyle but presumably not the egg is not addressed, yet this suggests that the zebrafish mechanism of blocking polyspermy (fertilization by multiple sperm) is not effective for mouse sperm or is rendered ineffective due to mouse IVF conditions. The authors do not discuss these observations in the context of either species' physiological process of fertilization, highlighting the lack of biological context in interpreting the results.</p>
<p>The authors further show that the zebrafish micropyle does not trigger the acrosome reaction in mouse sperm. Whether the acrosome reacts is not correlated with a sperm's ability to cross the micropyle opening, as both acrosome-intact and acrosome-reacted sperm were observed within the intrachorionic space. While the acrosome reaction is a key event during mammalian fertilization and is required for sperm to fertilize the egg, zebrafish sperm do not contain an acrosome. Thus, these results are particularly difficult to interpret biologically, bringing into question whether this observation has biological relevance or is a byproduct of egg activation/chorion lifting that indirectly draws sperm into the chorion.</p>
<p>The final experiments regarding CatSper1's role in mediating mouse sperm entry into the micropyle/chorion are not convincing. As no molecular interactions are described or perturbed, the reader cannot be sure whether the sperm's failure to enter is due to signaling via CatSper1 or whether the overall failure to undergo hyperactivation limits sperm motility such that the mutant sperm can no longer find and enter the zebrafish micropyle. Indeed, in Figure 5E, no CatSper1 mutant sperm are visible near any part of the egg, suggesting that overall motility is impaired, and this is not a phenotype specific to interactions with the micropyle.</p>
