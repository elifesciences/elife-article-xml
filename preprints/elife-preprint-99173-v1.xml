<title>Abstract</title><p>Adjuvants can affect the function of APCs and boost the adaptive immune responses post vaccination. However, whether adjuvants modulate the specificity of immune responses, especially the specificity of immunodominant epitope responses, and the mechanisms of adjuvants regulating antigen processing and presentation remain poorly defined. Here, using overlapping synthetic peptides, we screened the dominant epitopes of Th1 responses in mice post vaccination with different adjuvants and found that adjuvants altered antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell immunodominant epitope hierarchy. MHC-II immunopeptidome demonstrates that peptide repertoires presented by APCs are altered by adjuvants significantly. Unexpectedly, no novel peptide presentation was detected post adjuvants treatment, on the contrary, peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II presented in the control group were missing post adjuvant stimulation, especially in the MPLA and CpG group. The low stability peptide presented in adjuvant groups elicited robust T cell responses effectively and formed immune memory. Taken together, our results suggest that adjuvants (MPLA and CpG) restrain high stability peptides presentation instead of revealing cryptic epitopes, which may alter the specificity of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell dominant epitope responses. This capacity of adjuvants to modify pMHC stability and antigen-specific T cell immunodominant epitope responses has fundamental implications for the selection of suitable adjuvants in the vaccine design process and the development of epitope vaccines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adjuvants are an important composition of vaccines, which enhance or prolong the immune responses to co-administered antigens post vaccination. Most commonly used adjuvants stimulate Ab responses relying on B cells.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) The priming of B cells and the forming of B cell memory are dependent on the cognate help of antigen-specific T cells. Besides, T cells have direct effector functions against pathogen infection. Thus, antigen-specific T cells play a vital role in shaping immune responses in the setting of vaccination. However, the mechanisms of adjuvants regulating the specificity of antigen-specific T cell responses remain poorly resolved.</p>
<p>Antigen-specific T cell responses mainly focus on several peptides derived from antigen amino acids called immunodominant epitopes.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) Although specific T cell responses were provoked by the same antigen, their response epitopes may be different, which leads to diverse effects. Peptides presented by APCs (antigen presenting cells) provide the first major signal for the priming of T cells and determine the specificity. Although it has been confirmed that adjuvants can activate APCs, and increase the expression of costimulatory molecules of APCs,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) it has not been demonstrated how adjuvants affect the peptide repertoires presented by APCs or modulate epitope-specific T cell responses.</p>
<p><italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori/</italic> Hp) infects more than half of the world’s population and causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT) and gastric cancer.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) Studies in human and mouse models showed that Th1 response provides more important protection against <italic>H. pylori</italic> than a humoral immune response. Unfortunately, no effective vaccines driving T cell responses have been developed so far.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>) <italic>H. pylori</italic> provides an ideal experimental model to determine the mechanisms of adjuvants regulating T cell responses.</p>
<p>Studies of the widely used adjuvant have found that some pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) ligand adjuvants can induce strong T cell response.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) PRR ligand adjuvants targeting PRRs on the surface of innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells, promote cytokines secretion and upregulate co-stimulatory molecule expressions.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) Typical PRR adjuvants include MPLA, CpG and MDP, which have been confirmed to induce effective T cell responses and have been successfully used in many vaccines such as HPV, HSV, and COVID-19 vaccines.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) However, their impact on antigen processing and presentation in APCs, and immunodominant epitope responses are not known.</p>
<p>In this study, using MPLA, CpG and MDP adjuvants and <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigens, we demonstrate that immunodominant epitopes recognized by antigen specific T cells are altered by adjuvants. Furthermore, we show that adjuvants, MPLA and CpG especially, modulate the peptide repertoires presented on the surface of APCs. Surprisingly, instead of revealing cryptic epitopes or presenting high-stability peptides, peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II are restained and low-stability peptides were presented by APCs post adjuvants treatment. And, the low stability peptide presented in adjuvant groups elicits T cell response effectively. Thus, altering pMHCII stability presented on APCs provides a fundamentally new mechanism for PRR adjuvants regulating adaptive immunity. The implications of this observation are discussed.</p>

<title>Immunodominant T cell epitopes hierarchy varies in vaccinated mice with different adjuvants</title>
<p>To determine the influences of adjuvants on the specificity of immune responses, BALB/c mice were vaccinated with antigen UreB, one effective antigen for the <italic>H. pylori</italic> vaccine, combined with adjuvants CpG, MDP and MPLA respectively. Then, antigen specific T cells from immunized mice were expanded and their IFN-γ responses to 93 individual UreB overlapping 18mer peptides were screened using flow cytometry. 18mer peptides U313-330 and U403-426 were primarily recognized in the CpG group. T cells from the MDP group have dominant responses to U409-426 and U481-498. T cells from the MPLA group primarily recognized U313-U330 and U505-522, whereas U481-U504 was the dominant region in the no adjuvant group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). These data indicated that immunodominant epitopes responded by antigen-specific T cells varied in different adjuvant vaccination groups.</p>

<title>Profiling MHC-II peptides in adjuvants-treated APCs</title>
<p>Considering that T cell repertoires are the same in naive mice, we speculate that dominant epitope variations in different adjuvant vaccination groups result from the alteration of peptide presentation of APCs. To interrogate the repertoire of MHC-II peptides presented by APCs, antigens from <italic>H. pylori</italic> ultrasonic supernatant were used to pulse H-2<sup>d</sup> A20 cells combined with adjuvants CpG, MDP and MPLA respectively. Then, MHC-II-peptide complexes were immunoprecipitated. The bound peptides were eluted and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The whole proteomes of protein-pulsed A20 cells were also analyzed by LC-MS/MS to examine the effect of adjuvants on extracellular antigen phagocytosis and gene expression associated with antigen processing and presentation.</p>

</fig>
<p>A total of 4074 peptides were identified, 3408 peptides in the PBS group, 3257 peptides in the MDP group, 3227 peptides in the MPLA group, and 3330 peptides in the CpG group, respectively. As expected, the number and length distribution of peptides were not influenced by adjuvants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). The majority of identified peptides were 16 mers. Next, the binding motifs of all peptides identified in different groups were analyzed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). No obvious differences following adjuvant treatment were identified. The binding motifs of peptides per individual MHC-II allele, H2-IA and H2-IE were also analyzed (Figure S1). No major differences were detected. The observed amino acids at the main anchor location are consistent with the expected binding motifs. Binding affinity data predicted using NetMHCIIpan showed that most MS-detected peptides were indeed predicted to bind with MHC-II alleles (%rank &lt;10) and assigned to the H2-IA allele generally (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; Figure S1). These results indicate that adjuvants were not able to affect MHC-II binding characteristics.</p>
<p>We also chose another H-2<sup>d</sup> cell J774A.1, a macrophage cell line, for immunopeptidome in this study. Unfortunately, MHC-II molecular expression on J774A.1 was much lower than that on A20 cells. Even 5 times J774A.1 cells more than A20 cells were used, no enough peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS (Figure S2). Thus, A20 cells were used in our following experiments.</p>

<title>Adjuvants affected the presentation of exogenous peptides exclusively</title>
<p>Next, we examined the exogenous peptides across the <italic>H. pylori</italic> genome from MHC-II immunopeptidome. Surprisingly, <italic>H. pylori</italic> contains more than 3,000 proteins, but only no more than 30 proteins were detected from MHC-II immunopeptidome (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To test if the MHC-IP (MHC-immunoprecipitation) identified proteins have higher levels of expression in bacteria, we ranked the individual <italic>H. pylori</italic> proteins according to their abundance. The abundance of MHC-IP identified proteins in whole <italic>H. pylori</italic> proteome MS data was analyzed, and we found that the abundance of these proteins is similar to the other bacterial proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Then, we wondered whether MHC-IP proteins harbor more peptides compatible with the MHC-II, so we compared the ratio between the number of peptides that are predicted to bind MHC-II alleles and the total number of 13- to 17-mers. Obviously, MHC-IP proteins have more presentable peptides than most other bacterial proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Through analyzing the host and exogenous MHC-II peptides presented in different adjuvant groups, we found that 82.4% of host MHC-II peptides were presented in all the groups, however, only 34.4% of exogenous MHC-II peptides were conserved post adjuvants treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>; Figure S3). These data indicated that adjuvants affected the presentation of exogenous peptides particularly. Many exogenous peptides were missing post adjuvants MPLA or CpG treatment. However, no changes of the number of peptides from the host were detected (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). The above data indicate that the repertoires of exogenous peptides presented by APCs are affected exclusively by adjuvants and a smaller number of peptides are presented.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Adjuvants may affect antigen processing but not phagocytosis</title>
<p>To test if the changes of exogenous peptide presentation among adjuvant groups could be explained by differences in antigen phagocytosis, we examined the whole proteome data. We found a strong correlation of abundance of bacterial proteins between different adjuvants treated groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We further compared the abundance of bacterial proteins in the proteome and MHC-II immunopeptidome. We found that the abundance of bacterial proteins presented in the immunopeptidome changed significantly among adjuvant groups, and even no peptides of several bacterial antigens were detected in some groups. However, only several proteins altered abundances in the proteome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggested that changes of exogenous peptide presentation among adjuvant groups could not be explained by antigen phagocytosis.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further investigate how adjuvants affect the bacterial antigens to be processed and presented, we ranked the individual proteins and MHC-II peptides derived from bacteria according to their abundance in comparison with those from the host. The overall abundance of bacterial proteins in the APCs proteome was low (Figure S4A). And, individual bacterial proteins expressions were below most of the host proteins both in PBS and adjuvants groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast to the low abundance of bacterial proteins, the intensities of their MHC-II peptides are similar to peptides from the host in the PBS group according to the immunopeptidome data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that bacterial peptides are presented preferentially. However, in the MPLA and CpG groups, the intensities of bacterial MHC-II peptides in immunopeptidome were much lower than those from the host (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These results indicate that adjuvant MPLA and CpG restrain bacterial peptide presentation.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="594923v1_fig5.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Then, we analyzed the whole proteome data to determine whether the proteins involved in antigen presentation and processing were altered. We found that proteins involved in antigen processing, peptidase function, ubiquitination pathway and interferon (IFN) signaling were altered post adjuvants treatment, especially in MPLA and CpG groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>; Figure S4B and S4C). These data suggest that adjuvants MPLA and CpG may affect the antigen processing of APCs, resulting in fewer peptides presentation.</p>

<title>High-stability epitopes were deficient in adjuvants MPLA and CpG groups</title>
<p>To further characterize adjuvant effects on peptide presentation, the MHC binding affinity of the peptides presented in adjuvants groups and that of the peptides deficient post adjuvants stimulation were analyzed using the IEDB website. The IC50 values of presented peptides assigned to H2-IA and H2-IE alleles were much higher than deficient peptides, which indicated that the peptides presented in adjuvant groups have lower binding stability for MHC-II (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). At cutoffs of predicted percentile rank &lt;2 (Strong Binders) or &lt;10 (Weak Binders), similar results were detected (Figure S5). Furthermore, we found that the presented peptides in adjuvant goups were mainly derived from protein tuf, recA, etc., and the deficient peptides were mainly derived from protein ureA, hopZ, etc. (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). To validate the amino acid sequences of MS-detected peptides and the binding stability of peptides, 10 peptides derived from Top4 presented and deficient proteins shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> were synthesized (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). The tandem mass spectra of synthetic peptides and the experimental spectra were compared, and high correlations between fragment ions and retention times were observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Then, we performed the MHC-II competition binding assay to detect the binding stability of 10 synthetic peptides in the presence of one competing MHC-II ligand. We confirmed that peptides that were missing in adjuvant groups have better binding stability for MHC-II molecules in comparison with peptides presented in adjuvant groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). These data indicate that epitopes with high binding stability are deficient post adjuvants MPLA and CpG treatment.</p>

<title>Low-stability peptide presented in adjuvant groups induce robust T cell responses effectively</title>
<p>To evaluate if the low stability peptides presented in adjuvant groups could induce T cell responses or not, mice were immunized with a pool of 10 synthetic peptides. Cell responses to individual peptides were detected using IFN-γ Elispot assay on day 10 (effective phase) and day 28 (memory phase) post-immunization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). We found positive responses to low stability peptides recA #23 (AFIDAEHALDVHYAKR) and NCTC11637-00693 #38 (IHSQVEANTQAQEGLR), as well as to high stability peptides ureA #2 (ASMIHEVGIEAMFPDGTK), ureA #3(YVEAVALISAHIMEEAR) and hopZ #53(KMLELANQIKTNLSAIPQ) on day 10 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). On day 28, the response to the low stability peptide recA #23 (AFIDAEHALDVHYAKR) was not weaker than the other peptides (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). It was reported that peptides with low stability for MHC-II skew T-cell repertoires towards high-affinity clonotypes which had better responses against pathogen infection.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) To assess the functional avidities of T cell responses induced by the low stability peptide presented in adjuvant groups, peptide-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were expanded <italic>in vitro</italic>. And, the magnitude of IFN-γ responses was detected by ICS using flow cytometry on stimulation with a set of titrated peptides. We found that low stability peptide recA #23 induced more robust CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses at lower peptide concentrations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that adjuvants alter the specificity of dominant Th1 epitope responses post-vaccination. Using LC-MS/MS based MHC-II immunopeptidome, peptides of <italic>H. pylori</italic> antigens presented by APCs under the stimulation of different adjuvants were analyzed. The motifs of presented peptides binding to MHC-II are consistent generally following the stimulation of adjuvants. However, the exogenous peptide repertoires presented by APCs change obviously. Low stability peptides and high stability peptides were presented by APCs in the control group, however, fewer peptides were detected in adjuvant groups, and peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II presented in control group were missing post adjuvant stimulation, especially in the CpG group. The low stability peptide presented in adjuvant groups have good immunoreactivity inducing effector and memory immune responses effectively. Thus, our data suggest that adjuvants can restain pMHCII stability presented on APCs to regulate dominant epitope-specific T cell responses.</p>
<p>The protective effects of vaccines depend on the immune responses induced post vaccination. For prophylactic vaccines, adaptive immune responses are important which are restricted to a limited number of epitopes. However, not all epitope-specific responses are protective. Some epitope-induced immune responses exacerbate inflammation and autoimmune diseases.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) Some epitopes induce the expansion of Tregs and relieve inflammation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) Thus, the alteration of dominant epitope responses will directly affect vaccine effectiveness. Maeda <italic>et al.</italic> characterized the modulation of adjuvants LT and LTB on antibody responses to a coadministered antigen, EDIII. They showed that LT and LTB adjuvanted specific antibodies displayed distinct linear epitope-binding patterns and fewer peptides were recognized compared with the non-adjuvanted or alum-adjuvanted group.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) However, Borriello <italic>et al.</italic> showed that mannans formulated with alum as an adjuvant broaden epitopes responses of anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) Chung <italic>et al.</italic> reported that ISCOMATRIX™ adjuvant promotes HA1 antibodies against large conformational epitopes spanning the receptor binding domain, while antibodies targeting the C-terminus of the HA1 domain are generated in the unadjuvanted group. However, the numbers of recognized epitopes do not change among groups.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) Although the capacity of adjuvants to modulate the epitope specificity of antibodies has been described, the effects of adjuvants in the modulation of T cell epitope specificity remain unclear.</p>
<p>Lo-Man R <italic>et al.</italic> reported that <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> expressing MalE protein induced new CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses to peptides that were silent in purified Ag with adjuvant CFA administration group.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) Andersen e<italic>t al.</italic> showed that adenovirus vector expressing Ag85B/ESAT-6 fusion proteins induced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response against ESAT-6 epitope, while CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell response to epitope located in Ag85B was detected in the liposomal adjuvanted group.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) These researches suggest that specific T cell responses are not constant, and antigen delivery formulation can affect the specificity of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses. In this study, using a series of synthesized overlapping peptides, we reveal that adjuvants modulate the hierarchy of epitope-specific Th1 responses post vaccination.</p>
<p>Successful priming of epitope-specific T cell requires T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) on the surface of APCs. Adjuvants have been reported to have the capacity to activate APCs and enhance costimulatory signals.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) However, whether adjuvants can regulate the presentation of pMHC on APCs cell surface remains lacking direct evidence. In this study, using LC-MS/ MS-based immunopeptidome, we confirm that adjuvants affect peptide repertoires presented by MHC-II molecules of APCs, and fewer peptides are presented by APCs post MPLA and CpG stimulation. A narrow peptide repertoire has been reported to increase the possibility of T cell priming and improve the specificity of T cell responses.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) Thus, we speculate that adjuvants MPLA and CpG may enhance vaccine-induced immune response by restricting epitope diversity presentation of APCs rather than inducing more cryptic epitope presentation. Furthermore, we find that peptides with high binding stability for MHC-II are restained and low stability peptides are presented on APCs post MPLA and CpG adjuvants treatment. Peptides with low stability for MHC-II have been confirmed to skew antigen-specific T cell repertoires towards high TCR affinity clonotypes.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) Our data explain Baumgartner and colleagues’ finding that MPLA and CpG adjuvants induce high TCR affinity antigen-specific T cell clonotype responses.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) T cell clonotypes with higher TCR affinity have better abilities against pathogen infection and tumor.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) In this study, we also observed robust T cell responses induced by the peptide with low stability through the Titration assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), although no single T cell clonotype was used.</p>
<p>APCs subtypes differ in the expression of endolysosomal proteases and DO/ DM molecules(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), and exhibit different abilities to process Ag and present peptides.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>) Kanellopoulos <italic>et al.</italic> reported that DCs focused HEL-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses against an I-E<sup>d</sup>-restricted peptide HEL103-117, while B cells presented an additional I-A<sup>d</sup>-restricted peptide HEL7-31.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) Max Schnurr and colleagues had shown that CD1c<sup>+</sup> blood DCs and MoDCs were capable of presenting peptides of antigen NY-ESO-1 on both MHC I and MHC II, while pDCs were limited to MHC II presentation.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) In this study, antigen UreB adjuvanted different adjuvants induced antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses <italic>in vivo</italic> post-vaccination, whereas no peptides of UreB presented by A20 cells were detected <italic>in vitro</italic> using LC-MS/ MS. One reason may be differences in the cell types of APCs involved, with many APCs subtypes involved <italic>in vivo</italic>, especially DCs, but only the B cell line (A20) used <italic>in vitro</italic>. Another reason may be that the UreB peptide abundance is below the detection limit of LC-MS/MS <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Pathogen proteins with high abundance are often preferred as candidate antigens for vaccine design. However, the amounts of pathogen antigens are not consistent with that of antigens which are phagocytized and presented by APCs. Shira Weingarten-Gabbay and colleagues found that nucleocapsid protein (N) is the most abundant viral protein in SARS-CoV-2 infected A549 and HEK293T cells, but only one HLA-I peptide from N is presented.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>) Thus, antigens with high expression might be less presented than expected, and induce poor T-cell responses. We found that the proteins harboring more peptides compatible with the MHC binding motifs were more likely to be presented (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Screening the dominant epitopes from all proteins of pathogens is meaningful for vaccine design. This is the advantage of immunopeptidomes based on LC-MS/ MS. Several epitopes detected in this study with good immunogenicity may be used as candidates for epitope vaccine development.</p>
<p>Taken together, our work uncovers that adjuvants influence the pMHC stability presented on APCs and change the specificity of epitope responses. In the process of adjuvant selection for vaccines, it is necessary to consider not only adjuvants’ effect on the strength of immune responses, but also that on the specificity of the responses, especially for PRR ligand adjuvants, which mainly induce Th1 or CTL biased responses.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>First, the peptides screened <italic>in vitro</italic> using cell lines cannot reflect the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>. The epitope presentation of APCs can be affected by APCs subtypes and inflammatory cytokines at the inoculation site(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), which are difficult to simulate and reproduce <italic>in vitro</italic>. Second, peptide abundance below the limit of detection may be missed using LC-MS/MS based assays, which may cause false negatives. The possibility of these peptides inducing immune responses cannot be ruled out. Third, compared with mouse MHC molecules, human MHC molecules are much more complex. Whether the research’s conclusions can be generalized to the human population still needs further research.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study demonstrates a potential mechanism by which adjuvants influence T-cell responses. The observation that adjuvant impacts the exogenous peptide repertoire presented by MHC II molecules is fascinating and the strength of the evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, with studies comparing different adjuvants and an H pylori vaccine in murine models and in vitro systems, analysis of MHCII: peptide complexes in antigen-presenting cells and assessment of differential peptide binding affinities. This work will be of broad interest to vaccinologists as well as immunologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Li et al investigated how adjuvants such as MPLA and CpG influence antigen presentation at the level of the Antigen-presenting cell and MHCII : peptide interaction. They found that the use of MPLA or CpG influences the exogenous peptide repertoire presented by MHC II molecules. Additionally, their observations included the finding that peptides with low-stability peptide:MHC interactions yielded more robust CD4+ T cell responses in mice. These phenomena were illustrated specifically for 2 pattern recognition receptor activating adjuvants. This work represents a step forward for how adjuvants program CD4+ Th responses and provides further evidence regarding the expected mechanisms of PRR adjuvants in enhancing CD4+ T cell responses in the setting of vaccination.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a variety of systems to analyze this question. Initial observations were collected in an H pylori model of vaccination with a demonstration of immunodominance differences simply by adjuvant type, followed by analysis of MHC:peptide as well as proteomic analysis with comparison by adjuvant group. Their analysis returns to peptide immunization and analysis of strength of relative CD4+ T cell responses, through calculation of IC:50 values and strength of binding. This is a comprehensive work. The logical sequence of experiments makes sense and follows an unexpected observation through to trying to understand that process further with peptide immunization and its impact on Th responses. This work will premise further studies into the mechanisms of adjuvants on T cells</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While MDP has a different manner of interaction as an adjuvant compared to CpG and MPLA, it is unclear why MDP has a different impact on peptide presentation and it should be further investigated, or at minimum highlighted in the discussion as an area that requires further investigation.</p>
<p>It is alluded by the authors that TLR activating adjuvants mediate selective, low affinity, exogenous peptide binding onto MHC class II molecules. However, this was not demonstrated to be related specifically to TLR binding. I wonder if some work with TLR deficient mice (TLR 4KO for example) could evaluate this phenomenon more specifically.</p>
<p>It is unclear to me if this observation is H pylori model/antigen-specific. It may have been nice to characterize the phenomenon with a different set of antigens as supplemental. Lastly, it is unclear if the peptide immunization experiment reveals a clear pattern related to high and low-stability peptides among the peptides analyzed.</p>

<p>Adjuvants boost antigen-specific immune responses to vaccines. However, whether adjuvants modulate the epitope immunodominance and the mechanisms involved in adjuvant's effect on antigen processing and presentation are not fully characterized. In this manuscript, Li et al report that immunodominant epitopes recognized by antigen-specific T cells are altered by adjuvants.</p>
<p>Using MPLA, CpG, and MDP adjuvants and H. pylori antigens, the authors screened the dominant epitopes of Th1 responses in mice post-vaccination with different adjuvants and found that adjuvants altered antigen-specific CD4+ T cell immunodominant epitope hierarchy. They show that adjuvants, MPLA and CpG especially, modulate the peptide repertoires presented on the surface of APCs. Surprisingly, adjuvant favored the presentation of low-stability peptides rather than high-stability peptides by APCs. As a result, the low stability peptide presented in adjuvant groups elicits T cell response effectively.</p>
