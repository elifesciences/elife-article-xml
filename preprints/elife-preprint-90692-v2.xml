<title>Abstract</title><p>Arpin was discovered as an inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex localized at the lamellipodial tip of fibroblasts, where it regulated migration steering. Recently, we showed that arpin stabilizes the epithelial barrier in an Arp2/3-dependent manner. However, expression and functions of arpin in endothelial cells (EC) have not yet been described. Arpin mRNA and protein are expressed in EC and downregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Arpin depletion in HUVEC causes the formation of actomyosin stress fibers leading to increased permeability in an Arp2/3-independent manner. Instead, inhibitors of ROCK1 and ZIPK, kinases involved in the generation of stress fibers, normalize the loss-of-arpin effects on actin filaments and permeability. Arpin-deficient mice are viable but show a characteristic vascular phenotype in the lung including edema, microhemorrhage and vascular congestion, increased F-actin levels and vascular permeability. Our data show that, apart from being an Arp2/3 inhibitor, arpin is also a regulator of actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arpin was discovered ten years ago in fibroblasts as a protein that binds to and inhibits the heptameric actin nucleator actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dang et al. 2013</xref>). Arpin competed with WAVE2, a nucleation promoting factor (NPF) that activates Arp2/3, at the lamellipodial tip of migrating fibroblast to steer random migration by regulating migration speed and directional persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dang et al. 2013</xref>). However, later studies demonstrated that arpin did not regulate chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dang et al. 2017</xref>). Subsequently, arpin has been studied in different cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lomakina et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Li, Zheng, et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang, Li, et al. 2019</xref>), where its downregulation correlated with poor prognosis of the disease and high migratory capability and invasiveness of the tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Li, Qiu, et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lomakina et al. 2016</xref>). We have shown that arpin was expressed in colon epithelial cells and that patients with ulcerative colitis had lower levels of arpin in acutely inflamed tissue areas. Arpin colocalized with junctional proteins and stabilized epithelial barrier integrity under basal and inflammatory conditions in an Arp2/3-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chanez-Paredes et al. 2021</xref>). However, nothing is known about arpin expression in endothelial cells (EC) and functions in endothelial barrier regulation during inflammation.</p>
<p>The endothelium forms a semi-permeable barrier that separates the blood from tissues. During inflammation, weakening of cell-cell adhesive structures including adherens junctions (AJ) and tight junctions (TJ) is important for allowing the passage of plasma proteins and immune cells to the inflamed tissue and inflammation resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Reglero-Real et al. 2016</xref>). The correct regulation of AJ and TJ stability and thus vascular permeability is controlled by dynamic actin cytoskeletal remodeling including the formation of stabilizing cortical actin filaments and destabilizing contractile stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Prasain and Stevens 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Garcia-Ponce et al. 2015</xref>). As important actin cytoskeletal regulator, the Arp2/3 complex regulates maintenance and recovery of the pulmonary endothelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Belvitch et al. 2017</xref>). On the other hand, Arp2/3 is also involved in the endocytosis of occludin at the blood-brain barrier during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Park et al. 2013</xref>). Additionally, Arp2/3 and its activator WAVE-2 stabilize endothelial barrier functions by promoting the formation of junction-associated intermittent lamellipodia (JAIL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abu Taha et al. 2014</xref>). These studies are only a few examples highlighting the importance of the Arp2/3 complex for controlling vascular permeability. While Arp2/3 activators such as WAVE-2 have been studied in this context, the role of Arp2/3 inhibitors in endothelial barrier regulation remains elusive. Therefore, we hypothesized that arpin is expressed in endothelial cells and that it contributes to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics at junctions to fine-tune the regulation of endothelial permeability under basal and inflammatory conditions. To test this hypothesis, we generated arpin-depleted Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) and arpin-deficient mice to analyze the role of arpin in endothelial barrier regulation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Arpin is expressed in endothelial cells</title>
<p>Arpin was discovered in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dang et al. 2013</xref>), and it was subsequently described to be expressed in other cells including colon epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chanez-Paredes et al. 2021</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether arpin is expressed in endothelial cells. We found here by end-point RT-PCR that arpin mRNA is expressed in different human and mouse endothelial cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Also, arpin protein is present in HMEC-1 and HUVEC at similar levels with the predicted molecular weight of 25 kDa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Arpin was localized throughout the cytosol in confluent HUVEC monolayers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). However, line scans revealed an enrichment of arpin close to vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) at cell-cell contacts. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Analyzing arpin localization in postcapillary venules of cremaster muscles using PECAM-1 as template for endothelial cell-cell contacts, we observed a similar localization of arpin throughout the endothelial cytosol with an enrichment near and at junctions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Although the majority of arpin is localized in the cytosol, such enrichment at junctions observed both in human HUVEC culture and mouse cremaster venules suggests that arpin could contribute to endothelial barrier regulation.</p>

<title>Arpin is dowregulated by inflammatory cytokines</title>
<p>Endothelial cells are activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β leading to weakening of the endothelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mako et al. 2010</xref>). To study arpin regulation during inflammation, we analyzed <italic>ARPIN</italic> gene expression by qRT-PCR in HUVEC monolayers treated with TNFα for 4 and 18 h and found a significant downregulation of around 60% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Remarkably, expression of the other Arp2/3 inhibitors, <italic>AP1AR</italic> and <italic>PICK1</italic>, was not significantly changed after TNFα treatment. Western blot and densitometry analysis confirmed the decrease of arpin at the protein level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) with no significant changes of PICK1 protein levels (Figure S1A). Upregulation of Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was used here as a positive control for the inflammatory response.</p>

</fig>
<p>Immunofluorescence of arpin in HUVEC monolayers treated or not with TNFα confirmed downregulation of arpin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This decrease was not only obvious for total arpin, but arpin was also lost at junctions (arrows in the magnifications of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) and actin filaments (Top-right graphs <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, arpin reduction significantly correlated with the TNFα-induced increase in actin stress fibers (lower graph <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wojciak-Stothard et al. 1998</xref>). Arpin protein downregulation was also observed after IL-1β treatment in HUVECs for 4 and 18 h (Figure S1B) and no significant changes were observed in the protein levels of PICK1 (Figure S1C). Similar with TNFα-treatment, IL-1β induces loss of arpin at all subcellular locations (Top-right graphs Figure S1D). Again, IL1β-induced arpin downregulation significantly correlated with an increase in actin stress fibers (lower graph Figure S1D).</p>
<p>Arpin immunofluorescence signal in post-capillary venules of the TNFα-inflamed cremaster muscle was also reduced by around 50%, which was again true for both junctional and non-junctional arpin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Robust neutrophil recruitment confirmed that inflammation was induced correctly in this model. Overall, endothelial arpin is downregulated in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> suggesting that arpin plays an important role in the regulation of endothelial barrier dysfunction during inflammation.</p>

<title>Arpin depletion increases endothelial permeability and modifies junction architecture</title>
<p>To analyze the function of arpin in endothelial barrier regulation, we generated arpin-depleted HUVEC with more than 80% reduction in arpin protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Of note, arpin depletion did not change the expression of arpC5, a subunit of the Arp2/3 complex, or the NPFs WAVE2 and WASP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Although arpin-depleted HUVEC formed monolayers, the paracellular flux of 150 kDa FITC-dextran across untreated arpin-depleted HUVEC monolayers was 34.5% (±3.70) higher (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). While TNFα treatment of control HUVEC induced the expected strong increase in permeability, TNFα treatment of arpin-depleted HUVEC showed an even higher increase compared to control HUVEC treated with TNFα (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) suggesting that the TNFα-induced and arpin-induced permeability increases are regulated by different mechanisms. However, we did not observe changes in the total protein levels of the AJ proteins VE-Cadherin, β-catenin, and vinculin in control and arpin-depleted HUVEC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), or in the levels of the TJ proteins ZO-1 and claudin-5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). However, immunofluorescence staining of VE-Cadherin and β-catenin revealed discontinuous and zipper-like junctional patterns, indicative of immature junctions in arpin-depleted HUVEC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Surprisingly, calcium switch assay showed that control and arpin-depleted HUVEC formed new junctions in a similar fashion (Figure S2A). These data suggest that arpin is not required for junction assembly, but rather for stabilizing existing junctions.</p>

<title>Arpin depletion induces actin filament formation</title>
<p>It is well known that the endothelial actin cytoskeleton contributes to barrier homeostasis and that significant actin cytoskeleton remodelling accompanies increased vascular permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Garcia Ponce et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Hilfenhaus et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Waschke et al. 2005</xref>). Thus, we analyzed F-actin using phalloidin staining in control and arpin-depleted HUVEC. Quantifying the pixel intensity of the phalloidin stainings, we observed a statistically significant increase in actin filaments in the cells with arpin deficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Particularly, arpin-depleted HUVEC showed a significant increase in central actin filaments crossing the cell body (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). However, we did not observe significant differences in the total actin protein levels in control and arpin-depleted HUVEC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) suggesting that G-actin levels are reduced at the expense of F-actin formation. Quantification of other proteins known to be involved in actin dynamics such as cortactin, coronin1B, and cofilin did not reveal any significant changes caused by the loss of arpin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In the next set of experiments, we wanted to identify the nature of these actin filaments and answer the question of whether the observed hyperpermeability is related to these changes in the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

<title>Inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex does not rescue the observed phenotype in arpin-depleted HUVEC</title>
<p>The first function of arpin described was that it inhibits the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dang et al. 2013</xref>). Assuming this function, loss of arpin would mean more active Arp2/3. To determine if a potential increase in Arp2/3 activity is causing the observed effects in arpin-depleted endothelial cells, we used the pharmacological Arp2/3 inhibitor CK666 to test whether it would reverse the observed phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Surprisingly, phalloidin stainings and quantification of the total F-actin signal revealed no reduction in the pixel intensity between CK666-treated and vehicle-treated arpin-depleted HUVEC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> A and B). The central actin fiber density was also not affected by Arp2/3 inhibition in arpin-depleted HUVEC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, permeability increased in control HUVEC after CK666 treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Instead of normalizing the permeability in arpin-depleted HUVEC, CK666 induced an additional increase in permeability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). These surprising results demonstrate that arpin regulates actin filament formation and permeability in HUVEC in an Arp2/3-independent manner.</p>

<title>Arpin depletion leads to increased formation of actin stress fibers</title>
<p>Given that arpin acts independently of the Arp2/3 complex in HUVEC and that the observed central actin filaments in arpin-depleted HUVECs resemble stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tojkander, Gateva, and Lappalainen 2012</xref>), we investigated whether these actin structures are contractile actomyosin stress fibers, which are known to exert mechanical forces on junctions and thus destabilize endothelial contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Millan et al. 2010</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, we observed a significant increase in the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) at serine-19 in arpin-depleted HUVECs, indicative of actomyosin contractility. MLC is a target of kinases such as ROCK1 and ZIPK that phosphorylate it, and phosphatases such as Myosin Phosphatase Target Subunit 1 (MYPT1) that dephosphorylate MLC. Concomitant with the increase in p-MLC-S19, we found an increase in the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Threonin-696 and Threonin-853 in arpin-depleted HUVECs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), phosphorylations known to inactivate MYPT1. In agreement, we observed increased total levels of ROCK1 and ZIPK in arpin-depleted HUVECs that likely contribute to increased MLC phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). However, the levels of the formin mDia, implicated in the nucleation of actin stress fibers, were not affected by arpin depletion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These results suggest that the increased central actin filaments in arpin-depleted HUVEC are contractile actomyosin stress fibers that contribute to the destabilization of endothelial junctions and increased permeability.</p>

<title>Inhibition of ROCK1/2M and ZIPK rescues endothelial barrier functions in arpin-depleted HUVEC</title>
<p>Given the increased levels of ROCK1 and ZIPK and the increased phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1, we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of ROCK1 by Y27632 and of ZIPK by HS38 could revert increased stress fiber formation and permeability in arpin-depleted HUVEC.

Permeability assays confirmed these data and showed a complete rescue in arpin-depleted HUVEC treated with HS38 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). Of note, the even higher permeability in TNFα-treated arpin-depleted HUVECs was reduced after HS38 treatment but not to the levels of control cells indicating that ZIPK inhibition is able to rescue the permeability effect caused by the loss of arpin, but not the combined effect of TNFα treatment and loss of arpin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>).

<title>Arpin deficiency causes increased vascular permeability</title>
<p>To unravel whether arpin also regulates endothelial barrier integrity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed permeability assays <italic>in vivo</italic> in the lung because WT mice showed high levels of arpin in the lung (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>) and the lung is a highly vascularized organ. Remarkably, permeability in lungs of arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice was around two-fold higher than in arpin<sup>+/+</sup> mice under basal conditions without any permeability-inducing stimulus (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). To rule out that this is an effect specific only for the lung, we also performed Miles assays to measure permeability in the back skin under basal condition and with histamine as a permeability-inducing stimulus. Also in the skin, vascular permeability was higher in arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice under basal conditions compared to arpin<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). Of note, histamine stimulation further induced permeability in arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Treatment with either the ROCK1/2 inhibitor Y27632 or the ZIPK inhibitor HS38 reverted permeability to the basal levels observed in arpin<sup>+/+</sup> mice, thus confirming our findings in arpin-depleted HUVEC. Interestingly, Arp2/3 inhibition using CK-666 did not affect vascular permeability in the skin of arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>). Together, these results support the idea that arpin controls endothelial permeability via ROCK/ZIPK-dependent stress fiber formation and not via inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex. Next, we analyzed the protein levels of different junction proteins by Western blot and did not observe any significant differences in the protein levels of VE-Cadherin, β-catenin, vinculin, claudin-1 and −5, and tubulin in arpin<sup>+/+</sup> and arpin<sup>-/-</sup> lungs (Figure S3B).</p>
<p>Histological analyses revealed normal lung histology in arpin<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>, images 1 and 2). By contrast, the arpin<sup>-/-</sup> lungs showed several abnormalities indicative of a vascular phenotype. For example, absence of arpin caused a reduction of the volume of the alveolar space (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>, image 3, asterisk), signs of hemorrhage and microhemorrhage (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>, images 4 and 5, arrowheads), and presence of interalveolar edema (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>, image 6, asterisks). Accordingly, the histological score was significantly increased in arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>, graph below). Lungs of arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice also showed the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages. However, hemograms revealed that the number of leukocytes in the peripheral blood was not significantly altered in arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared with arpin<sup>+/+</sup> mice (Table S2), indicating that the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages in the lungs of arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice is not simply due to an increased number of these cells.</p>
<p>PECAM-1 immunostaining was performed to visualize blood vessels in the lung, and phalloidin to identify F-actin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>). Although we did not observe differences in total levels of PECAM-1 in arpin<sup>+/+</sup> and arpin<sup>-/-</sup> lungs, we observed a significant increase in the total levels of F-actin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref>, graph below), similar to what we observed in arpin-depleted HUVEC suggesting that the increased permeability <italic>in vivo</italic> is also due to an increase in the formation of actin stress fibers. In addition, we also analyzed endothelial junctions in post-capillary venules of cremaster muscles under basal conditions. We observed in venules of arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice VE-Cadherin internalization leading to a zipper-like junction structure similar to what we observed in arpin-depleted HUVEC (Figure S3C). Also, ZO-1 staining showed gaps in arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice, whereas it was continuous in arpin<sup>+/+</sup> mice (Figure S3D). Overall, our data highlight a novel important Arp2/3-independent role of arpin in maintaining endothelial barrier integrity <italic>in vitro and in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we discovered new and surprising arpin functions. First, arpin is expressed in endothelium <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and downregulated during inflammation. Second, arpin is required for proper endothelial permeability regulation and junction architecture. Third, and most surprisingly, arpin exerts these functions in an Arp2/3-independent manner; instead, it rather controls actomyosin contractility in a ROCK1/ZIPK-dependent mechanism (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Finally, we present the first total arpin knock-out mice that are viable and breed and develop normally but show histological characteristics of a vascular phenotype in the lung and increased permeability similar to what we observed in arpin-depleted HUVEC.</p>

<caption><title>Current working model for arpin functions in ECs.</title>
<p>Under basal conditions arpin is located throughout the cell and enriched at cellular junctions. During inflammation, arpin is downregulated causing the formation of actomyosin actin stress fibers, junction disruption, and increased permeability. Question marks indicate the hitherto unknown mechanism of how arpin controls the activity of ROCK and ZIPK to induce the formation of contractile actin stress fibers.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="542762v3_fig9.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Arpin is expressed in EC with a localization throughout the cytosol but with an enrichment at cell-cell contacts similar to what has been described in epithelial cells of the colon, other barrier-forming cells (Abu Taha et al.). Such ubiquitous but diffuse subcellular location in (endothelial) cells is not surprising for an actin-regulating protein as it has been also described for other actin cytoskeleton regulators such as WAVE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mooren et al. 2014</xref>) and the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abu Taha et al. 2014</xref>). The enrichment at junctions, however, suggested that arpin plays a role in the regulation of endothelial barrier integrity. In fibroblasts, arpin was enriched at the lamellipodial tip and accordingly regulated migration speed and directionality, one of the main functions thus far described for arpin. It will be important to reveal in future studies whether arpin also regulates endothelial cell movement for example during angiogenesis.</p>
<p>Of note, arpin is downregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines suggesting that the removal of arpin is required for the changes in EC occurring during inflammation including actin cytoskeleton remodelling and junction weakening that allow for inflammation-related vascular events such as plasma protein leakage and leukocyte recruitment essential for combating the cause of inflammation and inflammation resolution. This finding is in line with our previous report showing downregulation during epithelial inflammation. Particularly, we demonstrated that arpin is not only reduced in colon epithelial cells after treatment with pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model and in patients with ulcerative colitis, where loss of arpin was particularly evident in acutely inflamed tissue regions. Importantly, loss of arpin significantly correlated with epithelial barrier disruption in all models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chanez-Paredes et al. 2021</xref>) indicating that loss of arpin in the context of epithelium is related to pathogenic events. This is in contrast to our new findings in endothelium where barrier weakening is required for proper inflammation resolution. However, the recovery of arpin expression during inflammation resolution and the role of arpin in vascular diseases remain to be investigated. Besides, in macrophages infected with human rhinovirus arpin was also reduced leading to impaired phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jubrail et al. 2020</xref>). Thus, arpin downregulation seems to be relevant in different cell types to regulate different cellular functions. Our qRT-PCR results suggest that arpin reduction occurs at the transcriptional level. However, more research is needed to characterize the promoter region of arpin and regulatory mechanisms controlling arpin mRNA levels. Given the strong downregulation induced by cytokines such as TNFα it is tempting to speculate that arpin mRNA levels are controlled by inflammatory pathways that are well known to be induced by TNFα such as NF-κB.</p>
<p>The Arp2/3 complex is critical for endothelial barrier formation, maintenance and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abu Taha et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Belvitch et al. 2017</xref>). Therefore, it was logical to assume that an Arp2/3 inhibitory protein such as arpin would be important for endothelial barrier integrity regulation. This idea was further supported by our study showing that arpin is involved in epithelial barrier regulation in an Arp2/3-dependent manner. Surprisingly, our results in EC suggest that arpin functions independently of the Arp2/3 complex. Instead, we described here that arpin is involved in the formation of actomyosin stress fibers in a ROCK/ZIPK-dependent fashion. It is well known that in EC ROCK1 and ZIPK are activated downstream of several pro-inflammatory mediators including TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mong and Wang 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zeng et al. 2021</xref>) which leads to the phosphorylation of MLC and MYPT1 that together drive stress fiber formation, actomyosin contractility, reduction of the barrier-stabilizing cortical actin ring and barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Millan et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angulo-Urarte et al. 2018</xref>). Thus, our findings in arpin-depleted HUVEC of increased actomyosin stress fibers may well explain the observed increased permeability. ZIPK is not just activated but also overexpress by TNFα in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zeng et al. 2021</xref>), its depletion and inhibition reduces thrombin-induced MLC phosphorylation and actomyosin contractility (Zhang, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang, et al. 2019</xref>), which is in line with our observation in arpin-depleted HUVEC. Together, these data indicate a mechanistic link of arpin and ZIPK for EC barrier regulation during inflammation, but more research is required to unravel in detail the exact nature of this link. On the other hand, the spatiotemporal interplay between non-muscle-myosin II-dependent contractility and Arp2/3 complex activity regulates the formation of dactylopodia, a lamellipodia-related membrane protrusion of invasive EC implicated in sprouting angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Figueiredo et al. 2021</xref>). How such interplay may contribute to inflammatory EC barrier regulation and whether arpin connects the two different actin dynamics mechanisms are questions to be answered by future research.</p>
<p>Loss of the actin-binding protein (ABP) cortactin, which has also been implicated in the regulation of Arp2/3-induced actin branches, has also been shown to cause increased actomyosin contractility and as a consequence increased EC hyperpermeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Garcia Ponce et al. 2016</xref>). It remains elusive why barrier functions in EC and epithelial cells are regulated by arpin via different mechanisms, but this question is the focus of ongoing and future studies.</p>
<p>Although originally not described as an ABP, we do not discard the possibility that arpin can directly regulate actin cytoskeleton remodelling because a recently published actin interactome revealed that actin can interact transiently with arpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Viita et al. 2019</xref>). Thus, it will be important to unravel whether arpin interacts with G-actin, F-actin, or both; and how this direct interaction would contribute to the regulation of the actin dynamics, junction architecture, and barrier regulation in EC.</p>
<p>In this study, we also report for the first time a total arpin knockout C57BL/6 mouse generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic engineering. These mice developed and grew normally as C57BL/6 mice at least until week 12 when the arpin-deficient mice were used for experiments. Also, these mice did not show any phenotype identifiable by visual inspection. Thus, arpin is not essential for embryonic, fetal and early adult development similar to what has been described for other ABP knockout mice including those deficient for PICK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Steinberg et al. 2006</xref>), gadkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Schachtner et al. 2015</xref>), cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Schnoor et al. 2011</xref>), α-actinin3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">MacArthur et al. 2008</xref>) and coronin-1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Punwani et al. 2015</xref>). By contrast, mice deficient for the Arp2/3 subunits ArpC4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">van der Kammen et al. 2017</xref>) and ArpC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yae et al. 2006</xref>) and the NPF WAVE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dahl et al. 2003</xref>) and N-WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Snapper et al. 2001</xref>) are not viable, thus further highlighting the difference between Arp2/3 inhibitors and ABP and the Arp2/3 complex and its activators. Importantly, our permeability and histological data revealed a clear vascular phenotype in the lung and therefore the importance of arpin in maintaining endothelial barrier integrity in the lung <italic>in vivo</italic>, a phenotype that is in line with our observations in arpin-depleted HUVEC. Such a strong vascular phenotype in the lung can be caused by several factors including an increase in the intravascular or interstitial hydrostatic pressure, endothelial injury or disruption of tissue barriers or lymphatic insufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Malek and Soufi 2023</xref>). While this phenotype in the arpin<sup>-/-</sup> mice is notorious, it apparently does not compromise the life of the mice at least into early adulthood. It will be critical to characterize older mice; and to investigate whether these mice are more susceptible to inflammatory or infectious diseases of the lung that are also characterized by the loss of tissue barrier functions. Moreover, future investigations need to analyze arpin functions in other organs such as heart and brain in which arpin is highly expressed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results suggest that arpin, besides being an Arp2/3 inhibitor is a fundamental component of the molecular machinery that controls actomyosin contractility and endothelial barrier integrity. We proposed a model in which arpin is downregulated during inflammation to induce the formation of actomyosin stress fibers and vascular permeability. This study will hopefully pave the way for additional studies on the role of arpin in vascular diseases.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The data clearly demonstrate that arpin is important for vessel barrier function, yet its genetic loss via a CRISPR strategy was not lethality, but led to viable animals in C57Blk strain at 12 weeks of age, albeit with leaky blood vessels. Pharmacological approaches were employed to demonstrate that loss of arpin led to ROCK1-dependent stress fiber formation that promoted increased permeability.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results clearly demonstrate that arpin is expressed in the endothelium of blood vessels and its deficiency leads to leaky blood vessels in in vivo and in vitro models.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>They conclude vessel leak was not related to enhanced Arp2/3 function through arpin deficiency, but no direct evidence of Arp2/3 activity is provided to support this conclusion. Instead, the authors concluded that ROCK1 activity was elevated in arpin knockdown cells and caused robust stress fiber formation. This idea could be strengthened by testing if ROCK1 inhibition by pharmacological block in arpin KO mice leads to less vascular leakage while pharmacological inhibition of Arp2/3 does not attenuate increased vessel permeability.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have taken their previous finding that arpin is important for epithelial junctions and extended this to endothelial cells. They find that the positive effects of arpin on endothelial junctions are not dependent on Arp2/3 activity but instead on suppression of actinomyosin contractility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study uses standard approaches to test each of the components in the model. The quality of the experimental work is good and the amount of experimental evidence is sufficient to support this straightforward story.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The major weakness is that the story is a simple extension of the previous work on arpin and junctions in epithelial cells. The additional information is that the effects are not via Arp2/3 directly, but instead through an increase in actinomyosin contractility. However, the connection between arpin and increased ROCK activity is not revealed.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Arpin is a negative regulator of Arp2/3 activity. Here the authors investigated the role of arpin in vascular permeability using appropriate cultured human and murine endothelial monolayers and successfully developed an arpin KO mice. The results clearly show arpin is expressed in blood vessels (not clear about lymphatics but given leaky vessels, one wonders). The data show that arpin is important for vessel barrier function yet its genetic loss still leads to viable animals in the C57Blk strain albeit with leaky blood vessels. The data are well presented and controls are included. However, the evidence that arpin loss/knockdown causes increased actin functions independent of Arp2/3 is based on pharmacological data and is indirect. Authors conclude ROCK1 activity is elevated and the cause of lost barrier function by arpin reduction. I do have one suggestion for the authors that involves a new study in these animals, which could strengthen their proposed mechanism that the vascular defects are independent of Arp2/3 activity and rather involve ROCK1 but not ZIPK.</p>
<p>(1) If arpin is working via ROCK1, as the authors infer, perhaps treatment of arpin-/- mice with ROCK1 inhibitor(s) would attenuate vessel permeability while HS38 treatment would not. This type of study would strengthen the conclusion that ROCK1, but not ZIPK, was involved. Including CK666 if active in mouse cells, could also be tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To analyze vascular permeability in vivo, we performed Miles assays in arpin+/+ and arpin-/- mice using the inhibitors of ROCK1 (Y27632) and ZIPK (HS38). Both Y27632 and HS38 reduced the permeability caused by absence of arpin (new Figure 8E), thus confirming what we observed before in HUVEC (shown in old Figure 7). CK666 did not change the permeability in arpin-/- mice, thus confirming the conclusion that arpin does not regulate vascular permeability via Arp2/3 but rather via ROCK1/ZIPK-mediated stress fiber formation (page 13).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Fig 5. Data demonstrate that Arpin regulates actin filament formations and permeability in HUVEC, but this does not demonstrate its occurring in an Arp2/3-independent manner. If I understand your data this is indirect evidence. One needs more information to reach this conclusion. Can authors measure Arp2/3 directly and then test whether arpin knockdown and CK666 have the same capacity to reduce Arp2/3 activity in vitro.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Arp2/3 activity cannot be measured directly. The commonly used approach is therefore Arp2/3 inhibition via CK666. Our new in vivo permeability assays (see answer above) together with our HUVEC data in Figure 5 clearly show that CK666 does not have the same effect as arpin knock-down, and neither does CK666 rescue the effects of arpin deficiency in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings clearly suggest that arpin does not regulate endothelial permeability via Arp2/3.</p>

<p>Minor issues:</p>
<p>Fig 2, 3 or other Figs: In presented western blots, all proteins should include appropriate mw labels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. Molecular weights have been added to all Western blots.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig 2. Suggest that like your arpin analysis, amounts of AP1AP and PICK1 at baseline and TNF-treatment by blotting should be included. A minor point is yellow color for labels does not stand out and should be changed to another color - as the authors used in Fig 2C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included Western blots and quantifications for PICK1 in Figure S1A and S1C. An antibody against AP1AP was unfortunately not available.</p>
<p>The yellow color has been changed to purple for better visibility.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig 2C. The arpin loss at junctions and actin filaments (Figure 2C) is very minor even though it reached statistical significance. It really is not an obvious loss from your 3 color overlay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. It is indeed hard to see. We included now magnifications in Figure 2C that better show the loss of arpin at junctions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig 8, text 303-310 shows in vivo evidence of lung congestion and edema. Also appear to be inflammatory cells present in images. If these are inflammatory cells, it begs the question if these mice have an abnormal complete blood cell count (CBC). Suggest adding CBC data for arpin-/- vs control arpin +/+ mice in Fig 8.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The pathologist observed the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages, indicating the possibility of a (low level) chronic inflammation in arpin-deficient lungs. However, we now also performed hemograms of the mice (new Table S2) that showed no significant difference in the blood cell count of arpin-/- and arpin+/+ mice. Thus, the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages cannot be explained simply by higher leukocyte counts (page 14).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 289, pg 13, Fig 8: Lung levels of arpin are not shown in Fig 8B. Authors must mean another fig?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry. Arpin protein levels in lungs are shown in figure 8C. This has been corrected on page 13.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This is a solid piece of work that adds a small amount of additional factual information to our understanding of cell-cell junctions. The experimental work is of good quality and is sufficient to support the aims of the paper. I think the value of the work is to add this small amount of new knowledge to the archive. I do not believe that further experimental work would add to the paper - it's done. But this doesn't have the impact or completeness for this journal. It belongs in a for-the-record journal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your overall positive evaluation and your comments that our study represents a solid piece of work with good quality experimental work. However, we are not sure what you mean by “it belongs in a for-the-record journal”. Anyway, we agree that our study does not reveal a complete mechanism of how arpin regulates actin stress fibers, but we respectfully disagree that our study only adds a “small amount of additional factual information”. We may not have been very clear about it, but we present in this study several new discoveries and although some are descriptive in nature that does not make them trivial or less important. We provide for the first time experimental evidence that: 1) arpin is expressed in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo, and downregulated during inflammation; 2) presence of arpin is required for proper endothelial permeability regulation and junction architecture; 3) arpin exerts these functions in an Arp2/3-independent manner; 4) arpin controls actomyosin contractility in a ROCK1- and ZIPK-dependent fashion; 5) arpin knock-out mice are viable and breed and develop normally but show histological characteristics of a vascular phenotype and increased vascular permeability that can be rescued by inhibition of ROCK1 and ZIPK. The fact that arpin fulfills its functions in endothelial cells independently of the Arp2/3 complex is of special relevance as previously the only known function of arpin was the inhibition of the Arp2/3 complex. Thus, we believe that our study adds a significant amount of new information to the literature. Thank you very much.</p>
