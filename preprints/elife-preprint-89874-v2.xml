<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria are ubiquitously distributed across various biospheres and play key roles in global element cycles. However, few deep-sea <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> members have been cultivated, limiting our understanding of <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> in the deep biosphere. Here, we have successfully cultured a novel strain of <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> (strain ZRK32) from a cold seep sediment, by using an enriched medium supplemented with rifampicin and different nitrogen sources. Our genomic, physiological and phylogenetic analyses indicate that strain ZRK32 is a novel species, which we propose be named: <italic>Poriferisphaera heterotrophicis</italic>. We show that strain ZRK32 replicates using a budding mode of division. Based on the combined results from growth assays and transcriptomic analyses, we found that rich nutrients, or supplementation with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> promoted the growth of strain ZRK32 by facilitating energy production through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) glycolysis pathway. Moreover, supplementation with NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> induced strain ZRK32 to release a bacteriophage in a chronic manner, without host cell lysis. This bacteriophage then enabled strain ZRK32, and another marine bacterium that we studied, to metabolize nitrogen through the function of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs). Overall, these findings expand our understanding of deep-sea <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria, while highlighting their ability to metabolize nitrogen when reprogrammed by chronic viruses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria are ubiquitous in many environments, including lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pollet et al., 2011</xref>), wetlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dedysh and Ivanova, 2019</xref>), soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buckley et al., 2006</xref>), freshwater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brümmer et al., 2004</xref>), oceanic waters, and abyssal sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Woebken et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Goffredi and Orphan, 2010</xref>), where they are critical for carbon and nitrogen cycling; although, the specific pathways used are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>). Although <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria are highly abundant in nature, relatively few have been cultivated; therefore, the unexplored groups lack cultured and characterized representatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fuerst and Sagulenko, 2011</xref>). Currently, all taxonomically described <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> with validly published names can be divided into two recognized classes: <italic>Planctomycetia</italic> and <italic>Phycisphaerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fukunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Candidatus</italic> Brocadiae is considered a third class within the phylum <italic>Planctomycetes</italic>, although pure cultures are not yet available for its members and its class-level status remains to be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kartal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kartal et al., 2013</xref>). The majority of the species isolated from the phylum <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> are from the class, <italic>Planctomycetia</italic> — a class that consists of four orders: <italic>Planctomycetales</italic>, <italic>Pirellulales</italic>, <italic>Gemmatales</italic>, and <italic>Isosphaerales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dedysh et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, only few members from the <italic>Phycisphaerae</italic> class have been cultured; the class <italic>Phycisphaerae</italic> contains three orders: <italic>Phycisphaerales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fukunaga et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Tepidisphaerales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kovaleva et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>Sedimentisphaerales</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Spring et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria have fascinating physiological characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>). For decades, <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria have blurred the lines between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria possess several uncommon traits when compared with typical bacteria: they have a compartmentalized cell plan, an enlarged periplasm, a tightly folded nucleus-like structure, an endocytosis-like method of uptake, and a FtsZ-free method of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fuerst and Webb, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lindsay et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lonhienne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>). The unique cellular structures in <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria have stretched and challenged our understanding of the concept of a ‘prokaryote’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fuerst and Sagulenko, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria also exhibit a diverse range of respiration and cell division methods. Members of the class <italic>Planctomycetia</italic> are mostly aerobic and divide by budding, while <italic>Phycisphaerae</italic> members are mostly anaerobic and divide by binary fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rivas-Marín et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pradel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wiegand et al., 2020b</xref>). However, a recent report showed that <italic>Poriferisphaera corsica</italic> KS4 — a novel strain from class <italic>Phycisphaerae —</italic> was aerobic and that it might divide by budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kallscheuer et al., 2020b</xref>); this is different from previous reports and suggests that there are many physiological and cellular <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria characteristics yet to be discovered.</p>
<p>The deep sea is where life may have originated from and where stepwise evolution occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Orgel, 1998</xref>); it is also where a large number of uncultured microorganisms live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zheng et al., 2021b</xref>). Among these microbes, <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> might dominate deep-sea sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>). For example, in the Gulf of Mexico, the phylum <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> accounts for 28% of all bacteria, where they seem to be involved in the nitrogen cycle, and the breakdown of organic detrital matter, which is delivered to the sediment as marine snow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Vigneron et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, only few <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria from deep-sea environments have been cultured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wiegand et al., 2020b</xref>), limiting our understanding of their characteristics (e.g., material metabolism, element cycling, and ecological role) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kulichevskaya et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we successfully cultured a novel member of <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> (strain ZRK32) from a deep-sea subsurface sediment. We found that strain ZRK32 used a budding mode of division. We also found that supplementation with rich nutrients, and either NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, promoted strain ZRK32 growth. Moreover, the presence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> induced strain ZRK32 to release a bacteriophage in a chronic manner— a process that does not kill the host cell (i.e., the host bacteria continues to grow despite phage reproduction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). This bacteriophage reprogrammed strain ZRK32, and another marine bacterium we studied, to metabolize nitrogen through the action of auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs).</p>

<title>Isolation, morphology, and phylogenetic analysis of a novel strain of <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> isolated from a deep-sea cold seep</title>
<p>We enriched deep-sea <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria using a basal medium supplemented with rifampicin and inorganic nitrogen sources (NaNO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl). These enriched samples were plated on to agar slants in Hungate tubes, and then colonies with distinct morphologies were selected and cultivated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Some colonies were noted to be from the phylum <italic>Planctomycetes</italic>, based on their 16S rRNA sequences. Among these, strain ZRK32 was selected for further study as it grew faster than other strains. Following negative staining and TEM observation, we observed that strain ZRK32 cells were spherical (with an average diameter of 0.4-1.0 µm), and had a single polar flagellum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, we found that the mother and daughter cells of strain ZRK32 had distinct sizes at the stage of cell division (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Figure S1), indicating that strain ZRK32 was dividing asymmetrically (i.e., through budding). Ultrathin whole-cell sections showed that strain ZRK32 possessed a condensed and intact nucleoid-like structure, and a complex extended membrane structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on the 16S rRNA sequence of strain ZRK32, a sequence similarity calculation using the NCBI server indicated that the closest relatives of strain ZRK32 were <italic>Poriferisphaera corsica</italic> KS4<sup>T</sup> (98.06%), <italic>Algisphaera agarilytica</italic> 06SJR6-2<sup>T</sup> (88.04%), <italic>Phycisphaera mikurensis</italic> NBRC 102666<sup>T</sup> (85.28%), and <italic>Tepidisphaera mucosa</italic> 2842<sup>T</sup> (82.94%). Recently, the taxonomic threshold for species based on 16S rRNA gene sequence identity value was 98.65% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these criteria, we proposed that strain ZRK32 might be a novel representative of the genus <italic>Poriferisphaera</italic>. In addition, to clarify the phylogenetic position of strain ZRK32, the genome relatedness values were calculated by the average nucleotide identity (ANI), the tetranucleotide signatures (Tetra), and <italic>in silico</italic> DNA-DNA similarity (<italic>is</italic>DDH), against the genomes of strains ZRK32 and KS4. The ANIb, ANIm, Tetra, and <italic>is</italic>DDH values were 72.89%, 85.34%, 0.97385, and 20.90%, respectively (Table S1). These results together demonstrated the strain ZRK32 genome to be obviously below established ‘cut-off’ values (ANIb: 95%, ANIm: 95%, Tetra: 0.99, <italic>is</italic>DDH: 70%) for defining bacterial species, suggesting strain ZRK32 represents a novel strain within the genus <italic>Poriferisphaera</italic>.</p>
<p>To further confirm the taxonomy of strain ZRK32, we performed phylogenetic analyses. The maximum likelihood tree of 16S rRNA indicated that strain ZRK32 was from the genus <italic>Poriferisphaera</italic> and that it formed an independent phyletic line with strain <italic>Poriferisphaera corsica</italic> KS4<sup>T</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The genome tree also suggested that this novel clade was a sister-strain of strain KS4<sup>T</sup>, which belongs to the genus <italic>Poriferisphaera</italic> (Figure S2). Based on its genomic (Figure S3 and Table S1), physiological (Figure S4) and phylogenetic characteristics, strain ZRK32 was distinguishable from strain <italic>Poriferisphaera corsica</italic> KS4<sup>T</sup>, which is currently the only species of the genus <italic>Poriferisphaera</italic> with a validly published name. We therefore propose that strain ZRK32 represents a novel species in the genus <italic>Poriferisphaera</italic>, for which the name <italic>Poriferisphaera heterotrophicis</italic> sp. nov. is proposed.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Rich nutrients promote <italic>P. heterotrophicis</italic> ZRK32 growth</title>
<p>The growth rate of strain ZRK32 increased when it was cultured in a rich medium (containing ten times more yeast extract than basal medium) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To gain further insight into its metabolic characteristics, we performed transcriptomic analyses of strain ZRK32 grown in the rich medium and strain ZRK32 grown in the basal medium. The results showed that the expression of many genes involved in the TCA cycle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C) and the EMP glycolysis pathway (Figure S5A, B) (which both contribute to energy production) were up-regulated. In addition, the expression of genes encoding NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase and flagellum assembly-related proteins were also up-regulated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, E). To verify the transcriptomic data, we performed qRT-PCR assays, which showed the same gene expression variation, consistent with the transcriptomic results (Figure S6). Based on the combined results of the growth assay and transcriptomic analyses, we concluded that strain ZRK32 growth is better when cultured using nutrient-rich medium.</p>

<title><italic>P. heterotrophicis</italic> ZRK32 replicates using a budding mode of division</title>
<p>After reviewing more than 600 TEM photos, we confirmed that strain ZRK32 divided by budding —a method also reported in other <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Figure S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wiegand et al., 2020b</xref>). Remarkably, during the early stages of budding in strain ZRK32, the extracellular membrane extended and formed a bulge, which grew until it was a similar size to the mother cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B, panels 1 to 4). The genetic materials within the nucleoid then duplicated and divided equally between the mother and daughter cells, along with other cytoplasmic contents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B, panels 5 to 8). The daughter cell then separated from the mother cell, completing cell division.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether genes associated with budding method of cell division were present in the genome of strain ZRK32, and whether they were functional during bacterial growth. We performed genomic and transcriptomic analyses of strain ZRK32. We did not detect the cell division protein, FtsZ, in strain ZRK32, but we did identify other Fts-related proteins (e.g., FtsJ, FtsK, FtsL, FtsW, FtsX and FtsY) and rod shape-determining proteins (MreB, MreC and MreD); the expressions of genes encoding these Fts-related proteins were upregulated in the ZRK32 strains cultured in the rich medium compared with strains cultured in basal medium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> on <italic>P. heterotrophicis</italic> ZRK32 growth</title>
<p>As <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria are involved in nitrogen cycling, we tested the effects of different nitrogen-containing substances (including NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) on strain ZRK32 growth. These assays showed that adding NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to the culture medium increased strain ZRK32 growth, while adding NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibited growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The concentration of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> decreased from ∼21 mM to ∼6 mM, and then to ∼4 mM after strain ZRK32 had been incubating for four days and six days, respectively. The concentration of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> increased from ∼0 mM to ∼11 mM, and then to ∼7 mM after strain ZRK32 had been incubating for four days and six days, respectively. These results strongly suggest that strain ZRK32 can effectively convert NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, when strain ZRK32 was incubated in the rich medium supplemented with NH <sup>+</sup> for four days and six days, the concentration of NH <sup>+</sup> decreased from ∼19 mM to ∼11 mM, and then to ∼4 mM, with no change in the concentrations of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). To investigate nitrogen metabolism in strain ZRK32, we analyzed the strain ZRK32 genome and found that it contained a complete nitrate reduction pathway and key genes responsible for the conversion of ammonia to glutamate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), which explains the results in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figures 4B</xref> and C. Subsequently, we performed transcriptome sequencing analysis and found that the genes encoding nitrate reductase (NapA and NapB), nitrite reductase (NirB), glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase were all simultaneously up-regulated in the presence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. We also found that the genes encoding glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase were up-regulated in the presence of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). However, no differential expression was observed for the gene, <italic>nirD</italic> in the presence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, even though this gene encodes a nitrite reductase. Moreover, we observed that some genes involved in the TCA cycle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), the EMP glycolysis pathway (Figure S5C), and genes encoding NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase-related proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) were upregulated in the presence of NO <sup>-</sup> or NH <sup>+</sup>, but down-regulated in the presence of NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>. We also observed that the expressions of many genes associated with flagellum assembly were up-regulated when NO <sup>-</sup> or NH <sup>+</sup> were supplemented into the culture medium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). We observed similar trends in our qRT-PCR results (Figure S7), which validated our RNA-seq results.</p>

<title>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> induce the release of a chronic bacteriophage in <italic>P. heterotrophicis</italic> strain ZRK32</title>
<p>Bacteriophages are widely distributed across oceans and can regulate nitrogen metabolism in their host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cassman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Monier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gazitúa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore investigated whether bacteriophages affected nitrogen metabolism in strain ZRK32. TEM observations showed that phage-like structures (hexagonal phages, ∼30 nm) were present in cell suspensions of the ZRK32 strain that had been cultured using nutrient-rich medium supplemented with either NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, panels II and III). In contrast, no phage-like structures were observed in the cell suspensions of ZRK32 strain that was cultured in the rich medium alone (without NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, panel I). This suggests that the presence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> stimulated the release of the bacteriophages from strain ZRK32. Most chronic bacteriophages do not negatively affect their host’s growth when cultivated in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alarcón-Schumacher et al., 2022</xref>). Consistently, the replication and release of the bacteriophages from strain ZRK32 did not kill the host cell, consistent well with the key feature of chronic bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Howard-Varona et al., 2017</xref>). By comparing genomic sequences, we confirmed that the genome of the phage induced by NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was the same as the phage induced by NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. When we compared this phage genome (Phage-ZRK32, 21.9 kb) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) with the host genome (strain ZRK32) (using Galaxy Version 2.6.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/">https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afgan et al., 2018</xref>) with the NCBI BLASTN method), we found that the Phage-ZRK32 genome was outside of the host chromosome; this indicates that this chronic bacteriophage is extrachromosomal, which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chevallereau et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to the genes encoding phage-associated proteins, the genome of Phage-ZRK32 also has many auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), which encode glutamine amidotransferase, amidoligase, glutathione synthase, and gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Although, some genes (including genes encoding amidoligase, glutathione synthase and gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase) were absent from the strain ZRK32 genome.</p>

<p>To verify whether these AMGs were functional, we investigated whether Phage-ZRK32 was capable of reprogramming nitrogen metabolism and promoting growth in other marine bacteria. We selected the aerobic marine bacterium, <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), and examined the effects of Phage-ZRK32 on its growth. This showed that Phage-ZRK32 promoted <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 growth by facilitating the metabolism and utilization of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, D). In particular, adding Phage-ZRK32 and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> into the oligotrophic medium resulted in an approximate 3–8-fold increase in growth compared with strains cultivated without NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> or Phage-ZRK32 supplementation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The AMGs that encode amidoligase and gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase were absent from the <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 genome, even though it contains a complete nitrate reduction pathway and some genes responsible for converting ammonia to glutamate. Therefore, the Phage-ZRK32 AMGs might facilitate nitrogen metabolism and amino acid generation in <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 in a similar way to <italic>P. heterotrophicis</italic> ZRK32.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Until recently, most research on <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> has focused on strains in freshwater and shallow ocean environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bondoso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kallscheuer et al., 2020b</xref>), with few studies on deep-sea strains; this is likely due to the logistical difficulties associated with sampling and cultivating these strains. The availability of cultured and characterized representatives for many phylogenetic clades within the phylum <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> are lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dedysh et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, more approaches and media types, like those used in our study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), should be developed to obtain <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria from different deep-sea environments. The vast majority of <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> members have been isolated using an oligotrophic medium supplemented with N-acetyl glucosamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kaboré et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kallscheuer et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Peeters et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Salbreiter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wiegand et al., 2020a</xref>); use of this medium previously resulted in the breakthrough isolation of 79 <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wiegand et al., 2020b</xref>). However, we observed that strains of <italic>P. heterotrophicis</italic> ZRK32 grew much better when cultivated in a rich medium compared with strains cultivated in the basal medium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We also found that <italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucosamine did not stimulate the growth of strain ZRK32. These findings have revealed that strain ZRK32 prefers a nutrient-rich medium, which is different from most other <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wiegand et al., 2020b</xref>).</p>
<p>Notably, when growing in the rich medium, the expressions of most genes involved in the TCA cycle and EMP glycolysis pathway in strain ZRK32 were upregulated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-D</xref>, Figure S5B, and Figure S6), suggesting that strain ZRK32 might function through the complete TCA metabolic pathway and EMP glycolysis pathway to obtain energy for growth (Figure S8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zheng et al., 2021b</xref>). Consistent with the presence of EMP glycolysis pathway in strain ZRK32, we found that it could use a variety of sugars including glucose, maltose, fructose, isomaltose, galactose, D-mannose, and rhamnose (Table S2). As for the presence of TCA cycle in the anaerobic strain ZRK32, we propose that it might use other alternative electron acceptors (such as sulfate reducers, nitrate reducers, iron reducers, etc) in place of oxygen for the TCA cycle, as shown in other anaerobic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alteri et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Strain ZRK32 possesses a condensed and intact nucleoid-like structure and a complex membrane structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), which is similar to other reported <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kaushik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dedysh et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, TEM observation of ultrathin sections of cells from strain ZRK32 showed some eukaryote-like structures (Figure S9, panels 1 to 6). Although it is impossible to judge accurately what these structures are based on current methods, the internal structures of <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria are nevertheless fascinating. We also observed some vesicle-like (Figure S9, panels 7 to 8) and vacuole-like structures (Figure S9, panel 9) in strain ZRK32, similar to those observed in other <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>). Vacuoles store cellular components (such as proteins and sugars etc.,) and play essential roles in plant responses to different biotic/abiotic signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The presence of vacuoles in strain ZRK32 suggests that <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria might have adopted a eukaryotic mechanism for nutrient metabolism and signal transduction.</p>
<p>Most species within the class <italic>Planctomycetia</italic> divide by budding, and species within the class <italic>Phycisphaerae</italic> divide by binary fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fukunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yoon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kovaleva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kallscheuer et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pradel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Salbreiter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Wiegand et al., 2020b</xref>). However, the <italic>Poriferisphaera</italic> strain ZRK32 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Figure S1) was demonstrated to divide by budding, similar to the <italic>Poriferisphaera</italic> strain KS4 proposed by Kallscheuer et <italic>al</italic> (2020) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kallscheuer et al., 2020b</xref>), suggesting that members within the class <italic>Phycisphaerae</italic> might divide through both binary fission and budding. It is noteworthy that <italic>P. heterotrophicis</italic> ZRK32 forms an empty cell framework first, followed by the entry of the cellular contents (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B), which is different from the typical budding mode observed in yeast, where the cellular framework and contents both extend simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Herskowitz, 1988</xref>). During microbial cell division, members of the Fts family of proteins (tubulin homologs) usually assemble at the future site of cell division, forming a contractile ring known as the Z ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>). We observed that the expressions of numerous Fts-related proteins (FtsJ, FtsK, FtsL, FtsW, FtsX, and FtsY) in strain ZRK32 were upregulated when the strain had been cultivated in the rich medium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the FtsZ protein was absent from strain ZRK32, which is consistent with the proposal that the <italic>ftsZ</italic> gene is absent from <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jogler et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we also found that some genes that encoded rod shape-determining proteins (MreB, MreC, and MreD) were present in strain ZRK32, and that their expressions were upregulated in the strains cultivated in the rich medium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). MreB, usually participates in the formation and degradation of peptidoglycan, which ultimately determines bacterial cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rohs and Bernhardt, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria are major players in the global nitrogen cycling and perform important reactions, such as the anaerobic ammonium oxidation process that oxidizes NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> to N<sub>2</sub> gas, using NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> as an electron acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Strous et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Oshiki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wiegand et al., 2018</xref>). To date, most studies on anaerobic ammonium oxidation have been related to the monophyletic group (<italic>Candidatus</italic> Brocadiae) in the phylum <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Strous et al., 1999</xref>), with only few reports on the process of nitrogen metabolism in other <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria. Here, we found that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> promoted the growth of strain ZRK32, while NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibited its growth (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on our data and results from others, we speculate that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> might act as a terminal electron acceptor in the respiratory electron transport chain of strain ZRK32. In addition, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> might react with the iron-sulfur proteins in strain ZRK32 to form iron-nitric oxide complexes, which then inactivate iron-sulfur enzymes and inhibit the growth of strain ZRK32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reddy et al., 1983</xref>). We speculate that strain ZRK32 converts NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> to NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, C), enabling the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> created to enter the glutamate metabolic pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, E) — a pathway that is closely associated with several processes, including nitrogen metabolism, the TCA cycle, the EMP glycolysis pathway, and amino acid metabolism (Figure S8). Consistently, in the presence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, genes associated with the TCA cycle and the EMP glycolysis pathway were upregulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, Figure S5C and Figure S7). The presence of rich nutrients, and either NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> also stimulated the expression of genes encoding the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>). This complex couples the oxidation of NADH and the reduction of ubiquinone to generate a proton gradient, which is then used for ATP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Reda et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, large number of genes associated with flagellum assembly were also up-regulated in strain ZRK32 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). Flagellum-mediated motility is beneficial for bacteria, not only because it allows them to respond quickly to an ever-changing environment but also because it enables them to seek and acquire nutrients for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zheng et al., 2021a</xref>). Thus, strain ZRK32 might regulate the formation and motility of its flagellum to accelerate the absorption and utilization of nutrients available in its environment.</p>
<p>One of our most exciting results was that NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> could induce the release of a chronic bacteriophage (Phage-ZRK32) from strain ZRK32 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The Phage-ZRK32 was capable of facilitating nitrogen metabolism and amino acid metabolism in strain ZRK32 through the function of AMGs, which incorporate nitrogen into certain amino acids (including glutamate, cysteine and glycine) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Orlowski and Meister, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Mouilleron and Golinelli-Pimpaneau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lu, 2013</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses were performed (Figures S10-13) using AMG amino acid sequences (including amidoligase, glutamine amidotransferase, gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase, and glutathione synthase) from Phage-ZRK32, in addition to the same amino acid sequences from related phages and their bacterial hosts. The results showed that these AMGs may have been acquired from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> via horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Matilla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Consistently, Phage-ZRK32 promoted the growth of a marine <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> bacterium (<italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273) in the presence of either NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, D). Given that the AMGs encoding amidoligase and gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase were absent in the genome of <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273, we speculate that Phage-ZRK32 might promote the growth of <italic>Pseudomonas stutzeri</italic> 273 by facilitating nitrogen metabolism and amino acid generation, as in the <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> strain ZRK32. Most bacteriophage life-cycles are described as a lytic or lysogenic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Du Toit, 2017</xref>). Currently, more attention has been given to the chronic life cycle, where bacterial growth continues despite phage reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hoffmann Berling and Maze, 1964</xref>), and the progeny of these phage particles are released from host cells via extrusion or budding without killing the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Putzrath and Maniloff, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Russel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Marvin et al., 2014</xref>). Undoubtedly, Phage-ZRK32, which was induced by either NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> strain ZRK32, is a chronic bacteriophage. Moreover, it has recently been reported that the tailless <italic>Caudoviricetes</italic> phage particles are enclosed in lipid membrane and are released from the host cells by a nonlytic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), and the prophage induction contributes to the production of membrane vesicles by <italic>Lacticaseibacillus casei</italic> BL23 during cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">da Silva Barreira et al., 2022</xref>). Considering that strain ZRK32 has a large number of membrane vesicles during cell growth (Figure S9), we speculated that Phage-ZRK32 might be a membrane vesicle-engulfed phage and its release should be related to membrane vesicles. Altogether, our findings provide a novel insight into nitrogen metabolism in <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> bacteria and provide a suitable model to study the interactions between <italic>Planctomycetes</italic> and viruses.</p>

The medium was prepared under a 100% N<sub>2</sub> gas phase and sterilized by autoclaving at 115 °C for 30 minutes; following this, rifampicin (100 µg/mL) was added. The inoculated media were anaerobically incubated at either 4 °C or 28 °C for one month. The basal medium supplemented with 1.0 g/L NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 1.0 g/L NaNO<sub>3</sub>, and 15 g/L agar was evenly spread on to the inside wall of a Hungate tube, which formed a thin layer of medium for the bacteria to grow. After this, 50 µL of the enriched culture was anaerobically transferred into an anaerobic roll tube and then spread on to the medium layer. These tubes were also anaerobically cultured at either 4 °C or 28 °C for ten days. Single colonies growing at 28 °C were selected using sterilized bamboo sticks; they were then cultured in the 15 mL Hungate tube containing 10 mL basal medium (supplemented with 1.0 g/L NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and 1.0 g/L NaNO<sub>3</sub>) at 28 °C for seven days under a 100% N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. One strain was identified as a member of the phylum <italic>Planctomycetes</italic>, but was noted to have less than 98% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to other cultured strains; this strain was therefore selected to be cultivated. Strain ZRK32 was selected and purified by repeating the Hungate roll-tube method. The purity of strain ZRK32 was confirmed regularly by observation using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and by repeating partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. As strain ZRK32 grew slowly in basal medium, we used a rich culture medium (10.0 g/L yeast extract, 20.0 g/L NaCl, 1.0 g/L CH<sub>3</sub>COONa, 1.0 g/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 g/L KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2 g/L MgSO<sub>4</sub>.7H<sub>2</sub>O, 0.7 g/L cysteine hydrochloride, 500 µL/L 0.1 % (w/v) resazurin, 1.0 L sterilized distilled water, pH 7.0).</p>

<title>TEM observation</title>
<p>To observe the morphological characteristics of strain ZRK32, 10 mL culture was collected by centrifuging at 5000 × <italic>g</italic> for ten minutes. Cells were then washed three times with PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 L sterile water, pH 7.4). Finally, the cells were suspended in 20 μL PBS buffer, and then transferred onto copper grids coated with a carbon film by immersing the grids in the cell suspension for 30 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zheng et al., 2021b</xref>). To observe the ultrastructure of strain ZRK32, ultrathin-sections were prepared using methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Graham and Orenstein, 2007</xref>). Briefly, 500 mL of cells (cultured for six days at 28 °C) were collected by centrifuging at 5000 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 minutes, and then washing three times with PBS buffer. The cells were then preserved in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde for 12 hours at 4LJ°C and then dehydrated using different ethanol concentrations (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%) for ten minutes each time. The cells were then embedded in a plastic resin. Finally, 50-70 nm ultrathin sections were produced using an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC7, Germany) and then stained using uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All samples were examined under TEM (HT7700, Hitachi, Japan).</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis</title>
<p>To construct a maximum likelihood 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree, the full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences of strain ZRK32 and other related taxa were extracted from their corresponding genomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>). The maximum likelihood genome phylogenetic tree was constructed from a concatenated alignment of 37 protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wu et al., 2013</xref>) (extracted from the genomes using Phylosift v1.0.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Darling et al., 2014</xref>); all genes were present in a single copy and were universally distributed in both archaea and bacteria (Table S3). The reference sequences of four AMGs encoding amidoligase, glutamine amidotransferase, gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase, and glutathione synthase were retrieved by blasting the phage gene against the entire NCBI database, respectively. All phylogenetic trees were constructed using the W-IQ-TREE web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at">http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Trifinopoulos et al., 2016</xref>) using the “GTR+F+I+G4” model, and the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL v5) online tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Letunic and Bork, 2021</xref>) was used to edit the phylogenetic trees.</p>

<title>Growth assays of strain ZRK32</title>
<p>To assess the effects of nutrient-rich media on strain ZRK32 growth, we set up different cultures using either rich medium or basal medium. To assess the effects of different inorganic nitrogen sources (20 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and 20 mM NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) on strain ZRK32 growth, we used a rich culture medium supplemented with the nitrogen sources mentioned above. For each growth assay, 15LJmL of strain ZRK32 culture was inoculated in a 2LJL Hungate bottle containing 1.5LJL of the respective media. All Hungate bottles were anaerobically incubated at 28LJ°C. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring daily OD<sub>600</sub> values via a microplate reader until cell growth reached a stationary phase. Three replicates were performed for each condition. The concentrations of NO <sup>-</sup>, NH <sup>+</sup>, and NO <sup>-</sup> were determined using a continuous flow analyzer (SKALAR-SAN++, Netherlands), which has an analytical precision of 6%.</p>

<title>Transcriptomics</title>
<p>For transcriptomic sequencing, strains of ZRK32 were cultured in 1.5 L of either basal medium, rich medium, or rich medium supplemented with different nitrogen sources (20 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, or 20 mM NO <sup>-</sup>) at 28LJ°C for six days. Three biological replicates were cultured for each condition. Following this, cells from the three replicates were mixed and then collected for transcriptomic sequencing by Novogene (Tianjin, China), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zheng et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zheng et al., 2022</xref>).

<title>Isolation of bacteriophages</title>
<p>Isolation of the bacteriophages was performed using similar methods to those described previously, but with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yamamoto et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Tseng et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Blaschek, 1991</xref>). Strain ZRK32 was inoculated in either rich medium, or rich medium supplemented with 20 mM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> or 20 mM NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and then incubated at 28LJ°C for six days. Different cultures were collected by centrifuging at 8000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 20 minutes; this was repeated three times. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm millipore filter (Pall Supor, USA), and then 1 M NaCl was added to lyse the residual bacteria. The supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 8000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 20 minutes. The phage particles were immediately precipitated with 100 g/L polyethylene glycol (PEG8000) at 4 °C for two hours, and collected by centrifuging at 10000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 20 minutes. The phage particles were then suspended in SM buffer (0.01% gelatin, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>). The suspension was then extracted three times using an equal volume of chloroform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lin et al., 2012</xref>) and collected by centrifuging at 4000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 20 minutes.

<p>The authors isolated a novel marine Planctomycetes bacterium with unique characteristics using a budding mode of division from the deep-sea cold seep sediment and named it Poriferisphaera heterotrophicis ZRK32. This work demonstrated that strain ZRK32 preferred nutrient-rich medium, moreover, the addition of nitrate or ammonia promoted the growth of strain ZRK32 and further caused the release of bacteriophage without killing the host. These results are interesting, well presented and documented in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors of the manuscript cultivated a Planctomycetes strain affiliated with Phycisphaerae. The strain was one of the few Planctomycetes from deep-sea environments and demonstrated several unique characteristics, such as being the only known Phycisphaerae using a budding mode of division, extensive involvement in nitrate assimilation, and being able to release phage particles without cell death. The manuscript is generally well-written. However, a few issues need to be more clearly addressed, especially regarding the identification and characterization of the phage.</p>

<p>Response: Thanks for your suggestion. We added the key statistics of strain ZRK32 and KS4, and described as “Based on the 16S rRNA sequence of strain ZRK32, a sequence similarity calculation using the NCBI server indicated that the closest relatives of strain ZRK32 were Poriferisphaera corsica KS4T (98.06%), Algisphaera agarilytica 06SJR6-2T (88.04%), Phycisphaera mikurensis NBRC 102666T (85.28%), and Tepidisphaera mucosa 2842T (82.94%). Recently, the taxonomic threshold for species based on 16S rRNA gene sequence identity value was 98.65% (Kim et al., 2014). Based on these criteria, we proposed that strain ZRK32 might be a novel representative of the genus Poriferisphaera. In addition, to clarify the phylogenetic position of strain ZRK32, the genome relatedness values were calculated by the average nucleotide identity (ANI), the tetranucleotide signatures (Tetra), and in silico DNA-DNA similarity (isDDH), against the genomes of strains ZRK32 and KS4. The ANIb, ANIm, Tetra, and isDDH values were 72.89%, 85.34%, 0.97385, and 20.90%, respectively (Table S1). These results together demonstrated the strain ZRK32 genome to be obviously below established ‘cut-off’ values (ANIb: 95%, ANIm: 95%, Tetra: 0.99, isDDH: 70%) for defining bacterial species, suggesting strain ZRK32 represents a novel strain within the genus Poriferisphaera.” in the revised manuscript (Lines 124-139).</p>

<p>Response: Thanks for your valuable comments. We carefully read these two papers and found that phage ZRK32 is most likely a membrane vesicle-engulfed phage. We added the corresponding description as “Moreover, it has recently been reported that the tailless Caudoviricetes phage particles are enclosed in lipid membrane and are released from the host cells by a nonlytic mechanism (Liu et al., 2022), and the prophage induction contributes to the production of membrane vesicles by Lacticaseibacillus casei BL23 during cell growth (da Silva Barreira et al., 2022). Considering that strain ZRK32 has a large number of membrane vesicles during cell growth (Figure S9), we speculated that Phage-ZRK32 might be a membrane vesicle-engulfed phage and its release should be related to membrane vesicles.” in the revised manuscript (Lines 381-388).</p>

<p>1. While EMP glycolysis is predicted to be involved in energy conservation, no experimental evidence indicated any sugar utilization by the bacterium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thanks for your comments. We have previously tested the sugar utilization of strain ZRK32, and now added this description as “Consistent with the presence of EMP glycolysis pathway in strain ZRK32, we found that it could use a variety of sugars including glucose, maltose, fructose, isomaltose, galactose, D-mannose, and rhamnose (Table S2).” in the revised manuscript (Lines 281-284).</p>

<p>1. &quot;anaerobic representative&quot; is indicated in the Title, the contrary, TCA in energy metabolism is predicted by the bacterium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thanks for your valuable comments. Currently, anaerobic microorganisms can use other alternative electron acceptors (such as sulfate reducers, nitrate reducers, iron reducers, etc) in place of oxygen for the TCA cycle. For example, Proteus mirabilis uses the whole oxidative TCA cycle without using oxygen as the final electron acceptor when it performs multicellular swarming (Alteri et al., 2012). In this study, all the genes involved in the TCA cycle were present in anaerobic strain ZRK32 and most of them are upregulated, thus we speculate that it might function through the complete TCA metabolic pathway to obtain energy. We added the related description as “Notably, when growing in the rich medium, the expressions of most genes involved in the TCA cycle and EMP glycolysis pathway in strain ZRK32 were upregulated (Figure 2B-D, Figure S5B and Figure S6), suggesting that strain ZRK32 might function through the complete TCA metabolic pathway and EMP glycolysis pathway to obtain energy for growth (Figure S8) (Zheng et al., 2021b). Consistent with the presence of EMP glycolysis pathway in strain ZRK32, we found that it could use a variety of sugars including glucose, maltose, fructose, isomaltose, galactose, D-mannose, and rhamnose (Table S2). As for the presence of TCA cycle in the anaerobic strain ZRK32, we propose that it might use other alternative electron acceptors (such as sulfate reducers, nitrate reducers, iron reducers, etc) in place of oxygen for the TCA cycle, as shown in other anaerobic bacteria (Alteri et al., 2012).” in the revised manuscript (Lines 277-287).</p>

<p>1. The possible mechanisms of the chronic phage release without breaking the host are not discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Thanks for your valuable comments. The possible mechanism of the chronic phage release without breaking the host might be that it was enclosed in lipid membrane and released from the host cells by a nonlytic mechanism. We added the corresponding description as “Moreover, it has recently been reported that the tailless Caudoviricetes phage particles are enclosed in lipid membrane and are released from the host cells by a nonlytic mechanism (Liu et al., 2022), and the prophage induction contributes to the production of membrane vesicles by Lacticaseibacillus casei BL23 during cell growth (da Silva Barreira et al., 2022).
