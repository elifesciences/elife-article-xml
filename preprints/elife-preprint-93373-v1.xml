<title>Abstract</title><p>Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Intriguingly, there is a subset of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals who are seemingly able to maintain a healthy metabolic profile free of metabolic syndrome. The molecular underpinnings of MHO, however, are not well understood. Here, we report that CTRP10/C1QL2-deficient mice represent a unique female model of MHO. CTRP10 modulates weight gain in a striking and sexually dimorphic manner. Female, but not male, mice lacking CTRP10 develop obesity with age on a low-fat diet while maintaining an otherwise healthy metabolic profile. When fed an obesogenic diet, female <italic>Ctrp10</italic> knockout (KO) mice show rapid weight gain. Despite pronounced obesity, <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice do not develop steatosis, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, or low-grade inflammation. Obesity is largely uncoupled from metabolic dysregulation in female KO mice. Multi-tissue transcriptomic analyses highlighted gene expression changes and pathways associated with insulin-sensitive obesity. Transcriptional correlation of the differentially expressed gene (DEG) orthologous in humans also show sex differences in gene connectivity within and across metabolic tissues, underscoring the conserved sex-dependent function of CTRP10. Collectively, our findings suggest that CTRP10 negatively regulates body weight in females, and that loss of CTRP10 results in benign obesity with largely preserved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. This female MHO mouse model is valuable for understanding sex-biased mechanisms that uncouple obesity from metabolic dysfunction.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The prevalence of obesity has nearly tripled in the past four decades and the underlying cause is complex and multifactorial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Genetics, environmental and social factors, and demographics all play a contributing role in contributing to excessive weight gain in the setting of overnutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Although obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension, not all obese individuals develop the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). There is a subset of metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals with an apparently healthy metabolic profile free of some or most components of the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The molecular and physiological underpinnings of MHO are, however, not well understood. Novel preclinical animal models that can recapitulate features of MHO will be valuable in illuminating pathways that resist the deleterious effects of obesity and provide new therapeutic avenues to mitigate obesity-linked comorbidities.</p>
<p>The mechanisms that normally maintain body weight and metabolic homeostasis are complex and involve both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms. Tissue crosstalk mediated by paracrine and endocrine factors plays an especially important role in coordinating metabolic processes across organ systems to maintain energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Of the secretory proteins that circulate in plasma, C1q/TNF-related proteins (CTRP1-15) have emerged as important regulators of insulin sensitivity, and glucose and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). We originally identified the first seven members of the CTRP family based on shared sequence homology to the insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), and subsequently characterized additional members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). All fifteen CTRPs share a common C-terminal globular C1q domain and are part of the much larger C1q family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The use of gain- and loss-of- function mouse models has helped establish CTRP’s role in controlling various aspects of sugar and fat metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Additional diverse functions of CTRPs have also been demonstrated in the cardiovascular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), renal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), immune (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), sensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), gastrointestinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), musculoskeletal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>), and the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the family members, CTRP10 (also known as C1QL2) is understudied and consequently only limited information is available concerning its function. The best characterized role of CTRP10 is in the central nervous system (CNS). It has been shown that CTRP10 secreted from mossy fibers is required for the proper clustering of kainite-type glutamate receptors on postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). It serves as a transsynaptic organizer by directly binding to neurexin3 (Nrx3) on the presynaptic terminals, and to GluK2 and GluK4 on the postsynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Additional putative roles of CTRP10 in the CNS have also been suggested. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated CTRP10/C1QL2 in cocaine use disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). In rat models of depression, <italic>Ctrp10</italic> expression is increased in the dentate gyrus and reduced in the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). In humans with a history of psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia), the expression of <italic>CTRP10</italic> is elevated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). Whether and how CTRP10 contributes to addictive behavior and psychiatric disorders is unknown.</p>
<p>The potential function of CTRP10 in peripheral tissues, however, is essentially unknown and unexplored. The present study was motivated by the well documented metabolic functions of many CTRP family members we have characterized to date using genetic loss-of-function mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). We determined that the expression of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> in peripheral tissues is modulated by diet and nutritional states, and thus may have a metabolic role. We therefore used a genetic loss-of-function mouse model to determine if CTRP10 is required for regulating systemic metabolism. We unexpectedly discovered a female-specific requirement of CTRP10 for body weight control. We showed that the <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO mice represent a unique female model of MHO with largely preserved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. This valuable mouse model can be used to inform sex-dependent mechanisms that uncouple obesity from insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and metabolic dysfunction.</p>

<title>Nutritional regulation of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> expression in the brain and peripheral tissues</title>
<p>CTRP10 protein is highly conserved from zebrafish to human (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), with amino acid identity of 67%, 71%, 77%, and 94% between the full-length human protein and the fish, frog, chicken, and mouse orthologs, respectively. The conservation is much higher at the C-terminal globular C1q domain (93-100% identity) between the orthologs. Among the 12 different mouse tissue examined, brain had the highest expression of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Expression of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> in peripheral tissues was variable and generally much lower than in the brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We first determined whether <italic>Ctrp10</italic> expression is modulated by nutrition and metabolic state. Male mice were subjected to fasting and refeeding. In the refed period after an overnight fast, we observed a significant downregulation of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> in the visceral (gonadal) white adipose tissue (gWAT), liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, cerebellum, cortex, and hypothalamus relative to the fasted state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Next, we examined whether an obesogenic diet alters the expression of <italic>Ctrp10</italic>. Male mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks had a modest increase in <italic>Ctrp10</italic> expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and heart and decreased expression in skeletal muscle relative to mice fed a control low-fat diet (LFD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). These data indicate that <italic>Ctrp10</italic> expression is dynamically regulated by acute alterations in energy balance, and perhaps to a lesser extent in alterations to chronic nutritional state on an obesogenic diet.</p>

<title>Generation of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> knockout (KO) mice</title>
<p>We used mice lacking CTRP10 to address whether this secreted protein has a metabolic role in vivo. The mouse <italic>Ctrp10</italic> gene consists of two exons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). The CRISPR-Cas9 method was used to remove the entire protein coding region spanning exon 1 and 2, thus ensuring a complete null allele (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). The targeted allele was confirmed by sequencing. As expected, based on the gene deletion strategy, the <italic>Ctrp10</italic> transcript was absent from KO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>

<title>CTRP10 is largely dispensable for metabolic homeostasis in young mice fed a control low-fat diet</title>
<p>The body weight and body composition of male mice fed a LFD were not different between genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>). By 20 weeks of age, female KO mice fed LFD had a modestly higher body weight relative to WT controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> C), though the body composition was not different between genotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).

Because <italic>Ctrp10</italic> expression is regulated by nutritional states (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), we assessed serum metabolite levels in WT and KO mice in response to fasting and refeeding. No significant differences in fasting and refeeding blood glucose, serum insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA), and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were observed between genotypes of either sex, except the female KO mice had slightly lower fasting β-hydroxybutyrate levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). We performed glucose and insulin tolerance tests to determine any potential differences in glucose handling capacity and insulin sensitivity. No significant differences in glucose and insulin tolerance were noted between genotypes of either sex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-F</xref>). Together, these data indicate that CTRP10 is dispensable for metabolic homeostasis when mice are young (&lt; 20 weeks old) and fed a LFD.</p>

<title>CTRP10-deficient female mice on a low-fat diet develop obesity with age</title>
<p>Because female KO mice were slightly heavier at 20 weeks of age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), we suspected the weight may diverge further with age. Consequently, we monitored the body weight of female mice fed LFD over an extended period. Indeed, the female KO mice gained significantly more weight and adiposity with age (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). Consistent with greater adiposity, the adipocyte cell size (cross-sectional area) was also significantly larger in both gonadal (visceral) white adipose tissue (gWAT) and inguinal (subcutaneous) white adipose tissue (iWAT) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref>). By the time the mice reached 40 weeks of age, female KO mice weighed ∼ 6 g (20 %) heavier than the WT controls. Increased weight gain over time was not attributed to differences in food intake, as measured manually over a 24 h period (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Fecal output, frequency, and energy content were also not different between genotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>), suggesting that weight gain was not due to greater nutrient absorption. Deep colon temperatures in both light and dark cycle were also not different between genotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). Indirectly calorimetry analyses also revealed no significant differences between genotypes in food intake, physical activity, and energy expenditure across the circadian cycle and metabolic states (<italic>ad libitum</italic> fed, fasted, refed) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I-K</xref>). Despite significantly greater body weight and adiposity, female KO mice had the same metabolic profile as the lean WT controls. There were no differences in fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, NEFA, and β-hydroxybutyrate levels between genotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>). Interestingly, VLDL-TG levels were lower in female KO mice whereas HDL-cholesterol level was not different between genotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>). Direct assessments of glucose handling capacity and insulin sensitivity by glucose and insulin tolerance tests, respectively, also revealed no differences between genotypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N-O</xref>). Together, these data indicate that <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO female mice fed LFD develop obesity, but preserve a largely healthy metabolic profile similar to the much leaner WT female mice.</p>

<title>Rapid weight gain in CTRP10-deficient female mice fed a high-fat diet</title>
<p>Next, we challenged the mice with a HFD to determine if the sex-dependent effects on body weight become more pronounced. When fed a HFD, body weight gain and body composition were not different between genotypes in male mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>). Food intake, physical activity, and energy expenditure were also not different between genotypes in male mice across the circadian cycle (light and dark) and metabolic states (<italic>ad libitum</italic> fed, fasted, refed) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-E</xref>). In striking contrast, female KO mice gained weight rapidly on HFD (∼9 g or 28% heavier) and had greater adiposity than the WT controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-H</xref>). Surprisingly, food intake, physical activity, and energy expenditure were not significantly different between genotypes in female mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I-K</xref>). The ANCOVA analysis of energy expenditure using body weight as a covariate also did not reveal any differences between genotypes in female mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> L). Interestingly, the respiratory quotient (RER) was significantly lower in female KO mice relative to WT controls, especially during fasting and refeeding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>), suggesting a greater reliance on lipid substrates for energy metabolism during those periods. Together, these data indicate that CTRP10 is required for female-specific body weight control in response to caloric surplus, but neither food intake, physical activity level, nor energy expenditure could account for the marked increase in body weight and adiposity.</p>

<title>Obesity is uncoupled from insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in CTRP10-deficient female mice fed a HFD</title>
<p>We again measured fasting and refeeding responses in WT and <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO mice fed a HFD. No differences in fasting and refeeding blood glucose, serum insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol, NEFA, and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were noted between genotypes in male mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Female KO mice, however, had higher fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels, and lower β-hydroxybutyrate levels compared to the WT controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In the refed state, serum insulin levels continued to be significantly higher in female KO mice.

<p>Consistent with the fasting blood glucose and insulin data, glucose handling capacity and insulin sensitivity assessments by glucose and insulin tolerance in HFD-fed male mice also revealed no differences between genotypes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C-D</xref>). Female KO mice, however, had higher fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels suggesting the presence of mild insulin resistance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). We therefore expected to see differences in either glucose and/or insulin tolerance tests. To our surprise, the rate of glucose clearance in response to glucose or insulin injection was virtually identical between WT and KO female mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-F</xref>), suggesting no difference in insulin sensitivity between genotypes. VLDL-TG and HDL-cholesterol profiles were also indistinguishable between WT and KO female mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that CTRP10 is not required for metabolic homeostasis in male mice challenged with a HFD. In female mice, however, loss of CTRP10 markedly promotes weight gain in the face of caloric surplus, but, paradoxically, the excess adiposity is largely uncoupled from obesity-linked insulin resistance and dysregulated glucose and lipid metabolism.</p>

<p>Obesity is known to be associated with low-grade inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>), fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), and ER and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Despite marked differences in body weight and adiposity, the expression of genes associated with inflammation (except for <italic>Ccr2</italic>), fibrosis, oxidative stress in gWAT and iWAT were not significantly different between female KO mice and WT controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). The expression of some genes associated with ER stress (e.g., <italic>Ddit3</italic>/<italic>CHOP</italic>, <italic>Atf4</italic>, <italic>Xbp1</italic>) in iWAT were actually lower in female KO mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>).

<p>The liver weight of female KO mice was modestly increased (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>), but when normalized to body weight it was not significantly different from WT controls (2.76 % in WT and 2.60% in KO, <italic>P</italic> = 0.24). Histological analysis and quantification revealed no differences in hepatic lipid content (% lipid area) between genotypes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>).

<title>Transcriptomic and pathway changes associated with the metabolically healthy obesity phenotype in <italic>Ctrp10</italic> <bold>KO female mice.</bold></title>
<p>To define the specific mechanisms mediating the female-specific effects of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> ablation on favorable metabolic outcomes, four major metabolic tissues (gWAT, iWAT, liver, skeletal muscle) from female WT and KO mice fed a HFD were subjected to RNA-sequencing.

<p>Of the DEGs, we found significant changes across tissues in relevant classes of genes that encode proteins involved in gene expression (e.g., transcription factors), signaling (e.g., receptors), tissue crosstalk (e.g., secreted proteins), and metabolism (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Notably, the nuclear receptor, <italic>Nr1d1</italic> (also known as <italic>Rev-Erbα</italic>), is the only gene consistently suppressed across all four tissues (liver, gWAT, iWAT, and muscle) of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref> lower panel and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). Interestingly, global deletion of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> promotes lipogenesis, adipose tissue expansion, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). Although the whole-body and adipose-specific <italic>Nr1d1</italic> KO mice fed with HFD become markedly obese, the obesity is not accompanied by insulin resistance, adipose tissue inflammation and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). Like the <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice, HFD-fed mice lacking Nr1d1 can maintain a relatively healthy metabolic profile despite being strikingly obese. Since only male mice were used in these previous studies, we do not know whether female mice lacking Nr1d1 would also exhibit similar insulin-sensitive obesity phenotype. In WT mice, Nr1d1 acts as a transcriptional repressor of metabolic genes whose expression are upregulated by high-fat feeding; loss of Nr1d1 is thought to result in the de-repression of these genes, leading to greater lipid synthesis and fat mass accrual in response to caloric excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>). Thus, the suppression of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> expression—mimicking Nr1d1 deficiency—across tissues in HFD-fed <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice may contribute to benign fat mass expansion without the accompanying adipose tissue fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress.</p>

<p>Among the upregulated genes, <italic>Fgf21</italic> and <italic>Fgf1</italic> was significantly elevated in the liver of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). FGF21 is an hepatokine known to improve systemic insulin sensitivity and to promote a favorable metabolic profile in diet-induced obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). Likewise, FGF1 has been shown to dampen hepatic glucose output by suppressing adipose lipolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>), improve systemic insulin sensitivity by reducing adipose inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>), and alleviate hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>). Thus, upregulated expression of <italic>Fgf21</italic> and <italic>Fgf1</italic> in <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice could contribute to the MHO phenotype. In addition, the upregulated hepatic expression of IL-22 receptor (<italic>Il22ra1</italic>) in <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>) may confer protection against obesity-associated fatty liver, inflammation and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>). Further, a marked increase in uncoupling protein 3 (<italic>Ucp3</italic>) and Krüppel-like factor 15 (<italic>Klf15</italic>) expression in the skeletal muscle (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>) may promote lipid utilization and help mitigate lipid-induced insulin resistance in <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>). Taken together, these combined changes—at the level of gene expression and biological pathways and processes across tissues—acting in concert likely contribute to the apparently healthy obesity phenotype seen in the KO female mice.</p>

<title>Conservation of mouse DEG co-correlation in humans highlights sex-specific gene connectivity</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether the female-specific transcriptomic effects across tissues were conserved in humans.

Hierarchical clustering of transcriptional correlation of the orthologous DEGs among 4 metabolic tissues— subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle—showed differing patterns of gene connectivity between females (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10A</xref>) and males (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10B</xref>). When grouped according to sex in each tissue, the degree of sex-specific gene correlation pairs of DEGs orthologues showed the most significant differences in subcutaneous adipose tissue (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10C</xref>). Given the whole-body metabolic effects of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> ablation in mice, we further examined the degree of sex-dependent DEG co-correlation across metabolic tissues.

These analyses highlight the sex-specificity of CTRP10 DEG orthologues in humans, suggest possible sex-biased mechanisms of tissue crosstalk, and overall underscores the conservation of the sex- dependent metabolic function of CTRP10.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our current study has established a novel function for CTRP10 in modulating body weight in a sex-specific manner. When mice were fed a control LFD, female <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO mice developed obesity with age; increased adiposity, however, did not impair insulin action and glucose and lipid metabolism. When challenged with an obesogenic diet, female <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO mice gained weight rapidly. Despite having strikingly higher adiposity and weighing ∼10-11 g (∼28%) more, female KO mice fed a HFD exhibited a metabolic profile largely indistinguishable from the much leaner WT controls. Although female KO mice had higher fasting glucose and insulin levels, direct assessments of glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity by glucose and insulin tolerance tests, however, revealed no differences between genotypes. Except having lower fasting ketone (β-hydroxybutyrate) levels, the fasting lipid profile, as well as VLDL-TG and HDL-cholesterol levels, of <italic>Ctrp10-</italic>KO female mice resembled the WT controls. The hepatic fat content was also comparable between genotypes. Global transcriptomic profiling across different fat depots and liver did not reveal gene expression signatures associated with elevated inflammation, fibrosis, and ER and oxidative stress. Altogether, these findings suggest that CTRP10 deficiency promotes obesity in females but it also uncouples obesity from insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, steatosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Thus, <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO female mice represent a novel model of female obesity with largely preserved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health.</p>
<p>Our findings help inform ongoing studies on metabolically healthy obese (MHO) humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>). Because the criteria used to define MHO differs between studies, there is an ongoing debate regarding the prevalence of MHO and what fraction of the MHO population is insulin-sensitive and metabolically healthy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>). Nevertheless, among the obese individuals, there clearly exists a subgroup that maintains long-term normal insulin sensitivity and does not appear to develop any component of the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). MHO is observed in both sexes, but more common in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The underlying mechanism(s) that uncouple obesity from adverse metabolic health in MHO is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>). It is currently unknown whether males and females with MHO use similar or distinct mechanism to maintain insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. Our findings in <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO female, but not male, mice suggest that there may be female-biased mechanism that prevents metabolic deterioration in the face of obesity, thus underscoring the utility of the <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO mice as a female mouse model of MHO.</p>
<p>Obesity is frequently associated with insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, oxidative stress, and chronic low-grade inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>). The mechanisms that link obesity to metabolic dysfunctions are complex and multifactorial. There are limited number of mouse models described where obesity is uncoupled from insulin resistance and metabolic health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>); in some studies, however, only male mice were used or that the sex of the animals was not specified. In the case of aP2/FABP4 KO male mice, the uncoupling of obesity from insulin resistance was attributed to a marked decrease in TNF<italic>-α</italic> expression in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>). In the case of adiponectin overexpression in leptin-deficient (<italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic>) male and female mice, a dramatic expansion of the subcutaneous fat pad is thought to promote lipid sequestration in adipose compartment, thus preventing ectopic lipid deposition in non-adipose tissues (e.g., liver, pancreas, muscle) that would otherwise induce insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>). Massive obesity with preserved insulin sensitivity is also observed in leptin-deficient (<italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic>) male and female mice overexpressing the mitochondrial membrane protein, mitoNEET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>). The benign obesity is attributed to the inhibition of iron transport into mitochondria by mitoNEET, leading to reduced mitochondrial activity, fatty acid oxidation, and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>). In the Brd2 hypomorphic mice, severe obesity with lower blood glucose and enhanced glucose tolerance is due to a combination of hyperinsulinemia and marked reduction in macrophage infiltration into fat depot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>). Lastly, in male mice fed a high starch diet, uncoupling of obesity from insulin resistance is associated with lower ceramide levels in liver and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>). In all these cases, the uncoupling of obesity from metabolic dysfunction is seen in either male mice only (female mice were not included) or both sexes. These previous studies suggest that multiple mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, can contribute to the MHO phenotype in different mouse models.</p>
<p>In our study, loss of CTRP10 in female mice largely uncoupled obesity from insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, steatosis, inflammation, and ER and oxidative stress. The preservation of insulin sensitivity in <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice is due, at least in part, to the absence of obesity-linked adipose and liver inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress. These phenotypes associated with a favorable metabolic profile are also observed in MHO individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>). A healthy adaptive remodeling of white adipose tissues in response to caloric surfeit helps preserve the storage and secretory function of adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>). The expansion of benign adipose tissues further serves to sequester circulating lipids and prevent their ectopic deposition in non-adipose tissue (e.g., liver and skeletal muscle) which can impair insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>). The MHO phenotype seen in <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO female mice reinforce the notion that adipose tissue health, rather than abundance, is an important determinant of metabolic health in obesity.</p>
<p>Because lipidomic analysis was not performed—a limitation of this study—we do not know whether <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO female mice have reduced ceramide or diacylglycerol levels in liver and skeletal muscle, two lipid species known to antagonize insulin action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>). However, our global transcriptomic and pathway enrichment analysis across visceral and subcutaneous fat depots, liver, and skeletal muscle highlighted the relevant up- and down-regulated pathways and processes (e.g., lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, signaling) that may contribute to the MHO phenotype in <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO female mice. How these changes across tissues help to suppress the deleterious effects of obesity and maintain an apparently healthy metabolic profile in <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO female mice remains to be fully understood. Part of the mechanism may be attributable to the suppression of <italic>Nr1d1</italic> and the upregulated expression of <italic>Fgf1</italic>, <italic>Fgf21</italic>, <italic>Il22ra1</italic>, <italic>Ucp3</italic>, <italic>Klf15</italic>. Altered expression of these genes are known to reduce obesity-linked inflammation, oxidative stress, steatosis, and insulin resistance.</p>
<p>In many single-gene KO mouse models where both sexes are examined, it is often the males that show a more pronounced metabolic phenotype. It is known that C57BL/6 female mice generally gain significantly less weight on HFD compared to male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>). Therefore, it is intriguing that <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO female mice became obese on a control LFD and gained weight rapidly when fed an obesogenic diet. After twelve weeks on HFD, the body weight of female KO mice was approaching that of WT male mice fed the same diet. What mechanism underlies the sexually dimorphic requirement of CTRP10 for body weight control? We know that the obesity phenotype was not attributed to differences in food intake, physical activity level, body temperature, and energy expenditure between WT and KO female mice. We assume that the methods used to quantify these physiologic parameters are sensitive enough to detect small differences that can give rise to divergent body weight over time. Quantification of fecal output and fecal energy content also revealed no differences between genotypes. Thus, loss of CTRP10 did not affect macronutrient intake and absorption. Although we cannot fully rule out the CNS function of CTRP10/C1QL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), our data do not support a central role for CTRP10 in modulating food intake behavior, locomotor activity, and energy expenditure that affect body weight in female mice.</p>
<p>It is known that reduced estrogen level by ovariectomy or blocking estrogen action in estrogen receptor (ERα) KO mice will cause obesity and metabolic dysfunction in female mice fed a HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref>). Conversely, estradiol supplementation decreases HFD-induced weight gain and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref>). Estrogen also has the effect of reducing food intake, and promoting physical activity and energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref>). In our study, loss of CTRP10 promotes obesity without altering food intake, physical activity, and energy expenditure. While estrogen’s role cannot be completely ruled out, the fact that female <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO mice developed obesity with largely preserved metabolic health suggest that factors other than altered estrogen level contribute to the insulin-sensitive obesity phenotype. Future studies are warranted to uncover what factor(s) is causally contributing to obesity in female mice lacking CTRP10.</p>
<p>The sex-dependent effects of CTRP10 on metabolism and tissue transcriptomes appear to be conserved in humans. When the human orthologues of the mouse DEGs were used to interrogate the GTEx data, clear patterns of gene connectivity within and across metabolic tissues in females and males were observed, with the strongest sex-specific gene correlations seen in subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver. These findings provide further evidence that CTRP10 modulates tissue transcriptome in a sex-dependent manner. Further, our analyses of sex-dependent DEG co-correlation across metabolic tissues also suggest possible sex-biased mechanisms of inter-organ metabolic signaling between adipose tissue and liver.</p>
<p>CTRP10 has been previously shown to bind to the adhesion GPCR, brain angiogenesis inhibitor-3 (Bai3/Adgrb3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>). Bai3 is expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues, and it is a promiscuous GPCR that can bind to multiple ligands. In addition to CTRP10 (C1QL2), Bai3 also binds to CTRP11 (C1QL4), CTRP13 (C1QL3), CTRP14 (C1QL1), neuronal pentraxins, and reticulon 4 (RTN4) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref>). A constitutive, whole-body KO of Bai3 mouse models have recently been generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref>). Both male and female <italic>Bai3</italic> KO mice fed a standard chow have significantly lower body weight, beginning at weaning (3 weeks old) and continue into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref>). Lower body weight in <italic>Bai3</italic> KO mice of either sex is attributed to a reduction in both lean and fat mass, and is associated with higher energy expenditure and reduced food intake in male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref>). The impact of Bai3 deficiency on systemic metabolism in response to a high-fat diet was not examined. The <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO mice do not phenocopy the phenotypes of the <italic>Bai3</italic> KO mice. When fed a control low-fat diet, the body weight, food intake, and energy expenditure of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO male mice were indistinguishable from WT controls. In striking contrast to <italic>Bai3</italic> KO mice, female <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO mice fed a low-fat diet began to gain more weight around 20 weeks of age, and by 40 weeks had become visibly obese. While we did not rule out CTRP10-Bai3 signaling axis in modulating energy metabolism in peripheral tissues, our findings in <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO mice suggest that future works are needed to establish the molecular mechanisms that mediate the systemic metabolic function of CTRP10.</p>
<p>Several limitations of our current study are noted. We use a constitutive whole-body KO mouse model of CTRP10 to interrogate its function. It is unknown whether CTRP10 has a role during development that may influence sex-dependent postnatal weight gain with age or in response to a high-caloric diet. Future studies using conditional KO of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> gene in adult mice can help address this issue. Although the lack of differences in food intake, physical activity, and energy expenditure between genotypes do not support a central role of CTRP10 in mediating the metabolic phenotypes of <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO female mice, a brain-specific KO of <italic>Ctrp10</italic> gene is needed to definitively rule this out. Our phenotypic analyses in the context of metabolism are relatively comprehensive but not exhaustive. Although the metabolic profile of obese <italic>Ctrp10</italic>-KO female mice was largely indistinguishable from the much leaner WT controls, we do not know if some related aspect of metabolic health (e.g., blood pressure and heart function) may be altered in the absence of CTRP10 which we did not examine.</p>
<p>In summary, we have established the physiologic role and requirement of CTRP10 in modulating body weight in a female-specific manner. Importantly, loss of CTRP10 largely uncouples obesity from insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction. The CTRP10-deficient female mice represent a unique and valuable model to help dissect female-biased mechanisms that help preserve metabolic health in the face of positive energy balance and increased adiposity.</p>

<p>Eight-week-old mouse tissues (gonadal and inguinal white adipose tissues, interscapular brown adipose tissue, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, hindbrain, and hypothalamus) from C57BL/6J male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were collected from fasted and refed experiments as we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref>). For the fasted group, food was removed for 16 h (beginning 10 h into the light cycle), and mice were euthanized 2 h into the light cycle. For the refed group, mice were fasted for 16 h and refed with chow pellets for 2 h before being euthanized. Tissues (white and brown adipose tissues, liver, whole brain, kidney, spleen, heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas, small intestine, and colon) from C57BL/6J male mice fed a low-fat diet (LFD) or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks were also collected as we have previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Ctrp10/C1ql2</italic>-KO mice (C57BL/6NCrl-<italic>C1ql2<sup>em1(IMPC)Mbp</sup></italic>/Mmucd; stock number 050587-UCD) were generated using the CRISPR-cas9 method at UC Davis. The two guide RNAs (gRNA) used were 5’-CCGGCGCC GCTCCACCATTACCT-3’ and 5’-TCAGGCCACCCCATCCCCATCGG-3’. The <italic>Ctrp10</italic> gene consists of 2 exons. The entire protein coding region spanning exon 1 and 2 was deleted. This KO strategy ensures a complete null allele for <italic>Ctrp10</italic>. The KO mice were maintained on a C57BL6/6J genetic background. Genotyping primers for WT allele were forward (m10-Com-F) 5’-TGTCGGGCTCTTCGACTCTCCA-3’ and reverse (m10-WT-R) 5’-GCATCTCGT AGTGAGCCGCTCC-3’. The size of the WT band was 360 bp. Genotyping primers for the <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO allele were forward (m10-Com-F) 5’-TGTCGGGCTCTTCGACTCTCCA-3’ and reverse (m10-Mut-R1) 5’-GTCCAATCAGCT TTCTCAAGTCTGG-3’. The size of the KO band was 422 bp. The genotyping PCR parameters were as follows: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 10 cycles of (94°C for 10 sec, 65°C for 15 sec, 72°C for 30 sec), then 25 cycles of (94°C for 10 sec, 55°C for 15 sec, 72°C for 30 sec), and lastly 72°C for 5 min. Due to the presence of GC rich sequences, 7% DMSO was included in the PCR genotyping reaction. Mice were generated by intercrossing <italic>Ctrp10</italic> heterozygous (+/-) mice, supplemented with intercrossing WT or KO mice. <italic>Ctrp10</italic> KO (-/-) and WT (+/+) controls were housed in polycarbonate cages on a 12-h light–dark photocycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Mice were fed either a control low-fat diet (LFD; 10% kcal derived from fat; # D12450B; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal derived from fat; #D12492, Research Diets). LFD was provided for the duration of the study, beginning at 5 weeks of age; HFD was provided for 14 weeks, beginning at 6-7 weeks of age. At termination of study, all mice were fasted for 2 h and euthanized. Tissues were collected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at -80°C until analysis. All mouse protocols (protocol # MO22M367) were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institute of Health guidelines and followed the standards established by the Animal Welfare Acts.</p>

Rates of oxygen consumption (<italic>V<sup>˙</sup></italic> <sub>O2</sub>; mL·kg<sup>-1</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>) and carbon dioxide production (<italic>V<sup>˙</sup></italic> <sub>CO2</sub>; mL·kg<sup>-1·</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>) in each chamber were measured every 24 min throughout the studies. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER = <italic>V<sup>˙</sup></italic> <sub>CO2</sub>/<italic>V<sup>˙</sup></italic> <sub>O2</sub>) was calculated by CLAMS software (version 5.66) to estimate relative oxidation of carbohydrates (RER = 1.0) versus fats (RER = 0.7), not accounting for protein oxidation. Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated as EE= <italic>V<sup>˙</sup></italic> <sub>O2</sub>× [3.815 + (1.232 × RER)] and normalized to lean mass. Because normalizing to lean mass can potentially lead to overestimation of EE, we also performed ANCOVA analysis on EE using body weight as a covariate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref>).

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Sample size is indicated in figure and/or figure legend. All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data were analyzed with two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests, one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA (with Sidak’s post hoc tests). 2-way ANOVA was used for body weight over time, fasting-refeeding response, and all tolerance tests. <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents a detailed characterization of male and female wild-type and CTRP10 knockout mice, revealing that knockout mice develop female-specific obesity that is largely uncoupled from metabolic dysfunction. The data are <bold>convincing</bold>, and the work is a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to understanding how obesity is coupled to metabolic dysfunction, and how this can occur in a sex-specific manner.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Chen et al. presents a detailed metabolic characterization of male and female WT and CTRP10 knockout mice. The main finding is that female KO mice become obese on both low-fat and high-fat diets but without evidence of marked insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, or increased inflammatory markers. The authors performed a detailed transcriptomic analysis and identified differentially expressed genes that distinguish high-fat diet-fed CTRP10 KO from WT control mice. They further show that this set of genes exhibits cross-correlation in human tissues, and that this is greater in females than in males. The data indicate that the CTRP10 KO model may be useful to understand how obesity and metabolic dysfunction are coupled to each other, and how this occurs by a sex-biased mechanism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work presents a large amount of data, which has been carefully acquired and is convincing. The transcriptomic analysis will further help to define what pathways are associated with obesity, but not necessarily with metabolic dysfunction. The manuscript will be of interest to investigators studying metabolic diseases, and to those studying sex-specific differences in metabolic physiology. The limitations of the study are acknowledged, including that a whole-body knockout was used. The cause of the increased body weight is not entirely clear, despite the careful and detailed analysis that was performed. Notwithstanding these limitations, the phenotype is interesting, and this work will establish a basis for further work to understand the mechanisms that are involved.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Genes identified as DEGs in the mouse RNAseq data set were used to identify a set of human orthologous transcripts and the abundances of these transcripts were correlated with each other in Figure 10. This identified a greater correlation (&quot;connectivity&quot;) in subQ adipose compared to other tissues, and in females compared to males. The description of how this analysis was done could be clearer. In some cases, the text refers to the software that was used without describing the goal of the analysis. In other instances, specialized terminology was used (e.g. &quot;biweight midcorrelation&quot;) without defining what this means.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the current study, the authors investigated the role of loss of CTRP10 results in female obesity with preserved metabolic health. The overall conclusion is supported by the experimental data that CTRP10 negatively regulates body weight in females and that loss of CTRP10 results in benign obesity with largely preserved insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. The authors have shown the role of sex differences in the metabolically healthy obese (MHO) phenotype, which may increase the scope for research in this area.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study provides a detailed idea of how genes are regulated in a sex-dependent manner.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Mechanistic details are missing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study examines the impact of CTRP10/C1QL2 absence on obesity and metabolic health in mice. Female mice lacking CTRP10 tend to develop obesity, particularly on a high-fat diet. Surprisingly, they do not display the typical metabolic traits associated with obesity, like fatty liver or glucose intolerance. This indicates a disconnection between weight gain and metabolic issues in these female mice. The research underscores the need to understand sex-specific factors in how obesity influences metabolic health.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study provides compelling evidence regarding Ctrp10's role in female-specific metabolic regulation in mice, shedding light on its potential significance in metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
-The analysis and description of sex-specific human data require more details to highlight the relevance of Ctrp10 mouse data and the analysis of differentially expressed genes in humans.</p>
<p>
-There's a lack of analysis regarding secreted Ctrp10 under various dietary conditions.</p>
<p>
-The study didn't assess adipose tissue function to evaluate metabolic health.</p>
