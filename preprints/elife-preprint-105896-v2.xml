<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>In both invertebrates such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates such as mouse or human, the brain contains the most diverse population of cell types of any tissue. It is generally accepted that transcriptional diversity is an early step in generating neuronal and glial diversity, followed by the establishment of a unique gene expression profile that determines morphology, connectivity, and function. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are two types of neural stem cells, called Type 1 (T1) and Type 2 (T2) neuroblasts. In contrast to T1 neuroblasts, T2 neuroblasts generate intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) that expand the number and diversity of cell types. The diversity of T2-derived neurons contributes a large portion of the central complex (CX), a conserved brain region that plays a role in sensorimotor integration. Recent work has revealed much of the connectome of the CX, but how this connectome is assembled remains unclear. Mapping the transcriptional diversity of neurons derived from T2 neuroblasts is a necessary step in linking transcriptional profile to the assembly of the adult brain. Here we perform single nuclei RNA sequencing of T2 neuroblast-derived adult neurons and glia. We identify clusters containing all known classes of glia, clusters that are male/female enriched, and 161 neuron-specific clusters. We map neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and identify unique transcription factor combinatorial codes for each cluster (presumptive neuron subtype). This is a necessary step that directs functional studies to determine whether each transcription factor combinatorial code specifies a distinct neuron type within the CX. We map several columnar neuron subtypes to distinct clusters and identify two neuronal classes (NPF+ and AstA+) that both map to two closely related clusters. Our data support the hypothesis that each transcriptional cluster represents one or a few closely related neuron subtypes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In all organisms, the brain has arguably the most complex cellular diversity, from human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Siletti et al., 2023</xref>) to <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Franconville et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>). Neuronal diversity is essential for the assembly and function of the adult brain, yet the “parts list” of different neuronal and glial cell types remains incomplete. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the laterally-positioned optic lobes have been well characterized for transcriptionally distinct neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Konstantinides et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Özel et al., 2022</xref>), as has the central brain and ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lago-Baldaia et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McLaughlin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Naidu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sato and Suzuki, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Velten et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The central brain contains many diverse neurons that populate important neuropils, such as the mushroom body (MB) used for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sgammeglia and Sprecher, 2022</xref>), or the central complex (CX) used for celestial navigation and sensory-motor integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fisher, 2022</xref>), among other behaviors. The central brain neurons are all generated from neural stem cells, called neuroblasts (NBs). There are two types of NBs that generate central brain neurons: Type 1 (T1) and Type 2 (T2) NBs. T1 NBs undergo asymmetric divisions to self-renew and generate a ganglion mother cells (GMCs), which each produce two post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pollington et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). There are ∼100 T1 NBs per larval central brain lobe that each generate 20-100 neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, there are Type 0 (T0) NBs which generate post-mitotic neuron progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baumgardt et al., 2014</xref>); T0 NB lineages yet to be documented in the central brain. T2 NBs have a more complex division pattern than T1 NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). T2 NBs undergo asymmetric division to self-renew and generate an intermediate neural progenitor (INP); each INP undergoes 4-6 divisions to self-renew and generate a GMC and its two neuron or glial progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boone and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, each T2 NB division will generate 8-12 progeny cells. Most T2 NBs generate ∼500 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), have highly complex neuronal cell types based on morphology and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2013</xref>), and produce the columnar neurons of the adult CX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boyan and Williams, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kandimalla et al., 2023</xref>). Subsequently, we will call neurons born from type I NBs “T1-derived” and neurons born from type 2 NBs “T2-derived.”</p>
<p>Although single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) has been done on adult central brain neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Croset et al., 2018</xref>), the transcriptomic profile of T1 versus T2 neuronal and glial progeny has not yet been characterized. Furthermore, the T2 lineages generate diverse neuronal progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Yu et al., 2013</xref>) but focused transcriptional profiling of T2-derived progeny has not been reported. In this report, we generate a single nuclei (snRNA-seq) atlas of T2-derived progeny of the adult central brain. We use several complementary methods to link neuron identity to UMAP clusters. Our data will facilitate linking neuronal transcriptomes with connectomes to gain a molecular understanding of CX development, connectivity, and behavior.</p>

<title>Generation of a transcriptomic atlas of adult central brain neurons and glia</title>
<p>The adult central brain (i.e. brain without optic lobes) is composed of neuronal and glial progeny derived from both T1 and T2 NBs. We first generate a transcriptomic atlas of all central brain neurons derived from both T1 and T2 NBs. The flies were of a genotype that gave permanent lineage tracing of T2 NB-derived progeny in the adult (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, A’). This allowed us to first analyze all central brain T1- and T2-derived neurons and glia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and then focus on neurons and glia produced specifically by T2-derived lineages.</p>

<p>We dissociated nuclei from 7-day-old adult fly central brains with optic lobes removed using methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McLaughlin et al., 2021</xref>). The cDNA libraries were then prepared from dissociated nuclei with split-pool-based barcoding for single-nuclei transcription profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). We sequenced a total of 30,699 nuclei at 589 median genes per nuclei from the T1+T2 central brain.</p>
<p>To distinguish T2-derived progeny from T1-derived progeny, we expressed <italic>worniu-gal4,asense-gal80</italic> to drive expression of FLP recombinase (FLP) specifically in T2 NBs. This resulted in the flip out of a stop cassette and thus continuous expression of Gal4 under the ubiquitous <italic>actin5C</italic> enhancer. After removal of the stop cassette in T2 NBs, the <italic>actin5c-gal4</italic> can continuously drive expression of the reporter genes (RFP or GFP) and FLP in the T2-derived neuronal and glial progeny in adult brains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We assigned 3,125 nuclei which have expression of RFP, GFP, or FLP as being derived from T2 lineages. We assigned 27,574 triple-negative nuclei as derived from the T1 lineages. We used Seurat for filtering, integrating, and clustering the atlas to provide transcriptionally unique cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). We used uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)-based dimension reduction to visualize the 152 clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The most enriched or least expressed genes (marker genes) for each cluster are shown in Supp Table 1.</p>
<p>We used known markers (Supp Table 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davie et al., 2018</xref>) to identify distinct cell types in the central brain, including glia, mushroom body neurons, olfactory projection neurons, clock neurons, Poxn+ neurons, serotonergic neurons, dopaminergic neurons, octopaminergic neurons, corazonergic neurons, hemocytes, and ocelli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>; Supp Table 1). We didn’t observe any cluster exclusively containing progeny from T1 or T2 NB lineages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Supp Figure 1). We conclude that both T1 and T2 generate transcriptionally similar cells, despite their different developmental origins. Alternatively, deeper sequencing may resolve a single cluster into two clusters with each derived from T1 or T2 lineages. We next searched for cluster-defining genes in the T2 enriched clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>’) and found high expression of <italic>AstA</italic> (<italic>Allatostatin A</italic>), <italic>SerT</italic> (<italic>Serotonin transporter</italic>), <italic>Tk</italic> (<italic>Tachykinin</italic>), and <italic>Vmat</italic> (<italic>Vesicular monoamine transporter</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These enriched marker genes suggest that <italic>AstA</italic>+ neurons, serotonergic neurons, and <italic>TK</italic>+ neurons may be primarily derived from T2 lineages.</p>
<p>We explored the central brain atlas for glial cell types and their gene expression. We focused on the 3,409 glial nuclei from clusters that expressed the pan-glial marker <italic>repo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Campbell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Xiong et al., 1994</xref>) in the T1+T2 atlas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Each cluster contained a mix of T1 and T2 glial progeny (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>’). We identified six known glial cell types (astrocytes, cortex, ensheathing, surface glial and the two subtypes: perineurial and subperineurial) based on canonical glial makers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; Supp Table 3). Similar to a previous glial cell atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lago-Baldaia et al., 2023</xref>), we found some glial subtypes (astrocytes, ensheathing, and subperineurial) mapping to multiple clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, 1F). We identified a glial cluster that expressed genes associated with extracellular matrix, <italic>vkg</italic> and <italic>Col4a1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), which have previously been identified as pan surface glial markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">DeSalvo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hindle and Bainton, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the two surface glial subtypes, perineurial and subperineurial clusters, do not express these markers at cluster defining levels, and conversely the surface glia cluster 5 does not express perineurial or subperineurial specific makers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, Supp Table 4). Differential gene expression analysis for all genes between T1 and T2 glial progeny did not show differences across any glial cell types or clusters (Supp Table 5). We conclude that the adult central brain contains known glial cell types with no differences in gene expression between T1 and T2-derived glia.</p>

<title>Generation of a T1- and T2-specific cell atlas</title>
<p>We explored the diversity of T1 and T2-derived neurons by generating T1- and T2-specific cell atlases. We identified T1-derived neurons by bioinformatically <italic>excluding</italic> cells co-expressing T2-specific markers <italic>FLP+</italic>/<italic>GFP+</italic>/<italic>RFP+</italic> plus <italic>repo+</italic> glial clusters. We then generate a T1 neuron atlas containing 22,807 T1-derived neurons that form 114 clusters. Marker genes of each cluster are shown in Supp Table 5. We identified the neurons that are known to be generated by T1 NBs, including MB neurons and olfactory projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2022</xref>)(Supp Table 2). We identified other T1-derived neurons, including clock neurons, Poxn+ neurons, and neurons that release dopamine, serotonin, octopamine/tyramine, and other neuropeptides (Supp Figure 2, Supp Table 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davie et al., 2018</xref>). We gathered a list of genes that represented the 10 most enriched genes from each cluster and calculated the scaled averaged expression of each gene from each cluster (Supp Figure 2). Each unique combination of enriched genes could be referred to as cluster markers. We conclude that our T1-derived nuclei contain the expected abundance of neuronal diversity seen in previous scRNA-seq atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>In our whole brain atlas described above, T2-derived cells represent a minor contribution to the atlas due to their low nuclei numbers relative to the T1-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Raji and Potter, 2021</xref>). To generate a comprehensive T2 atlas, we needed to increase the percentage of T2-derived nuclei for RNAseq. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to select nuclei that are labeled by T2-specific permanent lineage tracing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We then selected the nuclei <italic>in silico</italic> that showed expression of UAS-transgenes (FLP, GFP, or RFP, see above) to eliminate contamination of T1 nuclei during FACS. In total, we sequenced 61,118 T2 nuclei. We included 3,125 UAS-transgene labeled nuclei from the dissociated central brain without sorting from the T1+T2 atlas (see above). We used integration in Seurat to generate an atlas containing 64,243 nuclei that formed 198 clusters. T2 NBs have been estimated to produced ∼5000 neurons/glia in the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), with ∼1,800 neurons in the central complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schlegel et al., 2024</xref>), giving our atlas ∼12x coverage. We next filtered out the <italic>repo</italic>+ glial cell clusters to generate a T2 neuron cell atlas with 50,148 non-glial nuclei forming 161 clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Marker genes of each cluster are shown in Supp Table 8.</p>
<p>We calculated the scaled average expression of the top 10 most enriched genes from each T2 neuron cluster (Supp Table 8). Each set of genes could serve as cluster marker genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We conclude that each cluster within our T2 neuron atlas represents a transcriptionally unique cell type. For the remainder of the paper, we focus solely on the diversity of T2-derived neurons and glia.</p>

<title>T2 neuroblasts generate all major classes of fast-acting neurotransmitters</title>
<p>An important aspect of neuronal identity and function is fast-acting neurotransmitter expression. We determined the neuronal populations that expressed seven fast-acting neurotransmitters: glutamatergic, cholinergic, GABAergic, tyraminergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic and octopaminergic in T2-derived neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-G</xref>). In neurons, we found that cholinergic neurons were most abundant (21%), followed by glutamatergic neurons (12%), GABAergic neurons (9%), tyraminergic neurons (2.6%), dopaminergic neurons (1.2%), serotonergic neurons (1.2%), and octopaminergic neurons (0.7%). Additionally, 12% of neurons were co-expressing 2 or 3 neurotransmitters. The remaining 40% in our atlas were not expressing any neurotransmitter with a log normalized expression &lt;2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>); this is similar to the ratios in the adult midbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Croset et al., 2018</xref>) and optic lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Konstantinides et al., 2022</xref>). The nuclei co-expressing two or more fast-acting neurotransmitters may reflect an authentic feature of these neurons, as see in other systems (see Discussion).

<p>When generating our atlas, we dissected both female and male adult brains that were processed as separate samples in order to differentiate the sex of nuclei in the snRNAseq atlas.

<title>T2 neuroblasts generate neurons expressing a diverse array of neuropeptides</title>
<p>Neuropeptides are often used as markers to distinguish different neuronal populations. We examined whether individual neuropeptide-encoding genes were exclusively expressed within single clusters, representing single neuronal subtypes. Among the 49 neuropeptides in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we identified 13 with enriched expression in a limited number of clusters, making them suitable as cluster-defining markers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). For all clusters significantly expressing cluster-defining neuropeptides, we assessed their co-expression with specific fast-acting neurotransmitters (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>These data raise several questions. What is the relationship between neuropeptide expression and cluster identity? Can two distinct clusters express the same neuropeptide? Can two neuropeptides be co-expressed by the same cluster? Our data show that all of these patterns exist. For example, in some cases, one cluster expresses two or more neuropeptide genes (e.g. clusters 100 and 128 express NPF and AstA); conversely, we also observe one neuropeptide expressed in multiple clusters (e.g. Ms, 2 clusters; Tk, 2 clusters) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to validate whether these neuropeptidergic cells indeed come from T2 lineages and target the CX. This required a method for specifically labelling of T2 peptidergic neurons, as antibody staining could be contaminated with T1-derived neurons. We developed a genetic approach to selectively visualize neuropeptide expression exclusively in neurons originating from T2 NB lineages. This technique involves driving FLP recombinase (FLP) under the control of the T2-specific driver <italic>wor-GAL4,ase-GAL80</italic>. The T2-specific FLP catalyzes the excision of a stop codon in the <italic>lexAop-FRT-stop-FRT-myr::gfp</italic> transgene, allowing existing neuropeptide-2A-LexA transgenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deng et al., 2019</xref>) to drive GFP expression specifically in neuropeptide-positive T2-derived neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This method revealed the morphology of specific T2-derived peptidergic neurons.</p>
<p>We first assayed Ms+ neurons because Wolff et al. reported that at least two FB neurons, FB4Z and FB5R express Ms and they target to two distinct FB layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wolff et al., 2025</xref>). However, we found that type II-derived Ms-2A-LexA-expressing neurons project to multiple layers of the dorsal fan-shaped body and the entire ellipsoid body, suggesting an unknown class of Ms+ neurons targeting to EB and/or FB (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-C</xref>’’, Supp Movie 1). In our atlas, Ms is mainly expressed in clusters 157 and 160; however, we cannot distinguish the corresponding identity of each neuron.</p>
<p>Next, we assayed neurons in two clusters (100 and 128) that express the same two neuropeptides, AstA and NPF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref>). We wanted to determine if these clusters contain two cell types with similar gene expression, or a single cell type that co-expressed both neuropeptides. We used NPF-2A-lexA and AstA-2A-lexA to label each class of neurons. We found that they were generated at indistinguishable numbers of cells and projections: both had ∼20 neurons projecting to a lateral domain of the ellipsoid body and the same two layers of the fan-shaped body (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref>; Supp Movies 2-3). Whether these T2-derived NPF and AstA neurons are indeed the same would require antibody validation.</p>
<p>We investigated whether specific transcription factors (TFs), or TF combinatorial codes, might correlate with the expression of cluster-defining neuropeptides, and thus provide candidates for a regulatory relationship where each cluster may have a TF code that drives transcription of a specific neuropeptides. To address this, we performed an unbiased correlation analysis of TF and neuropeptide expression patterns across all cells in our dataset to identify potential regulatory relationships. Interestingly, we found high correlations of multiple TFs to each neuropeptide (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>, Supp Fig 3, Supp Table 12). Our data provide a stepping-stone to the analysis of upstream TF combinatorial codes that drive neuropeptide expression.</p>

<title>Each neuron cluster consists of a unique combination of transcription factors</title>
<p>It is generally thought that neuronal diversity is generated by TF combinatorial codes that are uniquely expressed in neuronal subtypes, with an emphasis on homeodomain TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Reilly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sagner et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we assayed each class of TFs to determine how many were expressed in cluster-specific (i.e. neuron-specific) patterns. We found that most clusters expressed a unique TF combination (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This is true for all zinc-finger TFs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) and helix-turn-helix TFs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Nearly all clusters expressed a unique combination of homeodomain TFS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), with only a few clusters sharing a homeodomain code (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>’). In contrast, basic domain, unspecified domain, and high mobility group TFs were more promiscuously expressed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). We conclude that zinc finger, helix-turn-helix, and homeodomain TFs are good candidates for forming unique combinatorial codes that should be tested for a role in generating neuronal diversity.</p>

<title>Linking neurons to UMAP clusters</title>
<p>We sought to link well characterized CX neurons to their transcriptomes within the T2 atlas. We chose columnar neurons due to known cell type markers and genetic access. We used four complementary approaches to identify them, described below.
<list list-type="order">

<list-item><p>We used a published bulk RNAseq dataset to profile selective CX neurons and compared the expression profiles to our snRNA-seq dataset with a published algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Davis et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). We generated a heatmap based on the coefficient of the expression profiles to predict the identity of each cluster. We predicted that E-PG neurons were in cluster 75 and 95, P-EG neurons were in cluster 102, hDeltaK neurons were in cluster 100, FB6A were in cluster 162, and FB7A were in cluster 40 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). The prediction of E-PG neurons arising from cluster 75 and 95 was validated by expression of the transcription factor <italic>dac</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dillon and Doe, 2024</xref>); other neuron-cluster assignments await experimental validation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We assayed the enhancers in highly specific split-Gal4 lines to determine if the associated genes were expressed in the same neuron subtype as the split-Gal4 line (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). For example, the stable split line SS65380 is expressed in the FB2A neurons, and the enhancer DNA used to make the split lines are associated with the <italic>wnt10</italic> and <italic>lmpt</italic> genes. These two genes show high expression in cluster 149 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>), allowing us to predict that the FB2A neurons are in cluster 149. A similar approach was used to generate candidate neuron-cluster predictions for the following neurons: FB8G, FB6H, hDeltaA, hDeltaD, hDeltaH, and FB1C (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). These predictions can be used to focus experimental validation on a small group of neurons; however, the percentage of validated neurons-clusters awaits experimental analysis.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The fourth approach was based on using known or novel markers of CX neurons together with Gal4/LexA lines that are regulated by known gene enhancers. TFs known to be expressed by PF-R, P-EN and P-FN neurons are Toy and Runt, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>). We assigned PF-R neurons to cluster 105 based on being Toy+ Runt- and being labeled by Gal4/LexA driven by the enhancer of <italic>rho</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, left and middle columns). We assigned P-FN to clusters 38, 46, and 123 based on being Toy-Runt+ and being labeled by split line SS00191 associated with <italic>shakB</italic> and <italic>Pkc53E</italic> genes. Lastly, we assigned P-EN neurons to clusters 66 and 130 by their expression of Toy-Runt+ and labeled by <italic>Gψ30A-lexA</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, left and middle columns). This approach identified novel TF markers for P-EN, PF-R and P-FN neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>, right columns), which we validated by antibody staining (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D-H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dillon et al., 2024</xref>).

<p>The differential expression of TFs probably contributes to the morphological or connectivity diversity found within each class of CX neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Turner-Evans et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Wolff and Rubin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). We conclude that our T2 atlas can be used to link known neuron subtypes to their transcriptome (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). This is a necessary step in determining how cluster-specific gene expression regulates neuron-specific functional properties such as morphology, connectivity, and physiology.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We used a genetic approach to express RFP in the progeny of T2 NBs in the adult central brain. We excluded optic lobes by manual dissection, and thus our data are similar to recent scRNA-seq data from the central brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Similarities include neurons expressing predominantly single fast-acting neurotransmitters (discussed below). Both datasets show major classes of neurons including MB neurons, olfactory projection neurons, clock neurons, Poxn+ neurons, serotonergic neurons, dopaminergic neurons, octopaminergic neurons, corazoninergic neurons, and hemocytes. The MB neurons that appear in the T2-derived progeny may be due to off-target expression of our Gal4 driver at stages we have not assayed, or more likely, due to ambient RNA released during the dissociation and sorting steps.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed fewer distinct neuronal clusters in the T1-derived population (114 clusters; Supp Figure 2) than in the T2-derived neuronal population (161 clusters; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This could be due to the T1-derived progeny containing a large population of transcriptionally similar Kenyon cells of the MB, whereas T2-derived clusters contain fewer, but transcriptionally more diverse, cells than T1-derived progeny. It would be interesting to know whether T1 NB lineages are generally less diverse, or whether the Kenyon cells are exceptional in their lack of transcriptional diversity, despite the presence of protein gradient in young vs. old neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Our results are consistent with lineage analysis of T2 NBs, which make distinct neurons across the temporal axis of T2 NBs, plus unique neurons across the INP temporal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ito et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Yang et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides</title>
<p>We observed that most fast-acting neurotransmitters are uniquely expressed in neuronal populations, but we also observe a smaller group of neurons that express two or three neurotransmitters. This includes excitatory and inhibitory neurons, e.g. 2.9% of all neurons express genes necessary for cholinergic and GABAergic neurotransmitters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Co-expression of neurotransmitters has been reported in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Granger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Granger et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lozovaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Meye et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Spitzer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Takács et al., 2018</xref>) and it may be biologically relevant in the T2-derived neurons.</p>
<p>Neuropeptides are profoundly important for a vast array of behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Schoofs et al., 2017</xref>), and thus our mapping of neuropeptide expression to distinct neuronal subtypes may facilitate a functional analysis linking neuron identity, neuropeptide expression, and behavior.</p>

<title>Glial identities</title>
<p>We identified six classes of glia in the T1+T2 glial atlas that reflects previous scRNAseq datasets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lago-Baldaia et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to a recent glial cell atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lago-Baldaia et al., 2023</xref>), we found glial subtypes like astrocytes, ensheathing, and subperineurial glia mapped to several clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>). It remains unclear if these clusters with the same cell type annotation represent distinct glial identities or different transcriptional states within these populations. Interestingly, we detected a small population of <italic>vkg</italic>+ surface glia specific to the whole atlas (T1+T2) and not the T2 glia atlas. The lack of differential gene expression between T1- and T2-derived glia suggests these cell types are similar despite different developmental origins. It will be for future work to understand how different progenitors produce similar glial fates.</p>
<p>Similar to the T1+T2 glial atlas, our T2 atlas captured the known glial subtypes found in other scRNAseq datasets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lago-Baldaia et al., 2023</xref>). The T2 glia atlas contains more clusters than the T1+T2 atlas that may be due to the nearly 4x the number of glia captured (T1+T2 atlas 3,409 nuclei; T2 atlas – 12,315 nuclei).</p>
<p>Interestingly, we identified the astrocyte-like glia of the central brain previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Awasaki et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, we captured chiasm glia that have been shown to be derived from the T2 lineage DL1 and migrate into the optic lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Viktorin et al., 2013</xref>). These nuclei could represent either chiasm glia that did not migrate out of the central brain or optic lobe tissue that was not completely removed during dissections. It will be interesting to investigate how these T2-derived migratory chiasm glia compare to the optic-lobe derived chiasm glia, because of their different developmental origins.</p>

<title>Sex differences found in the adult neurons and glia</title>
<p>The T2 glia and neuron atlases contained clusters with disproportionate enrichment of female and male nuclei when normalized for sample input. We found the expected differential expression of yolk protein transcripts (<italic>yp1, yp2, yp3</italic>) enriched in female nuclei and the long non-coding RNAs <italic>rox1/2</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> enriched in male nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amrein and Axel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Meller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ryner et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, we found <italic>dsx</italic> to be enriched in both glial and neuronal female nuclei. Surprisingly, we found additional female and male-specific gene enriched in both neurons and glia including <italic>ATPsyndelta</italic> and undescribed, computationally predicted genes (CGs) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). It remains to be determined if these genes are driving sex-specific differences within glial and neuronal subtypes. These genes may reflect sex-specific differences in the adult central brain and may provide insight into how behavioral circuits are linked to sex-specific behaviors. Future work should aim to characterize and test these genes for functional roles.</p>

<title>TF codes</title>
<p>Our atlas showed zinc finger TFs and homeodomain TFs as forming combinatorial codes specific for distinct cell types. This raises the possibility that these TF combinations determine neuronal functional properties, by establishing and maintaining neuronal identities. This is consistent with data from <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hobert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Reilly et al., 2020</xref>), mammalian spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Briscoe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sagner et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Holguera and Desplan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>), leg motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Enriquez et al., 2015</xref>), and VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Soffers et al., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, we found more zinc finger TFs expressed in unique combinatorial codes compared to homeodomain TFs; this may be a caution to focusing too narrowly on homeodomain TFs function. We note that our results are mostly correlative and await functional analysis of the TF combinatorial codes found in our dataset. It is also possible that the current sparse TF expression patterns are due, in part, to false negative results due to low read depths. This can be resolved by increasing read depth or by performing functional assays.</p>

<title>Mapping neurons to clusters</title>
<p>In this study, we used several complementary approaches to map identified neurons to their transcriptomic UMAP cluster. First, we used bulk-seq data from specific neurons with our atlas to match neuron to cluster. Second, we used enhancer elements from neuron-specific split Gal4 lines to link enhancer-associated genes to each hemi-driver with common expression in a cluster. Third, we used known or novel TFs and other molecular markers that are expressed by a cluster as an entry point to look for other cluster specific genes. Each of these methods provides candidate neuron-cluster association, which requires experimental validation. It is not clear which method is more robust at identifying functional neuron-cluster associations. Nevertheless, we have validated a number of neuron-cluster associations using the third approach: beginning with a single gene-cluster correlation. In the future, our data can be used in two pipelines for linking neuron subtype to transcriptome. First, start with at least one validated marker for a cluster, then search all labeled clusters for candidate TFs that co-express with the validated marker, followed by validation via RNA in situ (or antibodies). Second, we can collect neurons of interest with FACS or antibody selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Davis et al., 2020</xref>), and perform bulk RNA sequencing, followed by looking for clusters enriched for the TFs found in bulk sequencing data, and then validation via RNA in situ (or antibodies). Notably, the second pipeline requires no prior markers beyond the Gal4 or LexA line expressed in single neuronal populations. Both pipelines result in a transcriptome that can be used to identify (a) TFs for their role in neuronal specification and/or maintenance, (b) cell surface molecules that may regulate neuronal morphology and/or connectivity, or (c) functionally relevant genes encoding ion channels, neuropeptides, receptors, and signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Single nuclei isolation, library preparation, and sequencing</title>
<p>We first used the split-pool method (Parse Bioscience, Seattle, WA, USA) to barcode RNAs from whole brain to generate a library which includes both T1 and T2 progeny. This library, T1+T2, was used for analysis in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. To increase the number of T2 nuclei for snRNAseq, we labeled T2 nuclei by crossing <italic>20xUAS-FLPG5.PEST;worniu-gal4,asense-gal80; Act5c(FRT.CD2)gal4</italic> to <italic>UAS-RedStinger</italic> (RFP) or <italic>UAS-unc84-2xGFP</italic> (GFP) flies. The adult flies were aged for 1 week at 25 °C before dissection. Equal amounts of male and female central brains (excluding optic lobes) were dissected at room temperature within 1 hour. The samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored separately at −80°C. Nuclei dissociated from the frozen, dissected brains was performed according to published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">McLaughlin et al., 2022</xref>). RFP+ or GFP+ nuclei were collected by sorting dissociated nuclei with SONY-SH800 with 100 μm chip. We performed three rounds of sorting and snRNAseq. In the first round, we pooled male and female brains together to select GFP+ nuclei and used particle-templated instant partitions to capture single nuclei to generate cDNA library (Fluent BioSciences, Waterton, MA). In the second round, RFP+ nuclei from male and female were pooled together. In the third round, RFP+ nuclei from male and female brains were collected separately. The split-pool method was then used to generate barcoded cDNA libraries from each individual nucleus from the second and third rounds. All libraries were sequenced with pair-ends reads 150bp on Illumina Novaseq 6000 (University of Oregon’s Genomics and Cell Characterization Core Facility).</p>

<title>snRNA-seq analysis</title>
<p>Our bioinformatic analysis was performed using pipeline from Fluent BioSciences , Parse Bioscience, and the Seurat R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hao et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Satija et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, pipelines from Fluent BioSciences and Parse Biosciences were used to perform demultiplexing, alignment, filtering, counting of barcodes and UMIs with an output being a cell-by-genes matrix of counts. We aligned our sequences to a custom reference genome by adding <italic>flpD5</italic> (RRID:Addgene_32132), <italic>redstinger</italic> (RRID:Addgene_46165), and <italic>unc84sfGFP</italic> (RRID:Addgene_46023) (+SV40 tail) sequences and annotations to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome release BDGP6.32.109. To further ensure that only high-quality cells were retained, we removed any cells with fewer than 200 genes or more than 2500 genes expressed and more than 5% mitochondrial RNA. For the T2 atlas, snRNA-seq data from three rounds of sorting and barcoding were integrated in Seurat with Anchor-based RPCA integration to generate an integrated dataset, and the downstream analysis was performed with the default parameters. The UMAP was generated with resolution 12. The integrated dataset was used for analyses.</p>

<title>Glia analyses</title>
<p>The T1+T2 glia atlas dataset was derived from the T1+T2 <italic>repo</italic>+ glial clusters and re-clustered to represent the glial subtypes. The T2 glia atlas was derived from the T2 <italic>repo</italic>+ glial clusters and re-clustered to represent the glial subtypes. Cell identity was determined by the validated markers for glia shown to differentially expressed between the clusters. Identities were assigned based on expression of these validated markers. Overlapping identities were assigned if multiple subtype markers were expressed within a single cluster.</p>

<title>Sex differences</title>
<p>We determined sex-biased clusters within the T2 glia and neuron atlases by identifying clusters that were disproportionate after normalizing the number of inputs for ‘female’ and ‘male’ samples respectively. The ‘female and male’ mixed samples were excluded from the analyses as we could not differentiate the sex origin of these nuclei. To determine differential gene expression between females and males, we pseudo bulked nuclei by aggregating the snRNAseq for comparison between sex and clusters. Heatmaps were generated in Seurat using the Scillus package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/xmc811/Scillus">https://github.com/xmc811/Scillus</ext-link>) to display the heatmap.</p>

<title>Transcription factor combinatorial analysis</title>
<p>We used the Seurat function FindAllMarkers to find positively differentially expressed TFs in all clusters. We then removed TFs which were not significantly differentially expressed. We gave a value of 1 to any TF that was found to be a positive marker in each cluster and a value of 0 in clusters which it was not a positive marker. Next, we found the number of unique combinations of markers for 6 classes (zinc finger, helix-turn-helix, homeodomain, basic domain, unidentified DNA binding domain, and high motility group) of TFs. The Jaccard index between each cluster was then calculated and clusters were sorted from most to least similar. The python packages Matplotlib and Seaborn were then used to generate heatmaps.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Epiney et al. use single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the lineage of Type-2 (T2) neuroblasts (NBs) in the adult Drosophila brain. To isolate cells born from T2 NBs, the authors used a genetic tool that specifically allows the permanent labeling of T2-derived cell types, which are then FAC-sorted for snRNA-seq. This effective labeling approach also allows them to compare the isolated T2 lineage cells with T1-derived cell types by a simple exclusion method. The authors begin by describing a transcriptomic atlas for all T1 and T2-derived neuronal and glia clusters, reporting that the T2-derived lineage comprises 161 neuronal clusters, in contrast to the T1 lineage which comprises 114 of them. The authors then use the expression of VAChT, VGlut, Gad1, Tbh, Ple, SerT, and Tdc2 to show that T2 neuroblasts generate all major neuron classes of fast-acting neurotransmitters. Strikingly, they show that a subset of glia and neuronal clusters have disproportionate enrichment in males or females, suggesting that T2 neuroblasts generate sex-biased cell types. The authors then proceed to characterize neuropeptide expression across T2-derived neuronal clusters and argue that the same neuropeptide can be expressed across different cell types, while similar cell types can express distinct neuropeptides. The functional implication of both observations, however, remains to be tested. Furthermore, the authors describe combinatorial transcription factor (TF) codes that are correlated with neuropeptide expression for T2-derived neurons along with an overall TF code for all T2-derived cell types, both of which will serve as an important starting point for future investigations. Finally, the authors map well-studied neuronal types of the central complex to the clusters of their T2-derived snRNA-seq dataset. They use known marker combinations, bulk RNA-seq data and highly specific split-GAL4 driver lines to annotate their T2-derived atlas, establishing a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas that would guide future studies in this field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study provides an in-depth transcriptomic characterization of neurons and glia derived from Type-2 neuroblast lineages. The results of this manuscript offer several future directions to investigate the mechanisms of diversifying neuronal identity. The datasets of T1-derived and T2-derived cells will pave the way for studies focused on the functional analysis of combinatorial TF codes specifying cell identity, sex-based differences in neurogenesis and gliogenesis, the relationship between neuropeptide (co)expression and cell identity, and the differential contributions of distinct progenitor populations to the same cell type.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study presents several important observations based on the characterization of Type II neuroblast-derived lineages. However, a mechanistic insight is missing for most observations. The idea that there is a sex-specific bias to certain T2-derived neurons and glial clusters is quite interesting, however, the functional significance of this observation is not tested or discussed extensively. Finally, the authors do not show whether the combinatorial TF code is indeed necessary for neuropeptide expression or if this is just a correlation due to cell identity being defined by TFs. Functional knockdown of some candidate TFs for a subset of neuropeptide-expressing cells would have been helpful in this case.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Epiney et al., present a single-nucleus sequencing analysis of Drosophila adult central brain neurons and glia. By employing an ingenious permanent labeling technique, they trace the progeny of T2 neuroblasts, which play a key role in the formation of the central complex. This transcriptomic dataset is poised to become a valuable resource for future research on neurogenesis, neuron morphology, and behavior.</p>
<p>The authors further delve into this dataset with several analyses, including the characterization of neurotransmitter expression profiles in T2-derived neurons. While some of the bioinformatic analyses are preliminary, they would benefit from additional experimental validation in future studies.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>We appreciate the authors' efforts to address some of the comments. While these revisions have improved the clarity of certain sections, some of the larger concerns remain unaddressed. Specifically, the manuscript still lacks the additional analyses that would allow for more specific conclusions, rather than the general observations currently presented. Although the revisions have certainly made the text clearer, the core issue of needing more detailed analysis to draw more concrete conclusions still stands.</p>

The datasets of T1-derived and T2-derived cells will pave the way for studies focused on the functional analysis of combinatorial TF codes specifying cell identity, sex-based differences in neurogenesis and gliogenesis, the relationship between neuropeptide (co)expression and cell identity, and the differential contributions of distinct progenitor populations to the same cell type.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study presents several important observations based on the characterization of Type II neuroblast-derived lineages. However, a mechanistic insight is missing for most observations. The idea that there is a sex-specific bias to certain T2-derived neurons and glial clusters is quite interesting, however, the functional significance of this observation is not tested or discussed extensively. Finally, the authors do not show whether the combinatorial TF code is indeed necessary for neuropeptide expression or if this is just a correlation due to cell identity being defined by TFs. Functional knockdown of some candidate TFs for a subset of neuropeptide-expressing cells would have been helpful in this case.</p>

<p>We agree that we do not provide mechanistic or functional insights. Our goal was to produce hypothesis generating datasets for our lab and others to use to direct functional or mechanistic studies.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Epiney et al., present a single-nucleus sequencing analysis of Drosophila adult central brain neurons and glia. By employing an ingenious permanent labeling technique, they trace the progeny of T2 neuroblasts, which play a key role in the formation of the central complex. This transcriptomic dataset is poised to become a valuable resource for future research on neurogenesis, neuron morphology, and behavior.</p>

<p>The authors further delve into this dataset with several analyses, including the characterization of neurotransmitter expression profiles in T2-derived neurons. While some of the bioinformatic analyses are preliminary, they would benefit from additional experimental validation in future studies.</p>

<p>Major points</p>
<p>(1) In Figures 1E and 4A, the T1 and T2 glia subsets reveal sub-clusters for several cell types as seen by the distribution of points on the UMAP. This observation is never validated or discussed. Do these sub-clusters represent true differences in identities or are they artifacts of the single-nucleus preparation? For Figure 1E, it is not clear whether specific sub-clusters (see Ensheathing-4 vs Ensheathing-5 and Astrocyte-2 vs. Astrocyte-6) are differentially enriched between the T1 and T2 lineages. The existence of these sub-clusters must be discussed or dismissed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this needs to be addressed more clearly in the manuscript and have made text changes in the Results and Discussion sections to clarify. We note that a recent glial cell atlas (Lago-Baldaia et al., 2023: PMID: 37862379) of the developing fly VNC and optic lobes found sub-clusters that mapped to the same subtype annotations. Interestingly, Lago-Baldaia and colleagues found that the transcriptional diversity of glia cell types did not match the morphological diversity of glia validated <italic>in vivo</italic>. See text changes below.</p>
<p>Lines 131-133: “Similar to a previous glial cell atlas (Lago-Baldaia et al., 2023) we found some glial subtypes (astrocytes, ensheathing, and subperineurial) mapped to multiple clusters (Figure 1E, 1F).”</p>
<p>Lines 206-208: “In line with our T1+T2 atlas and previous glia cell atlas (Lago-Baldaia et al., 2023), some subtypes mapped to several subclusters including ensheathing, astrocytes, and chiasm (Figure 4A-B).”</p>
<p>Lines 397-401: “Similar to a recent glial cell atlas (Lago-Baldaia et al., 2023), we found glial subtypes like astrocytes, ensheathing, and subperineurial glia mapped to several sub-clusters (Figure 1E-F). It remains unclear if these sub-clusters with the same cell type annotation represent distinct glial identities or different transcriptional states within these populations.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors present evidence for sex-specific neuronal and glia subtypes and find differential expression of specific yolk proteins and long non-coding RNAs. However, whether any of these differences are driven by other canonical sex-specific genes such as Fruitless (Fru) or Double-sex (Dbx) has not been reported or discussed. The authors must re-analyze their data for these genes and claim whether they have any contribution to sex-specific sub-clusters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have made text changes and clarifications to highlight the expression of other canonical sex-specific genes. <italic>Fru</italic> was enriched in male nuclei as expected. Interestingly, <italic>dbx</italic> was enriched in female nuclei. It remains to be determined if these genes are mechanisms that may be driving sex-specific changes.</p>
<p>Lines 224-226: “Additionally, female nuclei were enriched for <italic>dbx</italic> (Supp Table 8). Male glial nuclei expressed higher levels of genes including the male-specific genes <italic>lncRNA:rox1/2</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> (Figure 5C; Supp Table 8) (Ryner et al., 1996; Amrein and Axel, 1997; Meller et al., 1997).”</p>

<p>(3) In Figure 6C, it is unclear whether the Ms-2A-LexA-expressing neurons of clusters 157 and 160 project to two different neuropils or share projects to both neuropils. However, it is not explicitly shown in the immunostaining data whether indeed there are two populations to begin with. The authors must check for cluster 157 and 160 specific markers (such as Dh44 and ple) and test whether they appear mutually exclusively in the Ms-2A-LexA-expressing neurons. The same reasoning would apply to the data shown in Figures 6D and 6E, where the authors must test whether the NPF and AstA expressing cells are indeed neurons from clusters 100 and 128, using orthogonal cluster markers to conclude that they are similar (or the same) neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We changed the focus of the paragraph to confirm that these neurons indeed come from type II and that they target the central complex. Although due to the lack of reagents we cannot test the identity of each one of these neurons, we could make meaningful interpretations of the staining to validate our ideas about neuropeptidergic cells in the central complex. We made sure to mention the limitation of our experiment to avoid any wrong conclusions.</p>

<p>Minor points</p>
<p>(1) Line 115 - &quot;cluster that represents optic lobe neurons&quot;. How was this cluster identified?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We reexamined the most significant genes enriched in this cluster 124, and found they are <italic>Rh2</italic>, <italic>ninaC</italic>, <italic>trpl</italic>, and phototransduction related genes (Supplemental table 1). We reassigned the identity of this cluster as ocelli, which also express photoreceptor genes but can’t be easily removed during dissection. We modified the text as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;We used known markers (Croset et al., 2018; Davie et al., 2018; Supp Table 2) to identify distinct cell types in the central brain, including glia, mushroom body neurons, olfactory projection neurons, clock neurons, Poxn+ neurons, serotonergic neurons, dopaminergic neurons, octopaminergic neurons, corazonergic neurons, hemocytes, and ocelli (Figure 1B, Supp. Table 1).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) As the separation in Figure 1B is not obvious, annotated cell type clusters must be re-colored instead of being labelled as the exact dots are indistinguishable. This would especially be helpful for OCTY, SER, OPN, and CLK clusters.</p>
<p>(3) Cluster labels in Figure 1C are barely visible and the font size must be increased for the reader. Recoloring the cluster identities and attaching a legend would again help in this case.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recolored the atlas in Figure 1B, 1C and 1C’ and increased the font size in Figure 1C’.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) For Figure 4A, clusters should be labelled on the UMAP along with the legend as it is difficult for the reader to match identities using Seurat colors. The same is true for the UMAPs in Figure 5A.</p>

<p>Yes, we agree that labeling would improve readability and have done so for UMAPs in Figure 4A and 5A-A’’.</p>

<p>The authors further explore this dataset through several analyses, including the characterization of neurotransmitter expression profiles in T2-derived neurons.

<p>We collected male and female nuclei separately. We have added text in the methods section as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Equal amounts of male and female central brains (excluding optic lobes) were dissected at room temperature within 1 hour. The samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored separately at -80°.</p>
<p>In the first round, we pooled male and female brains together to select GFP+ nuclei and used particle-templated instant partitions to capture single nuclei to generate cDNA library (Fluent BioSciences, Waterton, MA).

The split-pool method was then used to generate barcoded cDNA libraries from each individual nucleus.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, we report that male and females contain the same neurons defined by their transcriptional profile. It remains to be seen if this sex-specific differences changes how these same neuronal subtypes function between male and females. We have added additional text in the discussion to expand on this thought.</p>
<p>Lines 437-441: “It remains to be determined if these genes are driving sex-specific differences within glial and neuronal subtypes.

<p>Line 250 - The idea behind these sections &quot;What is the relationship between neuropeptide expression and cluster identity?&quot; &quot;relation between cluster and morphology&quot; lacks clarity. As clusters are defined based on principal component analysis, and the genes used to define a cluster are dependent on this method, there is no assumption that each cluster represents only one type of neuron or that it should include only neurons expressing the same neurotransmitter genes. Even if some clusters consist of a single neuron type, this should not be generalized to all clusters (and vice-versa).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Correct, we cannot determine from the transcriptome data whether distinct clusters will have different morphology.
