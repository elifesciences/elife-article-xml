<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Affiliative social connections facilitate well-being and survival in numerous species. Engaging in social interactions requires positive or negative motivational drive, elicited through coordinated activity across neural circuits. However, the identity, interconnectivity, and functional encoding of social information within these circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on downstream projections of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) dopamine neurons (DRN<sup>DAT</sup>), which we previously implicated in social motivation alongside an aversive affective state. We show that three prominent DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections – to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala (CeA), and posterior basolateral amygdala (BLP) – play separable roles in behavior, despite substantial collateralization. Photoactivation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection promoted social behavior and photostimulation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BNST projection promoted exploratory behavior, while the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP projection supported place avoidance, suggesting a negative affective state. Downstream regions showed diverse receptor expression, poising DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons to act through dopamine, neuropeptide, and glutamate transmission. Furthermore, we show <italic>ex vivo</italic> that the effect of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> photostimulation on downstream neuron excitability depended on region and baseline cell properties, resulting in excitatory responses in BNST cells and diverse responses in CeA and BLP. Finally, <italic>in vivo</italic> microendoscopic cellular-resolution recordings in the CeA with DRN<sup>DAT</sup> photostimulation revealed a correlation between social behavior and neurons excited by social stimuli– suggesting that increased dopamine tone may recruit different CeA neurons to social ensembles. Collectively, these circuit features may facilitate a coordinated, but flexible, response in the presence of social stimuli that can be flexibly guided based on the internal social homeostatic need state of the individual.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A close social network confers a survival advantage, both in the wild and in the laboratory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Indeed, our brains have evolved to adapt to many changing conditions, including when we are with others and when we are alone. Many neuromodulatory systems and neural circuits engaged in social behaviors may serve a distinct function when social stimuli are not present. In non-social contexts, dopamine transporter-expressing dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN<sup>DAT</sup>) neurons can promote incentive memory expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, antinociception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, fear response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> – showing a clear role in many functions essential for survival. Moreover, DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons undergo synaptic strengthening after social isolation and increase responsiveness to social stimuli, and stimulation of these neurons induces a prosocial state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Strikingly, a functional imaging study in humans similarly revealed that 10 hours of social isolation heightened midbrain responses to social stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In mice, we further demonstrated that photostimulation of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons not only promoted social preference, but also induced place avoidance, suggesting an aversive internal state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. This led us to infer a role for these neurons in motivating social approach, driven by the desire to quell a negative state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and playing a role in social homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Taken together, this suggests a broad functional role for DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons in motivating adaptive, survival-promoting behaviors under both social and non-social conditions. While the multi-functional role of dopamine neurons in the DRN seems clear, it is yet unclear how these cells exert their influence at a circuit level, and the question remains: how do DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons simultaneously motivate social approach while also inducing a negative state consistent with place avoidance? What downstream targets receive this signal, and how do they respond?</p>
<p>There are several circuit motifs and neural encoding strategies that could enable DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons to simultaneous regulate these behavioral states and motivate adaptive responses. In a drive-state sequence model, if these DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons were the control center in the social homeostat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, the unpleasant state of being isolated could then feed-forward in a sequential chain to induce motivation to rectify this social deficit. However, in an effector state activation model, many parallel actions may be taken to address the challenge, and a pervasive behavioral state may be triggered by a neuromodulatory broadcast signal. In a parallel circuit model, distinct functional roles may be associated with projection-defined subpopulations in parallel (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>)</sup>, and neurons may simultaneously encode multiple types of information (i.e. exhibit ‘mixed selectivity’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>) or behavioral output may be governed by context- or state-dependency (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)</sup>. Yet, the mechanisms through which DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons exert their influence over social behavior has yet to be unraveled.</p>
<p>Here, we addressed the question of how DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons modulate both sociability and valence, by exploring the functional role and anatomical targets of distinct DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections in mice. We show that parallel DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections to different targets play separable roles in behavior, in spite of their heavily-collateralizing anatomical arrangement. Downstream, we find that within DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminal fields, there is spatial segregation of dopamine and neuropeptide receptor expression. Furthermore, photostimulation of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> inputs can modulate downstream neuronal excitability depending on their baseline cell properties. Lastly, we find that DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input enables a shift in central amygdala dynamics that allows it to predict social preference. These findings highlight the anatomical and functional heterogeneity that exists at multiple levels within the DRN<sup>DAT</sup> system. We suggest this organization may underlie the capacity of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup> system to exert a broad influence over different forms of behavior: allowing coordinated control over downstream neuronal activity and across the brain to signal a behavioral state that mimics a loneliness-like phenotype.</p>

<title>DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons project to and exhibit dense collateralization to distinct subregions of the amygdala and extended amygdala</title>
<p>To explore the circuit motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and computational implementation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> through which the DRN<sup>DAT</sup> system might operate, we examined whether discrete DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections underlie distinct features of behavior.

<p>We next considered the anatomical organization of these projections to determine whether form gives rise to function. In other words, we investigated whether DRN<sup>DAT</sup> outputs exhibit a circuit arrangement that facilitates a coordinated behavioral response. Axonal collateralization is one circuit feature that facilitates coordinated activity across broadly distributed structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Although VTA<sup>DAT</sup> projections to striatal and cortical regions typically show little evidence of collateralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, in contrast, DRN serotonergic neurons collateralize heavily to innervate the prefrontal cortex, striatum, midbrain, and amygdala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. However, it has yet to be determined whether DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons are endowed with this property.</p>
<p>To assess whether DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons exhibit axon collaterals, we performed dual retrograde tracing with fluorophore-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. We injected each tracer into two of the three downstream sites (BNST, CeA, and/or BLP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>) and, after 7 days for retrograde transport, we examined CTB-expressing cells in the DRN that were co-labelled with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). CTB injections into the BNST and CeA resulted in numerous TH+ cells labelled with both CTB-conjugated fluorophores, but fewer dual-labelled cells were observed when injections were placed in the BNST and BLP, or CeA and BLP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D-E</xref>). These data suggest significant collateralization to the extended amygdala, which includes the BNST and CeA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. To confirm the presence of axon collaterals we employed an intersectional viral strategy to selectively label CeA-projecting DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons with cytoplasmic eYFP (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F-G</xref>). This resulted in eYFP-expressing terminals both in the CeA and in the BNST (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H-I</xref>).</p>

<p>We first assessed whether photostimulation was sufficient to support place preference using the real-time place-preference (RTPP) assay. Here, we found that photostimulation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP projection, but not the projection to the BNST or CeA, produced avoidance of the stimulation zone, relative to eYFP controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-G</xref>).

<p>Next, to gain further insight into the functional divergence of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections in ethological behaviors, we assessed the effects of photostimulation on social interaction with a novel juvenile in the home-cage. Here, photoactivation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection modestly increased face sniffing of the juvenile mouse, consistent with a pro-social role for this projection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J-L</xref>), although no correlation between optically-induced change in face sniffing and social dominance was observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4M-O</xref>). When we plotted the difference score (ON-OFF) for face sniffing against rearing (ON-OFF) (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4— figure supplement 2A-C</xref>), we observed that DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BNST mice tended to engage in more rearing and less face sniffing during photostimulation (i.e. located in the upper left quadrant) whereas DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA mice tended to exhibit less rearing and more face sniffing during photostimulation (i.e. located in the lower right quadrant).</p>
<p>To explore the relationship between social dominance and baseline behavioral profile, we applied a data-driven approach by examining behavioral measures obtained from different assays in a correlation matrix (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This showed a weak, negative correlation between social dominance and open arm time in the elevated plus maze (EPM) – consistent with a previous report of higher trait anxiety in dominant mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. However, social dominance did not correlate significantly with any other behavioral variable. Additionally, our analysis of baseline behavioral profile revealed a robust negative correlation between the time spent engaged in social sniffing and time spent rearing (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Furthermore, following dimensionality reduction on baseline behavioral variables, we did not find clearly differentiated clusters of high- and low-ranked mice (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>), suggesting that the variation governing these latent behavioral features is not related to social rank.</p>
<p>Finally, to determine whether DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA photostimulation affected the probability of behavioral state transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, we examined the sequential structure of behavior using a First-order Markov model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Considering a 2-state model consisting of ‘social’ and ‘nonsocial’ behaviors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4P</xref>), we found that photostimulation in DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA mice did not significantly change the probability of transitioning within social and nonsocial state (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4Q</xref>), but did significantly change the probability of transitioning between social and nonsocial states (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4R</xref>). This suggests that the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection may increase engagement in social behavior by altering the overall structure of behavioral transitions.</p>

<title>DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminal fields contain spatially-segregated dopamine and neuropeptide receptor populations</title>
<p>Our data suggest that DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections exert divergent effects over behavior, despite substantial overlap in their upstream cells of origin. Given this overlap, we reasoned that one mechanism through which these projections might achieve distinct behavioral effects is via differential recruitment of downstream signaling pathways. We, therefore, next considered whether the pattern of receptor expression differed within the DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminal field of these downstream regions.</p>
<p>Subsets of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons co-express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and neuropeptide-W (NPW)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, and so we examined both dopamine (<italic>Drd1</italic> and <italic>Drd2</italic>) and neuropeptide (<italic>Vipr2</italic> and <italic>Npbwr1</italic>) receptor expression within DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminal fields. To achieve this, we performed single molecule fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (smFISH) using RNAscope (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). In the BNST and CeA we observed a strikingly similar pattern of receptor expression with dense neuropeptide receptor expression in the oval BNST and ventromedial CeL, and a high degree of co-localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-H</xref>). In the BNST and CeA subregions containing the highest density of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals, dopamine receptor expression was relatively more sparse, with <italic>Drd2</italic> more abundant than <italic>Drd1</italic>, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-H</xref>). The DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminal field of the BLP displayed a markedly different receptor expression pattern, dominated by <italic>Drd1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I-L</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I-K</xref>), consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Thus, in contrast to the BNST and CeA, the effects of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input to the BLP may be predominantly mediated via D<sub>1</sub>-receptor signaling. Collectively, this expression pattern suggests that the dopamine- and neuropeptide-mediated effects of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input may be spatially-segregated within downstream regions – providing the infrastructure for divergent modulation of cellular subsets.</p>

<p>Given the diversity of responses observed in the CeA and BLP, we next examined these downstream cells in more detail. To assess whether baseline electrophysiological properties predicted the optically-evoked response, we used unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering to classify downstream cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L-M</xref>). This established approach has been successfully applied to electrophysiological datasets to reveal distinct neuronal subclasses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>. The resulting dendrograms yielded two major clusters in the CeA and BLP, with distinct electrophysiological characteristics (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N-Q</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H-K</xref>). CeA cells in cluster 1 represented ‘late-firing’ neurons, whereas cluster 2 were typical of ‘regular-firing’ neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref></sup>. Strikingly, these clusters exhibited dramatically different response to DRN<sup>DAT</sup> photostimulation, with cluster 1 ‘late-firing’ neurons excited and cluster 2 ‘regular-firing’ neurons mostly inhibited (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6O</xref>). Similarly, BLP cells delineated into two major clusters, with properties characteristic of pyramidal neurons (cluster 1) and GABAergic interneurons (cluster 2) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6P-Q</xref>). These clusters showed remarkably different responses to DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input, with 93% of putative pyramidal neurons showing an inhibitory response, and 62% of putative GABAergic interneurons showing an excitatory response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Q</xref>). In addition, clustering CeA and BLP cells together yielded a very similar result (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1L-N</xref>). Thus, while photoactivation of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals elicits heterogeneous responses in downstream neurons, baseline cell properties strongly predict their response, suggesting robust synaptic organization. The opposing nature of these responses, in different neuronal subsets, suggests that – rather than inducing an overall augmentation or suppression of activity – DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input may adjust the <italic>pattern</italic> of downstream activity, in order to exert a functional shift in behavior.</p>

<title>DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input enables a functional shift in CeA dynamics to predict social preference</title>
<p>Our data thus far suggest that photostimulation of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections to downstream extended amygdala targets elicits divergent behaviors that are, together, congruent with a loneliness-like state, with the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection promoting sociability. Considering the diversity of responses in the CeA elicited by DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input <italic>ex vivo</italic>, we next wondered how DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input into the CeA <italic>in vivo</italic> during a behaviorally-relevant task may modify how the CeA represents social information. Neuromodulatory input has been previously shown to alter responses to salient stimuli—for instance, stimulation of VTA dopamine terminals increases the signal-to-noise ratio to aversive stimuli in projection-specific populations of prefrontal cortex neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. However, how DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input modifies the coding scheme of CeA neurons for social information remains unknown.</p>
<p>Therefore, to test the hypothesis that DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input alters the responses of CeA neurons to functionally-relevant stimuli, we examined the dynamics of CeA neurons while simultaneously stimulating DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals during a three chamber sociability task. To achieve this, we expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP7f nonspecifically in the CeA and either the red-shifted opsin ChrimsonR or a control fluorophore (TdTomato) in the DRN of DAT::Cre mice, and additionally implanted a gradient index (GRIN) lens over the CeA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This allowed us to stimulate DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals in the CeA while resolving single-cell calcium dynamics in the CeA <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). We confirmed <italic>ex vivo</italic> that blue light delivery alone onto DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals did not elicit a ChrimsonR-mediated postsynaptic potential in CeA neurons (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-F</xref>), and that red light delivery was still capable of eliciting ChrimsonR-mediated EPSPs and IPSPs during continuous delivery of blue light (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G-I</xref>).</p>

<p>We then performed microendoscopic epifluorescent calcium imaging during the three-chamber sociability task where mice freely-explored a chamber containing a novel juvenile mouse and a novel object at opposite ends. Given that social isolation produces changes in long-term potentiation of synapses onto DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, we were limited to a single manipulation of social isolation for each mouse. We hypothesized that stimulation of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> inputs to CeA would mimic a loneliness-like state, consistent with our ChR2 manipulations with group-housed mice. Thus, we compared three conditions—group-housed without DRN<sup>DAT</sup> stimulation (GH off), group-housed with DRN<sup>DAT</sup> stimulation (GH on), and 24 hours socially isolated without DRN<sup>DAT</sup> stimulation (SI off) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-D</xref>) to allow for within-subjects comparisons.</p>
<p>In contrast to the photostimulation experiments in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, here we aimed to investigate the impact of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neuron stimulation on neural dynamics within the CeA without inducing robust behavioral changes that could introduce sensorimotor confounds to changes in neural activity due to stimulation. We successfully optimized viral expression and illumination parameters to minimize changes in social preference with DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA with ChrimsonR to prioritize comparison of the neural dynamics (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>) and also did not observe any behavioral effects of illumination in TdTomato expressing mice (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1J-K</xref>).</p>
<p>We then aligned the recorded CeA calcium traces with social cup and object cup interactions and found a striking diversity of neuronal responses to these stimuli under the three experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig7s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). We next determined the response strength of individual CeA neurons to either stimulus under the three conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F-G</xref>) using an area under ROC curve-based approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup> to determine responsiveness of CeA neurons to social and object stimuli (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1M</xref>). At a single-cell level, we did not observe significant changes in CeA response strength or proportion of neurons significantly responding to social or object stimuli across the three conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G-H</xref>). However, we did find a trend indicating stronger responses toward social stimuli compared to object stimuli in the GH on condition compared to the GH off condition in mice expressing ChrimsonR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>), but not TdTomato (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1L</xref>) in DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons. Importantly, in co-registered neurons, we found little overlap between CeA neurons excited by the social stimulus in both GH on and GH off conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>), suggesting that DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminal stimulation may recruit separate ensembles of CeA neurons to represent social stimuli. Considering the variability in social preference behavior across mice and the diverse effects of photostimulation depending on the mouse’s social history, we next considered the responses of CeA neurons to social and object stimuli on an animal-by-animal basis. While we did not observe significant changes in the proportion of excitatory or inhibitory responses to social or object stimuli across the three conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K-L</xref>), we did find a significant positive correlation between the proportion of socially-excited CeA neurons and social preference in the GH on condition, but not in the GH off or SI off conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7M</xref>). Importantly, we do not observe a correlation between social preference and object-excited CeA neurons (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1N</xref>) or socially-inhibited CeA neurons (<xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1O</xref>). This result may suggest that DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input in the CeA in a behaviorally-relevant task allows for a functional shift in its dynamics that enables it to predict the amount of social preference the mouse exhibits.</p>

<p>Finally, considering that the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection is sufficient in promoting sociability, we next assessed whether activity in the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection is necessary for the rebound in sociability that occurs following acute social isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. We injected an AAV enabling Cre-dependent expression of NpHR into the DRN of DAT::Cre male mice, and implanted optic fibers over the BNST, CeA, or BLP (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). We allowed 7 weeks for adequate terminal expression, after which we inhibited DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals in the BNST, CeA, and BLP while mice performed the three-chamber sociability task (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Inhibition of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals in downstream regions while mice were group-housed did not change social preference (<xref rid="fig8s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). However, inhibition of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals in CeA, but not BNST or BLP, blocked the rebound in sociability associated with acute social isolation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Additionally, we found that optically-inhibited changes in social preference in DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA mice were negatively correlated with social dominance (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>), suggesting that the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection is necessary for the expression of isolation-induced social rebound in a rank-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Neural circuits that motivate social approach are essential in maintaining social connections and preventing isolation. Here we show that DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons can exert a multi-faceted influence over behavior, with the pro-social effects mediated by the projection to the CeA, the avoidance effects mediated by the projection to the BLP, and the pro-exploratory effects mediated by the projection to the BNST. Our data suggest these effects are enabled via separable functional projections, dense collateralization, co-transmission, and precisely-organized synaptic connectivity. Notably, our experiments were conducted in male mice; future work should investigate whether similar circuit mechanisms operate in females and explore the biological basis of sex-specific responses to social isolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup>. In addition, while terminal photostimulation allowed projection-specific manipulation, it may have inadvertently activated fibers of passage—a limitation that could be addressed in future studies using intersectional genetic strategies. Despite these caveats, these observed circuit features may facilitate a coordinated, but flexible, response in the presence of social stimuli, that can be flexibly guided based on internal social homeostatic need state.</p>

<p>Our findings revealed several features of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup> circuit which might facilitate a concerted response to novel social and non-social situations. Firstly, we observed dissociable roles for discrete downstream projections – a common motif of valence-encoding neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Biased recruitment of these ‘divergent paths’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> to the BNST, CeA, and BLP by upstream inputs may serve to fine-tune the balance between social investigation and environmental exploration: facilitating behavioral flexibility with changing environmental conditions or internal state. Secondly, we demonstrate extensive collateralization of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons In other populations, collateralization is proposed to aid temporal coordination of a multifaceted response: enabling synchronous activation of distributed regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. This feature may, therefore, facilitate coordinated recruitment of the BNST and CeA, allowing these regions to work in concert to promote social approach while also maintaining vigilance to salient environmental stimuli. Thirdly, we find precise synaptic organization in the DRN<sup>DAT</sup> modulation of downstream neuronal activity that allows for qualitatively distinct response profiles of downstream targets. Combined with the spatially-segregated downstream receptor expression pattern, this organization may allow DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons to elicit broad, yet finely-tuned, control over the pattern of neuronal activity, on multiple timescales—perhaps explaining the diverse behavior effects between the BNST- and CeA-projecting DRN<sup>DAT</sup> populations, despite heavy collateralization.</p>
<p>Although we hypothesized that stimulating DRN<sup>DAT</sup> inputs to the CeA in group-housed mice would mimic a state similar to that of isolation, we did not observe that the isolation OFF condition produced neural responses more similar to the group-housed ON condition. This suggests two possibilities: 1) that the photostimulation impacted neural activity beyond the endogenous dopamine innervation that may occur with social isolation because it is more potent of a change or 2) that the timing of endogenous dopamine innervation is different and is partially quenched upon exposure to a social agent. To completely understand the temporal dynamics of dopamine signaling with isolation and the firing of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons upon isolation, further experiments will require exploration of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> stimulation parameter space, endogenous neural activity in the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA circuit during social isolation, and the effects of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> stimulation timing.</p>

<title>Separable projections mediate social behavior and valence</title>
<p>Our data support the hypothesis that separable DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections mediate distinct functional roles: a feature which has been previously observed in other neuronal circuits (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>)</sup>. The DRN<sup>DAT</sup> circuit attributes we describe above may further enable this system to modulate other diverse forms of behavior (e.g. arousal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, fear/reward associations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and antinociception<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>)</sup>. These could be mediated via other downstream projections and/or via these same projections under different environmental contexts, testing conditions, social histories, and/or internal states. Further work is required to determine how this system is able to exert a broad influence over multiple forms of behavior. Indeed, a recent study examined DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projection to the nucleus accumbens and its role in promoting sociability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup>, suggesting a parallel circuit to that described in the current study. Collectively, however, our data and others support a role for the DRN<sup>DAT</sup> system in exerting a coordinated behavioral response to novel situations – both social and non-social.</p>
<p>The CeA has been implicated in mediating the response to threats – orchestrating defensive behavioral responses and autonomic changes via efferents to subcortical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">116</xref></sup> and brainstem nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">117</xref></sup>. One possible interpretation, therefore, is that DRN<sup>DAT</sup> input to the CeA suppresses fear-promoting neuronal ensembles in order to facilitate social approach. In the maintenance of social homeostasis, suppression of fear in the presence of social stimuli may represent an adaptive response – preventing salient social stimuli from being interpreted as a threat. Indeed, other need states, such as hunger, are associated with fear suppression and higher-risk behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref></sup>, suggesting a conserved response to homeostatic imbalance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, the motivation to attend to social stimuli may also be driven by territorial defense (interacting with social rank), highlighting a need to further understand how internal states can play into the output of this system. A more comprehensive knowledge of the functional cell-types modulated by DRN<sup>DAT</sup> activity will facilitate our understanding of how this input can shape the downstream neuronal representation of social and non-social stimuli.</p>
<p>In contrast to the CeA, photoactivation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP projection produced avoidance of the stimulation zone, suggesting an aversive state. This differs from the valence-independent role of VTA dopamine input to the greater BLA complex, wherein dopamine signaling gates synaptic plasticity for associative learning of both positive and negative valence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> and responds to salient stimuli predicting both positive and negative outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. However, DRN and VTA axonal fields differ within the BLA complex, with DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals being more concentrated within the BLP, and VTA<sup>DAT</sup> inputs traversing the LA, BLA and intercalated cells more densely.</p>
<p>While there have been seemingly contradictory reports on the effect of dopamine on excitability in the BLA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, our observations using photostimulation of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals (in short phasic bursts) are consistent with <italic>in vivo</italic> extracellular recordings combined with electrical stimulation of the midbrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. One unifying hypothesis is that dopamine induces an <italic>indirect</italic> GABA-mediated suppression of pyramidal neurons, which may attenuate their response to weak inputs, while <italic>directly</italic> exciting pyramidal neurons to augment their response to large inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>. In this way, amygdala dopamine may underlie a similar role to cortical dopamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref></sup> – enhancing signal-to-noise ratio to facilitate behavioral responses to salient stimuli <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A similar complexity surrounds dopamine’s effects in the BNST. Photostimulation of DRN<sup>DA</sup>-BNST projections have been shown to have antinociceptive effects on male mice upon formalin injection into the paw, whereas females do not show this antinociceptive effect and instead display contextual hyperlocomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Given that our study does not include females, there are likely behavioral and physiological sex differences that begs further investigation. Additionally, prior studies using optogenetic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> or exogenously applied dopamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref></sup> report a wide range of outcomes on BNST excitability, including a higher frequency of inhibitory responses that we observed. Notably, one study found that higher doses of exogenously applied dopamine decreased the amplitude of GABA<sub>A</sub>-IPSC in ovBNST neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, potentially consistent with our results. Interestingly, animals given intermittent access to sucrose displayed a significant increase in GABA<sub>A</sub>-IPSCs in ovBNST neurons following dopamine application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that experience-dependent factors shape dopamine sensitivity in the BNST, paralleling how dopaminergic modulation in the cortex may be state-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>. Considering that our <italic>ex</italic> vivo recordings were performed in group housed mice, future work should test whether social isolation alters ovBNST responses to dopamine, providing a framework for understanding how environmental states influence dopaminergic neuromodulatory tone.</p>

<title>Multi-transmitter phenotype of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons may permit modulation on different timescales</title>
<p>DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons possess an impressive repertoire of signaling molecules: alongside dopamine and glutamate subsets of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neuron express VIP and NPW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. While there is some partial segregation of VIP- and NPW-expressing neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>, our receptor expression analyses suggest that these neuropeptides converge on the same neurons in the BNST and CeA. This co-localization is intriguing, given that <italic>Vipr2</italic> is typically coupled to the excitatory G<sub>s</sub>-protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">121</xref></sup>, while <italic>Npbwr1</italic> is coupled to the inhibitory G<sub>i</sub>-protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup>. Therefore, signaling through these receptors may exert opposing actions on downstream cells. Recruitment of neuropeptidergic signaling pathways may support slower, sustained downstream modulation, for example, in hunger-mediating hypothalamic Agouti-Related Peptide (AgRP) neurons, neuropeptide co-release is essential for sustaining feeding behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref></sup>. Therefore, a delayed, persistent neuropeptide-mediated signal might enable downstream modulation to outlive phasic DRN<sup>DAT</sup> activity: promoting behavioral adjustments over longer timescales.</p>
<p>While the functional role of these neuropeptides remains to be elucidated, studies on knockout mice suggest a role for NPW in social behavior and stress responding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in humans with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the <italic>NPBWR1</italic> gene (which impairs receptor function) the perception of fearful/angry faces was more positive and less submissive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref></sup>, suggesting a possible role for NPW signaling in interpreting social signals. Similarly, the function of DRN VIP+ neurons has received little attention in rodent models, but there has been more focus on the role of VIP in avian social behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref></sup>. Of particular interest, in the rostral arcopallium (a homolog of mammalian amygdala<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref></sup>), VIP binding density is elevated in birds during seasonal flocking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref></sup>. This suggests that elevated VIP receptor expression may encourage affiliative social grouping behavior in birds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref></sup>. Thus, NPW and VIP may act in concert with fast glutamate-mediated and slow dopamine-mediated neurotransmission in the central extended amygdala, to modulate behavior on different timescales.</p>
<p>Together, these findings suggest that NPW and VIP may act in concert with fast glutamate and slower dopamine signaling to shape social behavior across multiple timescales within the extended amygdala. Although we observed relatively low expression of <italic>Drd1</italic> in the BNST and CeA compared to <italic>Vipr2</italic> and <italic>Npbwr1</italic>, it remains possible that dopamine’s effects are mediated by other receptors, such as <italic>Drd3, Drd4,</italic> and <italic>Drd5</italic>—warranting further investigation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Together, these findings reveal that DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections exhibit substantial functional specialization, with anatomically distinct pathways modulating different facets of behavior. The DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection promotes sociability, DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP input drives avoidance, and DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BNST enhances vigilant exploration, highlighting the diverse roles of this neural circuit in coordinating adaptive responses to social and environmental contexts. These findings uncover a circuit mechanism through which DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections orchestrate distinct behavioral features of a loneliness-like state, providing a framework for understanding how neuromodulatory systems guide complex social and emotional behaviors and suggesting potential targets for therapeutic intervention in affective disorders.</p>

<title>Surgery and viral constructs</title>
<p>Mice (&gt;7 weeks of age) were anaesthetized with isoflurane (inhalation: 4% for induction, ∼2% for maintenance, oxygen flow rate 1 L/min) before being placed in a digital small animal stereotax (David Kopf Instruments, CA, USA). Surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions with body temperature maintained by a heating pad throughout. Injections of recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, herpes simplex virus (HSV), or cholera toxin subunit-B (CTB) were performed using a beveled 33 gauge microinjection needle with a 10 μL microsyringe (Nanofil; WPI, FL, USA). Virus or CTB was delivered at a rate of 0.1 μL/min using a microsyringe pump (UMP3; WPI, FL, USA) connected to a Micro4 controller (WPI, FL, USA). Following injection, the needle was maintained in place for ∼2 min, then raised up by 0.05 mm and held for ∼10 min (to permit diffusion from the injection site) before being slowly withdrawn. Skull measurements were made relative to Bregma for all injections and implants. Implants were secured to the skull by a layer of adhesive cement (C&amp;B Metabond; Parkell Inc., NY, USA) followed by a layer of black cranioplastic cement (Ortho-Jet; Lang, IL, USA). Mice were given pre-emptive analgesia (1 mg/kg buprenorphine slow-release; sub-cutaneous; delivered concurrent with warmed Ringer’s solution to prevent dehydration), supplemented with meloxicam (1.5 mg/kg; sub-cutaneous) where necessary, and were monitored on a heating pad until recovery from anesthesia.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Mice were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal; IP) or euthasol (150 mg/kg; IP) followed by transcardial perfusion with 10 mL ice-cold Ringer’s solution and 15 mL ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain was carefully dissected from the cranial cavity and immersed in 4% PFA for ∼6-18 h before transfer to 30% sucrose solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C. After at least 48 hr, brains were sectioned at 40 µm on a freezing sliding microtome (HM430; Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and sections stored at 4°C in 1X PBS. For immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBS-T; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) with 3% normal donkey serum (NDS; Jackson Immunoresearch, PA, USA) for 30-60 min at room temperature. This was followed by incubation in primary antibody solution chicken anti-TH (1:1000; AB9702; EMD Millipore, MA, USA) in 0.3% PBS-T with 3% NDS) overnight at 4°C. Sections were then washed in 1X PBS four times (10 min each) before incubation in secondary antibody solution containing donkey anti-chicken 488 or 647 (1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch, PA, USA) and a DNA-specific fluorescent probe (DAPI; 1:50000; Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) in 0.2% PBS-T with 3% NDS for 1.5-2 hr at room temperature.

<p>In DAT::Cre mice, AAV<sub>5</sub>-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-eYFP (300 nL) was injected into the DRN (ML:1.20, AP:-4.10, DV:-2.90; needle at a 20° angle from the midline, bevel facing medial) or VTA (ML:0.85, AP:-2.70, DV:-4.50), and after 8 weeks mice underwent perfusion-fixation. Brains were subsequently sectioned at 40 µm, processed with immunohistochemistry for TH and DAPI, and serial z-stack images (3 µm optical thickness) collected at 20X on a confocal microscope. (See <italic>‘Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy’</italic> section above for details). A maximum projection was generated in FIJI and background subtraction based on the ‘rolling ball’ algorithm (radius = 50 pixels) was applied to correct for uneven illumination. The appropriate brain atlas slice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref></sup> was overlaid onto the fluorescent image using the BigWarp plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/BigWarp">https://imagej.net/BigWarp</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">133</xref></sup> in FIJI, by designating major anatomical landmarks based on DAPI staining and TH expression. Regions of interest (ROIs) were then annotated from the overlaid atlas, and mean fluorescence within each ROI quantified using FIJI. The PFC was examined from AP: 2.22 to 1.34, the striatum from AP 1.70 to 0.74, the BNST from AP 0.37 to -0.11, the CeA from AP -0.82 to -1.94, and the amygdala from AP -0.82 to -2.92. Average images in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, 5A, 5E, and 5I were created by aligning individual images (from the middle AP region of the BNST, CeA, or BLP), using the line ROI registration plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Align_Image_by_line_ROI">https://imagej.net/Align_Image_by_line_ROI</ext-link>) in FIJI.

<title>Retrograde tracing and intersectional viral expression</title>
<p>C57BL/6 mice were injected with 150-250 nL CTB conjugated to Alexa Fluor-555 (CTB-555) or Alexa Fluor-647 (CTB-647; Molecular Probes, OR, USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">134</xref></sup>) in two of three locations: the BNST (ML:1.10, AP:0.50, DV: -4.30; needle bevel facing back), CeA (ML:2.85, AP: -1.20; DV:-4.75; needle bevel facing back), or BLP (ML:3.35, AP:-2.20, DV:-5.25; needle bevel facing back). To assess retrograde CTB co-expression following injection of both fluorophore-conjugates of CTB into the same region (<xref rid="fig1s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>), injections were either performed sequentially, or CTB-555 and CTB-647 were mixed prior to a single injection. After 7 days to allow for retrograde transport, mice were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) and perfused-fixed for subsequent histology. Brain sections containing injection sites and the DRN were prepared at 40 µm and processed with immunohistochemistry for TH and DAPI. (See <italic>‘Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy’</italic> section above for details). CTB injection sites were verified with images acquired on a confocal microscope through a 10X objective (serial z-stack with 5 µm optical thickness) and images of the DRN were acquired through a 40X objective (serial z-stack with 3 µm optical thickness). DRN cells co-expressing CTB and TH were counted manually using the ROI ‘point’ tool in Fluoview software version 4.0 (Olympus, PA, USA). Counted files were imported into FIJI, and images overlaid onto the appropriate brain atlas image of the DRN using the BigWarp plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/BigWarp">https://imagej.net/BigWarp</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">133</xref></sup>. The x-y coordinates of counted/marked CTB+/TH+ cells were extracted using the ‘Measure’ function in FIJI.

<p>Intersectional labelling of the dopaminergic projection from the DRN to the CeA was achieved by injecting HSV-LS1L-mCherry-IRES-flpo (300 nL) into the CeA (ML:2.85, AP:-1.45, DV:-4.55; needle bevel facing medial) and AAV<sub>5</sub>-fDIO-eYFP (300 nL) into the DRN (ML:1.20, AP:-4.10, DV:-2.90; needle at a 20° angle from the midline, bevel facing medial) of a DAT::Cre mouse. After 8 weeks, mice were perfused-fixed with 4% PFA, and the brain sectioned on a freezing microtome at 40 µm before immunohistochemical processing with TH and DAPI.

Behavioral experiments commenced 7-8 weeks following surgery. Mice were handled and habituated to patch cable connection once per day for at least 3 days before beginning optical manipulations. Behavioral testing was performed in dimly-lit soundproofed room during the mice’s active dark phase (∼10am-5pm). On each testing day, mice were given at least 1 hr to acclimate to the testing room before experiments began. For optical manipulations, optic fiber implants were connected to a patch cable via a ceramic sleeve (Precision Fiber Products, CA, USA), which itself was connected to a commutator (rotary joint; Doric, Québec, Canada) using an FC/PC adapter, to permit uninhibited movement. The commutator, in turn, was connected via a second patch cable (with FC/PC connectors) to a 473 nm diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) laser (OEM Laser Systems, UT, USA). To control the output of the laser, a Master-8 pulse stimulator (AMPI, Israel) was used, and the light power set to 10 mW.</p>

<title>Tube test</title>
<p>Cages of mice (same-sex groups of 2-4) were assayed for social dominance using the tube test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Mice were individually trained to pass through a clear Plexiglas tube (30 cm length, 3.2 cm inner diameter) over 4 days. Each training trial involved releasing the mouse into the tube from one end, and ensuring it traveled through and out the other side. Mice which attempted to reverse, or were reluctant to exit at the other end of the tube, were gently encouraged forwards by light pressure from a plastic stick pressing on their hind region. Between trials mice freely explored the open arena outside tube (76 x 60 cm) for ∼30-60 s. Mice performed 8 training trials (4 from each end) on days 1 and 2, and 3 trials (alternating ends) on days 3 and 4. On days 5-8 mice competed against cagemates in a round-robin design. For each contest, mice were released simultaneously into opposite ends of the tube so that they met face-to-face in the center of the tube. The mouse which retreated from the confrontation was designated as the ‘loser’ and his opponent designated the ‘winner’. Across testing days, the side from which animals were released and the order in which they were tested against cagemates was counterbalanced. An animal’s ‘relative dominance’ score reflected their proportion of ‘wins’ across all contests from 3-4 days of testing.</p>

An upturned wire mesh cup was placed in the left and right compartments. Each mouse first underwent a habituation session (10 min) where they freely explored the chamber. They were then briefly (∼1 min) confined to the center compartment by the insertion of clear Plexiglas walls, while a novel object was placed under one of the two upturned cups, and a juvenile C57BL/6 mouse (3.5-5 weeks of age) was placed under the other upturned cup. The mice were then allowed to freely explore the chamber for a further 10 min. The task was repeated on the second day, with the chamber rotated by 90° relative to external spatial cues, and with a different novel object and novel juvenile mouse. The 10 min test epoch was paired with blue light delivery (8 pulses with 5 ms pulse-width, at 30 Hz, every 5 s) on one of the two days, counterbalanced across animals. Mice were excluded if they showed a strong preference (&gt;70% time spent) for one side of the chamber in the habituation phase, or if they spent more than 1 min on top of the upturned cups during any session. For photoinhibition experiments, the protocol was exactly the same as the ChR2 experiment, except the 10 min test epoch was paired with constant yellow light (589nm) delivery for one day in the ‘group-housed’ and also during the additional ‘isolated’ condition. Animals were recorded using a video camera positioned above the chamber and movement tracked using Ethovision XT (Noldus, Netherlands). The social:object ratio reflected the time spent in the ‘social’ side of the chamber (containing a novel juvenile mouse) divided by the time spent in the ‘object’ side of the chamber (containing a novel object).</p>

<p>Mice were tested individually in their home cage. They freely explored alone for 5 min after which a novel juvenile mouse was placed in the cage for a further 3 min. The task was repeated on the second day with a different novel juvenile mouse. One of the two sessions was paired with blue light delivery (8 pulses with 5 ms pulse-width, at 30 Hz, every 5 s) which commenced after 2 min and continued until the end of the task (6 min total). The behavior of the mouse during the 3 min with the juvenile was scored manually using ODLog software (Macropod Software, Australia). Video files were scored twice (by two different observers, blinded to the experimental conditions) and the average of their counts was used for analysis.

Mice freely explored for 15 min, with blue light (8 pulses with 5 ms pulse-width, at 30 Hz, every 5 s) delivered during the middle 5 min epoch of the session.

Mice freely explored for 30 min, during which entry into one side of the chamber resulted in delivery of blue light (15 pulses with 5 ms pulse-width, at 30 Hz, every 5 s), which continued until mice exited the zone. Entry into the opposite side did not result in blue light delivery. The side paired with blue light delivery was counterbalanced across animals.

<title>Intra-cranial self-stimulation (ICSS)</title>
<p>Mice were food deprived for 16-20 hr prior to each day of ICSS, in order to encourage behavioral responding. Testing was conducted in an operant chamber (Med Associates, VT, USA) within a custom sound-attenuating outer box. The operant chamber contained two illuminated nose-poke ports, each with an infrared beam, and a cue light positioned above each port. White noise was delivered continuously throughout the session, and successful nose-pokes (signaled by a beam break) resulted in an auditory tone (1 s duration, 1 or 1.5 kHz) and illumination of the respective cue light. A nose-poke at the ‘active’ port also triggered delivery of blue light (90 pulses with 5 ms pulse-width, at 30 Hz) while a nose-poke at the ‘inactive’ port did not trigger light delivery. The physical location of the active and inactive nose-poke ports, and the auditory tone frequency associated with each port, was counterbalanced across animals. On day 1 (training), mice completed a 2 hr session in the operant chamber in which both nose-poke ports were baited with a small amount of palatable food, in order to encourage investigation. On day 2 (testing), mice completed an identical 2 hr session, except the nose-poke ports were not baited. Nose-poke activity was recorded with MedPC software (Med Associates, VT, USA) and subject-averaged cumulative distribution plots were generated using MATLAB (Mathworks, MA, USA). Only data from day 2 was used for analysis.</p>

<title>Analysis of baseline behavior</title>
<p>The baseline behavior of all mice (i.e without stimulation) was evaluated to uncover any relationships between specific types of behavior assessed in different tasks. These analyses used relative dominance from the tube test, the first 5 min of the OFT and EPM, and the OFF trial from the three-chamber sociability and juvenile intruder assays. Correlation matrices were generated in GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) to show the Pearson’s correlation coefficient for each pair of variables.</p>
<p>Dimensionality reduction was performed on baseline behavior data using principal component analysis (PCA) with the scikit-learn module<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">136</xref></sup> in Python. The eight input measures from behavioral assays were (1) percent time moving in the OFT, (2) time in the center of the OFT, (3) time in the open arms of the EPM, (4) social:object ratio in the three chamber assay, and (5) time spent face sniffing, (6) anogenital sniffing, (7) rearing, and (8) grooming in the juvenile intruder assay. The data was first normalized to generate a covariance matrix and then the first 5 PCs were extracted. Relative dominance was concatenated with the resulting PC values for each mouse to color-code individual points in the PC1 vs PC2 plot.</p>

<title>First order Markov analysis</title>
<p>Behavioral videos from the juvenile intruder assay were manually annotated so that each second of the 180 s session was assigned a code(s) from 15 behavioral categories:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>- Social behaviors: face sniff (reciprocated), face sniff (non-reciprocated), flank sniff, anogenital sniff (reciprocated), anogenital sniff (non-reciprocated), close follow, approach, dominant climb, attack.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>- Nonsocial behaviors: groom, dig, rear, climb, still, ambulate.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We designed a 2-state Markov model, in which behaviors were assigned to either the ‘social’ or ‘nonsocial’ categories. For each animal, we created a transition probability matrix from each sequence by counting the number of transitions that occurred and dividing by the total number of occurrences of that behavior. To compute the overall transition probability matrix for the eYFP and ChR2 groups, we took the mean of the transition probability across all individuals in that group. Difference scores between the stimulation OFF and ON sessions were calculated by taking the difference across pairs of transition probability matrices corresponding to each individual, then calculating the mean across eYFP or ChR2-expressing mice.</p>
<p>To verify that a first order Markov model was an appropriate fit for our data we computed the log likelihood chi squared statistic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">137</xref></sup>:

<graphic xlink:href="636224v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

where <italic>0</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> ≥ 0 is the observed number of transitions from state i to j, <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> ≥ 0 is the expected number of transitions from state i to state j assuming a zeroth order Markov (i.e., no time dependence). We found that G was statistically significant for all subjects in both the 15 state and 2 state models, thus rejecting the null hypothesis of randomly transitioning between states.</p>
<p>We also tested whether a non-stationary model was a better fit for the data than a stationary model. To do this, we divided each subject’s behavioral sequence into two segments of equal duration and computed transition probability matrices for each segment. We then computed a variation on the likelihood ratio chi square statistic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">137</xref></sup>:

<p>DAT::Cre mice received an injection of 300 nL AAV<sub>5</sub>-DIO-ChR2-eYFP or AAV<sub>9</sub>-FLEX-ChrimsonR-TdTomato in the DRN (ML:1.20, AP:-4.10, DV:-2.90; needle at a 20° angle from the midline, bevel facing medial), and after at least 8 weeks for transgene expression, mice were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) or euthasol (150 mg/kg; IP). They were then transcardially perfused with ice-cold (∼4°C) modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; composition in mM: NaCl 87, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4*H20 1.3, MgCl2*6H2O 7, NaHCO3 25, sucrose 75, ascorbate 5, CaCl2*2H2O 0.5, in ddH20; osmolarity 320-330 mOsm, pH 7.30-7.40), saturated with carbogen gas (95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide) before the brain was rapidly and carefully extracted from the cranial cavity. Thick coronal (300 µm) slices containing the BNST, CeA, BLP, and DRN were prepared on a vibrating blade vibratome (VT1200; Leica Biosystems, Germany), in ice-cold modified ACSF saturated with carbogen gas. Brain slices were hemisected with a scalpel blade before transfer to a holding chamber containing ACSF (composition in mM: NaCl 126, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4*H20 1.25, MgCl2*6H2O 1, NaHCO3 26, glucose 10, CaCl2*H2O 2.4; osmolarity 298-302 mOsm, pH 7.30-7.40) saturated with carbogen, in a warm water bath (∼30°C).</p>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings were commenced after the slices had rested for at least 45 min. During recording, the brain slice was maintained in a bath with continuously perfused ACSF, saturated with carbogen, at 31±1°C using a peristaltic pump (Minipuls3; Gilson, WI, USA). Slices were visualized through an upright microscope (Scientifica, UK) equipped with infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics and a Q-imaging Retiga Exi camera (Q Imaging, Canada). In the BNST, CeA, and BLP, recordings were performed in the region containing fluorescent DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals (expressing ChR2-eYFP or Chrimson-TdTomato) with neurons visualized through a 40X/0.80 NA water immersion objective. Terminal expression was confirmed by brief illumination from a 470 nm LED light source (pE-100; CoolLED, NY, USA) for ChR2-eYFP, or a metal halide lamp (Lumen 200; Prior Scientific Inc., UK), for ChrimsonR-TdTomato, combined with the appropriate filter set. Borosilicate glass capillaries were shaped on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument, CA, USA) to produce pipettes for recording that had resistance values of 3.5-5 MOhm when filled with internal solution (composition in mM: potassium gluconate 125, NaCl 10, HEPES 20, MgATP 3, and 0.1% neurobiotin, in ddH20 (osmolarity 287 mOsm; pH 7.3). Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made using pClamp 10.4 software (Molecular Devices, CA, USA), with analog signals amplified using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier, filtered at 3 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1550 (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). A 5 mV, 250 ms hyperpolarizing step was used to monitor cell health throughout the experiment, and recordings were terminated if significant changes (&gt;20%) occurred to series resistance (R<sub>s</sub>), input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>), or holding current.</p>
<p>Passive cell properties (capacitance, membrane resistance) were estimated from the current response to hyperpolarizing 5 mV, 250 ms steps, delivered in voltage-clamp from a holding potential of -70 mV, using custom MATLAB code written by Praneeth Namburi, based on MATLAB implementation of the Q-Method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">138</xref></sup>. To examine the membrane potential response to current injection, cells were recorded in current-clamp mode, and a series of 1 s steps were delivered, in 20 pA increments, from - 120 pA to 260 pA. The voltage sag amplitude (attributable to the hyperpolarization-activated cation current; I<sub>h</sub>) was measured as the difference between the peak instantaneous and steady-state membrane potential elicited during a -120 pA step (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref>). The ramp ratio was calculated by dividing the average membrane potential between 900-1000 ms by the membrane potential between 100-200 ms following step onset, using the largest current step that elicited a subthreshold response (i.e. did not evoke action potentials). The firing delay was taken as the time between current step onset and the first elicited action potential, on delivery of the first current step that was elicited a suprathreshold response (i.e. rheobase current). The max instantaneous firing frequency (max freq.<sub>inst</sub>) was taken as the maximum firing frequency attained during the first 100 ms of the depolarizing current steps.</p>
<p>To photostimulate ChR2-expressing DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals in the BNST, CeA, and BLP, 470 nm light was delivered through the 40X/0.8 NA objective from an LED light source (pE-100; CoolLED, NY, USA). Neurons were recorded at their resting membrane potential in current-clamp mode, and 470 nm light (8 pulses at 30 Hz, 5ms pulse-width) was delivered every 30 s. In a minority of cells which showed spontaneous activity at the resting potential, negative current was injected to hold the cell at a subthreshold potential (typically ∼-60 mV). The peak amplitude of the optically-evoked excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) or trough amplitude of the inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP) was measured from the average trace using Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices, CA, USA), using the 5 s prior to stimulation as baseline. Tau for the decay phase of the IPSP was estimated by fitting the IPSP with a single exponential, from the IPSP trough until return to baseline. Total voltage area was calculated from 0-5.5 s following the onset of the first light pulse. In cells where optical stimulation evoked only an EPSP the response was classed as an ‘excitation’, only an IPSP was classed as an ‘inhibition’, and a combined optically-evoked EPSP and IPSP was classed as ‘mixed’. To assess the effect of photostimulation on firing activity, constant positive current was injected to elicit consistent spontaneous action potentials, and 470 nm light (8 pulses at 30 Hz, 5 ms pulse-width) was delivered every 30 s. The interevent interval (IEI) between action potentials was calculated for 5 s before and 5 s after the first pulse of blue light using Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). A decrease in IEI (indicating an increase in firing rate) was classed as an ‘excitation’ and an increase in IEI (indicating a decrease in firing rate) was classed as an ‘inhibition’.</p>
<p>Following recording, images showing the location of the recording pipette within the slice were captured through a 4X/0.10 NA objective. Images were subsequently overlaid onto the appropriate brain atlas image<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c131">131</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">132</xref></sup>, recorded cell locations were annotated, and then converted into x-y coordinates in FIJI. Python was used to generate a scatter plot of cell location, with points color-coded by the overall membrane potential response to photostimulation (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>Unsupervised agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to classify cells according to their baseline electrophysiological properties. This approach organizes objects (in this case cells) into clusters, based on their similarity. The electrophysiological properties used as input features for clustering CeA cells were ramp ratio, max firing frequency, firing delay, and voltage sag, which are characteristics that have been previously shown to distinguish between subtypes of CeA neuron<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>. For clustering BLP cells, we replaced ramp ratio with capacitance, as this measure is often used to distinguish between pyramidal neurons and GABAergic interneurons, which are the two main cell types in this region. Data for each cell property was max-min normalized to produce a 4 x <italic>n</italic> matrix of input features (where <italic>n</italic> = total number of cells). Clustering was performed using the ‘linkage’ function of SciPy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">139</xref></sup> in Python, using Ward’s linkage method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">140</xref></sup> and Euclidean distance. Briefly, this approach begins with each cell assigned to a single cluster. Cells that are in closest proximity (i.e. have highest similarity) are then linked to form a new cluster. Then the next closest clusters are linked, and so on. This process is repeated until all cells are included in a single cluster. The output of this analysis is plotted as a hierarchical tree (dendrogram), in which each cell is a ‘leaf’ and the Euclidean distance on the y-axis indicates the linkage between cells (larger distance indicates greater dissimilarity). To annotate the photostimulation response of cells on the dendrogram (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N, 6P</xref>, and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6— figure supplement 1M</xref>), the response was designated as ‘excitation’ if action potential IEI decreased with optical stimulation and ‘inhibition’ if action potential IEI increased on stimulation. If firing data was not available, cells were designated as showing an ‘excitation’ if only an EPSP was evoked on optical stimulation, and ‘inhibition’ if only an IPSP was evoked. In cells where a mixed EPSP/IPSP was elicited, the response was designated as an ‘excitation’ if the overall voltage area (0-5.5 s following light onset) was positive, and an ‘inhibition’ if the overall voltage area was negative.</p>
<p>At the end of recording, brain slices were fixed in 4% PFA overnight and then washed in 1X PBS (4 x 10 min each). Slices were blocked in 0.3% PBS-T (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) with 3% NDS (Jackson Immunoresearch, PA, USA) for 30-60 min at room temperature. They were then incubated in PBS-T 0.3% with, 3% NDS, and CF405- or CF633-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000; Biotium, CA, USA) for 90 min at room temperature to reveal neurobiotin labelling.

The protocol was performed as recommended by the manufacturer, with some modifications to prevent tissue degradation and optimize labelling specificity in our regions of interest. Fresh frozen slices were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hr at 4°C. Slices were dehydrated in an ethanol series (50%, 70%, 100%, and 100% ethanol, 5 min each) and then incubated in hydrogen peroxide for 8 min at room temperature. Protease treatment was omitted in order to prevent tissue degradation. Slides were then incubated with the desired probes (pre-warmed to 40°C and cooled to room temperature) for 2 hr at 40°C in a humidified oven. Following washing (2 x 30 s in 1X RNAscope wash buffer), signal amplification molecules (Amp 1, 2, and 3) were hybridized to the target probes in sequential steps, with 30 min incubation for Amp 1 and 2 and 15 min incubation for Amp 3 at 40°C, all in a 40°C humidified oven followed by washing (2 x 30 s in wash buffer).

<p>DAT::Cre mice received an injection of 300 nL AAV<sub>9</sub>-Syn-FLEX-ChrimsonR-TdTomato in the DRN (ML:1.20, AP:-4.10, DV:-2.90; needle at a 20° angle from the midline, bevel facing medial), and 250 nL AAV<sub>1</sub>-Syn-GCaMP6f or AAV<sub>1</sub>-Syn-GCaMP67f in the CeA (ML:2.85, AP:-1.20, DV:-4.75, needle bevel facing posterior). After ∼4 weeks mice underwent a second surgery to implant an integrated 0.6 mm diameter, 7.3 mm long gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens with attached baseplate (Inscopix, CA, USA) over the CeA (ML: 2.85, AP:-1.50, DV:-4.60). The lens was lowered slowly into the cleaned craniotomy by hand. The GRIN lens was adhered to the skull by a layer of adhesive cement (C&amp;B Metabond; Parkell Inc., NY, USA) followed by a layer of black cranioplastic cement (Ortho-Jet; Lang, IL, USA), and protected by a small PCR tube cap, held in place by cement. The nVoke miniaturized microscope (Inscopix, CA, USA) consists of a 455±8 nm blue LED for GCaMP excitation, and a 620±30 nm red LED for simultaneous optogenetic manipulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">142</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Behavioral experimentation commenced at least 1 week after baseplate surgery. Mice were first habituated to handling and connection of the microscope for a minimum of 3 consecutive days. For recording, mice were connected to the nVoke miniature microscope by tightening a small set screw on the baseplate. The microscope data cable was connected to a commutator (Inscopix, CA, USA), to allow unrestricted movement, and the commutator was itself connected to a data acquisition (DAQ) box. Grayscale images were acquired at a rate of 20 frames/s (fps; ∼50 ms exposure time) with the blue LED delivering 0.2-0.3 mW light power and analog gain on the image sensor set to 2. For the social approach task, mice were placed in the three-chamber apparatus (57.5l x 22.5w x 16.5h chamber with clear walls and grey floors). Following microscope connection, mice freely explored the chamber for 5 min. They were then confined to the center portion of the chamber, by the insertion of clear Plexiglas panels, during which a novel juvenile mouse was placed under one cup and a novel object was placed under the other cup. The panels were removed, and the test mouse allowed to freely explore for a further 10 min. One ‘group-housed’ session was conducted without red-light delivery, and another ‘group-housed’ session was conducted with red 620 nm light delivery (8 pulses with 5 ms pulse-width, at 30 Hz, every 1 s; 10 mW) through the objective lens of the microscope, to activate ChrimsonR-expressing DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals. The order of ‘group-housed’ sessions was counterbalanced. 2-3 weeks later, mice were isolated for 24 hours, and another session (‘isolated’) commenced without red-light delivery. A top-down SLEAP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">143</xref></sup> (v1.3.1) model was trained using 774 labeled frames, annotating a skeleton composed of 15 keypoints (comprised of (1) nose, (2) head, (3) left ear, (4) right ear, (5) neck, (6) left forelimb, (7) right forelimb, (8) trunk, (9) left hindlimb, (10) right hindlimb, (11) tail base, (12-14) points along the length of the tail, and (15) tail tip). Pose estimation using the trained model was then performed on the behavior videos to determine if there was a social or object cup interaction. To determine if there was a social or object cup interaction, the nose of the mouse must be within 1.3x the diameter of the cup, and the cup must be within a 90° cone in front of the mouse’s head.</p>
<p>Raw videos of GCaMP fluorescence were first pre-processed in Inscopix Data Processing Software 1.3.0 (Inscopix, CA, USA) by cropping the region outside the GRIN lens, applying 2x spatial downsampling, and a 3×3 median filter to fix defective pixels. A spatial band-pass filter was applied (0.005 to 0.5 oscillations/pixel) to remove high and low spatial frequency content, and rigid motion correction was performed (to account for small lateral displacements) by registering to a stable reference frame with a prominent landmark (e.g. blood vessel). Processed recordings were then exported as TIFF stacks for additional piecewise non-rigid motion correction using the NoRMCorre algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref></sup> in overlapping 64 x 64 pixel grids using a MATLAB implementation. Constrained non-negative matrix factorization for endoscopic recordings (CNMF-E) was then used to extract the spatial shapes and calcium signals from individual cells in the imaging field of view<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">145</xref></sup> using a MATLAB implementation (key parameters: minimum local correlation for seeding pixels = 0.9, minimum peak-to-noise ratio for seeding pixels =12). The extracted calcium signals were inspected, and non-neuronal objects were manually excluded. All following downstream analyses used raw CNMF-E traces.</p>
<p>Calcium traces were aligned to detected behavioral events (interaction to the social and object cups, as determined by feature thresholds extracted from SLEAP keypoints). Single cell responses to social and object cup interaction were determined using an ROC (receiver operating characteristic) analysis, which has been previously been described to determine neural responses to social behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup>. A binary behavior vector of social or object cup interaction (calculated in 40ms time bins) was compared to a binary neural activity vectors generated by applying thresholds that span 100 steps from the minimum to maximum z-score value of each calcium trace to determine a true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) at each step. From these values yielded an ROC curve for each neuron that corresponded to the performance of that single neuron in predicting social or object cup interactions. The area under the ROC curve (auROC) was used to determine how strongly modulated each neuron was to the social and object stimuli. To determine the significance of single-cell responses, a null distribution of 1,000 auROC values was generated by randomly circularly shifting the binary behavior vectors and again comparing it to the binary neural activity signal. A neuron was considered having a significant excitatory response to the social or object stimulus if the auROC value exceeded the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the 1,000 shuffled auROC values, and was considered having a significant inhibitory response if the auROC value was less than the 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the 1,000 shuffled auROC values.</p>
<p>Co-registration of active neurons during imaging sessions was performed using CellReg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">146</xref></sup>. In short, the spatial footprint matrices from each imaging session (as determined by CNMF-E) were used to align different imaging sessions within each animal to a reference session through translational and rotational shifts. Spatial correlation and centroid distance between cells were used to probabilistically register active cells across sessions.</p>
<p>Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was performed by averaging each neuron’s response to the onset of social or object cup interaction throughout the trial. A social or object cup interaction was classified a trial if it (a) lasted a minimum of 1s, (b) if there had been at least 5s that elapsed since the last interaction, and (c) if there was less than 1.5s pause in interaction with the social or object cups. The z-scored averaged traces (5s before and after the onset of social or object cup interaction) were concatenated, such that each row corresponds to one neuronal unit. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was performed using MATLAB’s “cluster” function. Each neuron was initially designated as an individual cluster. Those that were in closest proximity were merged to form a new cluster, then the next closest were merged etc. until a hierarchical tree was formed with all neurons contained within a single cluster. A threshold at 0.770 × max(linkage) was set to prune branches from the hierarchical tree, so that all neurons below each cut were assigned to a single cluster. After the dendrogram was constructed, the average traces (were displayed as a heatmap alongside their corresponding leaf. The traces of all neurons belonging to a single cluster were then averaged, and the number of neurons that corresponded to each behavior group was calculated for each cluster.</p>

<p>Statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). Normality was evaluated using the D’Agostino-Pearson test, and data are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise noted. Data which followed a Gaussian distribution were compared using a paired or unpaired t-test (non-directional) for two experimental groups, and a one-way or two-way ANOVA with repeated measures for three or more experimental groups. Data for two experimental groups which did not follow a Gaussian distribution were compared using a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors perform a series of studies to follow up on their previous work, which established a role for dorsal raphe dopamine neurons (DRN) in the regulation of social-isolation-induced rebound in mice. In the present study, Lee et. al, use a combination of modern circuit tools to investigate putatively distinct roles of DRN dopamine transporting containing (DAT) projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala (CeA), and posterior basolateral amygdala (BLP). Notably, they reveal that optogenetic stimulation of distinct pathways confers specific behavioral states, with DRNDAT-BLP driving aversion, DRNDAT-BNST regulating non-social exploratory behavior, and DRNDAT-CeA promoting socialability. A combination of electrophysiological studies and in situ hybridization studies reveal heterogenous dopamine and neuropeptide expression and different firing properties, providing further evidence of pathway-specific neural properties. Lastly, the authors combine optogenetics and calcium imaging to resolve social encoding properties in the DRNDAT-CeA pathway, which correlates observed social behavior to socially engaged neural ensembles.</p>
<p>Collectively, these studies provide an interesting way of dissecting out separable features of a complex multifaceted social-emotional state that accompanies social isolation and the perception of 'loneliness.' The main conclusions of the paper provide an important and interesting set of findings that increase our understanding of these distinct DRN projections and their role in a range of social (e.g., prosocial, dominance), non-social, and emotional behaviors. However, as noted below, the examination of these circuits within a homeostatic framework is limited given that a number of the datasets did not include an isolated condition. The DRNDAT-CeA pathway was investigated with respect to social homeostatic states in the present study for some of the datasets.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors perform a comprehensive and elegant dissection of the anatomical, behavioral, molecular, and physiological properties of distinct DRN projections relevant to social, non-social, and emotional behavior, to address multifaceted and complex features of social state.</p>
<p>(2) This work builds on prior findings of isolation-induced changes in DRN neurons and provides a working framework for broader circuit elements that can be addressed across social homeostatic state.</p>
<p>(3) This work characterizes a broader circuit implicated in social isolation and provides a number of downstream targets to explore, setting a nice foundation for future investigation.</p>
<p>(4) The studies account for social rank and anxiety-like behavior in several of the datasets, which are important consideration to the interpretation of social motivation states, especially in male mice with respect to dominance behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The conceptual framework of the study is based on the premise of social isolation and perceived 'loneliness' under the framework of social homeostasis, analogous to hunger. In this framework, social isolation should provoke an aversive state and compensatory social contact behavior. In the authors' prior work, they demonstrate synaptic changes in DRN neurons and social rebound following acute social isolation. Thus, the prediction would be that downstream projections also would show state dependent changes as a function of social isolation state (e.g., grouped/socially engaged vs. isolated). In the current paper, a social isolation condition was included for some but not all experiments, which should be considered in the interpretation of the data, specifically within the context of dynamic isolation states.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 1 confirms co-laterals in the BNST and CeA via anatomical tracing studies. The goal of the optogenetic studies is to dissociate functional/behavioral roles of distinct projections. One limitation of optogenetic projection targeting is the possibility of back-propagating action potentials (stimulation of terminals in one region may back-propagate to activate cell bodies, and then afferent projections to other regions), and/or stimulation of fibers of passage. However, this is addressed in the discussion and the present data are convincing, which minimizes the concern.</p>
<p>(3) Sex as a biological variable should be considered in the present data, as included in the discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the role of dopaminergic neurons (dopamine transporter expressing, DAT) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in regulating social and affective behavior through projections to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the posterior subdivision of the basolateral amygdala. The largest effect observed was in the DRN-DAT projections to the CeA. Augmenting previously published results from this group (Matthews et al., 2016), the comprehensive behavioral analysis relative to social dominance, gene expression analysis, electrophysiological profiling, and in vivo imaging provides novel insights into how DRN-DAT projections to the CeA influence the engagement of social behavior in the contexts of group housed and socially isolated mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Correlational analysis with social dominance is a nice addition to the study. The overall computational analyses performed are well-designed and rigorous.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Analysis of dopamine receptor expression did not include Drd3, Drd4, or Drd5 which may provide more insights into how dopamine modulates downstream targets. This is particularly relevant to the BNST projection in which the densest innervation did not robustly co-localize with the expression of either Drd1 or Drd2. It is also possible that dopamine release from DRN-DAT neurons in any or all of these structures in modulating neurotransmitter release from inputs to these regions that contain D2 receptors on their terminals.</p>
<p>(2) Although not the focus of this study, without pharmacological blockade of dopamine receptors, it is not possible to assess what the contribution of dopamine is to the behavioral outcomes. Given the co-release of glutamate and GABA from these neurons it is possible that dopamine plays only a marginal role in the functional connectivity of DRN-DAT neurons.</p>
<p>(3) Photostimulation parameters used during the behavioral studies (8 pulses of light delivered at 30 Hz for several minutes) could lead to confounding results limiting data interpretation. As shown in Figure 6J, 8 pulses of light delivered at 30 Hz results in a significant attenuation of the EPSC amplitude in the BLP and CeA projection. Thus, prolonged stimulation could lead to significant synaptic rundown resulting in an overall suppression of connectivity in the later stages of the behavioral analyses.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>No further issues have been identified.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors had previously found that brief social isolation could increase the activity of these neurons, and that manipulation of these neurons could alter social behavior in a social rank-dependent fashion. This manuscript explored which of the outputs were responsible for this, identifying the central nucleus of the amygdala as the key output region. The authors identified some discrete behavior changes associated with these outputs, and found that during photostimulation of these outputs, neuronal activity appeared altered in 'social response' neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Rigorous analysis of the anatomy. Careful examination of the heterogenous effects on cell activity due to stimulation, linking the physiology with the behavior via photostimulation during recording in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) There are some clear imbalances in the sample size across the different regions parsed. The CeA has a larger sample size, likely in part to the previous work suggesting differential effects depending on social rank/dominance. Given the potential variance, it may be hard to draw conclusions about the impact of stimulation across different social ranks for other groups.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While it may be difficult to draw conclusions about the impact of stimulation across different social ranks, we believe that the dominance-induced variance in our dataset reveals key insights into how social history may affect the function of these circuits. However, we do recognize that there are imbalances in sample size across the different circuits that we probed. To test whether we could detect a significant effect in our DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA:ChR2 group with a sample size matched to the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP:ChR2 group (the lowest sample size of the three circuits probed), we subsampled and ran tests for statistical significance using the following MATLAB code:</p>
<fig id="sa4fig1">
<label>Author response image 1.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-105955-sa4-fig1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>We found that out of 1000 subsamples, we detected a statistically significant effect 40.5% of the time (Author response image 2A). This suggests that the optogenetic effect exists, though it is moderate and is variable across mice (as explained by the significant correlation between social rank and optogenetic effect).</p>
<p>To test whether these inconsistent effects may be an effect of variance induced by social rank, we wrote the following MATLAB code to maintain the distribution of social rank in our subsamples:</p>
<fig id="sa4fig2">

(B) Same as (A), but ensuring that the proportion of subordinate, intermediate, and dominant mice in the subsampled groups were the same as the original distribution.

</fig>
<p>We found that out of 1000 subsamples, we detected a statistically significant effect 45.5% of the time when we maintained the original distribution of social rank in DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA:ChR2 mice (Author response image 2B). This suggests that reducing the sample size to N=14 reduces the statistical power and indeed can make an effect harder to reliably detect. The reviewer is correct in saying that sample imbalance may skew conclusions. However, given the rank-dependent optogenetic effect on social preference seen in DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA:ChR2 mice (N=29 mice, p=0.002, Figure 4H) that is notably absent in DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP:ChR2 mice (N=14 mice, p=0.806, Figure 4I), we hypothesize that we would not see a significant effect of photoactivating the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP circuit on social preference, even with a larger sample size. While we acknowledge there may be evidence that there could be an effect in the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP projection, this analysis reveals that this effect is not as robust as the effect we see in the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection, which is the focus of this study. An in-depth exploration of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projection to the BLP is certainly warranted in future studies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the same analysis approach applied to DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BNST:ChR2 mice suggest a reliably negative result, with subsampling only resulting in a significant result 1.1% of the time (Author response image 2C) and 1.7% of the time if maintaining the original rank distribution (Author response image 2D).</p>

<p>(2) It is somewhat unclear why only the 'social object ratio' was used to assess the effects versus more direct measurements of social behavior.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We decided to use ‘social:object ratio’ as we felt that measurement more directly supported our claim of increased social preference through optogenetic manipulation; however, in our updated manuscript, we included direct measurements of social behavior in the revised manuscript (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and have updated the legend to reflect this addition (lines 1679-1684; 1698-1708).</p>

<p>(3) Somewhat related, while it is statistically significant, it is unclear if the change seen in face investigation of biologically significant, on average, it looks like a few-seconds difference and that was not modulated by social rank.</p>

<p>While the effect size is relatively small (4.19 seconds, 2.32% of the session), we believe we should report any statistically significant findings we discover. However, due to the small effect size, we have de-emphasized our claims regarding this finding in the text (line 172).</p>

<p>(4) There are several papers studying these neurons that have explored behaviors examined here, as well as the physiological connectivity that are not cited that would provide important context for this work.

There are technical differences that may drive these differences, but not addressing them is a major weakness.</p>

<p>In the revised text, we have cited the groups who have found different effects of dopamine-mediated effects in the ovBNST (specifically from Krawczyk et al., 2011, Maracle et al., 2018, and Yu et al., 2021) and reconciled these results with those from our study (lines 422-432).</p>

Summary:</p>
<p>The authors perform a series of studies to follow up on their previous work, which established a role for dorsal raphe dopamine neurons (DRN) in the regulation of social-isolation-induced rebound in mice. In the present study, Lee et. al, use a combination of modern circuit tools to investigate putatively distinct roles of DRN dopamine transporting containing (DAT) projections to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala (CeA), and posterior basolateral amygdala (BLP). Notably, they reveal that optogenetic stimulation of distinct pathways confers specific behavioral states, with DRNDAT-BLP driving aversion, DRNDAT-BNST regulating non-social exploratory behavior, and DRNDAT-CeA promoting socialability. A combination of electrophysiological studies and in situ hybridization studies reveal heterogenous dopamine and neuropeptide expression and different firing properties, providing further evidence of pathway-specific neural properties. Lastly, the authors combine optogenetics and calcium imaging to resolve social encoding properties in the DRNDAT-CeA pathway, which correlates observed social behavior to socially engaged neural ensembles.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Collectively, these studies provide an interesting way of dissecting out separable features of a complex multifaceted social-emotional state that accompanies social isolation and the perception of 'loneliness.' The main conclusions of the paper provide an important and interesting set of findings that increase our understanding of these distinct DRN projections and their role in a range of social (e.g., prosocial, dominance), non-social, and emotional behaviors. However, as noted below, the examination of these circuits within a homeostatic framework is limited given that a number of the datasets did not include an isolated condition. The DRNDAT-CeA pathway was investigated with respect to social homeostatic states in the present study for some of the datasets.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors perform a comprehensive and elegant dissection of the anatomical, behavioral, molecular, and physiological properties of distinct DRN projections relevant to social, non-social, and emotional behavior, to address multifaceted and complex features of social state.</p>
<p>
(2) This work builds on prior findings of isolation-induced changes in DRN neurons and provides a working framework for broader circuit elements that can be addressed across the social homeostatic state.</p>
<p>
(3) This work characterizes a broader circuit implicated in social isolation and provides a number of downstream targets to explore, setting a nice foundation for future investigation.</p>
<p>
(4) The studies account for social rank and anxiety-like behavior in several of the datasets, which are an important consideration to the interpretation of social motivation states, especially in male mice with respect to dominance behavior.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The conceptual framework of the study is based on the premise of social isolation and perceived 'loneliness' under the framework of social homeostasis, analogous to hunger. In this framework, social isolation should provoke an aversive state and compensatory social contact behavior. In the authors' prior work, they demonstrate synaptic changes in DRN neurons and social rebound following acute social isolation. Thus, the prediction would be that downstream projections also would show state-dependent changes as a function of social housing conditions (e.g., grouped vs. isolated). In the current paper, a social isolation condition was not included for the majority of the studies conducted (e.g., Figures 1-6 do not include an isolated condition, Figures 7-8 do include an isolated condition). Thus, while Figure 1-6 adds a very interesting and compelling set of data that is of high value to the social behavior field with respect to social and emotional processing and general circuit characterization, these studies do not directly investigate the impacts of dynamic social homeostatic state. The main claim of the paper, including the title (e.g., separable DRN projections mediate facets of loneliness-like state), abstract, intro, and discussion presents the claim of this work under the framework of dynamic social homeostatic states, which should be interpreted with caution, as the majority of the work in the paper did not include a social isolation comparison.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In previous studies, loneliness-like phenotypes have been characterized across species as having the key dimensions of an aversive state that increases prosociality[1–5].  These two features are amplified by photostimulation of DRN DA neurons, and as we show in this manuscript, are separable across different projections to each target, and our ability to distinctly mimic different aspects of the constellation of features we characterize as “loneliness.”</p>
<p>However we agree with the reviewer that we do not intend to imply that the mouse currently feels lonely.  Indeed, isolating the animals would occlude our ability to see photostimulation-induced mimicry of specific features of the loneliness-like phenotype, and this is precisely why we did not isolate animals for our ChR2 gain-of-function experiments.  To address the reviewers’ concern, we will change the title of our manuscript from making a claim of “mediating” (which we agree would rely more heavily on mediating actual (ethologically-induced) loneliness rather than “mimicry” (photostimulation-induced) behaviors associated with a loneliness-like phenotype. We have changed language regarding this claim throughout our manuscript (Lines 1, 83, 285, 369).</p>
<p>For the ChR2 experiments in particular, we intended the optogenetic manipulation to be a gain-of-function one to test the hypothesis that activation of these circuits is sufficient to recapitulate different facets of a loneliness-like state (i.e. prosociality, aversion, and increased exploratory behavior). As such, that is why we only included group-housed conditions for these experiments—to mimic the phenotype of social isolation without social isolation. To test the necessity of these circuits in mediating different facets of a loneliness-like state, we agree that silencing the studied projections in an isolated state is critical, which is what we show in Figure 8. We agree that the addition of an isolated condition to understand the circuit-specific impact of dynamic social homeostatic state is important (particularly through <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings of these specific circuits during relevant behaviors), and would be a great follow-up to this study.</p>

<p>(2) In Figure 1, the authors confirm co-laterals in the BNST and CeA via anatomical tracing studies. The goal of the optogenetic studies is to dissociate the functional/behavioral roles of distinct projections. However, one limitation of optogenetic projection targeting is the possibility of back-propagating action potentials (stimulation of terminals in one region may back-propagate to activate cell bodies, and then afferent projections to other regions), and/or stimulation of fibers of passage. Therefore, one limitation in the dataset for the optogenetic stimulation studies is the possibility of non-specific unintended activation of projections other than those intended (e.g., DRNDAT-CeA). This can be dealt with by administering lidocaine to prevent back-propagating action potentials.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While back-propagating action potentials are potentially confounding for the manipulation techniques presented in this paper, we do show circuit-specific optogenetic behavioral effects <italic>despite</italic> significant collateralization (specifically between DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons projecting to the CeA and BNST; Figure 1H), suggesting circuit-specificity. Namely, we see that stimulation of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals in CeA promotes social preference (Figure 4E,K) whereas stimulation of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> terminals in BNST promotes rearing (exploratory) behavior (Figure 3G). There is a non-negligible chance that we are stimulating DRN<sup>DAT</sup> fibers of passage, which we have addressed in a caveat disclaimer included in the revised discussion (lines 345-347).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigated the role of dopaminergic neurons (dopamine transporter expressing, DAT) in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in regulating social and affective behavior through projections to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the posterior subdivision of the basolateral amygdala. The largest effect observed was in the DRN-DAT projections to the CeA. Augmenting previously published results from this group (Matthews et al., 2016), the comprehensive behavioral analysis relative to social dominance, gene expression analysis, electrophysiological profiling, and in vivo imaging provides novel insights into how DRN-DAT projections to the CeA influence the engagement of social behavior in the contexts of group-housed and socially isolated mice.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Correlational analysis with social dominance is a nice addition to the study. The overall computational analyses performed are well-designed and rigorous.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Analysis of dopamine receptor expression did not include Drd3, Drd4, or Drd5 which may provide more insights into how dopamine modulates downstream targets. This is particularly relevant to the BNST projection in which the densest innervation did not robustly co-localize with the expression of either Drd1 or Drd2. It is also possible that dopamine release from DRN-DAT neurons in any or all of these structures modulates neurotransmitter release from inputs to these regions that contain D2 receptors on their terminals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although we find that there is more <italic>Vipr2</italic> and <italic>Npbwr1</italic> expression compared to <italic>Drd1</italic> and <italic>Drd2</italic> expression in ovBNST, we still do find that a substantial proportion of cells in ovBNST express dopamine receptors (particularly D2 dopamine receptors, as shown in Figure 5C). In our revised manuscript, we have discussed potential functional mechanism through D3, D4, and D5 dopamine receptors, as well as pre-synaptic dopamine receptor expression (lines 459-461).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Although not the focus of this study, without pharmacological blockade of dopamine receptors, it is not possible to assess what the contribution of dopamine is to the behavioral outcomes. Given the co-release of glutamate and GABA from these neurons, it is possible that dopamine plays only a marginal role in the functional connectivity of DRN-DAT neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree with the reviewer’s comments, we are careful to avoid making claims about dopamine-mediated physiological and behavioral effects of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons (despite that these neurons are genetically identified through the expression of dopamine transporter [DAT]), mentioned in lines 222-228 in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Photostimulation parameters used during the behavioral studies (8 pulses of light delivered at 30 Hz for several minutes) could lead to confounding results limiting data interpretation. As shown in Figure 6J, 8 pulses of light delivered at 30 Hz result in a significant attenuation of the EPSC amplitude in the BLP and CeA projection. Thus, prolonged stimulation could lead to significant synaptic rundown resulting in an overall suppression of connectivity in the later stages of the behavioral analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Despite attenuation of EPSC amplitude in BLP and CeA projections and potential synaptic rundown, we still observe significant behavioral effects through optogenetic manipulation of these circuits (increasing the likelihood of capturing a ‘true positive’ rather than a ‘false negative’ effect). In general, we attempt to reduce the duty cycle by sparingly delivering trains of optogenetic stimulation (eight 5-ms pulses every 5 seconds). Additionally, in the real time place preference task where stimulation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP projection significantly reduces the time spent in the “ON” chamber, stimulation is only delivered when the mouse is in the “ON” compartment of the apparatus. However, we do feel that the reviewer’s concern that EPSC attenuation and potential synaptic rundown may potentially explain the robust place avoidance effects in DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP:ChR2 mice in the first half of the session (Figure 2G). Importantly, we show in our previous published work (Matthews et al., 2016, Cell; Figure 3) through fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) that dopamine transients were consistently recorded in response to eight pulses of 30 Hz DRN<sup>TH</sup> stimulation delivered every 5 seconds in the BNST, though less consistently in the CeA.</p>
