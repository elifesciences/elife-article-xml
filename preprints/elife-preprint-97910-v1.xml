<abstract>
<p>Sortin-Nexin 4 (SNX4) is an evolutionary conserved organizer of membrane recycling. In neurons, SNX4 accumulates in synapses, but how SNX4 affects synapse function remains unknown. We generated a conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse model and report that SNX4 cKO synapses show enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation, while the first evoked EPSC was normal. SNX4 depletion did not affect vesicle recycling or the levels and localization of SNARE-protein VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2. However, SNX4 depletion affected synapse ultrastructure: an increase in docked synaptic vesicles at the active zone, while the overall vesicle number was normal, and a decreased active zone length. These effects together lead to a substantially increased density of docked vesicles per release site. In conclusion, SNX4 is a negative regulator of synaptic vesicle docking and release. These findings suggest a role for SNX4 in synaptic vesicle recruitment at the active zone.</p>

<p>Endosome sorting plays a critical role in the recycling and degradation of proteins in various eukaryotic cell types, including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cullen &amp; Steinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huotari &amp; Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Sardana &amp; Emr, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Vietri et al., 2020</xref>). Synapses, in particular, rely on rapid recycling mechanisms to replenish synaptic vesicles (SVs) and facilitate neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kononenko &amp; Haucke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Rizzoli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Südhof, 2000</xref>). The extent to which endosome sorting is involved in these processes has been a subject of ongoing debate since the early studies on SV recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ceccarelli et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Heuser &amp; Reese, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kononenko &amp; Haucke, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Watanabe &amp; Boucrot, 2017</xref>). While it has been demonstrated that depleting endosomal proteins affect neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tagliatti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>), the precise role of these sorting proteins on SV maintenance and fusogenity remains not well understood.</p>
<p>Sorting nexins (SNXs) are evolutionary conserved organizers of endosome sorting that are recruited to endosome membrane domains by a phox homology (PX) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Carlton et al., 2005</xref>). SNX4 belongs to a subgroup of SNXs containing a C-terminal a Bin–Amphiphysin– Rvs (BAR) domain that recognizes and remodels curved endosome membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cullen &amp; Steinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Teasdale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Van Weering et al., 2012</xref>). While several SNX-BARs are associated with the retromer-related Endosomal SNX-BAR Sorting Complex for Promoting Exit (ESCPE)-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Simonetti et al., 2023</xref>), SNX4 forms a distinct sorting complex with SNX7, SNX30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>), SNX5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>), or SNX32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sugatha et al., 2023</xref>) for endosome-to-cell surface recycling pathways and autophagosome traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Traer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Van Weering et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). SNX4 emerges as a central hub in this endosome recycling pathway as the expression of SNX4 is required for the stable SNX7 and SNX30 protein levels in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>). SNX4 is expressed in all cell types but to what extent this conserved principle also operates in highly polarized mammalian cells, such as neurons, remains unclear. In post-mortem AD brain material, altered protein levels of SNX4 have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). SNX4 is implicated in the recycling of the amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE-1), sorting it away from the endolysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Toh et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, dysregulation of SNX4 may lead to the mislocalization of BACE-1 to late endosomal compartments, potentially contributing to altered amyloid-ß-production. In yeast, Snx4 is essential for the endosome recycling of Snc1p, a homolog of the SNARE protein VAMP2/synaptobrevin-2 (VAMP2/syb2) that is essential for synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hettema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Schoch et al., 2001</xref>). In neurons, SNX4 specifically accumulates in synapses, and its knockdown dysregulates protein pathways involved in neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Vazquez-Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>). While its synaptic subcellular localization has been shown, the functional role of SNX4-dependent endosome sorting in synapses remains unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we characterize the role of endosomal sorting protein SNX4 in synapse function using a novel conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse model. We show that SNX4 limits synaptic vesicle docking and release. SNX4 depletion enhances neurotransmission specifically during train stimulation, while the first evoked response is not significantly affected. SNX4 depletion does not impact vesicle recycling or the levels and localization of the SNARE-protein VAMP2/syb-2. The overall number synaptic vesicles is unaffected in SNX4 cKO neurons, but these synapses show an increased number of docked synaptic vesicles at the active zone of the presynapse. The active zone length is decreased, thereby further increasing the density of synaptic vesicles at the release site of SNX4 cKO synapses. Our data collectively shows that the endosomal sorting protein SNX4 is a negative regulator of synaptic vesicle docking and release.</p>

<title>Neuronal SNX4 protein levels are depleted in 21 days in conditional SNX4 knock out mouse primary cultures</title>
<p>We generated a conditional knock-out mouse model for SNX4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) to circumvent previously reported off-target effects using shRNA approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Vazquez-Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>). In neuronal cultures, SNX4 has a half lifetime of 10.6 days (Dörrbaum et al., 2018).

SNX4 expression was detected by western blot which showed a reduction of 67% after 14 days of cre, 83% after 18 days of cre and 90% after 21 days of cre compared to control neurons infected with delta-Cre (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c, d</xref>). Immunohistochemistry of SNX4 in primary hippocampal neurons showed a 64% reduction in SNX4 in MAP2-neurites after 21 days of expressing cre (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e, f</xref>). Morphological parameters such as dendrite length, based on MAP2 staining, and synapse number, based on VAMP2 puncta, remained unaffected in SNX4 cKO neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 f-h</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). These data show a successful depletion of 90% of endosomal sorting protein SNX4 using a novel conditional knock-out mouse model for SNX4.</p>

<title>SNX4 depletion enhances neurotransmission during train stimulation</title>
<p>To investigate the functional role of SNX4 in synapses, we studied the effect of SNX4 depletion on neurotransmission by electrophysiological recordings in single hippocampal neurons cultured on glia micro-islands (autapse) at DIV21 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Both the amplitude and charge of the first evoked response showed a non-significant trend towards an increase in SNX4 cKO neurons (KO) compared to neurons infected with delta-Cre (control) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">d</xref>). The rescue condition where SNX4 was re-expressed at DIV14 (KO + SNX4) showed a decreased amplitude compared to KO but not to control. A similar trend was observed for total charge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, d</xref>). Paired pulse ratios were not affected in SNX4 cKO neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). We next investigated the effect of SNX4 depletion on synaptic transmission during sustained activity using a series of train stimulations at 5, 10 and 40Hz (results in <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Supplementary table 1</xref>, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig S2</xref>). During a train of 100 action potentials at 40 Hz, the charge in SNX4 cKO neurons was highly increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, h</xref>). The average charge between pulse 90-100 was increased by 110% in SNX4 cKO synapses compared to control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). SNX4 overexpression rescued this increase in charge to WT levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f, g</xref> &amp;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">h</xref>). The size and refilling of the readily releasable vesicle pool (RRP) was estimated using back extrapolation of the cumulative charge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>). While we found no significant differences in RRP estimate size in SNX4 cKO synapses compared to control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>), the slope estimate of the cumulative charge was increased upon SNX4 depletion, which was rescued by SNX4 overexpression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2j</xref>). Together these data show enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation in SNX4 cKO autapses. This suggests that vesicle recruitment during high frequency train stimulation is limited by SNX4.</p>

<title>Synaptic vesicle recycling and retrieval are not altered in SNX4 cKO neurons</title>
<p>As the recruitment rate of releasable vesicles during train stimulation was increased in SNX4 cKO neurons, we assessed its role in synaptic vesicle recycling using the synaptic vesicle fusion reporter synaptophysin-super-ecliptic-pHluorin (SypHy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Granseth et al., 2006</xref>). Neurons were stimulated by two trains of 100 action potentials at 40 Hz. The total pool of SypHy in acidified SVs per synapse was determined by NH4 superfusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, b</xref>). SNX4 cKO neurons showed a higher fluorescence intensity upon both stimulation trains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), represented as the release fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d, e</xref>), and return to baseline fluorescence level within 60 seconds over a total imaging time course of 160 seconds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). The fluorescence decay time constant tau in the 60 s after electrical stimulation, a measure for SV endocytosis, was not changed after both stimuli in SNX4 cKO neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Finally, the responding fluorescent puncta during action potential stimulation as a ratio of the total fluorescent puncta during NH4, the percentage of active synapses, showed a trend towards fewer active synapses in SNX4 cKO neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Hence, these data show that SNX4 depletion enhances synaptic vesicle release without altering synaptic vesicle recycling and the number of active synapses in hippocampal neurons. It has, however, been shown that different SV recycling pathways dominate at different temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). To test if SNX4 affects SV recycling at physiological temperatures, we used FM4-64 dye loading protocol before electrical field stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>). Recycling SVs were labelled by a 60s-incubation with FM4-64 in 60mM K<sup>+</sup> at 37<sup>0</sup>C. Vesicle fusion was triggered by a train of action potentials at 40 Hz, resulting in a decreased FM4-64 fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h, i</xref>). SNX4 cKO neurons showed a similar fluorescence intensity decay after electrical stimulation over a total imaging time course of 80 seconds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>). The average fluorescence signal in the last 10 seconds normalized to baseline (F/F0), a measure for the total amount of recycling synaptic vesicles fusing, was not significantly different between control and SNX4 cKO neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3k</xref>). FM4-64 uptake, a measure for endocytosis at 37 C, was also not altered in SNX4 cKO neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3l</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that SNX4 depletion does not affect synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling both at room temperature and physiological temperature.</p>

<p>In yeast it is reported that SNX4 homologue Snx4p mediates retrieval of Snc1p, yeast’s VAMP2/syb-2 homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hettema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Missorting of VAMP2 in neurons could affect synaptic transmission. Therefore, we investigated VAMP2/syb-2 as potential cargo of SNX4. To test whether SNX4 mediates VAMP2/syb-2 retrieval in neurons, we investigated the localization, number and expression levels of VAMP2/syb-2 upon SNX4 knock-out by immunohistochemistry. SNX4 immunostaining showed clear co-localization with VAMP2/syb-2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In SNX4 cKO neurons, no significant difference was found in VAMP2/syb-2 puncta number per μm dendrite or VAMP2/syb-2 intensity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a, b, c</xref>). Sholl-analysis of average VAMP2/syb-2 intensity over distance from soma also revealed no differences in VAMP2/syb-2 localization upon SNX4 depletion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed no changes in total VAMP2/syb-2 protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). These data show that SNX4 is not required for a normal VAMP2/syb-2 distribution and protein level, as observed for the yeast orthologs of both proteins.</p>

<title>Presynaptic ultrastructure and synaptic vesicle docking are affected in SNX4 cKO synapses</title>
<p>Next, we sought to further investigate synapse organization upon SNX4 depletion using electron microscopy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>). The number of docked vesicles was measured by direct contact of vesicles with the active zone plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref>). The average synaptic vesicle size, defined by all clear core vesicles smaller than 50 nm, was reduced by 5%, whereas vesicles larger than 50 nm, did not show significant changes upon SNX4 depletion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c, d</xref>). In SNX4 cKO synapses, the number of docked vesicles was significantly higher than in control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, f</xref>) whilst the total number of vesicles was not altered (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). When normalized to the active zone length, the density of docked vesicles at the active zone length further increases by 50% in SNX4 cKO synapses compared to control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>). Moreover, we observed a significant decrease in active zone length, PSD length and vesicle cluster area (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g-j</xref>). Together these data show that SNX4 depletion affects the presynaptic ultrastructure, characterized by smaller active zone length and vesicle cluster area, suggesting a decrease in overall synapse size. In these smaller synapses, SNX4 cKO neurons contain more docked synaptic vesicles leading to a substantially increased density of docked vesicles per release site.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we addressed the role of SNX4-dependent endosome sorting in synapses, using a new conditional SNX4 knock-out mouse model. We show that SNX4 cKO synapses elicit enhanced neurotransmission during train stimulation. SNX4 depletion did not affect vesicle recycling or the levels and localization of SNARE-protein VAMP2/syb-2. Electron microscopy showed that synapses had an increased number of docked vesicles at the active zone, while the overall number of synaptic vesicles was normal. The active zone length was decreased upon SNX4 depletion, thereby further increasing the density of docked synaptic vesicles at the release site. Taken together, our data shows that the endosomal sorting protein SNX4 is a negative regulator of synaptic vesicle docking and release. These findings indicate that SNX4 regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment at the active zone.</p>

<title>Enhanced SV recruitment and increased SV docking explain increased transmission in SNX4 cKO synapses</title>
<p>SNX4 cKO synapses showed a 110% increase in neurotransmission during intense stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). A trend towards increased neurotransmission was observed already from the start of the train, and also in single evoked responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c-d</xref>), but became more prominent (and significant) during sustained stimulation. Despite the variability within all datasets, both trends and the significant effect during sustained stimulation were fully reversed by acute SNX4 expression. The total number of synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1h</xref>) and fraction of active synapses (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3g</xref>) was not affected in SNX4 cKO neurons, suggesting an intrasynaptic effect. While approximately twice more vesicles were released during sustained stimulation in the absence of SNX4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), our RRP estimation indicated a normal resting state RRP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>). All measures of release probability were normal (normal paired pulse facilitation, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>, and shape of the rundown curve, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), indicating that an increased release probability is an unlikely explanation for the observed increase in neurotransmission during sustained stimulation. Hence, this suggests that a higher recruitment rate of SVs to the releasable pool (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h,j</xref>) in SNX4 cKO synapses is responsible for the increased neurotransmission. While back extrapolation methods for estimating the RRP have their limitations and mechanisms of SV recruitment remain not fully understood, it is evident that the involvement of newly recruited vesicles becomes more prominent during high frequency trains (Neher et al., 2015). In line with this, the increased neurotransmission of SNX4 cKO neurons was less prominent in 5Hz and 10Hz trains (Fig S2). Hence, an increased contribution of newly recruited vesicles during sustained stimulation is consistent with the fact that neurotransmission is increased especially during high frequency stimulation in SNX4 cKO synapses.</p>
<p>The increase in neurotransmission during sustained stimulation was also observed with synaptic vesicle fusion reporter synaptophysin-pHluorin but not with the FM-64 dye. The latter method reports the release of only recycled vesicles, suggesting that these do not contribute to the enhanced release. Finally, examining SV recycling with FM-64 dye indicates that the increased SV recruitment in SNX4 cKO synapses is not driven by an enhanced rate of the synaptic vesicle cycle, as endocytosis and release of recycled SVs were normal in SNX4 cKO synapses.</p>
<p>Ultrastructural characterization of SNX4 cKO synapses revealed a 50% increase in docked vesicles when normalized to active zone length. This increase might contribute to an enhanced SV recruitment and support increased neurotransmission in SNX4 cKO synapses. If vesicles are already docked, they may be recruited faster during train stimulation. Synaptic vesicle docking appears to be a more dynamic process than previously conceived, where docked SVs are dynamically replaced by recruited vesicles from various synaptic vesicle pools, a process depending on activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kusick et al., 2020</xref>).An increase in docked SV concentration at the active zone also implies a closer proximity to calcium channels. However, all measures of release probability were unaffected by SNX4 deficiency (as argued above) suggesting a normal channel coupling in SNX4 cKO synapses.</p>

<title>SNX4 at the crossroad of endosomal sorting and autophagy regulating synaptic output</title>
<p>Increased neurotransmission upon depletion of endosomal genes has been shown by several labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Soykan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tagliatti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>). These results are consistent with a postulated hypothesis that endosomes act sorting stations for SV proteins and control the balance between novel and reused SV proteins that affect SV release and neurotransmission efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Truckenbrodt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In the presence of SNX4, the recycling process may lead to the re-use of older SV proteins that, as indirect consequence, potentially diminish the efficiency of SV exocytosis. In the absence of SNX4, older SV proteins are less recycled and traffic towards degradation, rendering the synapse with relatively more novel SV proteins, enhancing SV recruitment and fusion. Blocking the degradation pathway with HOPS/ESCRT mutants rescues the observed increased release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>) . Similarly, Skywalker and ARF6 mutants show increased SV sorting through endosomal intermediates, increasing SV docking and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fernandes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tagliatti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Uytterhoeven et al., 2011</xref>). Our data is consistent with this literature, demonstrating enhanced neurotransmission upon inactivation of an endosome sorting gene. That said, SNX4 cKO synapses do not show an accumulation of endosomal intermediates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5d</xref>) or decreased SV numbers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5e</xref>) as reported for other endosome gene mutants, marking a novel finding in endosomal protein knockout studies.</p>
<p>Endosomal sorting also mediates the delivery of active zone proteins, where disturbances in these pathways potentially correlate with smaller active zones and SVs, ultrastructural phenotypes we also observed in SNX4 cKO synapses. Previous studies suggest that the removal of SNX4 directs its cargo toward the degradative pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hettema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Traer et al., 2007</xref>). Although the SNX4 cargo, particularly in mammalian neurons, is currently unknown, it is unlikely that VAMP2/syb-2 recycling explains our phenotype since the overall levels and localization of VAMP2/syb-2 remained unaffected upon SNX4 depletion.</p>
<p>Apart from endosome sorting, SNX4 has been reported to regulate several types of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hanley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Recent literature has shown that synaptic vesicle release could be regulated by synaptic autophagy (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Decet &amp; Verstreken, 2021</xref>). Loss of ATG5 has been shown to result in increased neurotransmission, an effect independent from total SVs pool number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kuijpers et al., 2021</xref>). Knock down of SNX4 altered recruitment and turnover kinetics of ATG5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>), which might also impact on neurotransmitter release. Collectively, both endosome sorting and autophagic pathways highlight the importance of SV protein turnover in maintaining efficient neurotransmitter release, with potential regulatory contributions from SNX4.</p>

<title>SNX-BAR proteins critical for synapse function</title>
<p>Many of our examined synaptic parameters remained unaltered or showed considerable variability, including our hypothesis that depletion of a synaptic endosomal sorting protein would disrupt synaptic recycling. This suggests the presence of redundant pathways compensating for SNX4 depletion, potentially involving other SNX-BAR complexes or endosomal sorting complexes like ESCPE, retriever, or retromer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Simonetti et al., 2023</xref>). Particularly SNX-BAR proteins, such as SNX7 and SNX30, are of potential interest for future research due to their ability to form selective complexes with SNX4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Antón et al., 2020</xref>). The role of endosome sorting in the synaptic vesicle cycle is increasingly recognized through knockout studies targeting various endosomal complexes, revealing changes in SV exocytosis, SV endocytosis, or endosome-like vesicle numbers (X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">X. W. Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Inoshita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tagliatti et al., 2016</xref>). Our data supports this, showing for the first time that a protein from the highly evolutionary conserved SNX-BAR protein family, such as SNX4, regulates SV docking at the active zone and sustained SV release. Taken together, we show that endosomal sorting protein SNX4 regulates synaptic vesicles recruitment at the active zone. The precise regulation of vesicle availability is crucial for a synapse to effectively coordinate neurotransmission, a process heavily relying on endosome sorting mechanisms.</p>

Prior to cell culture, sapphire disks were etched for 30 minutes in 60% sulfuric acid, washed, incubated in 3M KOH overnight, washed and dried before carbon coating and subsequent baking at 180 C for 2 hours. Sapphire discs were coated by a mixture of 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma), 0.7 mg/ml rat tail collagen (BD Biosciences), and 10 mM acetic acid (Sigma) and placed in an agarose-coated 12-well plate to form glia monolayer islands selectively on sapphire disks.

Sapphire disks were separated from the Epon by dipping the samples in boiling water and liquid nitrogen and regions with micro-networks were selected by light microscopy. These regions were cut out and mounted on pre-polymerized Epon blocks for ultrathin sectioning. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were cut parallel to the sapphire disk, collected on single-slot, formvar-coated copper grids, and stained in uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Hippocampal synapses were randomly selected at low magnification using an electron microscope (JEOL1010), and the conditions were blinded. For each condition, the number of docked SVs, total SV number, and active zone length were measured on digital images taken at 80,000-fold magnification using custom-written semiautomatic image analysis software running in Matlab (Mathworks). For all morphological analyses the following requirements were set: clearly recognizable synapses with intact synaptic plasma membranes with a recognizable pre- and postsynaptic area and defined SV membranes. SVs were defined as docked if there was no distance visible between the SV membrane and the active zone membrane.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Data are shown as mean +-SEM. Data that violated both normality (Shapiro-Wilk) and homogeneity (Levene test) was tested with the two-sided Mann–Whitney U test. Data exhibiting a normal distribution yet significantly altered variation were tested with Welch’s t-test. When assumptions of homogeneity and normality were met, data were tested with Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. For the analysis of electron microscopy data, electrophysiology data and live cell imaging (pHluorin and FM dye), the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for different variables applicable to each experiment such as culture batch, sapphire or synapse originating from the same neuron. If ICC was close to 0.1, indicating that a considerable portion of the total variance can be attributed to e.g. culture week, multilevel analysis was performed to accommodate nested data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aarts et al., 2014</xref>). Bar graphs were plotted as the mean with SEM, where individual data points represent fields of view, neurons or synapses (EM data set).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the work: &quot;Endosomal sorting protein SNX4 limits synaptic vesicle docking and release&quot; Josse Poppinga and collaborators addressed the synaptic function of Sortin-Nexin 4 (SNX4). Employing a newly developed in vitro KO model, with live imaging experiments, electrophysiological recordings, and ultrastructural analysis, the authors evaluate modifications in synaptic morphology and function upon loss of SNX4. The data demonstrate increased neurotransmitter release and alteration in synapse ultrastructure with a higher number of docked vesicles and shorter AZ. The evaluation of the presynaptic function of SNX4 is of relevance and tackles an open and yet unresolved question in the field of presynaptic physiology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The sequential characterization of the cellular model is nicely conducted and the different techniques employed are appropriate for the morpho-functional analysis of the synaptic phenotype and the derived conclusions on SNX4 function at presynaptic site. The authors succeeded in presenting a novel in vitro model that resulted in chronical deletion of SNX4 in neurons. A convincing sequence of experimental techniques is applied to the model to unravel the role of SNX4, whose functions in neuronal cells and at synapses are largely unknown. The understanding of the role of endosomal sorting at the presynaptic site is relevant and of high interest in the field of synaptic physiology and in the pathophysiology of the many described synaptopathies that broadly result in loss of synaptic fidelity and quality control at release sites.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The flow of the data presentation is mostly descriptive with several consistent morphological and functional modifications upon SNX loss. The paper would benefit from a wider characterization that would allow us to address the physiological roles of SNX4 at the synaptic site and speculate on the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition, due to the described role of SNX4 in autophagy and the high interest in the regulation of synaptic autophagy in the field of synaptic physiology, an initial evaluation of the autophagy phenotype in the neuronal SNX4KO model is important, and not to be only restricted to the discussion section.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>SNX4 is thought to mediate recycling from endosomes back to the plasma membrane in cells. In this study, the authors demonstrate the increases in the amounts of transmitter release and the number of docked vesicles by combining genetics, electrophysiology, and EM. They failed to find evidence for its role in synaptic vesicle cycling and endocytosis, which may be intuitively closer to the endosome function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The electrophysiological data and EM data are in principle, convincing, though there are several issues in the study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is unclear why the increase in the amounts of transmitter release and docked vesicles happened in the SNX4 KO mice. In other words, it is unclear how the endosomal sorting proteins in the end regulate or are connected to presynaptic, particularly the active zone function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study aims to determine whether the endosomal protein SNX4 performs a role in neurotransmitter release and synaptic vesicle recycling. The authors exploited a newly generated conditional knockout mouse to allow them to interrogate the SNX4 function. A series of basic parameters were assessed, with an observed impact on neurotransmitter release and active zone morphology. The work is interesting, however as things currently stand, the work is descriptive with little mechanistic insight. There are a number of places where the data appear to be a little preliminary, and some of the conclusions require further validation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the work are the state-of-the-art methods to monitor presynaptic function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses are the fact that the work is largely descriptive, with no mechanistic insight into the role of SNX4. Further weaknesses are the absence of controls in some experiments and the design of specific experiments.</p>
