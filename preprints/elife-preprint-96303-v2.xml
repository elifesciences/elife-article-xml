<title>Abstract</title><p>Biological memory networks are thought to store information by experience-dependent changes in the synaptic connectivity between assemblies of neurons. Recent models suggest that these assemblies contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E/I assemblies), resulting in co-tuning and precise balance of excitation and inhibition. To understand computational consequences of E/I assemblies under biologically realistic constraints we built a spiking network model based on experimental data from telencephalic area Dp of adult zebrafish, a precisely balanced recurrent network homologous to piriform cortex. We found that E/I assemblies stabilized firing rate distributions compared to networks with excitatory assemblies and global inhibition. Unlike classical memory models, networks with E/I assemblies did not show discrete attractor dynamics. Rather, responses to learned inputs were locally constrained onto manifolds that “focused” activity into neuronal subspaces. The covariance structure of these manifolds supported pattern classification when information was retrieved from selected neuronal subsets. Networks with E/I assemblies therefore transformed the geometry of neuronal coding space, resulting in continuous representations that reflected both relatedness of inputs and an individual’s experience. Such continuous representations enable fast pattern classification, can support continual learning, and may provide a basis for higher-order learning and cognitive computations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autoassociative memory establishes internal representations of specific inputs that may serve as a basis for higher brain functions including classification and prediction. Representation learning in autoassociative memory networks is thought to involve experience-dependent synaptic plasticity and potentially other mechanisms that enhance connectivity among assemblies of excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hebb, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miehl et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>). Classical theories proposed that assemblies define discrete attractor states and map related inputs onto a common stable output pattern. Hence, neuronal assemblies are thought to encode internal representations, or memories, that classify inputs relative to previous experience via attractor dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amit and Tsodyks, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Goldman-Rakic, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hopfield, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kohonen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lagzi and Rotter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mazzucato et al., 2015</xref>). However, brain areas with memory functions such as the hippocampus or neocortex often exhibit dynamics that is atypical of attractor networks including irregular firing patterns, transient responses to inputs, and high trial-to-trial variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Iurilli and Datta, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Renart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shadlen and Newsome, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Irregular, fluctuation-driven firing reminiscent of cortical activity emerges in recurrent networks when neurons receive strong excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brunel, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shadlen and Newsome, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</xref>). In such “balanced state” networks, enhanced connectivity among assemblies of E neurons is prone to generate runaway activity unless matched I connectivity establishes co-tuning of E and I inputs in individual neurons. The resulting state of “precise” synaptic balance stabilizes firing rates because inhomogeneities in excitation across the population or temporal variations in excitation are tracked by correlated inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hennequin et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lagzi and Fairhall, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rost et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vogels et al., 2011</xref>). E/I co-tuning has been observed experimentally in cortical brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bhatia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Froemke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Okun and Lampl, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wehr and Zador, 2003</xref>) and emerged in simulations that included spike-timing dependent plasticity at I synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lagzi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vogels et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zenke et al., 2015</xref>). In simulations, E/I co-tuning can be established by including I neurons in assemblies, resulting in “E/I assemblies” where I neurons track activity of E neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Eckmann et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lagzi and Fairhall, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mackwood et al., 2021</xref>). Exploring the structural basis of E/I co-tuning in biological networks is challenging because it requires the dense reconstruction of large neuronal circuits at synaptic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Friedrich and Wanner, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Modeling studies started to investigate effects of E/I assemblies on network dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chenkov, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mackwood et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sadeh and Clopath, 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Schulz et al., 2021</xref>) but the impact on neuronal computations in the brain remains unclear. Balanced state networks can exhibit a broad range of dynamical behaviors, including chaotic firing, transient responses and stable states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Festa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hennequin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Murphy and Miller, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Roudi and Latham, 2007</xref>), implying that computational consequences of E/I assemblies depend on network parameters. We therefore examined effects of E/I assemblies on autoassociative memory in a spiking network model that was constrained by experimental data from telencephalic area Dp of adult zebrafish, which is homologous to mammalian piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mueller et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Dp and piriform cortex receive direct input from mitral cells in the olfactory bulb (OB) and have been proposed to function as autoassociative memory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Haberly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wilson and Sullivan, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, manipulations of neuronal activity in piriform cortex affected olfactory memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meissner-Bernard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sacco and Sacchetti, 2010</xref>). In both brain areas, odors evoke temporally structured, spatially distributed activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Blazing and Franks, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yaksi et al., 2009</xref>) that are dominated by synaptic inputs from recurrent connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Franks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>) and modified by experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chapuis and Wilson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Frank et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jacobson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings revealed that neurons in posterior Dp (pDp) received large E and I synaptic inputs during odor responses. These inputs were co-tuned in odor space and correlated on fast timescales, demonstrating that pDp enters a transient state of precise synaptic balance during odor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that network models of pDp with assemblies but without E/I co-tuning generated persistent attractor dynamics and exhibited a biologically unrealistic broadening of the firing rate distribution. Introducing E/I assemblies established E/I co-tuning, stabilized the firing rate distribution, and abolished persistent attractor states. In networks with E/I assemblies, population activity was locally constrained onto manifolds that represented learned and related inputs by “focusing” activity into neuronal subspaces. The covariance structure of manifolds supported pattern classification when information was retrieved from selected neuronal subsets. Furthermore, the continuity of the olfactory coding space provided a metric representing the similarity of inputs to learned stimuli. These results show that autoassociative memory networks constrained by biological data operate in a balanced regime where information is contained in the geometry of neural manifolds. Predictions derived from these analyses may be tested experimentally by measurements of neuronal population activity in zebrafish.</p>

<title>A spiking network model based on pDp</title>
<p>To analyze memory-related computational functions of E/I assemblies under biologically realistic constraints we built a spiking neural network model, pDp<sub>sim</sub>, based on experimental data from pDp (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blumhagen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yaksi et al., 2009</xref>). pDp<sub>sim</sub> comprised 4000 E neurons and 1000 I neurons, consistent with the estimated total number of 4000 – 10000 neurons in adult zebrafish pDp (unpublished observations). The network received afferent input from 1500 mitral cells in the OB with a mean spontaneous firing rate of 6 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Friedrich and Laurent, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tabor and Friedrich, 2008</xref>). Odors were modeled by increasing the firing rates of 10% of mitral cells to a mean of 15 Hz and decreasing the firing rates of 5% of mitral cells to a mean of 2 Hz (Methods, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Friedrich and Laurent, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2001</xref>). As a result, the mean activity increased only slightly while the variance of firing rates across the mitral cell population increased approximately 7-fold, consistent with experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Friedrich and Laurent, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Wanner and Friedrich, 2020</xref>).</p>

<p>pDp<sub>sim</sub> consisted of sparsely connected integrate-and-fire neurons with conductance-based synapses (connection probability ≤5%, Methods). Model parameters were taken from the literature when available and otherwise determined to reproduce measured observables (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-H</xref>; Methods). The mean firing rate was &lt;0.1 Hz in the absence of stimulation and increased to ∼1 Hz during odor presentation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Blumhagen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rupprecht et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>). Population activity was odor-specific and activity patterns evoked by uncorrelated OB inputs remained uncorrelated in pDp<sub>sim</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yaksi et al., 2009</xref>). The synaptic conductance during odor presentation substantially exceeded the resting conductance and inputs from other E neurons (recurrent inputs) contributed &gt;80% of the excitatory synaptic conductance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Hence, pDp<sub>sim</sub> entered a balanced state during odor stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>) with recurrent input dominating over afferent input, as observed in pDp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>). Shuffling spike times of inhibitory neurons resulted in runaway activity with a probability of 0.79 ± 0.20, demonstrating that activity was inhibition-stabilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sadeh and Clopath, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Tsodyks et al., 1997</xref>). These results were robust against parameter variations (Methods). pDp<sub>sim</sub> therefore reproduced key features of pDp.</p>

<title>Co-tuning and stability of networks with E/I assemblies</title>
<p>To create networks with defined neuronal assemblies we rewired a small subset of the connections in randomly connected (<italic>rand</italic>) networks. An assembly was generated by identifying the 100 E neurons that received the most connections from the mitral cells activated by a given odor and increasing the probability of connections between these E neurons by a factor of 〈 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). The number of E input connections per neuron was maintained by randomly eliminating connections from neurons outside the assembly. We thus refer to an odor as “learned” when a network contains a corresponding assembly, and as “novel” when no such assembly is present. In each network, we created 15 assemblies representing memories of uncorrelated odors. As a result, ∼30% of E neurons were part of an assembly, with few neurons participating in multiple assemblies. Odor-evoked activity within assemblies was higher than the population mean and increased with 〈 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). When 〈 reached a critical value of ∼6, networks became unstable and generated runaway activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>We first set 〈 to 5, then uniformly scaled I-to-E connection weights by a factor of χ until E population firing rates in response to learned odors matched the corresponding firing rates in <italic>rand</italic> networks, i.e., 1 Hz (“<italic>Scaled I</italic>” networks; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, C, D, F</xref>). Under these conditions, activity within assemblies was amplified substantially in comparison to the corresponding neurons in <italic>rand</italic> networks (“pseudo-assembly”) whereas activity outside assemblies was substantially reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, G</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Hence, non-specific scaling of inhibition resulted in a large and biologically unrealistic divergence of firing rates (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>) that nearly exhausted the dynamic range of individual neurons in the population, indicating that homeostatic global inhibition is insufficient to maintain a stable firing rate distribution. We further observed that neurons within activated assemblies produced regular spike trains (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A, C</xref>), indicating that the balanced regime was no longer maintained.</p>
<p>In <italic>rand</italic> networks, correlations between E and I synaptic conductances in individual neurons were slightly above zero (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), presumably because of stochastic inhomogeneities in the connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pehlevan and Sompolinsky, 2014</xref>). In <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks, correlations remained near zero, indicating that E assemblies by themselves did not enhance E/I co-tuning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks with structured E but random I connectivity can therefore not account for the stability, synaptic balance, and E/I co-tuning observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We next created structured networks with more precise E/I balance by including I neurons within assemblies. We first selected the 25 I neurons that received the largest number of connections from the 100 E neurons of an assembly. The connectivity between these two sets of neurons was then enhanced by two procedures to generate E/I assemblies: (1) in “<italic>Tuned I</italic>” networks, the probability of I-to-E connections was increased by a factor ® while E-to-I connections remained unchanged. (2) In “<italic>Tuned E+I</italic>” networks, the probability of I-to-E connections was increased by ® and the probability of E-to-I connections was increased by © (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). As for “<italic>Scaled I</italic>” networks, ® and © were adjusted to obtain mean population firing rates of ∼1 Hz in response to learned odors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D, F</xref>). The other observables used to constrain the <italic>rand</italic> networks remained unaffected (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1 C-E</xref>). Activity of networks with E assemblies could not be stabilized around 1 Hz by increasing connectivity from subsets of I neurons receiving dense input from activated mitral cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1G-H</xref>; Sadeh and Clopath, 2020).</p>
<p>In <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, correlations between E and I conductances in individual neurons were significantly higher than in <italic>rand</italic> or <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). To further analyze E/I co-tuning we projected synaptic conductances of each neuron onto a line representing the E/I ratio expected in a balanced network (“balanced axis”) and onto an orthogonal line (“counter-balanced axis”; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref> inset, Methods). The ratio between the standard deviations (SD.) along these axes has been used previously to quantify E/I co-tuning in experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>). This ratio was close to 1 in <italic>rand</italic> and <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks but significantly higher in <italic>Tuned I</italic> and <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Hence, <italic>Tuned</italic> networks exhibited significant co-tuning along the balanced axis, as observed in pDp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, activity within assemblies was higher than the mean activity but substantially lower and more irregular than in <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, G</xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A-C</xref>). Unlike in <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks, mean firing rates evoked by novel odors were indistinguishable from those evoked by learned odors and from mean firing rates in <italic>rand</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1F</xref>). Hence, E/I co-tuning prevented excessive amplification of activity in assemblies without affecting global network activity, consistent with experimental observations in Dp and piriform cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chapuis and Wilson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Frank et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of E/I assemblies on attractor dynamics</title>
<p>We next explored effects of assemblies on network dynamics. In <italic>rand</italic> networks, firing rates increased after stimulus onset and rapidly returned to a low baseline after stimulus offset (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Correlations between activity patterns evoked by the same odor at different time points and in different trials were positive but substantially lower than unity, indicating high variability (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Hence, <italic>rand</italic> networks showed transient and variable responses to input patterns, consistent with the typical behavior of generic balanced state networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shadlen and Newsome, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</xref>). <italic>Scaled</italic> networks responded to learned odors with persistent firing of assembly neurons and high pattern correlations across trials and time, implying attractor dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hopfield, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Khona and Fiete, 2022</xref>), whereas <italic>Tuned</italic> networks exhibited transient responses and modest pattern correlations similar to <italic>rand</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Hence, <italic>Tuned</italic> networks did not exhibit stable attractor states, presumably because precise synaptic balance prevented strong recurrent amplification within E/I assemblies.</p>
<p>In classical memory networks, attractor dynamics drives pattern completion, the retrieval of the whole memory from noisy or corrupted versions of the learned input. We therefore tested whether networks with E/I assemblies performed pattern completion using two different approaches. In computational studies, pattern completion is often assessed by testing whether targeted partial stimulation of an assembly can activate the assembly as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sadeh and Clopath, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vogels et al., 2011</xref>). Stimulating subsets of E neurons in an assembly during baseline activity recruited the entire assembly in all structured pDp<sub>sim</sub> networks (<italic>Scaled</italic> and <italic>Tuned</italic>) without a significant increase in the overall population activity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>During partial assembly stimulation, most pDp<sub>sim</sub> neurons do not receive any input, which is unlikely to happen during odor presentation. Therefore, we also assessed pattern completion with more realistic variations of inputs, building on experimental studies in the olfactory system and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wilson and Sullivan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yassa and Stark, 2011</xref>). We morphed a novel odor into a learned odor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), or a learned odor into another learned odor (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>), and quantified the similarity between morphed and learned odors by the Pearson correlation of the OB activity patterns (input correlation). We then compared input correlations to the corresponding pattern correlations among E neurons in pDp<sub>sim</sub> (output correlation). In <italic>rand</italic> networks, output correlations increased linearly with input correlations but did not exceed them (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with the absence of pattern completion in generic random networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schaffer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wiechert et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks, in contrast, showed typical signatures of pattern completion: output correlations increased abruptly as a morphed odor approached a learned odor and eventually exceeded the corresponding input correlations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). In <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, output correlations were higher than in <italic>rand</italic> networks but remained lower than input correlations and did not increase steeply near the learned odor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>). Hence, networks with E/I assemblies did not show signatures of pattern completion in response to naturalistic stimuli, consistent with the absence of strong recurrent amplification within assemblies.</p>

</fig>
<p>To further understand the effect of E/I assemblies on network dynamics we examined the synaptic currents underlying the modest amplification of activity in assemblies of <italic>Tuned</italic> networks that occurred as a learned odor was approached (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We measured the relative contribution of synaptic inputs from afferent and recurrent sources received by assembly and non-assembly neurons. In <italic>rand</italic> networks, activity in pseudo-assembly neurons increased linearly as the corresponding odor was approached (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This linear increase in activity can be attributed entirely to an increase in afferent input (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) because the net recurrent input remained constant due to E/I balance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). In <italic>Scaled</italic> networks, assembly firing rates increased massively as the learned odor was approached (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), reflecting a large increase in recurrent excitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>). In <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, in contrast, assembly firing rates increased only modestly due to a slightly larger increase in E than I currents near the learned odor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-F</xref>). Hence, the modest amplification by assemblies of <italic>Tuned</italic> networks involves an “imperfect” synaptic balance.</p>

<title>Geometry of activity patterns in networks with E/I assemblies</title>
<p>We next examined how E/I assemblies transform the geometry of neuronal representations, i.e their organization in a state space where each axis represents the activity of one neuron or one pattern of neural covariance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chung and Abbott, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gallego et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Langdon et al., 2023</xref>). To address this general question, we created an odor subspace and examined its transformation by pDp<sub>sim</sub>. The subspace consisted of a set of OB activity patterns representing four uncorrelated pure odors and mixtures of these pure odors. Pure odors were assigned to the corners of a square and mixtures were generated by selecting active mitral cells from each of the pure odors with probabilities depending on the relative distances from the corners (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, Methods). Correlations between OB activity patterns representing pure odors and mixtures decreased approximately linearly as a function of distance in the subspace (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The odor subspace therefore represented a hypothetical olfactory environment with four odor sources at the corners of a square arena and concentration gradients within the arena. Locations in the odor subspace were visualized by the color code depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>To examine how pDp<sub>sim</sub> transforms this odor subspace we projected time-averaged activity patterns onto the first two principal components (PCs). As expected, the distribution of OB activity patterns in PC space closely reflected the square geometry of the subspace (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). This geometry was largely preserved in the output of <italic>rand</italic> networks, consistent with the notion that random networks tend to maintain similarity relationships between input patterns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schaffer et al., 2018</xref>). We next examined outputs of <italic>Scaled</italic> or <italic>Tuned</italic> networks containing 15 assemblies, two of which were aligned with pure odors (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>). The four odors delineating the odor subspace therefore consisted of two learned and two novel odors. In <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks, odor inputs were discretely distributed between three locations in state space representing the two learned odors and residual odors, consistent with the expected discrete attractor states (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref>). <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, in contrast, generated continuous representations of the odor subspace (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The geometry of these representations was distorted in the vicinity of learned odors, which were more distant from most mixtures than novel odors. These geometric transformations were less obvious when activity patterns of <italic>Tuned</italic> networks were projected onto the first two PCs extracted from <italic>rand</italic> networks (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). Hence, E/I assemblies introduced local curvature into the coding space that partially separated learned from novel odors without disrupting the continuity of the subspace representation.</p>
<p>The curvature of the activity manifold in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks suggests that E/I assemblies confine population activity along specific dimensions of the state space. To test this hypothesis, we first quantified the dimensionality of odor-evoked activity by the participation ratio, a measure that depends on the eigenvalue distribution of the pairwise neural covariance matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Altan et al., 2021</xref>) (Methods). As expected, dimensionality was highest in <italic>rand</italic> networks and very low in <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks, reflecting the discrete attractor states (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). In <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, dimensionality was high compared to <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks but lower than in <italic>rand</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The same trend was observed when we sampled data from a limited number of neurons to mimic experimental conditions and when we used other measures of dimensionality (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4C-E</xref>). Furthermore, when restraining the analysis to activity evoked by novel odors and related mixtures, dimensionality was similar between <italic>rand</italic> and <italic>Tuned</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). These observations support the hypothesis that E/I assemblies locally constrain neuronal activity onto lower-dimensional subspaces (manifolds), consistent with recent findings showing effects of specific circuit motifs on the dimensionality of neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dahmen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Recanatesi et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>We further tested this hypothesis by examining the local geometry of activity patterns around representations of learned and novel odors. If E/I assemblies locally confine activity onto manifolds, small changes of input patterns should modify output patterns along preferred dimensions near representations of learned but not novel odors. To test this prediction, we selected sets of input patterns including each pure odor and the seven most closely related mixtures. We then quantified the variance of the projections of their corresponding output patterns onto the first 40 PCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). In <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, this variance decreased only slightly as a function of PC rank for activity patterns related to novel odors, indicating that patterns varied similarly in all directions. For patterns related to learned odors, in contrast, the variance was substantially higher in the direction of the first few PCs, implying variation along preferred dimensions. In addition, we measured the distribution of angles between edges connecting activity patterns representing pure odors and their corresponding related mixtures in PC space (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, inset; Methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>). Angles were narrowly distributed around 1 rad in <italic>rand</italic> networks but smaller in the vicinity of learned patterns in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 H</xref>).</p>
<p>Activity may be constrained non-isotropically by amplification along a subset of dimensions, by inhibition along other dimensions, or both. E neurons participating in E/I assemblies had large loadings on the first two PCs (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4 F, G</xref>) and responded to learned odors with increased firing rates as compared to the mean rates in <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> and <italic>rand</italic> networks. Firing rates of the remaining neurons, in contrast, were slightly lower than the corresponding mean rates in <italic>rand</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Consistent with these observations, the variance of activity projected onto the first few PCs was higher in <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> than in <italic>rand</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) while the variance along higher-order PCs was lower (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, inset). These observations indicate that local activity manifolds are delineated both by amplification of activity along preferred directions and by suppression of activity along other dimensions.</p>
<p>To obtain first insights into network mechanisms underlying effects of E/I assemblies on manifold geometry we simulated additional networks. Equalizing biophysical parameters of E and I neurons had little impact on network behavior (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>; Methods), indicating that observed effects do not depend on specific biophysical differences between E and I neurons. We next explored the hypothesis that the modest amplification of activity within E/I assemblies contributes to the geometry of neural manifolds in pDp<sub>sim</sub>. First, we adjusted the number of I-to-E connections (®) within assemblies of <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> networks to prevent amplification of activity within assemblies during presentation of learned odors (<italic>Tuned[adjust]</italic>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6A-C, E</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> networks with control parameters, we observed neither a curvature of activity manifolds in PC space nor an asymmetry of d<sub>M</sub> in these modified networks (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6F-H</xref>). Second, we reduced recurrent amplification in assemblies of <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks by decreasing 〈 and χ (<italic>Scaled[adjust]</italic>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6A-C, E</xref>). This resulted in distorted activity manifolds and an asymmetric increase in d<sub>M</sub>, similar to observations in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6F-H</xref>). Third, we artificially amplified activity in pseudo-assemblies of <italic>rand</italic> networks through concentration-dependent modifications of excitability instead of connectivity changes (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>). This manipulation increased the mean population activity as compared to control <italic>rand</italic> networks, but it also induced geometric modifications similar to <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, although the manifold curvature in PC space appeared less pronounced (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6B-H</xref>). Hence, different manipulations had consistent effects on manifold geometry despite different effects on mean firing rates: signatures of manifold geometry observed in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks were mimicked by manipulations producing a modest, input-dependent amplification of firing rates in (pseudo-)assemblies but abolished by manipulations that suppressed this amplification. These results indicate that the modest amplification of activity within assemblies contributes to the geometry of odor representations in pDp<sub>sim</sub>. However, further analyses are required to explore potential contributions of other processes and to understand the underlying mechanisms in more detail.</p>

<title>Pattern classification by networks with E/I assemblies</title>
<p>The lack of discrete attractor states raises the question how transformations of activity patterns by <italic>Tuned</italic> networks affect pattern classification. To quantify the association between an activity pattern and a class of patterns representing a given odor we computed the Mahalanobis distance (d<sub>M</sub>). This measure quantifies the distance between the pattern and the class center, taking into account covariation of neuronal activity within the class. In bidirectional comparisons between patterns from different classes, the mean d<sub>M</sub> may be asymmetric if neural covariance differs between classes. We first quantified d<sub>M</sub> between representations of pure odors based on activity patterns across 80 E neurons drawn from the corresponding (pseudo-) assemblies. d<sub>M</sub> was asymmetrically increased in <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> networks as compared to <italic>rand</italic> networks. Large increases were observed for distances between patterns related to learned odors and reference classes representing novel odors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>). In the other direction, increases in d<sub>M</sub> were smaller. Moreover, distances between patterns related to novel odors were almost unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Further analyses showed that increases in d<sub>M</sub> in <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> networks involved both increases in the Euclidean distance between class centers and non-isotropic scaling of intra-class variability (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). The geometric transformation of odor representations by E/I assemblies therefore particularly enhanced the discriminability of patterns representing learned odors.</p>

<p>To further analyze pattern classification, we performed multi-class quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), an extension of linear discriminant analysis for classes with unequal covariances. Using QDA, we determined the probabilities that an activity pattern evoked by a mixture is classified as being a member of each of four classes representing the pure odors, thus mimicking a 4-way forced choice odor classification task. The four classes were defined by the distributions of activity patterns evoked by the pure and closely related odors. We then examined the classification probability of patterns evoked by mixtures with respect to a given class as a function of the similarity between the mixture and the corresponding pure odor (“target”) in the OB. As expected, the classification probability increased with similarity. Furthermore, in <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> networks, the classification probability of mixtures similar to a pure odor was significantly higher when the pure odor was learned (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Hence, E/I assemblies facilitated the classification of inputs related to learned patterns. Pattern classification by QDA could not be applied to outputs of <italic>Scaled</italic> networks because intra-class variability was too low (Methods).</p>
<p>E/I assemblies also improved pattern classification when activity patterns were classified based on correlations to template vectors representing the four odor classes (Methods; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). This analysis further revealed hysteresis effects in <italic>Scaled</italic> but not in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks that impaired pattern classification (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>).</p>
<p>When neuronal subsets were randomly drawn not from assemblies but from the entire population, d<sub>M</sub> was generally lower (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These results indicate that assembly neurons convey higher-than-average information about learned odors. Together, these observations imply that pDp<sub>sim</sub> did not function as a categorical classifier but nonetheless supported the classification of learned odors, particularly when the readout focused on assembly neurons. Conceivably, classification may be further enhanced by optimizing the readout strategy, for example, by a learning-based approach. However, modeling biologically realistic readout mechanisms requires further experimental insights into the underlying circuitry.</p>

<title>Additional computational properties of networks with E/I assemblies</title>
<p>E/I assemblies may not only support discrete classification but also other tasks. We hypothesized that continuous manifolds provide a distance metric to quantitatively evaluate the relatedness between an input and other stimuli. The geometric modifications induced by E/I assemblies may specifically provide a metric between a new sensory input and previously learned stimuli. To explore these hypotheses, we first used multilinear regression to predict the concentration of a pure odor in subspace mixtures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) based on population activity. Highest prediction errors were observed for <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks, presumably because their discontinuous outputs poorly represent gradual concentration differences (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D, E</xref>). Lowest errors were observed for concentration estimates of learned odors in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks. We further trained support vector machines to estimate the concentrations of pure odors in the subspace mixtures and again found highest accuracy for learned odors in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). These results show that networks with E/I assemblies enable the quantitative analysis of selected stimulus components in the presence of distractors, presumably due to the geometric properties of the underlying neural manifold.</p>
<p>We next examined whether E/I assemblies can stabilize activity when multiple memories are successively added into a network, as in a continual learning process. In the absence of precise E/I balance, the divergence of firing rates and, thus, the risk of network instability are expected to increase as assemblies accumulate. <italic>Tuned</italic> networks may be more resistant against these risks, particularly when assemblies overlap, because activity is controlled more precisely within each additional assembly. To test this hypothesis, we examined responses of <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> and <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks to an additional odor subspace where four of the six pairwise correlations between the pure odors were clearly positive (range, 0.27 – 0.44; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We then compared networks with 15 randomly created assemblies to networks with two additional assemblies representing two of the correlated pure odors. These two additional assemblies had, on average, 16% of neurons in common due to the similarity of the odors. In <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, introducing additional overlapping assemblies selectively increased the discriminability of the corresponding odor representations in PC space (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, C</xref>), as observed for uncorrelated assemblies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), but population firing rates remained almost unchanged (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, C</xref>). In <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks, in contrast, creating two additional memories resulted in a convergence of the corresponding representations in PC space and in a substantial increase in firing rates, particularly in response to the learned and related odors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These observations are consistent with the assumption that precise balance in E/I assemblies protects networks against instabilities during continual learning, even when memories overlap. We further observed that, in this regime of higher pattern similarity, d<sub>M</sub> was again increased upon learning, particularly between learned odors and reference classes representing other odors (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>). E/I assemblies therefore consistently increased d<sub>M</sub> in a directional manner under different conditions.</p>

<title>A precisely balanced memory network constrained by pDp</title>
<p>Autoassociative memory networks map inputs onto output patterns representing learned information. Classical models proposed this mapping to be accomplished by discrete attractor states that are defined by assemblies of E neurons and stabilized by global homeostatic inhibition. However, as seen in <italic>Scaled I</italic> networks, global inhibition is insufficient to maintain a stable, biologically plausible firing rate distribution. This problem can be overcome by including I neurons in assemblies, which leads to more precise synaptic balance. To explore network behavior in this regime under biologically relevant conditions we built a spiking network model constrained by experimental data from pDp. The resulting <italic>Tuned</italic> networks reproduced additional experimental observations that were not used as constraints including irregular firing patterns, lower output than input correlations, and the absence of persistent activity. Hence, pDp<sub>sim</sub> recapitulated characteristic properties of a biological memory network with precise synaptic balance.</p>

<title>Neuronal dynamics and representations in precisely balanced memory networks</title>
<p>Simulated networks with global inhibition showed attractor dynamics and pattern completion, consistent with classical attractor memory. However, the distribution of firing rates broadened as connection density within assemblies increased, resulting in unrealistically high (low) rates inside (outside) assemblies and, consequently, in a loss of synaptic balance. Hence, global inhibition was insufficient to stabilize population activity. In networks with E/I assemblies, in contrast, firing rates remained within a realistic range and the balanced state was maintained. Such <italic>Tuned</italic> networks showed no discrete attractor states but transformed the geometry of the coding space by confining activity to continuous manifolds near representations of learned inputs. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that E/I co-tuning decreases the probability of multistable attractor states as compared to balanced networks with global inhibition or lateral inhibition between assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boerlin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hennequin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wu and Zenke, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Geometric transformations in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks may be considered as intermediate between two extremes: (1) geometry-preserving transformations as, for example, performed by many random networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Schaffer et al., 2018</xref>), and (2) discrete maps as, for example, generated by discrete attractor networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Freeman and Skarda, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hopfield, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Khona and Fiete, 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). We found that transformations became more discrete map-like when amplification within assemblies was increased and precision of synaptic balance was reduced. Likewise, decreasing amplification in assemblies of <italic>Scaled</italic> networks changed transformations towards the intermediate behavior, albeit with broader firing rate distributions than in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6B</xref>). These observations indicate that a modest amplification of activity within assemblies contributes to geometric modifications of activity manifolds in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, but other factors such as structured inhibition may also contribute. Hence, further analyses are required to obtain a deeper mechanistic understanding of manifold geometry in networks with E/I assemblies. Nonetheless, our results suggest that precise synaptic balance may generally favor intermediate over discrete transformations because this regime tends to linearize the relationship between the mean input and output firing rates of neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Denève and Machens, 2016</xref>).</p>

<p>E/I assemblies increased variability of population activity along preferred directions of state space and reduced its dimensionality in comparison to <italic>rand</italic> networks. Nonetheless, dimensionality remained high compared to <italic>Scaled</italic> networks with discrete attractor states. These observations indicate that geometric transformations in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks involved (1) a modest amplification of activity in one or a few directions aligned to the assembly, and (2) a modest reduction of activity in other directions. E/I assemblies therefore created a local curvature of coding space that “focused” activity in a subset of dimensions and, thus, stored information in the geometry of coding space.</p>
<p>As E/I assemblies were small relative to the total size of the E neuron population, stored information may be represented predominantly by small neuronal subsets. Consistent with this hypothesis, d<sub>M</sub> was increased and the classification of learned inputs by QDA was enhanced when activity was read out from subsets of assembly neurons as compared to random neuronal subsets. Moreover, signatures of pattern completion were found in the activity of assemblies but not in global pattern correlations. The retrieval of information from networks with small E/I assemblies therefore depends on the selection of informative neurons for readout. Unlike in networks with global attractor states, signatures of memory storage may thus be difficult to detect experimentally without specific knowledge of assembly memberships.</p>

<title>Computational functions of networks with E/I assemblies</title>
<p>In theory, precisely balanced networks with E/I assemblies may support pattern classification despite high variability of spike trains and the absence of discrete attractor states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Denève and Machens, 2016</xref>). Indeed, we found in <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> networks that input patterns were classified successfully by generic classifiers, particularly relative to learned inputs. Analyses based on the Mahalanobis distance d<sub>M</sub> indicate that classification of learned inputs was enhanced by two effects: (1) local manifolds representing learned odors became more distant from representations of other odors due to a modest increase in firing rates within E/I assemblies, and (2) the concomitant increase in variability was not isotropic, remaining sufficiently low in directions that separated novel from learned patterns. Hence, information contained in the geometry of coding space can be retrieved by readout mechanisms aligned to activity manifolds. Efficient readout mechanisms may thus integrate activity primarily from assembly neurons, as mimicked in our QDA-based pattern classification. This notion is consistent with the finding that the integrated activity of E/I assemblies can be highly informative despite variable firing of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boerlin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Denève et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Denève and Machens, 2016</xref>). It will thus be interesting to explore how the readout of information from local manifolds could be further optimized.</p>
<p>Networks with E/I assemblies may also perform computations other than pattern classification. A toy model of continual learning indicates that precise balance can stabilize firing rate distributions when new memories are added, helping to prevent catastrophic failures. Furthermore, we found that continuous manifolds in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks support metric analyses, for example, to determine the relatedness of a (potentially complex) input to previously learned stimuli. Such tasks are not supported by discrete attractor states because information about gradual differences between inputs is lost by pattern completion. E/I assemblies can thus enhance the quantitative analysis of relevant information through changes in manifold geometry.</p>
<p>Conceivably, E/I assemblies may have further consequences for neuronal computation. Unlike discrete attractor networks, <italic>Tuned</italic> networks do not exhibit persistent activity, suggesting that they mediate fast computations rather than short-term memory functions. Fast classification may, for example, be important to interpret dynamical sensory inputs on a moment-to-moment basis. Moreover, the representation of learned inputs by small neuronal subsets, rather than global activity states, raises the possibility that multiple inputs can be classified simultaneously. Generally, the absence of discrete attractor states indicates that information is not stored in the form of distinct items. Rather, E/I assemblies cause geometric modifications of a continuous coding space that result in an overrepresentation of learned (relevant) inputs at the expense of other stimuli. These pattern transformations may thus contribute to different classification and learning processes by re-formatting and extracting relevant information for further processing by distributed networks. Such a function would be loosely related to computations within layers of artificial neuronal networks and consistent with the notion that piriform cortex is embedded in a larger network comprising multiple telencephalic brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Haberly, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title>Balanced state networks with E/I assemblies as models for olfactory cortex</title>
<p>Piriform cortex and Dp have been proposed to function as attractor-based memory networks for odors. Consistent with this hypothesis, pattern completion and its modulation by learning has been observed in piriform cortex of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barnes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chapuis and Wilson, 2011</xref>). However, odor-evoked firing patterns in piriform cortex and Dp are typically irregular, variable, transient and less reproducible than in the OB even after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jacobson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yaksi et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that activity does not converge onto stable attractor states. Balanced networks with E/I assemblies, in contrast, are generally consistent with these experimental observations. Alternative models for pattern classification in the balanced state include networks endowed with short-term plasticity, which respond to stimuli with an initial amplification phase followed by a tonic inhibition-stabilized state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wu and Zenke, 2021</xref>), or mechanisms related to “balanced amplification”, which typically generate pronounced activity transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahmadian and Miller, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Murphy and Miller, 2009</xref>). However, it has not been explored whether these models can be adapted to reproduce characteristic features of Dp or piriform cortex.</p>
<p>Our results generate predictions to test the hypothesis that E/I assemblies establish local manifolds in Dp: (1) odor-evoked population activity should be constrained onto manifolds, particularly in response to learned odors. (2) Learning should increase the magnitude and asymmetry of d<sub>M</sub> between odor representations. (3) Activity evoked by learned and related odors should exhibit lower dimensionality and more directional variability than activity evoked by novel odors. (4) Careful manipulations of inhibition may unmask assemblies by increasing amplification. These predictions may be addressed experimentally by large-scale measurements of odor-evoked activity after learning. The direct detection of E/I assemblies will ultimately require dense reconstructions of large neuronal networks at synaptic resolution. Given the small size of Dp, this challenge may be addressed in zebrafish by connectomics approaches based on volume electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Denk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Friedrich and Wanner, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kornfeld and Denk, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The hypothesis that memory networks contain E/I assemblies and operate in a state of precise synaptic balance can be derived from the basic assumptions that (1) synaptic plasticity establishes assemblies and (2) that firing rate distributions remain stable as network structure is modified by experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barron et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hennequin et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, <italic>Tuned</italic> networks based on Dp may also reproduce features of other recurrently connected brain areas such as hippocampus and neocortex, which also operate in a balanced state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Renart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sadeh and Clopath, 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shadlen and Newsome, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Znamenskiy et al., 2024</xref>) Future experiments may therefore explore representations of learned information by local manifolds also in cortical brain areas.</p>

<title>Olfactory bulb input</title>
<p>Each pDp<sub>sim</sub> neuron received external input from the OB, which consisted of 1500 mitral cells spontaneously active at 6 Hz. Odors were simulated by increasing the firing rate of 150 randomly selected mitral cells. Firing rates of these “activated” mitral cells were drawn from a discrete uniform distribution ranging from 8 to 32 Hz and their onset latencies were drawn from a discrete uniform distribution ranging from 0 to 200 ms. An additional 75 randomly selected mitral cells were inhibited. Firing rates and latencies of these neurons were drawn from discrete uniform distributions ranging from 0 to 5 Hz and from 0 to 200 ms, respectively. After odor onset, firing rates decreased exponentially with a time constant of 1, 2 or 4 s (equally distributed). Spikes were then generated from a Poisson distribution, and this process was repeated to create trial-to-trial variability. As all odors had almost identical firing patterns, the total OB input did not vary much across odors. In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> – 3, the odor set consisted of 10 novel and/or 10 learned odors, all of which were uncorrelated (pattern correlations close to zero). Odors were presented for 2 s and separated by 1 s of baseline activity.</p>
<p>Olfactory subspaces comprised 121 OB activity patterns. Each pattern was represented by a pixel in a 11 x 11 square. The pixel at each vertex corresponded to one pure odor with 150 activated and 75 inhibited mitral cells as described above, and the remaining pixels corresponded to mixtures. When pure odors were correlated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), adjacent pure odors shared half of their activated and half of their inhibited mitral cells. We generated 8 different trajectories within the square, each visiting all possible virtual odor locations for 1s. Each trajectory thus consisted of 121s of odor presentation, and trajectories were separated by 2 s of baseline activity. The dataset for analysis therefore comprised 968 activity patterns (8 trajectories x 121 odors). The total number of activated and inhibited cells at each location in the virtual square remained within the range of 150 ± 10% and 75 ± 10%, respectively. The fraction of activated and inhibited mitral cells from a given pure odor (its concentration) decreased with the distance from the corresponding vertex as shown in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. At each location within the square and for each trajectory, mitral cells that remained activated in the mixture were randomly selected from the pool of C mitral cells with the shortest latencies from each pure odor. C decreased with the distance from the vertex as shown in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The firing rate of each selected mitral cell varied ±1 Hz around its rate in response to the pure odor. The identity, but not the firing rate, of the activated mitral cells therefore changed gradually within the odor subspace. This procedure reflects the experimental observation that responses of zebrafish mitral cells to binary odor mixtures often resemble responses to one of the pure components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tabor et al., 2004</xref>).</p>

Hence, the size of assemblies was substantially smaller than the total population, consistent with the observation that only a minority of neurons in Dp or piriform cortex are activated during odor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Miura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yaksi et al., 2009</xref>) and upregulate <italic>cfos</italic> during olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meissner-Bernard et al., 2018</xref>). We then rewired assembly neurons: additional connections were created between assembly neurons, and a matching number of existing connections between non-assembly and assembly neurons were eliminated. The number of input connections per neuron therefore remained unchanged. A new connection between two assembly neurons doubled the synaptic strength w<sub>EE</sub> if it added to an existing connection. As a result of this rewiring, the connection probability within the assembly increased by a factor 〈 relative to the baseline connection probability.</p>
<p>In <italic>Scaled</italic> networks, w<sub>IE</sub> was increased globally by a constant factor χ. In <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, connections were modified between the 100 E neurons of an assembly and the 25 I neurons that were most densely connected to these E neurons, using the same procedure as for E-to-E connections. In <italic>Tuned I</italic> networks, only I-to-E connections were rewired, while in <italic>Tuned E+I networks</italic>, both I-to-E and E-to-I connections were rewired (<xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Whenever possible, parameters 〈, ®, ©, χ that generated networks with less than 15% change in population firing rates compared to the corresponding <italic>rand</italic> network were selected.

<p><italic>Co-tuning</italic> was quantified by two different procedures: (1) For each neuron, we calculated the Pearson correlation between the time-averaged E and I conductances in response to 10 learned odors. (2) As described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018</xref>), we projected observed pairs of E and I conductances onto a “balanced” and “counter-balanced” axis. The balanced axis was obtained by fitting a linear model without constant to the E and I conductances of 4000*10 neuron-learned odor pairs. The resulting model was a constant I/E ratio (∼1.2) that defined a membrane potential close to spike threshold. The counter-balanced axis was orthogonal to the balanced axis. For each neuron, synaptic conductances were projected onto these axes and their dispersions quantified by the standard deviations.</p>

<title>Classification: four-way forced choice task</title>
<p>To assess the assignment of odor-evoked patterns to representations of pure odors in the odor subspace, we used <italic>Quadratic Linear Discriminant</italic> (QDA) analysis, a non-linear classifier that takes into account the separation and covariance patterns of different classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ghojogh and Crowley, 2019</xref>). The training set consisted of the population response to multiple trials of each of the 4 pure odors, averaged over the first and second half of the 1 s odor presentation. To increase the number of training data in each of the 4 odor classes, the training set also included population response to odors that were closely related to the pure odor (Pearson correlation between OB response patterns &gt; 0.6). Analyses were performed using subsets of 80 neurons (similar results were obtained using 50 – 100 neurons). These neurons were randomly selected (50 iterations) either from the (pseudo-) assemblies representing the pure odors (400 E neurons; pseudo-assemblies in <italic>rand</italic> networks and for novel odors) or from the entire population of E neurons. We verified that the data came from a Gaussian mixture model. The trained classifier was then applied to activity patterns evoked by the remaining odors of the subspace (test set; correlation with pure odors &lt; 0.6). Each pattern x from the test set was assigned to the class k that maximized the discriminant function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="571272v3_inline4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, where S<sub>k</sub> is the neuronal covariance matrix of each odor class k and π<sub>k</sub> is the prior probability of class k. This discriminant function is closely related to d<sub>M</sub>. The subsampling of neurons ensured the invertibility of S<sub>k</sub> in <italic>Tuned</italic> and <italic>rand</italic> networks. In <italic>Scaled</italic> networks, S<sub>k</sub> is low-rank and therefore not invertible, and QDA cannot be applied.</p>
<p>Template matching (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>) was performed in a similar way except that each test pattern x was assigned to the class k that maximized the correlation between pattern x and a randomly selected pattern in each class (10 iterations).</p>

<title>Classification: odor concentration</title>
<p>As mentioned above, an odor is represented by 150 activated mitral cells, a subset of which remain activated in mixtures. We define the percentage of remaining activated cells as the concentration of the odor. We performed multiple linear regression to predict the concentration of a given odor based on the firing rate of 80 E neurons averaged over the first second of odor presentation. As for QDA, these 80 neurons were randomly selected (50 iterations) from the (pseudo-) assemblies representing the pure odors (400 E neurons; pseudo-assemblies in <italic>rand</italic> networks and for novel odors). We included 4 or 8 trials to equilibrate the number of population responses across the different concentrations (n=352).</p>
<p>Using the Matlab function <italic>fitcecoc</italic>, we also trained a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to assess the accuracy of different networks in predicting the concentration of an odor in a mixture. Mixtures were divided into 6 different concentration classes, with 15% increments (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We included 2 to 6 trials to equilibrate the number of population responses within the different classes. The dataset consisted of 162 population responses of 80 randomly selected neurons (20 iterations) and was randomly partitioned in training and testing set (2-fold cross-validation, 20 iterations).</p>

Equivalent plots for dM (same plots as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Note that dM was increased asymmetrically.

These effects were prominent when E neurons were drawn from assemblies. An important contribution to the increase in dM in the direction from learned odors to reference classes representing novel odors was made by the increased distance between class centers. In the other direction, dM was smaller, implying that variability in the reference class was higher. Nonetheless, variability in the relevant direction did not fully counteract the increased distance between class centers in <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> networks. As a consequence, dM was still increased slightly relative to the corresponding <italic>rand</italic> networks. Most of these effects were still observed, albeit weakly, when E neurons were drawn from the whole population.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study introduces a biologically constrained model of telencephalic area of adult zebrafish to highlight the significance of precisely balanced memory networks in olfactory processing. The authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that their model performs better in multiple situations (for e.g. in terms of network stability and shaping the geometry of representations), compared to traditional attractor networks and persistent activity. The work supports recent studies reporting functional E/I subnetworks in several sensory cortexes, and will be of interest to both theoretical and experimental neuroscientists studying network dynamics based on structured excitatory and inhibitory interactions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Meissner-Bernard et al present a biologically constrained model of telencephalic area of adult zebrafish, a homologous area to the piriform cortex, and argue for the role of precisely balanced memory networks in olfactory processing.</p>
<p>This is interesting as it can add to recent evidence on the presence of functional subnetworks in multiple sensory cortices. It is also important in deviating from traditional accounts of memory systems as attractor networks. Evidence for attractor networks has been found in some systems, like in the head direction circuits in the flies. However, the presence of attractor dynamics in other modalities, like sensory systems, and their role in computation has been more contentious. This work contributes to this active line of research in experimental and computational neuroscience by suggesting that, rather than being represented in attractor networks and persistent activity, olfactory memories might be coded by balanced excitation-inhibitory subnetworks.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of the work is in: (1) direct link to biological parameters and measurements, (2) good controls and quantification of the results, and (3) comparison across multiple models.</p>
<p>(1) The authors have done a good job of gathering the current experimental information to inform a biological-constrained spiking model of the telencephalic area of adult zebrafish. The results are compared to previous experimental measurements to choose the right regimes of operation.</p>
<p>
(2) Multiple quantification metrics and controls are used to support the main conclusions, and to ensure that the key parameters are controlled for - e.g. when comparing across multiple models.</p>
<p>
(3) Four specific models (random, scaled I / attractor, and two variant of specific E-I networks - tuned I and tuned E+I) are compared with different metrics, helping to pinpoint which features emerge in which model.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have also:</p>
<p>
(a) made a good effort to provide a mechanistic explanation of their results (especially on the mechanism underlying medium amplification in specific E/I network models);</p>
<p>
(b) performed a systematic analysis of the parameter space by changing different parameters of E and I neurons (specifically showing that different time constants of E and I neurons do not change the results and therefore the main effects result from connectivity);</p>
<p>
(c) added further analysis and discussion on the potential functional and computational significance of balanced specific E-I subnetworks.</p>
<p>These additions substantially strengthen the study, presenting compelling evidence for how networks with specific E-I structure can underpin olfactory processing and memory representations. The findings have potential implications that extend beyond the olfactory system and may be applicable to other neural systems and species.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors conducted a comparative analysis of four networks, varying in the presence of excitatory assemblies and the architecture of inhibitory cell assembly connectivity. They found that co-tuned E-I assemblies provide network stability and a continuous representation of input patterns (on locally constrained manifolds), contrasting with networks with global inhibition that result in attractor networks.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings presented in this paper are very interesting and cutting-edge. The manuscript effectively conveys the message and presents a creative way to represent high-dimensional inputs and network responses. Particularly, the result regarding the projection of input patterns onto local manifolds and continuous representation of input/memory is very Intriguing and novel. Both computational and experimental neuroscientists would find value in reading the paper.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Intuitively, classification (decodability) in discrete attractor networks is much better than in networks with continuous representations. This could also be shown in Figure 5B, along with the performance of the random and tuned E-I networks. The latter networks have the advantage of providing network stability compared to the Scaled I network, but at the cost of reduced network salience and, therefore, reduced input decodability. Thus, tuned E-I networks cannot always perform better than any other network.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work investigates computational consequences of assemblies containing both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E/I assembly) in a model with parameters constrained by experimental data from the telencephalic area Dp of zebrafish. The authors show how this precise E/I balance shapes the geometry of neuronal dynamics in comparison to unstructured networks and networks with more global inhibitory balance. Specifically, E/I assemblies lead to the activity being locally restricted onto manifolds - a dynamical structure in-between high-dimensional representations in unstructured networks and discrete attractors in networks with global inhibitory balance. Furthermore, E/I assemblies lead to smoother representations of mixtures of stimuli while those stimuli can still be reliably classified, and allows for more robust learning of additional stimuli.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Since experimental studies do suggest that E/I balance is very precise and E/I assemblies exist, it is important to study the consequences of those connectivity structures on network dynamics. The authors convincingly show that E/I assemblies lead to different geometries of stimulus representation compared to unstructured networks and networks with global inhibition. This finding might open the door for future studies for exploring the functional advantage of these locally defined manifolds, and how other network properties allow to shape those manifolds.</p>
<p>The authors also make sure that their spiking model is well-constrained by experimental data from the zebrafish pDp. Both, spontaneous and odor stimulus triggered spiking activity is within the range of experimental measurements. But the model is also general enough to be potentially applied to findings in other animal models and brain regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All my previous points have been addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Meissner-Bernard et al present a biologically constrained model of telencephalic area of adult zebrafish, a homologous area to the piriform cortex, and argue for the role of precisely balanced memory networks in olfactory processing.</p>
<p>This is interesting as it can add to recent evidence on the presence of functional subnetworks in multiple sensory cortices. It is also important in deviating from traditional accounts of memory systems as attractor networks. Evidence for attractor networks has been found in some systems, like in the head direction circuits in the flies. However, the presence of attractor dynamics in other modalities, like sensory systems, and their role in computation has been more contentious. This work contributes to this active line of research in experimental and computational neuroscience by suggesting that, rather than being represented in attractor networks and persistent activity, olfactory memories might be coded by balanced excitation-inhibitory subnetworks.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of the work is in: (1) direct link to biological parameters and measurements, (2) good controls and quantification of the results, and (3) comparison across multiple models.</p>
<p>(1) The authors have done a good job of gathering the current experimental information to inform a biological-constrained spiking model of the telencephalic area of adult zebrafish. The results are compared to previous experimental measurements to choose the right regimes of operation.</p>
<p>(2) Multiple quantification metrics and controls are used to support the main conclusions and to ensure that the key parameters are controlled for - e.g. when comparing across multiple models.  (3) Four specific models (random, scaled I / attractor, and two variant of specific E-I networks - tuned I and tuned E+I) are compared with different metrics, helping to pinpoint which features emerge in which model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major problems with the work are: (1) mechanistic explanation of the results in specific E-I networks, (2) parameter exploration, and (3) the functional significance of the specific E-I model.</p>
<p>(1) The main problem with the paper is a lack of mechanistic analysis of the models. The models are treated like biological entities and only tested with different assays and metrics to describe their different features (e.g. different geometry of representation in Fig. 4). Given that all the key parameters of the models are known and can be changed (unlike biological networks), it is expected to provide a more analytical account of why specific networks show the reported results. For instance, what is the key mechanism for medium amplification in specific E/I network models (Fig. 3)? How does the specific geometry of representation/manifolds (in Fig. 4) emerge in terms of excitatory-inhibitory interactions, and what are the main mechanisms/parameters? Mechanistic account and analysis of these results are missing in the current version of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that further mechanistic insights would be of interest and addressed this issue at different levels:</p>
<p>(1) Biophysical parameters: to determine whether network behavior depends on specific choices of biophysical parameters in E and I neurons we equalized biophysical parameters across neuron types. The main observations are unchanged, suggesting that the observed effects depend primarily on network connectivity (see also response to comment [2]).</p>
<p>(2) Mechanism of modest amplification in E/I assemblies: analyzing the different components of the synaptic currents demonstrate that the modest amplification of activity in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks results from an “imperfect” balance of <italic>recurrent</italic> excitation and inhibition within assemblies (see new Figures 3D-F and text p.7). Hence, E/I co-tuning substantially reduces the net amplification in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks as compared to <italic>Scaled</italic> networks, thus preventing discrete attractor dynamics and stabilizing network activity, but a modest amplification still occurs, consistent with biological observations.</p>
<p>(3) Representational geometry: to obtain insights into the network mechanisms underlying effects of E/I assemblies on the geometry of population activity we tested the hypothesis that geometrical changes depend, at least in part, on the modest amplification of activity within E/I assemblies (see Supplementary Figure 6). We changed model parameters to either prevent the modest amplification in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks (increasing I-to-E connectivity within assemblies) or introduce a modest amplification in subsets of neurons by other mechanisms (concentration-dependent increase in the excitability of pseudo-assembly neurons; <italic>Scaled</italic> I networks with reduced connectivity within assemblies). Manipulations that introduced a modest, input-dependent amplification in neuronal subsets had geometrical effects similar to those observed in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, whereas manipulations that prevented a modest amplification abolished these effects (Supplementary Figure 6). Note however that these manipulations generated different firing rate distributions. These results provide a starting point for more detailed analyses of the relationship between network connectivity and representational geometry (see p.12).</p>
<p>In summary, our additional analyses indicate that effects of E/I assemblies on representational geometry depend primarily on network connectivity, rather than specific biophysical parameters, and that the resulting modest amplification of activity within assemblies makes an important contribution. Further analyses may reveal more specific relationships between E/I assemblies and representational geometry, but such analyses are beyond the scope of this study.</p>

<p>(2) The second major issue with the study is a lack of systematic exploration and analysis of the parameter space. Some parameters are biologically constrained, but not all the parameters. For instance, it is not clear what the justification for the choice of synaptic time scales are (with E synaptic time constants being larger than inhibition: tau_syn_i = 10 ms, tau_syn_E = 30 ms). How would the results change if they are varying these - and other unconstrained - parameters? It is important to show how the main results, especially the manifold localisation, would change by doing a systematic exploration of the key parameters and performing some sensitivity analysis. This would also help to see how robust the results are, which parameters are more important and which parameters are less relevant, and to shed light on the key mechanisms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We chose a relatively slow time constant for excitatory synapses because experimental data indicate that excitatory synaptic currents in Dp and piriform cortex contain a prominent NMDA component. Nevertheless, to assess whether network behavior depends on specific choices of biophysical parameters in E and I neurons, we have performed additional simulations with equal synaptic time constants and equal biophysical parameters for all neurons. Each neuron also received the same number of inputs from each population (see revised Methods). Results were similar to those observed previously (Supplementary Fig.5 and p.9 of main text). We therefore conclude that the main effects observed in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks cannot be explained by differences in biophysical parameters between E and I neurons but is primarily a consequence of network connectivity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is not clear what the main functional advantage of the specific E-I network model is compared to random networks. In terms of activity, they show that specific E-I networks amplify the input more than random networks (Fig. 3). But when it comes to classification, the effect seems to be very small (Fig. 5c). Description of different geometry of representation and manifold localization in specific networks compared to random networks is good, but it is more of an illustration of different activity patterns than proving a functional benefit for the network. The reader is still left with the question of what major functional benefits (in terms of computational/biological processing) should be expected from these networks, if they are to be a good model for olfactory processing and learning.</p>
<p>One possibility for instance might be that the tasks used here are too easy to reveal the main benefits of the specific models - and more complex tasks would be needed to assess the functional enhancement (e.g. more noisy conditions or more combination of odours). It would be good to show this more clearly - or at least discuss it in relation to computation and function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the previous manuscript, the analysis of potential computational benefits other than pattern classification was limited and the discussion of this issue was condensed into a single itemized paragraph to avoid excessive speculation. Although a thorough analysis of potential computational benefits exceeds the scope of a single paper, we agree with the reviewer that this issue is of interest and therefore added additional analyses and discussion.</p>
<p>In the initial manuscript we analyzed pattern classification primarily to investigate whether <italic>Tuned</italic> networks can support this function at all, given that they do not exhibit discrete attractor states. We found this to be the case, which we consider a first important result.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we found that precise balance of E/I assemblies can protect networks against catastrophic firing rate instabilities when assemblies are added sequentially, as in continual learning. Results from these simulations are now described and discussed in more detail (see Results p.11 and Discussion p.13).</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we now also examine additional potential benefits of <italic>Tuned</italic> networks and discuss them in more detail (see new Figure 5D-F and text p.11). One hypothesis is that continuous representations provide a distance metric between a given input and relevant (learned) stimuli. To address this hypothesis, we (1) performed regression analysis and (2) trained support vector machines (SVMs) to predict the concentration of a given odor in a mixture based on population activity. In both cases, <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> networks outperformed <italic>Scaled</italic> and _rand n_etworks in predicting the concentration of learned odors across a wide range mixtures (Figure 5D-F).  E/I assemblies therefore support the quantification of learned odors within mixtures or, more generally, assessments of how strongly a (potentially complex) input is related to relevant odors stored in memory. Such a metric assessment of stimulus quality is not well supported by discrete attractor networks because inputs are mapped onto discrete network states.</p>
<p>The observation that <italic>Tuned</italic> networks do not map inputs onto discrete outputs indicates that such networks do not classify inputs as distinct items. Nonetheless, the observed geometrical modifications of continuous representations support the classification of learned inputs or the assessment of metric relationships by hypothetical readout neurons. Geometrical modifications of odor representations may therefore serve as one of multiple steps in multi-layer computations for pattern classification (and/or other computations). In this scenario, the transformation of odor representations in Dp may be seen as related to transformations of representations between different layers in artificial networks, which collectively perform a given task (notwithstanding obvious structural and mechanistic differences between artificial and biological networks). In other words, geometrical transformations of representations in <italic>Tuned</italic> networks may overrepresent learned (relevant) information at the expense of other information and thereby support further learning processes in other brain areas. An obvious corollary of this scenario is that Dp does not perform odor classification <italic>per se</italic> based on inputs from the olfactory bulb but reformats representations of odor space based on experience to support computational tasks as part of a larger system. This scenario is now explicitly discussed (p.14).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors conducted a comparative analysis of four networks, varying in the presence of excitatory assemblies and the architecture of inhibitory cell assembly connectivity. They found that co-tuned E-I assemblies provide network stability and a continuous representation of input patterns (on locally constrained manifolds), contrasting with networks with global inhibition that result in attractor networks.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings presented in this paper are very interesting and cutting-edge. The manuscript effectively conveys the message and presents a creative way to represent high-dimensional inputs and network responses. Particularly, the result regarding the projection of input patterns onto local manifolds and continuous representation of input/memory is very Intriguing and novel. Both computational and experimental neuroscientists would find value in reading the paper.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>that have continuous representations. This could also be shown in Figure 5B, along with the performance of the random and tuned E-I networks. The latter networks have the advantage of providing network stability compared to the Scaled I network, but at the cost of reduced network salience and, therefore, reduced input decodability. The authors may consider designing a decoder to quantify and compare the classification performance of all four networks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now quantified classification by networks with discrete attractor dynamics (<italic>Scaled</italic>) along with other networks. However, because the neuronal covariance matrix for such networks is low rank and not invertible, pattern classification cannot be analyzed by QDA as in Figure 5B. We therefore classified patterns from the odor subspace by template matching, assigning test patterns to one of the four classes based on correlations (see Supplementary Figure 8). As expected, <italic>Scaled</italic> networks performed well, but they did not outperform <italic>Tuned</italic> networks. Moreover, the performance of <italic>Scaled</italic> networks, but not <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, depended on the order in which odors were presented to the network. This hysteresis effect is a direct consequence of persistent attractor states and decreased the general classification performance of <italic>Scaled</italic> networks (see Supplementary Figure 8 for details). These results confirm the prediction that networks with discrete attractor states can efficiently classify inputs, but also reveal disadvantages arising from attractor dynamics. Moreover, the results indicate that the classification performance of <italic>Tuned</italic> networks is also high under the given task conditions, which simulate a biologically realistic scenario.</p>
<p>We would also like to emphasize that classification may not be the only task, and perhaps not even a main task, of Dp/piriform cortex or other memory networks with E/I assemblies. Conceivably, other computations could include metric assessments of inputs relative to learned inputs or additional learning-related computations. Please see our response to comment (3) of reviewer 1 for a further discussion of this issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Networks featuring E/I assemblies could potentially represent multistable attractors by exploring the parameter space for their reciprocal connectivity and connectivity with the rest of the network. However, for co-tuned E-I networks, the scope for achieving multistability is relatively constrained compared to networks employing global or lateral inhibition between assemblies. It would be good if the authors mentioned this in the discussion. Also, the fact that reciprocal inhibition increases network stability has been shown before and should be cited in the statements addressing network stability (e.g., some of the citations in the manuscript, including Rost et al. 2018, Lagzi &amp; Fairhall 2022, and Vogels et al. 2011 have shown this).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We now explicitly discuss multistability (see p. 12) and refer to additional references in the statements addressing network stability.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work investigates the computational consequences of assemblies containing both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E/I assembly) in a model with parameters constrained by experimental data from the telencephalic area Dp of zebrafish. The authors show how this precise E/I balance shapes the geometry of neuronal dynamics in comparison to unstructured networks and networks with more global inhibitory balance. Specifically, E/I assemblies lead to the activity being locally restricted onto manifolds - a dynamical structure in between high-dimensional representations in unstructured networks and discrete attractors in networks with global inhibitory balance. Furthermore, E/I assemblies lead to smoother representations of mixtures of stimuli while those stimuli can still be reliably classified, and allow for more robust learning of additional stimuli.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Since experimental studies do suggest that E/I balance is very precise and E/I assemblies exist, it is important to study the consequences of those connectivity structures on network dynamics. The authors convincingly show that E/I assemblies lead to different geometries of stimulus representation compared to unstructured networks and networks with global inhibition. This finding might open the door for future studies for exploring the functional advantage of these locally defined manifolds, and how other network properties allow to shape those manifolds.</p>
<p>The authors also make sure that their spiking model is well-constrained by experimental data from the zebrafish pDp. Both spontaneous and odor stimulus triggered spiking activity is within the range of experimental measurements. But the model is also general enough to be potentially applied to findings in other animal models and brain regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I find the point about pattern completion a bit confusing. In Fig. 3 the authors argue that only the Scaled I network can lead to pattern completion for morphed inputs since the output correlations are higher than the input correlations. For me, this sounds less like the network can perform pattern completion but it can nonlinearly increase the output correlations. Furthermore, in Suppl. Fig. 3 the authors show that activating half the assembly does lead to pattern completion in the sense that also non-activated assembly cells become highly active and that this pattern completion can be seen for Scaled I, Tuned E+I, and Tuned I networks. These two results seem a bit contradictory to me and require further clarification, and the authors might want to clarify how exactly they define pattern completion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that this comment concerns a semantic misunderstanding and apologize for any lack of clarity. We added a definition of pattern completion in the text: “…the retrieval of the whole memory from noisy or corrupted versions of the learned input.”. Pattern completion may be assessed using different procedures. In computational studies, it is often analyzed by delivering input to a subset of the assembly neurons which store a given memory (partial activation). Under these conditions, we find recruitment of the entire assembly in all structured networks, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figure 3. However, these conditions are unlikely to occur during odor presentation because the majority of neurons do not receive any input.</p>
<p>Another more biologically motivated approach to assess pattern completion is to gradually modify a realistic odor input into a learned input, thereby gradually increasing the overlap between the two inputs. This approach had been used previously in experimental studies (references added to the text p.6). In the presence of assemblies, recurrent connectivity is expected to recruit assembly neurons (and thus retrieve the stored pattern) more efficiently as the learned pattern is approached. This should result in a nonlinear increase in the similarity between the evoked and the learned activity pattern. This signature was prominent in <italic>Scaled</italic> networks but not in <italic>Tuned</italic> or <italic>rand</italic> networks. Obviously, the underlying procedure is different from the partial activation of the assembly described above because input patterns target many neurons (including neurons outside assemblies) and exhibit a biologically realistic distribution of activity. However, this approach has also been referred to as “pattern completion” in the neuroscience literature, which may be the source of semantic confusion here. To clarify the difference between these approaches we have now revised the text and explicitly described each procedure in more detail (see p.6).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors argue that Tuned E+I networks have several advantages over Scaled I networks. While I agree with the authors that in some cases adding this localized E/I balance is beneficial, I believe that a more rigorous comparison between Tuned E+I networks and Scaled I networks is needed: quantification of variance (Fig. 4G) and angle distributions (Fig. 4H) should also be shown for the Scaled I network. Similarly in Fig. 5, what is the Mahalanobis distance for Scaled I networks and how well can the Scaled I network be classified compared to the Tuned E+I network? I suspect that the Scaled I network will actually be better at classifying odors compared to the E+I network. The authors might want to speculate about the benefit of having networks with both sources of inhibition (local and global) and hence being able to switch between locally defined manifolds and discrete attractor states.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a more rigorous comparison of Tuned and Scaled networks would be of interest. We have added the variance analysis (Fig 4G) and angle distributions (Fig. 4H) for both Tuned I and Scaled networks. However, the Mahalanobis distances and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis cannot be applied to Scaled networks because their neuronal covariance matrix is low rank and not invertible_._ To nevertheless compare these networks, we performed template matching by assigning test patterns to one of the four odor classes based on correlations to template patterns (Supplementary Figure 8; see also response to the first comment of reviewer 2). Interestingly, <italic>Scaled</italic> networks performed well at classification but did not outperform <italic>Tuned</italic> networks, and exhibited disadvantages arising from attractor dynamics (Supplementary Figure 8; see also response to the first comment of reviewer 2)<italic>.</italic> Furthermore, in further analyses we found that continuous representational manifolds support metric assessments of inputs relative to learned odors, which cannot be achieved by discrete representations. These results are now shown in Figure 5D-E and discussed explicitly in the text on p.11 (see also response to comment 3 of reviewer 1).</p>
<p>We preferred not to add a sentence in the Discussion about benefits of networks having both sources of inhibition_,_ as we find this a bit too speculative.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>At a few points in the manuscript, the authors use statements without actually providing evidence in terms of a Figure. Often the authors themselves acknowledge this, by adding the term &quot;not shown&quot; to the end of the sentence. I believe it will be helpful to the reader to be provided with figures or panels in support of the statements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. We have provided additional data figures to support the following statements:</p>
<p>“d<sub>M</sub> was again increased upon learning, particularly between learned odors and reference classes representing other odors (Supplementary Figure 9)”</p>
<p>“decreasing amplification in assemblies of Scaled networks changed transformations towards the intermediate behavior, albeit with broader firing rate distributions than in Tuned networks (Supplementary Figure 6 B)”</p>

<p>Precise balancing of excitation and inhibition in subnetworks would lead to the cancellation of specific dynamical modes responsible for the amplification of responses (hence, deviating from the attractor dynamics with an unstable specific mode). What is the key difference in the specific E/I networks here (tuned I or/and tuned E+I) which make them stand between random and attractor networks? Excitatory and inhibitory neurons have different parameters in the model (Table 1). Time constants of inhibitory and excitatory synapses are also different (P. 13). Are these parameters causing networks to be effectively more excitation dominated (hence deviating from a random spectrum which would be expected from a precisely balanced E/I network, with exactly the same parameters of E and I neurons)? It is necessary to analyse the network models, describe the key mechanism for their amplification, and pinpoint the key differences between E and I neurons which are crucial for this.</p>

<p>This information was present in the original manuscript at (Figure 3) but we improved the writing to further clarify this issue: “ (…) we morphed a novel odor into a learned odor (Figure 3A), or a learned odor into another learned odor (Supplementary Figure 3B), and quantified the similarity between morphed and learned odors by the Pearson correlation of the OB activity patterns (input correlation). We then compared input correlations to the corresponding pattern correlations among E neurons in Dp (output correlation). In <italic>rand</italic> networks, output correlations increased linearly with input correlations but did not exceed them (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 3B)”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Yes: despite odors being uncorrelated and connectivity being random, some neurons (6 % of E neurons) belong to more than one assembly.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting question. The unstability arises when inhibitions fails to counterbalance efficiently the increased recurrent excitation within Dp. The transition point is difficult to estimate, as it can depend on several parameters, including the probability of E to E connections, their strength, assembly size, and others. We have therefore not attempted to estimate it analytically.</p>

<p>P. 4: &quot;Hence, non-specific scaling of inhibition resulted in a divergence of firing rates that exhausted the dynamic range of individual neurons in the population, implying that homeostatic   global inhibition is insufficient to maintain a stable firing rate distribution.&quot;</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>To more clearly illustrate the finding that in <italic>Scaled</italic> networks, assembly neurons are highly active (close to maximal realistic firing rates) whereas non-assembly neurons are nearly silent we have now added Supplementary Fig. 2B. Moreover, we have toned down the text: “Hence, non-specific scaling of inhibition resulted in a large and biologically unrealistic divergence of firing rates (Supplementary Figure 2B) that nearly exhausted the dynamic range of individual neurons in the population, indicating that homeostatic global inhibition is insufficient to maintain a stable firing rate distribution”</p>

<p>The size of the effect (plearned – pnovel = 0.074; difference of means; Figure 5C) may appear small in terms of absolute probability, but it is substantial relative to the maximum possible increase (1 – p<sub>novel</sub> =  0.133; Figure 5C).

<p>We agree with the reviewer that these additional experimental observations cannot be used as biological evidence favouring Tuned E+I networks over random networks. We here just wanted to point out that additional observations which we did not take into account to fit the model are not invalidating the existence of E-I assemblies in biological networks. As assemblies tend to result in persistent activity in other types of networks, we feel that this observation is worth pointing out.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Congratulations on the great and interesting work! The results were nicely presented and the idea of continuous encoding on manifolds is very interesting. To improve the quality of the paper, in addition to the major points raised in the public review, here are some more detailed comments for the paper:</p>
<p>(1) Generally, citations have to improve. Spiking networks with excitatory assemblies and different architectures of inhibitory populations have been studied before, and the claim about improved network stability in co-tuned E-I networks has been made in the following papers that need to be correctly cited:</p>

<p>Additionally, there are lots of pioneering work about tracking of excitatory synaptic inputs by inhibitory populations, that are missing in references. Also, experimental work that show existence of cell assemblies in the brain are largely missing. On the other hand, some references that do not fit the focus of the statements have been incorrectly cited.</p>
<p>The authors may consider referencing the following more pertinent studies on spiking networks to support the statement regarding attractor dynamics in the first paragraph in the Introduction (the current citations of Hopfield and Kohonen are for rate-based networks):</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the references suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the reference list and made the following changes, which we hope address the reviewer’s concerns:</p>
<p>(1) We adjusted References about network stability in co-tuned E-I networks.</p>
<p>(2) We added the Lagzi &amp; Rotter (2015), Amit et al. (1991), Mazzucato et al. (2015) and GoldmanRakic (1995) papers in the Introduction as studies on attractor dynamics in spiking neural networks. We preferred to omit the two X.J Wang papers, as they describe attractors in decision making rather than memory processes.</p>
<p>(3) We added the Ko et al. 2011 paper as experimental evidence for assemblies in the brain. In our view, there are few experimental studies showing the existence of cell assemblies in the brain, which we distinguish from cell ensembles, group of coactive neurons.</p>
<p>(4) We also included Hennequin 2018, Brunel 2000, Lagzi et al. 2021 and Eckmann et al. 2024, which we had not cited in the initial manuscript.</p>
<p>(5) We removed the Wiechert et al. 2010 reference as it does not support the statement about geometry-preserving transformation by random networks.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The gist of the paper is about how the architecture of inhibition (reciprocal vs. global in this case) can determine network stability and salient responses (related to multistable attractors and variations) for classification purposes. It would improve the narrative of the paper if this point is raised in the Introduction and Discussion section. Also see a relevant paper that addresses this point here:</p>
<p>Lagzi F, Bustos MC, Oswald AM, Doiron B. 2021. Assembly formation is stabilized by Parvalbumin neurons and accelerated by Somatostatin neurons. bioRxiv doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459211">https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459211</ext-link></p>

<p>Classification has long been proposed to be a function of piriform cortex and autoassociative memory networks in general, and we consider it important. However, the computational function of Dp or piriform cortex is still poorly understood, and we do not focus only on odor classification as a possibility. In fact, continuous representational manifolds also support other functions such as the quantification of distance relationships of an input to previously memorized stimuli, or multi-layer network computations (including classification). In the revised manuscript, we have performed additional analyses to explore these notions in more detail, as explained above (response to public reviews, comment 3 of reviewer 1). Furthermore, we have now expanded the discussion of potential computational functions of <italic>Tuned</italic> networks and explicitly discuss classification but also other potential functions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) A plot for the values of the inhibitory conductances in Figure 1 would complete the analysis for that section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 1, we decided to only show the conductances that we use to fit our model, namely the afferent and total synaptic conductances. As the values of the inhibitory conductances can be derived from panel E, we refrained from plotting them separately for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) How did the authors calculate correlations between activity patterns as a function of time in Figure 2E, bottom row? Does the color represent correlation coefficient (which should not be time dependent) or is it a correlation function? This should be explained in the Methods section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The color represents the Pearson correlation coefficient between activity patterns within a narrow time window (100 ms). We updated the Figure legend to clarify this: “Mean correlation between activity patterns evoked by a learned odor at different time points during odor presentation. Correlation coefficients were calculated between pairs of activity vectors composed of the mean firing rates of E neurons in 100 ms time bins. Activity vectors were taken from the same or different trials, except for the diagonal, where only patterns from different trials were considered.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 3 needs more clarification (both in the main text and the figure caption). It is not clear what the axes are exactly, and why the network responses for familiar and novel inputs are different. The gray shaded area in panel B needs more explanation as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We have improved Figure 3A, the figure caption, as well as the text (see p.6). We hope that the figure is now clearer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The &quot;scaled I&quot; network, known for representing input patterns in discrete attractors, should exhibit clear separation between network responses in the 2D PC space in the PCA plots. However, Figure 4D and Figure 6D do not reflect this, as all network responses are overlapped. Can the authors explain the overlap in Figure 4D?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure 4D, activity of Scaled networks is distributed between three subregions in state space that are separated by the first 2 PCs. Two of them indeed correspond to attractor states representing the two learned odors while the third represents inputs that are not associated with these attractor states. To clarify this, please see also the density plot in Figure 4E. The few datapoints between these three subregions are likely outliers generated by the sequential change in inputs, as described in Supplementary Figure 8C.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The reason for writing about the ISN networks is not clear. Co-tuned E-I assemblies do not necessarily have to operate in this regime. Also, the results of the paper do not rely on any of the properties of ISNs, but they are more general. Authors should either show the paradoxical effect associated with ISN (i.e., if increasing input to I neurons decreases their responses) or show ISN properties using stability analysis (See computational research conducted at the Allen Institute, namely Millman et al. 2020, eLife ). Currently, the paper reads as if being in the ISN regime is a necessary requirement, which is not true. Also, the arguments do not connect with the rest of the paper and never show up again. Since we know it is not a requirement, there is no need to have those few sentences in the Results section. Also, the choice of alpha=5.0 is extreme, and therefore, it would help to judge the biological realism if the raster plots for Figs 2-6 are shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have toned down the part on ISN and reduced it to one sentence for readers who might be interested in knowing whether activity is inhibition-stabilized or not. We have also added the reference to the Tsodyks et al. 1997 paper from which we derive our stability analysis. The text now reads “Hence, pDp<sub>sim</sub> entered a balanced state during odor stimulation (Figure 1D, E) with recurrent input dominating over afferent input, as observed in pDp (Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018). Shuffling spike times of inhibitory neurons resulted in runaway activity with a probability of 0.79 ± 0.20, demonstrating that activity was inhibition-stabilized (Sadeh and Clopath, 2020b, Tsodyks et al., 1997).”</p>
<p>We have now also added the raster plots as suggested by the reviewer (see Figure 2D, Supplementary Figure 1 G, Supplementary Figure 4). We thank the reviewer for this comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) In the abstract, authors mention &quot;fast pattern classification&quot; and &quot;continual learning,&quot; but in the paper, those issues have not been addressed. The study does not include any synaptic plasticity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Concerning “continual learning” we agree that we do not simulate the learning process itself. However, Figure 6 show results of a simulation where two additional patterns were stored in a network that already contained assemblies representing other odors. We consider this a crude way of exploring the end result of a “continual learning” process. “Fast pattern classification” is mentioned because activity in balanced networks can follow fluctuating inputs with high temporal resolution, while networks with stable attractor states tend to be slow. This is likely to account for the occurrence of hysteresis effects in <italic>Scaled</italic> but not <italic>Tuned</italic> networks as shown in Supplementary</p>
<p>Fig. 8.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) In the Introduction, the first sentence in the second paragraph reads: &quot;... when neurons receive strong excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input ...&quot;. The word strong should be changed to &quot;weak&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, see the pioneering work of Brunel 2000.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In classical balanced networks, strong excitatory inputs are counterbalanced by strong inhibitory inputs, leading to a fluctuation-driven regime. We have added Brunel 2000.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) In the second paragraph of the introduction, the authors refer to studies about structural co-tuning (e.g., where &quot;precise&quot; synaptic balance is mentioned, and Vogels et al. 2011 should be cited there) and functional co-tuning (which is, in fact, different than tracking of excitation by inhibition, but the authors refer to that as co-tuning). It makes it easier to understand which studies talk about structural co-tuning and which ones are about functional co-tuning. The paper by Znamenski 2018, which showed both structural and functional tuning in experiments, is missing here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the citation to the now published paper by Znamenskyi et al. (2024).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The third paragraph in the Introduction misses some references that address network dynamics that are shaped by the inhibitory architecture in E/I assemblies in spiking networks, like Rost et al 2018 and Lagzi et al 2021.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These references have been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) The last sentence of the fourth paragraph in the Introduction implies that functional co-tuning is due to structural co-tuning, which is not necessarily true. While structural co-tuning results in functional co-tuning, functional co-tuning does not require structural co-tuning because it could arise from shared correlated input or heterogeneity in synaptic connections from E to I cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We generally agree with the reviewer, but we are uncertain which sentence the reviewer refers to.</p>
<p>We assume the reviewer refers to the last sentence of the second (rather than the fourth paragraph), which explicitly mentions the “…structural basis of E/I co-tuning…”. If so, we consider this sentence still correct because the “structural basis” refers not specifically to E/I assemblies, but also includes any other connectivity that may produce co-tuning, including the connectivity underlying the alternative possibilities mentioned by the reviewer (shared correlated input or heterogeneity of synaptic connections).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) In order to ensure that the comparison between network dynamics is legit, authors should mention up front that for all networks, the average firing rates for the excitatory cells were kept at 1 Hz, and the background input was identical for all E and I cells across different networks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We slightly revised the text to make this more clear “We (…) uniformly scaled I-to-E connection weights by a factor of χ until E population firing rates in response to learned odors matched the corresponding firing rates in <italic>rand</italic> networks, i.e., 1 Hz”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) In the last paragraph on page 5, my understanding was that an individual odor could target different cells within an assembly in different trials to generate trial to trail variability. If this is correct, this needs to be mentioned clearly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is not correct, an odor consists of 150 activated mitral cells with defined firing rates. As now mentioned in the Methods, “Spikes were then generated from a Poisson distribution, and this process was repeated to create trial-to-trial variability.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) The last paragraph on page 6 mentions that the four OB activity patterns were uncorrelated but if they were designed as in Figure 4A, dues to the existing overlap between the patterns, they cannot be uncorrelated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This appears to be a misunderstanding. We mention in the text (and show in Figure 4B) that the four odors which “… were assigned to the corners of a square…” are uncorrelated.  The intermediate odors are of course not uncorrelated. We slightly modified the corresponding paragraph (now on page 7) to clarify this: “The subspace consisted of a set of OB activity patterns representing four uncorrelated pure odors and mixtures of these pure odors. Pure odors were assigned to the corners of a square and mixtures were generated by selecting active mitral cells from each of the pure odors with probabilities depending on the relative distances from the corners (Figure 4A, Methods).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(16) The notion of &quot;learned&quot; and &quot;novel&quot; odors may be misleading as there was no plasticity in the network to acquire an input representation. It would be beneficial for the authors to clarify that by &quot;learned,&quot; they imply the presence of the corresponding E assembly for the odor in the network, with the input solely impacting that assembly. Conversely, for &quot;novel&quot; inputs, the input does not target a predefined assembly. In Figure 2 and Figure 4, it would be especially helpful to have the spiking raster plots of some sample E and I cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have modified the existing spiking raster plots in Figure 2, such that they include examples of responses to both learned and novel odors. We added spiking raster plots showing responses of I neurons to the same odors in Supplementary Figure 1F, as well as spiking raster plots of E neurons in Supplementary Figure 4A. To clarify the usage of “learned” and “novel”, we have added a sentence in the Results section: “We thus refer to an odor as “learned” when a network contains a corresponding assembly, and as “novel” when no such assembly is present.”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(17) In the last paragraph of page 8, can the authors explain where the asymmetry comes from?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in the text, the asymmetry comes from the difference in the covariance structure of different classes. To clarify, we have rephrased the sentence defining the Mahalanobis distance:</p>
<p>“This measure quantifies the distance between the pattern and the class center, taking into account covariation of neuronal activity within the class. In bidirectional comparisons between patterns from different classes, the mean dM may be asymmetric if neural covariance differs between classes.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(18) The first paragraph of page 9: random networks are not expected to perform pattern classification, but just pattern representation. It would have been better if the authors compared Scaled I network with E/I co-tuned network. Regardless of the expected poorer performance of the E/I co-tuned networks, the result would have been interesting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see our reply to the public review (reviewer 2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(20) The last sentence in the first paragraph on page 11 is not clear. What do the authors mean by &quot;linearize input-output functions&quot;, and how does it support their claim?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now amended this sentence to clarify what we mean: “…linearize the relationship between the mean input and output firing rates of neuronal populations…”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(21) In the first sentence of the last paragraph on page 11, the authors mentioned “high variability”, but it is not clear compared with which of the other 3 networks they observed high variability.</p>
<p>Structurally co-tuned E/I networks are expected to diminish network-level variability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>“High variability” refers to the variability of spike trains, which is now mentioned explicity in the text. We hope this more precise statement clarifies this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(22) Methods section, page 14: &quot;firing rates decreased with a time constant of 1, 2 or 4 s&quot;. How did they decrease? Was it an implementation algorithm?

<p>- There was no github link to the code in the manuscript. The code should be made available with a link to github in the final manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The code can be found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/clairemb90/pDp-model">https://github.com/clairemb90/pDp-model</ext-link>. The link has been added in the Methods section.</p>

<p>Figure 1:</p>
<p>- Fig. 1A: call it pDp not Dp. Please check if this name is consistent in every figure and the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for catching this. Now corrected in Figure 1, Figure 2 and in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors write: &quot;Hence, pDpsim entered an inhibition-stabilized balanced state (Sadeh and Clopath, 2020b) during odor stimulation (Figure 1D, E).&quot; and then later &quot;Shuffling spike times of inhibitory neurons resulted in runaway activity with a probability of ~80%, demonstrating that activity was indeed inhibition-stabilized. These results were robust against parameter variations (Methods).&quot; I would suggest moving the second sentence before the first sentence, because the fact that the network is in the ISN regime follows from the shuffled spike timing result.</p>
<p>Also, I'd suggest showing this as a supplementary figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have removed “inhibition-stabilized” in the first sentence as there is no strong evidence of this in Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018. And removed “indeed” in the second sentence. We also provided more detailed statistics. The text now reads “Hence, pDpsim entered a balanced state during odor stimulation (Figure 1D, E) with recurrent input dominating over afferent input, as observed in pDp (Rupprecht and Friedrich, 2018). Shuffling spike times of inhibitory neurons resulted in runaway activity with a probability of 0.79 ± 0.20, demonstrating that activity was inhibition-stabilized (Sadeh and Clopath, 2020b).”</p>

<p>Figure 2:</p>
<p>- &quot;... Scaled I networks (Figure 2H.&quot; Missing )</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors write &quot;Unlike in Scaled I networks, mean firing rates evoked by novel odors were indistinguishable from those evoked by learned odors and from mean firing rates in rand networks (Figure 2F).&quot;</p>
<p>Why is this something you want to see? Isn't it that novel stimuli usually lead to high responses? Eg in the paper Schulz et al., 2021 (eLife) which is also cited by the authors it is shown that novel responses have high onset firing rates. I suggest clarifying this (same in the context of Fig. 3C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Dp and piriform cortex, firing rates evoked by learned odors are not substantially different from firing rates evoked by novel odors. While small differences between responses to learned versus novel odors cannot be excluded, substantial learning-related differences in firing rates, as observed in other brain areas, have not been described in Dp or piriform cortex. We added references in the last paragraph of p.5. Note that the paper by Schulz et al. (2021) models a different type of circuit.</p>

<p>- Fig. 2B: Indicate in figure caption that this is the case &quot;Scaled I&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is not exactly the case “Scaled I”, as the parameter 𝝌𝝌 (increased I to E strength) is set to 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Suppl Fig. 2I: Is E&amp;F ever used in the manuscript? I couldn't find a reference. I suggest removing it if not needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Suppl. Fig 2I E&amp;F is now Suppl Fig.1G&amp;H. We now refer to it in the text: “Activity of networks with E assemblies could not be stabilized around 1 Hz by increasing connectivity from subsets of I neurons receiving dense feed-forward input from activated mitral cells (Supplementary Figure 1GH; Sadeh and Clopath, 2020).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3:</p>
<p>- As mentioned in my comment in the public review section, I find the arguments about pattern completion a little bit confusing. For me it's not clear why an increase of output correlations over input correlations is considered &quot;pattern completion&quot; (this is not to say that I don't find the nonlinear increase of output correlations interesting). For me, to test pattern completion with second-order statistics one would need to do a similar separation as in Suppl Fig. 3, ie measuring the pairwise correlation at cells in the assembly L that get direct input from L OB with cells in the assembly L that do not get direct input from OB. If the pairwise correlations of assembly cells which do not get direct input from OB increase in correlations, I would consider this as pattern completion (similar to the argument that increase in firing rate in cells which are not directly driven by OB are considered a sign of pattern completion).</p>
<p>Also, for me it now seems like that there are contradictory results, in Fig. 3 only Scaled I can lead to pattern completion while in the context of Suppl. Fig. 3 the authors write &quot;We found that assemblies were recruited by partial inputs in all structured pDpsim networks (Scaled and Tuned) without a significant increase in the overall population activity (Supplementary Figure 3A).&quot;   I suggest clarifying what the authors exactly mean by pattern completion, why the increase of output correlations above input correlations can be considered as pattern completion, and why the results differs when looking at firing rates versus correlations.</p>

<p>Please see our reply to the public review (reviewer 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- I actually would suggest adding Suppl. Fig. 3 to the main figure. It shows a more intuitive form of pattern completion and in the text there is a lot of back and forth between Fig. 3 and Suppl. Fig. 3</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We feel that the additional explanations and panels in Fig.3 should clarify this issue and therefore prefer to keep Supplementary Figure 3 as part of the Supplementary Figures for simplicity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- In the whole section &quot;We next explored effects of assemblies ... prevented strong recurrent amplification within E/I assemblies.&quot; the authors could provide a link to the respective panel in Fig. 2 after each statement. This would help the reader follow your arguments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The references to the appropriate panels have been added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig. 3A: I guess the x-axis has been shifted upwards? Should be at zero.</p>

<p>Figure 4:</p>
<p>- &quot;This geometry was largely maintained in the output of rand networks, consistent with the notion that random networks tend to preserve similarity relationships between input patterns (Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014; Marr, 1969; Schaffer et al., 2018; Wiechert et al., 2010).&quot; I suggest adding here reference to Fig. 4D (left).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Added.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Please add a definition of E/I assemblies. How do the authors define E/I assemblies? I think they consider both, Tuned I and Tuned E+I as E/I assemblies? In Suppl. Fig. 2I E it looks like tuned feedforward input is defined as E/I assemblies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. E/I assemblies are groups of E and I neurons with enhanced connectivity. In other words, in E/I assemblies, connectivity is enhanced not only between subsets of E neurons, but also between these E neurons and a subset of I neurons. This is now clarified in the text: “We first selected the 25 I neurons that received the largest number of connections from the 100 E neurons of an assembly. To generate E/I assemblies, the connectivity between these two sets of neurons was then enhanced by two procedures.”. We removed “E/I assemblies” in Suppl. Fig.2, where the term was not used correctly, and apologize for the confusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Suppl. Fig. 4: Could the authors please define what they mean by &quot;Loadings&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The loadings indicate the contribution of each neuron to each principal component, see adjusted legend of Suppl. Fig. 4: “G. Loading plot: contribution of neurons to the first two PCs of a <italic>rand</italic> and a <italic>Tuned E+I</italic> network (Figure 4D).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig. 4F: The authors might want to normalize the participation ratio by the number of neurons (see e.g. Dahmen et al., 2023 bioRxiv, &quot;relative PR&quot;), so the PR is bound between 0 and 1 and the dependence on N is removed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion, but we prefer to use the non-normalized PR as we find it more easily interpretable (e.g. number of attractor states in Scaled networks).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig. 4G&amp;H: as mentioned in the public review, I'd add the case of Scaled I to be able to compare it to the Tuned E+I case.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As already mentioned in the public review, we thank the reviewer for this suggestion, which we have implemented.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure caption Fig. 4H &quot;Similar results were obtained in the full-dimensional space.&quot; I suggest showing this as a supplemental panel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Since this only adds little information, we have chosen not to include it as a supplemental panel to avoid overloading the paper with figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 5:</p>
<p>- As mentioned in the public review, I suggest that the authors add the Scaled I case to Fig. 5 (it's shown in all figures and also in Fig. 6 again). I guess for Scaled I the separation between L and M will be very good?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see our reply to the public review (reviewer 3).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig. 5A&amp;B: I am a bit confused about which neurons are drawn to calculate the Mahalanobis distance. In Fig. 5A, the schematic indicates that the vector B from which the neurons are drawn is distinct from the distribution Q. For the example of odor L, the distribution Q consists of pure odor L with odors that have little mixtures with the other odors. But the vector v for odor L seems to be drawn only from odors that have slightly higher mixtures (as shown in the schematic in Fig. 5A). Is there a reason to choose the vector v from different odors than the distribution Q?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The distribution Q and the vector v consist of activity patterns across the same neurons in response to different odors. The reason to choose a different odor for v was to avoid having this test datapoint being included in the distribution Q. We also wanted Q to be the same for all test datapoints.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What does &quot;drawn from whole population&quot; mean? Does this mean that the vectors are drawn from any neuron in pDp? If yes, then I don't understand how the authors can distinguish between different odors (L,M,O,N) on the y-axis. Or does &quot;whole population&quot; mean that the vector is drawn across all assemblies as shown in the schematic in Fig. 5A and the case &quot;neurons drawn from (pseudo-) assembly&quot; means that the authors choose only one specific assembly? In any case, the description here is a bit confusing, I think it would help the reader to clarify those terms better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, “drawn from whole population” means that we randomly draw 80 neurons from the 4000 E neurons in pDp. The y-axis means that we use the activity patterns of these neurons evoked by one of the 4 odors (L, M, N, O) as reference. We have modified the Figure legend to clarify this: “d<sub>M</sub> was computed based on the activity patterns of 80 E neurons drawn from the four (pseudo-) assemblies (top) or from the whole population of 4000 E neurons (bottom). Average of 50 draws.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Suppl Fig. 5A: In the schematic the distance is called d_E(\bar{Q},\bar{V}) while the colorbar has d_E(\bar{Q},\bar{Q}) with the Qs in different color. The green Q should be a V.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this mistake, it is now fixed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig. 5: Could the authors comment on the fact that a random network seems to be very good in classifying patterns on it's own. Maybe in the Discussion?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The task shown in Figure 5 is a relatively easy one, a forced-choice between four classes which are uncorrelated. In Supplementary Figure 9, we now show classification for correlated classes, which is already much harder.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 6:</p>
<p>- Is the correlation induced by creating mixtures like in the other Figures? Please clarify how the correlations were induced.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified this point in the Methods section: “The pixel at each vertex corresponded to one pure odor with 150 activated and 75 inhibited mitral cells (…) and the remaining pixels corresponded to mixtures. In the case of correlated pure odors (Figure 6), adjacent pure odors shared half of their activated and half of their inhibited cells.”. An explicit reference to the Methods section has also been added to the figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Fig. 6C (right): why don't we see the clear separation in PC space as shown in Fig. 4? Is this related to the existence of correlations? Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. The assemblies corresponding to the correlated odors X and Y overlap significantly, and therefore responses to these odors cannot be well separated, especially for Scaled networks. We added the overlap quantification in the Results section to make this clear. “These two additional assemblies had on average 16% of neurons in common due to the similarity of the odors.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- &quot;Furthermore, in this regime of higher pattern similarity, dM was again increased upon learning, particularly between learned odors and reference classes representing other odors (not shown).&quot; Please show this (maybe as a supplemental figure).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now show the data in Supplementary Figure 9.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>- The authors write: &quot;We found that transformations became more discrete map-like when amplification within assemblies was increased and precision of synaptic balance was reduced. Likewise, decreasing amplification in assemblies of Scaled networks changed transformations towards the intermediate behavior, albeit with broader firing rate distributions than in Tuned networks (not shown).&quot;</p>
<p>Where do I see the first point? I guess when I compare in Fig. 4D the case of Scaled I vs Tuned E+I, but the sentence above sounds like the authors showed this in a more step-wise way eg by changing the strength of \alpha or \beta (as defined in Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Also I think if the authors want to make the point that decreasing amplification in assemblies changes transformation with a different rate distribution in scaled vs tuned networks, the authors should show it (eg adding a supplemental figure).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The first point is indeed supported by data from different figures. Please note that the revised manuscript now contains further simulations that reinforce this statement, particularly those shown in Supplementary Figure 6, and that this point is now discussed more extensively in the Discussion. We hope that these revisions clarify this general point.</p>
<p>The data showing effects of decreasing amplification in assemblies is now shown in Supplementary Figure 6 (Scaled[adjust])</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- I suggest adding the citation Znamenskiy et al., 2024 (Neuron; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.12.013">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.12.013</ext-link>), which shows that excitatory and inhibitory (PV) neurons with functional similarities are indeed strongly connected in mouse V1, suggesting the existence of E/I assembly structure also in mammals.</p>

<p>Done.</p>
