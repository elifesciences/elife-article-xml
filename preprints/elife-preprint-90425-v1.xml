<title>Summary</title>
<p>The mitosis to meiosis transition requires dynamic changes in gene expression, but whether and how the mitotic transcriptional machinery is regulated during this transition is unknown. In budding yeast, SBF and MBF transcription factors initiate the mitotic gene expression program. Here, we report two mechanisms that work together to restrict SBF activity during meiotic entry: repression of the SBF-specific Swi4 subunit through LUTI-based regulation and inhibition of SBF by Whi5, a homolog of the Rb tumor suppressor. We find that untimely SBF activation causes downregulation of early meiotic genes and delays meiotic entry. These defects are largely driven by the SBF-target G1 cyclins, which block the interaction between the central meiotic regulator Ime1 and its cofactor Ume6. Our study provides insight into the role of <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> in establishing the meiotic transcriptional program and demonstrates how the LUTI-based regulation is integrated into a larger regulatory network to ensure timely SBF activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A key aspect in understanding developmental programs and cell state transitions is mapping the interplay between transcription factors and their associated gene regulatory networks. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the transition from mitotic growth to meiotic differentiation is a crucial decision that is regulated by multiple inputs, such as nutrient availability, respiration competence, and cell identity. Under nutrient-limiting conditions, a diploid cell enters the meiotic program to produce four haploid gametes. The process of meiotic entry is tightly controlled by the master transcriptional regulator Ime1, as both extrinsic (e.g. nutrient status, extracellular pH) and intrinsic (e.g. mating type, mitochondrial function) cues are integrated at the <italic>IME1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kassir et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Honigberg, 2003</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">van Werven and Amon, 2011</xref>). Once translated, Ime1 is phosphorylated by the Rim11 and Rim15 kinases to promote its nuclear localization and interaction with Ume6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vidan and Mitchell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Pnueli et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Malathi et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">1997</xref>). In mitotically dividing cells, Ime1 target genes are repressed by Ume6 through its association with the Sin3-Rpd3 histone deacetylase complex (Kardosh and Struhl, 1997; Rundlett E. et al., 2003). However, under nutrient starvation, entry into the meiotic program is initiated by the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6, which together function as a transcriptional activator, culminating in the induction of early meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bowdish et al., 1995</xref>). Mitosis to meiosis transition requires dynamic remodeling of the gene regulatory networks to maintain the mutual exclusivity of these programs. While entry into the mitotic program is initiated by the central transcription factors SBF and MBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Spellman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>), whether and how these complexes are regulated during meiotic entry is unknown.</p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms regulating entry into the mitotic cell cycle, also known as G1/S transition, are functionally conserved from yeast to metazoans (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Van Den Heuvel and Dyson, 2008</xref>). SBF and MBF are heterodimeric transcription factors composed of Swi4-Swi6 and Mbp1-Swi6 subunits, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). These transcription factors are homologous to the mammalian E2Fs. E2Fs are negatively regulated by the tumor suppressor protein Rb, which is homologous to the budding yeast Whi5 that inhibits SBF in early G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hasan et al., 2014</xref>). Whi5-based SBF inhibition is relieved by cyclin/CDK-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent re-localization of Whi5 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wagner et al., 2009</xref>). Although SBF and MBF act in parallel during the G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Spellman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>), they activate functionally specialized subsets of gene targets. SBF regulates the expression of genes involved in budding and cell morphogenesis, while MBF-regulated genes are involved in DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Simon et al., 2001</xref>). Despite the well-characterized function in budding yeast mitotic growth, the regulation and function of SBF and MBF during meiotic entry remains largely unknown. In contrast to mitotic divisions where budding and DNA replication occur simultaneously, the meiotic program requires DNA replication and repair, but not bud morphogenesis or asymmetric growth. Accordingly, the regulation and subsequent activity of SBF and MBF are likely to be divergent to establish meiotic entry.</p>

<p>The activity of SBF and MBF is regulated in part through subunit abundance, which in turn controls expression of the G1/S regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dorsey et al., 2018</xref>). For example, overexpression of a hyperactive allele of <italic>SWI4</italic> can trigger premature entry into the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sidorova and Breeden, 2002</xref>). Additionally, <italic>SWI4</italic> has also been shown to be haploinsufficient and rate limiting during G1/S progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mcinerny et al., 1997</xref>). These results suggest that the precise levels of SBF and MBF subunits are important for activating the G1/S regulon at the correct time.</p>
<p>Three key observations support differential regulation of SBF and MBF during the meiotic program: First, a meiotic mass spectrometry dataset suggests that Swi4 has dynamic protein behavior, which is not observed for its counterparts Swi6 and Mbp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>). Second, meiotic cells express a repressive non-canonical mRNA from the <italic>SWI4</italic> locus called LUTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>), which stands for Long Undecoded Transcript Isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chia et al., 2017</xref>). Third, two SBF-specific targets, namely the G1-cyclins <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>, have been shown to repress early meiotic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Colomina et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>LUTI-based gene regulation repurposes gene-activating transcription factors as repressors by a two-pronged mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Tresenrider and Ünal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>). First, transcription factor-dependent activation of the distal LUTI promoter results in co-transcriptional silencing of the downstream canonical gene promoter. Second, the coding sequence (CDS) within the LUTI is translationally repressed due to competitive translation of the upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the LUTI-specific 5′ leader. Consequently, upregulation of the LUTI results in downregulation of the canonical mRNA and corresponding protein. While LUTIs are conserved from yeast to humans and have been identified in different cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Van Dalfsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hollerer et al., 2019</xref>; Jorgensen et al., 2020), their biological significance remains poorly understood. In fact, only a single LUTI has been assigned a biological role so far with distinct phenotypic outcomes resulting from its loss or gain of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chia et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the differential regulation of SBF and MBF during the meiotic program and determine how the untimely activation of SBF impacts meiotic entry. We found that overexpression of Swi4 results in the activation of SBF targets and concomitant downregulation of the early meiotic genes. SBF targets Cln1 and Cln2 inhibit meiotic entry by blocking the interaction between Ime1 and its cofactor Ume6. Furthermore, the LUTI-based mechanism causes downregulation of Swi4 protein synthesis and acts in conjunction with Whi5 to restrict SBF activity during meiosis. Overall, our study reveals the functional role of a LUTI in establishing the early meiotic transcriptome, demonstrates how the LUTI-based regulation is integrated into a larger regulatory network to ensure timely SBF activity, and provides mechanistic insights into how SBF misregulation impedes transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate.</p>

<title>Swi4 is the sole downregulated subunit within the SBF and MBF complexes during meiosis</title>
<p>While the SBF and MBF transcription factors have been heavily studied in the context of the mitotic cell cycle, their involvement in regulating the meiotic transcriptional program is not well understood. To understand the regulation and function of these complexes during meiosis, we first monitored the levels of SBF and MBF subunits throughout a meiotic time course. Cells were first grown in rich media overnight and were then transferred to pre-sporulation media. After additional overnight growth, cells were shifted to sporulation media (SPO) to induce meiosis, and samples were taken hourly for protein extraction and immunoblotting to monitor the abundance of each subunit. Unlike the mitotic G1/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kelliher et al., 2018</xref>), meiotic entry resulted in ∼30% decrease in Swi4 levels after 2 hours, while Mbp1 and Swi6 levels were increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). These data indicate that Swi4 is the sole subunit within SBF and MBF whose level declines during meiotic entry and are consistent with a published mass spectrometry dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined the expression of a set of well-characterized transcripts that are regulated by SBF or MBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Iyer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Simon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Harris et al., 2013</xref>; Smolka et al., 2012) using a published meiotic RNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). This analysis revealed that compared to mitotically dividing cells, most of the SBF-specific target genes had either low or no expression during early meiosis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, most of the MBF targets displayed increased expression upon meiotic entry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on our findings thus far, we propose that Swi4 levels are tightly regulated in meiosis to ensure that SBF targets, including <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>, are turned off during meiotic entry. If Swi4 is indeed limiting for meiotic SBF activity, then higher Swi4 levels should lead to increased expression of SBF targets. To test this possibility, we overexpressed <italic>SWI4</italic> by placing it under the regulation of the <italic>ATG8</italic> promoter (<italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic>), which is highly expressed in meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). The steady-state level of <italic>pATG8</italic>-driven Swi4 was 5 times higher than wild type (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>). Using reverse transcription coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), we measured the transcript levels of well-characterized SBF targets and observed a significant increase in the expression of <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> in <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> cells relative to wild type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, p = 0.0351 [<italic>CLN1</italic>], p = 0.0013 [<italic>CLN2</italic>], two-tailed t-test). In contrast, the MBF-specific targets <italic>CDC21</italic> and <italic>RNR1</italic> remained similar (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, p = 0.8488 [<italic>CDC21</italic>], p = 0.0859 [<italic>RNR1</italic>], two-tailed t-test). These findings indicate that upregulation of <italic>SWI4</italic> is sufficient to induce the expression of SBF-specific targets <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> in meiosis without affecting MBF-specific targets.</p>
<p>To test whether the downregulation of <italic>SWI4</italic> is functionally important for meiotic progression, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and visualized the kinetics of meiotic divisions in <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> cells relative to wild type. By tracking the endogenous histone H2B fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry (Htb1-mCherry), we found that <italic>SWI4</italic> overexpression caused a significant delay in meiotic progression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, p = 0.0045, Mann-Whitney test). We conclude that downregulation of <italic>SWI4</italic> is necessary for timely meiotic progression.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Regulation of Swi4 abundance is required for timely meiotic entry</title>
<p>Since Swi4 abundance, and by inference SBF activity, was decreased during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition, we hypothesized that the meiotic progression delay observed in <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> cells was due to meiotic entry defects. To test this we monitored Ime1, a meiosis-specific transcription factor and a master regulator of meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kassir et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Honigberg, 2003</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">van Werven and Amon, 2011</xref>). To quantify the bulk levels of Ime1 protein in meiosis, we performed immunoblotting. During meiotic entry (2 h in SPO), when Swi4 abundance was elevated, there was a 50% reduction in Ime1 levels in <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> cells compared to wild type (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref>). In parallel, we monitored meiotic entry on a single-cell basis by measuring the localization of endogenous Ime1 carrying an N-terminal green fluorescent protein tag (<italic>GFP-IME1</italic>; Moretto 2018) and Htb1-mCherry. Compared to wild type where &gt; 90% of the cells had nuclear Ime1 following meiotic entry (2 h in SPO), only ∼50% of <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> cells had nuclear Ime1, which was significantly lower (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>, p = 0.0169, two-tailed t-test).</p>

<p>Given that the increase in Swi4 levels coincided with a decrease in Ime1 protein expression and nuclear localization, this raised the possibility that Swi4 interferes with Ime1 function. To further investigate the relationship between these two transcription factors at a single-cell level, we generated strains carrying endogenous fluorescent protein tags for each transcription factor (<italic>GFP-IME1, SWI4-mCherry</italic>). Using DAPI as a nuclear marker, we measured the mean nuclear intensity of each transcription factor before (0 h) and after meiotic entry (4 h) (see Materials and Methods for details on image quantification). In wild type, most cells exhibited decreased nuclear Swi4 and increased nuclear Ime1 upon meiotic entry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-E</xref>). Conversely, in the <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> mutant, there was a significant shift in the fraction of cells with higher nuclear Swi4 levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test,). Additionally, the cells with increased nuclear Swi4 had reduced levels of nuclear Ime1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). This inverse relationship between Swi4 and Ime1 nuclear localization further indicates that higher levels of Swi4 are antagonistic to Ime1 function.</p>
<p>Ime1 is necessary for the expression of early meiotic genes. Therefore, we next characterized the changes in the early meiotic transcriptome upon <italic>SWI4</italic> overexpression by mRNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq). Using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Love et al., 2014</xref>), we identified differentially expressed genes in <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> mutant compared to wild type during meiotic entry (2 h in SPO). To investigate general pathways being affected by increased Swi4 levels in meiosis, we ran gene ontology analysis of statistically significant (padj &lt; 0.05) output from DESeq2, which revealed that the genes with significantly increased expression were involved in mitosis while those with significantly decreased expression were involved in meiotic processes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>). Regarding the SBF targets, we noticed increased expression of many genes, including <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, Supplemental Table 1). We focused on a cluster of previously identified early meiotic genes involved in DNA replication and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brar et al., 2012</xref>) and observed that more than 50% had a significant decrease in their expression upon <italic>SWI4</italic> overexpression (padj &lt; 0.05, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, Supplemental Table 1). Finally, gene set enrichment analysis was performed to test whether expression of either the early meiotic gene set or SBF target gene set is enriched in wild type or <italic>pATG-SWI4</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>). This gene set level analysis revealed significant enrichment of SBF target gene expression (NES = 2.88, p &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), as well as significant disenrichment of early meiotic gene expression (NES = −2.88, p &lt; 0.001, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) in the <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> mutant. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the increased levels of Swi4 during transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate abruptly activates SBF and disrupts the early meiotic transcriptome, highlighting the importance of <italic>SWI4</italic> regulation.</p>
<p>As an orthogonal approach, we performed live-cell imaging of Rec8, endogenously tagged with GFP (Rec8-GFP), which is a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit and a direct transcriptional target of Ime1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Primig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Klein et al., 1999</xref>). Htb1-mCherry was used as a nuclear marker. This analysis revealed a significant delay in Rec8-GFP nuclear appearance in the <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> strain compared to wild type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref>, p = 0.0005, Mann-Whitney test). Furthermore, sporulation efficiency was decreased by ∼20% in the <italic>pATG8-SWI4</italic> strain relative to wild type (Supplemental Table 2). These findings are consistent with the mRNA-seq data and further underscore the importance of <italic>SWI4</italic> downregulation in establishing a robust meiotic cell fate.</p>

<p>To determine whether these two G1 cyclins are functionally responsible for the meiotic progression delay observed in response to SBF misregulation, we performed time-lapse fluorescence microscopy in cells carrying Rec8-GFP and Htb1-mCherry.

<p>However, the progression was still delayed compared to wild type, suggesting redundancy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>).

<p>Since the meiotic defect was more pronounced in response to <italic>CLN2</italic> overexpression, we decided to use the <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> mutant to explore how G1 cyclins counteract meiosis. To assess meiotic entry, we performed fixed-cell imaging for GFP-Ime1 and found that when <italic>CLN2</italic> was overexpressed, only 5% of the <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> cells displayed nuclear GFP-Ime1 signal during early meiosis as opposed to &gt;84% of wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>, 2 h in SPO). In parallel, we measured <italic>IME1</italic> transcript and Ime1 protein levels.</p>
<p>In both cases, we observed ∼30% decrease in abundance in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> mutant relative to wild type (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A-C</xref>, 2 h in SPO). These data raise the possibility that the meiotic entry defect observed in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> mutant arises from downregulation of <italic>IME1</italic> expression.</p>
<p>To test whether the increased levels of Ime1 can rescue the meiotic defect of <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> mutant, we replaced the endogenous <italic>IME1</italic> promoter with a copper-inducible <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We adapted a previously well-characterized overexpression allele of <italic>IME1</italic>, <italic>pCUP1-IME1</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berchowitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chia and van Werven, 2016</xref>) and included a functional, N-terminal GFP tag to track Ime1’s subcellular localization <italic>(pCUP1-GFP-IME1</italic>). Use of the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter was successful in elevating <italic>IME1</italic> transcript and protein levels in the presence of <italic>CLN2</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D-F</xref>). Despite the rescue of <italic>IME1</italic> expression, gamete formation was still severely perturbed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Using a single z-slice to measure mean nuclear intensity, we noticed that the intensity of the nuclear Ime1 signal was significantly lower in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2; pCUP1-GFP-IME1</italic> cells compared to the <italic>pCUP1-GFP-IME1</italic> control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>, p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test). This finding indicates that rescue of <italic>IME1</italic> expression did not also rescue sporulation, further suggesting a defect in Ime1 nuclear localization. To test this possibility, we utilized a nanobody trap strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Fridy et al., 2014</xref>) where we C-terminally fused a single-domain anti-GFP antibody to Pus1, a constitutively nuclear localized protein (<italic>PUS1-⍺GFP</italic>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). In this background, control strains carrying a <italic>GFP-IME1</italic> allele sporulated efficiently, demonstrating that tethering of Ime1 to Pus1 does not interfere with Ime1 function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, mean nuclear intensity of GFP-</p>
<p>Ime1 was indistinguishable between <italic>PUS1-⍺GFP</italic> and <italic>pATG8-CLN2; PUS1-⍺GFP</italic>, indicating that nuclear localization was fully rescued (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4I</xref>, p = 0.6563 [<italic>PUS1-</italic></p>
<p><italic>⍺GFP</italic> vs. <italic>pATG8-CLN2; PUS1-⍺GFP</italic>], Mann-Whitney test). Surprisingly, these cells still failed to undergo meiosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that G1 cyclins interfere with Ime1 function at an additional step beyond misregulating its expression and localization. Alternatively, G1 cyclins could disrupt a different meiotic factor in addition to Ime1.</p>
<p>To induce early meiotic genes, Ime1 must interact with another transcription factor called Ume6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rubin-Bejerano et al., 1996</xref>). Since Ime1 itself does not possess a DNA-binding domain, its binding to Ume6 is essential for targeting Ime1 to early meiotic gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Smith et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rubin-Bejerano et al., 1996</xref>). To address whether the G1 cyclins might disrupt the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6, we fused the anti-GFP nanobody to Ume6 (<italic>UME6-⍺GFP</italic>) in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> strain carrying a GFP tagged Ime1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>). This nanobody trap should lead to constitutive tethering of Ime1 to Ume6, as evidenced by the rescue of Ime1 nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4L</xref>, p = 0.035 [wild type vs. <italic>pATG8-CLN2 UME6-⍺GFP</italic>] Mann-Whitney test). Under these conditions, the sporulation defect of <italic>pATG8-CLN2</italic> mutant was rescued, reaching similar levels to wild type (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Since <italic>IME1</italic> is expressed from its endogenous promoter in the <italic>pATG8-CLN2; UME6-⍺GFP</italic> strain, these data suggest that overexpression of G1 cyclins results in meiotic failure due to reduced Ime1-Ume6 interaction.</p>
<p>Our findings thus far highlight the biological significance of restricting SBF activity during the transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate. By downregulating the limiting Swi4 subunit, cells ensure that the SBF regulon is turned off under conditions that favor meiotic entry. Among the SBF targets, G1 cyclins pose a major block to meiotic entry by interfering with Ime1 function, critically at the level of Ime1-Ume6 interaction. While these findings emphasize the importance of <italic>SWI4</italic> regulation to ensure timely SBF activity, the question remains as to how SBF activity is downregulated during transition from mitosis to meiosis.</p>

<p>To further investigate LUTI-based repression of <italic>SWI4</italic>, we examined the relationship between <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>and <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic>transcripts using single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Raj et al., 2008</xref>). Two distinct probes were used: one, conjugated to Quasar 670 (Q670) and complementary to the <italic>SWI4</italic> coding sequence (CDS) and the other, conjugated to CAL Fluor Red 590 (CF590) and unique to the 5′ extended LUTI sequence. Accordingly, a spot where the two probe sets colocalized indicated a <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> transcript, whereas a spot marked with Q670 probe alone highlighted a <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic> transcript. We used a well-established meiotic cell synchronization system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berchowitz et al., 2013</xref>) to investigate the precise temporal expression of these two mRNA isoforms. In comparison to premeiotic state, meiotic cells displayed a significant increase in <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> transcripts (p &lt; 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test) as well as a significant decrease in <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic> transcripts (p = 0.0007, Mann-Whitney test) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>), thus confirming their inverse expression pattern.</p>
<p>To characterize the functional contribution of the LUTI to <italic>SWI4</italic> downregulation, we eliminated <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> production (<italic>ΔLUTI</italic>) by deleting its promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>) and used RNA blotting to visualize the <italic>SWI4</italic> mRNA isoforms. In wild-type cells, <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> was readily detectable after 1 hour in SPO, corresponding to early meiotic entry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). During the time points when <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> was highly expressed, <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic> transcript levels were lower, consistent with the smFISH results revealing <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> and <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic>levels are anticorrelated. In <italic>ΔLUTI</italic> cells, we observed an increase in the abundance of <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic>mRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This finding corroborates previous reports, where LUTI expression leads to co-transcriptional silencing of the canonical gene promoter, thereby silencing expression of the protein-coding transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Van Dalfsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>; Vander <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wende et al., 2022</xref>). Finally, by immunoblotting, we observed an increase in Swi4 protein abundance in the <italic>ΔLUTI</italic> mutant compared to wild type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>), further indicating that <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> expression downregulates Swi4 protein levels in meiosis.</p>
<p><italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> translation occurs within the upstream ORFs (uORFs) of its 5′ leader sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). If the uORFs repress productive translation of the <italic>SWI4</italic> CDS contained within the LUTI, then their removal should result in increased Swi4 protein levels. To determine whether the uORFs inhibit translation of the <italic>SWI4</italic> CDS, we mutated the start codon of all seven uORFs within <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> from ATG to ATC (<italic>ΔuORF</italic>) and measured Swi4 protein levels using immunoblotting. Compared to wild type, the <italic>ΔuORF</italic> mutant had higher levels of Swi4 protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). RNA blotting confirmed that <italic>SWI4<sup>canon</sup></italic> transcript levels remained similar between wild type and <italic>ΔuORF</italic> mutant, whereas <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> levels were higher in the <italic>ΔuORF</italic> mutant compared to wild type (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), likely resulting from increased transcript stability due to bypass of nonsense mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings indicate that the uORFs within the LUTI are translated at the expense of <italic>SWI4</italic> CDS, thus halting Swi4 synthesis during early meiosis.</p>
<p>Our previous findings highlight an antagonistic relationship between Swi4 and Ime1 nuclear localization, whereby overexpression of <italic>SWI4</italic> leads to a decrease in Ime1 nuclear localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Given the previous finding that Ime1 activates transcription of LUTIs in early meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>), we were curious whether the reverse regulation could also occur, where Ime1 causes downregulation of Swi4 through activating <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>transcription. To test this possibility, we used an inducible allele of <italic>IME1</italic> (<italic>pCUP1-IME1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chia and van Werven, 2016</xref>) and measured Swi4 protein abundance. In the absence of <italic>IME1</italic> induction, Swi4 levels remained constant. However, after 1 hour of <italic>IME1</italic> induction, Swi4 levels started to decrease dramatically (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>). Therefore, reduction in Swi4 levels is dependent on Ime1 rather than being driven by nutrient deprivation in SPO, a condition that is known to trigger autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abeliovich and Klionsky, 2001</xref>). To further assess whether <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> is regulated by the Ime-Ume6 transcription factor complex, we analyzed a published Ume6 ChIP-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>) and found evidence for Ume6 binding at the <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>). Additionally, analysis of an mRNA-seq dataset from <italic>UME6-T99N</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>), an allele of <italic>UME6</italic> that can no longer interact with Ime1, revealed a dramatic reduction in <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> expression in meiotic conditions (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). Together, these data support the notion that Ime1-Ume6 complex induces the expression of <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>, which in turn inhibits Swi4 protein synthesis through the combined act of transcriptional and translational interference.</p>

<title><italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> is integrated into a larger regulatory network to regulate SBF activity during meiotic entry</title>
<p>Since the removal of <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic> resulted in an increase in Swi4 levels, we next wanted to investigate how the loss of LUTI-based regulation affects meiotic entry.

</fig>
<p>Since transition from the mitotic to meiotic program is a critical cell fate decision, it is likely that additional players are in place to restrict SBF activity. In this case, even when the LUTI-based regulation fails, SBF would remain largely inactive due to a backup mechanism. In support of this notion and consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Argüello-Miranda et al., 2018</xref>), the SBF inhibitor Whi5 was expressed during early meiosis (0 h in SPO) and localized to the nucleus (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>). During the mitotic G1 phase, Whi5 associates with promoter-bound SBF, thereby preventing the transcription of SBF target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>). Shortly before the G1/S transition, phosphorylation of Whi5 via the Cln3/CDK pathway activates SBF by promoting nuclear export of Whi5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>). However, in nutrient-deprived conditions that favor meiosis such as nitrogen limitation, <italic>CLN3</italic> is translationally repressed and any Cln3 protein that is expressed is also unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Parviz and Heideman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gallego et al., 1997</xref>). Without Cln3/CDK, Whi5 is expected to inhibit SBF in a constitutive manner.</p>
<p>To determine whether Whi5 and <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>act in parallel to restrict SBF activity, we removed Whi5 from the nucleus using the anchor-away method, which enables compartment-specific depletion of a target protein via inducible dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>). Whi5 was tagged with FRB and ribosomal protein Rpl13a was tagged with FKBP12. Upon addition of rapamycin, Rpl13a-FKBP12 and Whi5-FRB formed a heterodimer, leading to successful nuclear exclusion of Whi5 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Using Whi5 anchor away (<italic>WHI5-AA)</italic> alone or in combination with removal of LUTI-based <italic>SWI4</italic> regulation (<italic>ΔLUTI)</italic>, we performed mRNA-seq to measure expression of SBF targets and early meiotic genes. Similar to the <italic>ΔLUTI</italic> single mutant, <italic>WHI5-AA</italic> alone did not significantly change the expression of SBF targets or early meiotic genes relative to wild type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). However, loss of both modes of regulation resulted in increased expression of SBF targets as well as a concomitant decrease in early meiotic transcripts compared to wild type (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, Supplemental Table 3). As expected, Swi4 levels were similar to wild type in <italic>WHI5-AA</italic> but were elevated in <italic>ΔLUTI</italic> and <italic>ΔLUTI</italic>; <italic>WHI5-AA</italic> mutants (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant enrichment of the SBF regulon (NES = 1.95, p &lt; 0.001) as well as significant disenrichment of the early meiotic genes (NES = −3.39, p &lt; 0.001) in the Δ<italic>LUTI</italic>; <italic>WHI5-AA</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we monitored meiotic entry using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy in strains carrying endogenously tagged Rec8-GFP in conjunction with Htb1-mCherry. In agreement with our mRNA-seq data, loss of either LUTI-or Whi5-based repression of SBF alone was not sufficient to cause a delay in meiotic entry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). However, simultaneous perturbation of both pathways led to a significant delay in meiotic entry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, p = 0.0112, Mann-Whitney test). These data further support the notion that <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>is integrated into a larger regulatory network to regulate SBF activity during meiotic entry, which includes Whi5-mediated repression of SBF.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we describe two distinct mechanisms by which meiotic cells inhibit the activity of SBF, a transcription factor complex crucial for the G1/S transition during the mitotic cell cycle. The dual inhibition of SBF converges on its unique subunit Swi4 and is important for proper transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate. Swi4 inhibition occurs through: (1) meiosis-specific expression of a LUTI from the <italic>SWI4</italic> locus, <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>, which downregulates Swi4 protein levels, and (2) repression of Swi4 activity by the Rb homolog Whi5, which occurs even when the LUTI-based regulation is disrupted. Conditions that lead to elevation of Swi4 levels at meiotic entry result in abrupt activation of the SBF and a concomitant decline in the expression of early meiotic genes, leading to meiotic progression delays. Additionally, we show that the SBF targets <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> are major drivers of the meiotic entry defect resulting from SBF misregulation. The <italic>CLN</italic>-dependent phenotypes can be largely rescued by tethering of the central meiotic regulator Ime1 to its cofactor Ume6, suggesting that the primary reason for meiotic failure caused by these G1 cyclins is due to a defect in Ime1-Ume6 interaction. Our findings reveal the functional role of a LUTI in establishing the meiotic transcriptional program and demonstrate how the LUTI-based regulation is integrated into a larger regulatory network to ensure timely SBF activity, and provide mechanistic insights into how SBF misregulation impedes transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>

<title>Rewiring of the G1/S regulon</title>
<p>It has long been known that entry into the mitotic cell cycle and meiotic differentiation are regulated differently. During the mitotic cell cycle, budding yeast cells must reach a critical size before commitment to division in late G1 phase, an event termed the “Start” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hartwell et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Johnston et al., 1977</xref>). Start depends on the activation of the G1/S regulon by SBF and MBF, which regulate ∼200 genes that function in polarized growth, macromolecular biosynthesis, DNA replication, and repair among other critical processes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2004</xref>). In contrast, entry into meiosis requires the transcriptional activator, Ime1, which is exclusively induced in diploid cells through the integration of several extrinsic cues including nitrogen levels, carbon source and extracellular pH (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">van Werven and Amon, 2011</xref>). Ime1 initiates the first transcriptional wave of early meiotic genes required for DNA replication, recombination, and chromosome morphogenesis. Before our study, it was unclear whether and how SBF-MBF activity is regulated during the transition from mitosis to meiosis, despite the transcriptome-wide differences between these two developmental programs. We found that during meiotic entry, the SBF-specific Swi4 subunit is downregulated, which indicates that the activity of SBF, but not MBF, is constrained. Consistently, SBF-specific targets display either low or no expression during early meiosis, while MBF targets are upregulated upon meiotic entry. MBF targets are involved in processes shared between mitosis and meiosis including DNA replication and repair, whereas SBF targets are predominantly involved in processes unique to mitosis such as budding and cell wall biosynthesis. This functional specialization might have enabled adaptations to accommodate specific cell fates. Likewise, SBF-specific targets that are detrimental to meiosis, such as the G1 cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Colomina et al., 1999</xref>, and this study), might contribute to the mutually exclusive nature of the mitotic and meiotic programs.</p>
<p>Absolute measurements of the concentrations of SBF and MBF in single cells during mitotic G1 demonstrated that these transcription factors are sub-saturating with respect to their target promoters in small cells, but that SBF and MBF levels increase as cells grow, suggesting that their abundance is a limiting factor in activating the G1/S regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dorsey et al., 2018</xref>). Corroborating these findings, we show that overexpression of <italic>SWI4</italic> as well as the simultaneous disruption of the two pathways that normally restrict SBF activity at meiotic entry – namely LUTI and Whi5 – result in abrupt activation of the SBF regulon and a concomitant decrease in early meiotic gene expression. However, MBF targets do not seem to be affected in response to increased SBF activity. This is surprising given that SBF and MBF share a common subunit, Swi6, and that an upsurge in Swi4 abundance might be expected to titrate Swi6 away from MBF. It is possible that meiosis-specific regulators like Ime1 and Ime2 compensate to maintain MBF target expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brush et al., 2012</xref>). Future studies are necessary to dissect the meiotic roles of MBF and potential compensatory mechanisms.</p>

<title>Inhibition of G1 cyclins during meiotic entry and vice versa</title>
<p>We found that the meiotic entry delay due to untimely SBF activation can be partially rescued by loss of either <italic>CLN1</italic> or <italic>CLN2</italic>, demonstrating that both cyclins are responsible for the meiotic defects associated with SBF misregulation. In addition to <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic>, improper activation of SBF also leads to upregulation of <italic>PCL1</italic> during meiotic entry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). <italic>PCL1</italic> encodes a cyclin that interacts with the Pho85 CDK and is involved in the regulation of polarized cell growth and morphogenesis as well as progression through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Espinoza et al., 2016</xref>). Whether <italic>PCL1</italic> misexpression contributes to the SBF-associated meiotic entry defects is an interesting avenue for future studies.</p>
<p>We and others have demonstrated that elevated levels of G1 cyclins inhibit meiotic entry. Therefore, it is crucial to dissect the mechanisms that govern the downregulation of G1 cyclins during this process. Among the G1 cyclins that are known to inhibit meiotic entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Colomina et al., 1999</xref>), only the mechanism of <italic>CLN3</italic> restriction was previously known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Parviz and Heideman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gallego et al., 1997</xref>). Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> remain quiescent during meiotic entry through the combined act of LUTI-based and Whi5-dependent inhibition of SBF. Whether additional mechanisms play a role in restricting SBF and/or <italic>CLN1</italic>-<italic>CLN2</italic> remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Our findings also shed light on the mechanism by which G1 cyclins prevent meiotic entry. Previous work demonstrated that G1 cyclin overexpression leads to downregulation of <italic>IME1</italic> expression and inhibition of Ime1 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Colomina et al., 1999</xref>). Even though we observed similar defects in <italic>IME1</italic> in response to <italic>CLN2</italic> overexpression, increasing <italic>IME1</italic> expression or targeting Ime1 to the nucleus did not result in successful meiosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Instead, we found that restoring the interaction between Ime1 and its cofactor Ume6 was sufficient to bypass the meiotic blockage exerted by Cln/CDK. Collectively, our analyses suggest that the primary reason why G1 cyclins cause a meiotic failure is due to a deficiency in Ime1-Ume6 interaction.</p>
<p>Future work could be aimed at dissecting how G1 cyclins affect the interaction between Ime1 and Ume6 and whether their impact on Ime1’s subcellular localization is primarily due to G1 cyclin-dependent changes in Ime1-Ume6 interaction. Since there are no CDK consensus phosphorylation sites on Ime1 itself, other players are likely to be involved. Rim11 and Rim15 are potential candidates since these two kinases have been implicated in Ime1-Ume6 phosphorylation as well as regulation of Ime1 localization and its interaction with Ume6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rubin-Bejerano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Vidan and Mitchell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bowdish et al., 1994</xref>). Interestingly, Rim15 contains CDK consensus phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Holt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Moreno-Torres et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Breitkreutz et al., 2010</xref>), Furthermore, Cln2/CDK activity has been previously shown to inhibit Rim15 nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Talarek et al., 2010</xref>), thereby making it an attractive candidate for further investigation.</p>

The reverse regulation, where Ime1 inhibits Swi4, is also in place. This occurs through the Ime1-dependent expression of <italic>SWI4 <sup>LUTI</sup></italic>, which is necessary to downregulate Swi4 levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, also reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tresenrider et al., 2021</xref>). The antagonistic relationship between Swi4 and Ime1 is further evidenced by their mutually exclusive pattern of nuclear localization at the single-cell level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In summary, our study highlights the multiple ways in which Swi4 and Ime1 regulate each other, which likely plays a crucial role in cellular decision making between the mitotic and meiotic transcriptional programs.</p>

<title>Intersection of LUTI-based gene repression with other regulatory pathways</title>
<p>While LUTI-based regulation is both necessary and sufficient to downregulate Swi4 levels, disrupting it alone is not enough to activate the SBF regulon. We found that the LUTI-based mechanism works together with the Whi5 pathway to inhibit SBF activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). As a result, only when both mechanisms are simultaneously disrupted, do cells exhibit abrupt activation of SBF targets and subsequent meiotic entry defects. This two-pronged inhibition of SBF activity is reminiscent of how meiotic cells prevent microtubule-kinetochore interactions during prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, LUTI-based regulation represses the expression of a limiting outer kinetochore subunit, Ndc80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Even when the outer kinetochore assembles upon disruption of <italic>NDC80<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>, microtubules are still unable to engage with the kinetochores due to restriction of Clb/CDK activity. The loss of both regulations results in meiotic chromosome segregation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Integrating LUTI-based repression into larger regulatory networks likely ensures robustness in cellular decision-making, providing a fail-safe system. However, combinatorial use of the LUTI-based mechanism with other regulatory pathways poses a challenge to uncover their functional importance. Despite 8% of the yeast genes being subject to LUTI-based regulation during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>), the biological significance of only two LUTIs, <italic>NDC80<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>and <italic>SWI4<sup>LUTI</sup></italic>, have been uncovered thus far. Therefore, systematic studies aiming to dissect the biological roles of LUTIs in meiosis and beyond would benefit from simultaneous perturbation approaches, including synthetic genetic interactions.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Cell state changes are primarily governed by transcription factors. Our study highlights how transition from mitotic to meiotic cell fate is ensured by inhibition of the SBF transcription factor through two distinct mechanisms. The SBF regulon includes G1 cyclins, whose untimely expression blocks meiotic entry by interfering with Ime1, a master transcriptional regulator of meiosis. SBF and Ime1 antagonize each other, thereby helping establish a mutually exclusive state between the mitotic and meiotic transcriptional programs.</p>
<p>Divergence of the G1/S transcription factors has been observed in mammalian cells. Functional homologs of SBF and MBF in mammalian cells are known as E2Fs, nine of which control the G1/S transition (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Van Den Heuvel and Dyson, 2008</xref>). Each E2F regulates a distinct sets of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gaubatz et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, some members of the E2F family are involved in tissue-specific regulation of cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Julian et al., 2016</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms driving the rewiring of these complex gene networks are not well understood. Given the conservation of LUTI-based gene regulation and Whi5 in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hollerer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hasan et al., 2014</xref>), our studies may shed light into cell type specific regulations of Rb and E2Fs.</p>

<p>For <italic>SWI4</italic> (pUB1587) 1200 bases upstream of the ORF, <italic>SWI4</italic> ORF, C-terminal 3V5 epitope tag, and <italic>SWI4</italic> 3’UTR (1000 bases downstream of ORF) were cloned into a <italic>LEU2</italic> single integration vector by Gibson assembly (NEB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>). LUTI promoter deletion (<italic>ΔLUTI</italic>) strain (pUB1588) was similarly constructed with −1200 to −934 bases upstream from ORF deleted. For the uORF mutant (<italic>ΔuORF</italic>) strain (pUB1734) all seven ATG uORFs were mutated using gBlocks with the ATG&gt;ATC mutations and cloned by Gibson assembly into 3V5-tagged <italic>LEU2</italic> single integration vector. In all strains described above, the endogenous <italic>SWI4</italic> gene is deleted using Pringle-based insertion of KanMX6 marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bähler et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>For overexpression of <italic>SWI4 (pUB1585)</italic>, <italic>CLN1 (pUB2144)</italic>, and <italic>CLN2 (pUB1899)</italic>, the relevant gene carrying a 3V5 epitope tag was cloned downstream of the <italic>ATG8</italic> promoter, which is highly expressed during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). A <italic>LEU2</italic> single integration vector was used for cloning the fragments by Gibson assembly (<italic>NEB</italic>). In the strains carrying overexpression transgenes, the wild-type alleles at the endogenous loci remained intact. <italic>pCUP1-GFP-IME1</italic> allele was made with Pringle-based insertion of the <italic>pCUP1</italic> promoter upstream of <italic>GFP-IME1</italic>. <italic>PUS1-</italic>⍺GFP and <italic>UME6-</italic>⍺GFP were made by Pringle-based insertion using a plasmid (pUB1707) gifted by the Lackner Lab. For <italic>WHI5-AA</italic> the <italic>WHI5-mCherry-FRB</italic> allele was made by Pringle-based insertion using a plasmid (pUB595) gifted by the Nasmyth lab.

<title>Sporulation Conditions</title>
<p>For meiotic experiments using <italic>pCUP1-IME1/pCUP1-IME4</italic> or <italic>pCUP-IME1</italic> system, cells were synchronized as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chia and van Werven, 2016</xref>). Briefly, after 24 h of growth in YPD at room temperature, saturated cultures (OD<sub>600</sub> &gt; 10) were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.25 in BYTA (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto tryptone, 1% potassium acetate, and 1.02% potassium phthalate) for 16-18 h of growth at 30°C (OD<sub>600</sub> of &gt; 5).

Anchor away meiotic experiments was performed as described above with final 1 µM rapamycin (Millipore) added to BYTA 30 minutes before transfer to SPO and again 1 µM rapamycin added to SPO media.</p>
<p>In all other meiotic experiments, cells were prepared as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Carlile and Amon, 2008</xref>). Briefly, after 24 h of growth in YPD at room temperature, saturated cultures (OD<sub>600</sub> &gt; 10) were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.25 and inoculated in BYTA (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto tryptone, 1% potassium acetate, and 1.02% potassium phthalate) for 16-18 h at 30°C (OD<sub>600</sub> of &gt; 5). Cells were washed with water twice before final resuspension in SPO with 0.5% potassium acetate to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.85. Sporulation efficiency was counted after 24 h in SPO.</p>
<p><italic>UME6</italic>-<italic>⍺GFP</italic> meiotic experiments were prepared as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chia and van Werven, 2016</xref>). Briefly, after 18 h of growth in YPD at room temperature, saturated cultures (OD<sub>600</sub> &gt; 10) were diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2 in reduced YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, uracil [24 mg/L]). Reduced YPD was used instead of BYTA to prevent cells from prematurely entering meiosis in BYTA due to the Ime1-Ume6 interaction from the GFP nanobody. Cells were grown for ∼6 h at 30°C until they reached an OD<sub>600</sub> between 0.5 and 1.0. Cultures were then back diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1 and grown for 18 h at 30°C. Cells were washed with water twice before final resuspension in SPO with 0.5% potassium acetate to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.85. Sporulation efficiency was counted after 24 h in SPO.</p>

<p>Su et al propose the existence of two mechanisms repressing SBF activity during entry into meiosis in budding yeast. First, a decrease in Swi4 protein levels by a LUTI-dependent mechanism where Ime1 would act closing a negative feedback loop. Second, the sustained presence of Whi5 would contribute to maintaining SBF inhibited under sporulation conditions. The article is clearly written and the experimental approaches used are adequate to the aims of this work. The results obtained are in line with the conclusions reached by the authors but, in my view, they could also be explained by the existing literature and, hence, would not represent a major advance in the field of meiosis regulation.</p>
<p>Regarding the first mechanism, Fig 1 shows that Swi4 decreases very little after 1-2h in sporulation medium, whereas G1-cyclin expression is strongly repressed very rapidly under these conditions (panel D and work by others). This fact dampens the functional relevance of Swi4 downregulation as a causal agent of G1 cyclin repression. The authors use overexpression of Swi4 in Figs 2 and 3 to test the relevance of Swi4 downregulation but the pATG8-SWI4 construct produces levels much higher (4-5 fold) than the wild-type gene at time 0, which may likely introduce artifactual effects in the resulting observations. In addition, the LUTI-deficient SWI4 mutant does not cause any noticeable relief in CLN2 repression, arguing against the relevance of this mechanism in the repression of G1-cyclin transcription during entry into meiosis.</p>
<p>The authors propose a second mechanism where Whi5 would maintain SBF inactive under sporulation conditions. The role of Whi5 as a negative regulator of the SBF regulon is well known. On the other hand, the double WHI5-AA SWI4-dLUTI mutant does not upregulate CLN2, the G1 cyclin with the strongest negative effect on sporulation, raising serious doubts on the functional relevance of this backup mechanism during entry into meiosis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript highlights a mechanistic insight into meiotic initiation in budding yeast. In this study, the authors addressed a genetic link between mitotic cell cycle regulator SBF (the Swi4-Swi6 complex) and a meiosis inducing regulator Ime1 in the context of meiotic initiation. The authors' comprehensive analyses with cytology, imaging, RNA-seq using mutant strains lead the authors to conclude that Swi4 levels regulates Ime1-Ume6 interaction to activate expression of early meiosis genes for meiotic initiation. The major findings in this paper are that (1) the higher level of Swi4, a subunit of SBF transcription factor for mitotic cell cycle regulation, is the limiting factor for mitosis-to-meiosis transition; (2) G1 cyclins (Cln1, Cln2), that are expressed under SBF, inhibit Ime1-Ume6 interaction under overexpression of SWI4, which consequently leads to downregulation of early meiosis genes; (3) expression of SWI4 is regulated by LUTI-based transcription in the SWI4 locus that impedes expression of canonical SWI4 transcripts; (4) expression of SWI4 LUTI is likely negatively regulated by Ime1; (5) Action of Swi4 is negatively regulated by Whi5 (homologous to Rb)-mediated inhibition of SBF, which is required for meiotic initiation. Thus, the authors proposed that meiotic initiation is regulated under the balance of mitotic cell cycle regulator SBF and meiosis-specific transcription factor Ime1.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The most significant implication in their paper is that meiotic initiation is regulated under the balance of mitotic cell cycle regulator and meiosis-specific transcription factor. This finding will provide a mechanistic insight in initiation of meiosis not only into the budding yeast also into mammals. The manuscript is overall well written, logically presented and raises several insights into meiotic initiation in budding yeast. Therefore, the manuscript should be open for the field. I would like to raise the following concerns, though they are not mandatory to address. However, it would strengthen their claims if the authors could technically address and revise the manuscript by putting more comprehensive discussion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors showed that increased expression of the SBF targets, and reciprocal decrease in expression of meiotic genes upon SWI4 overexpression at 2 h in SPO (Figure 2F). However, IME1 was not found as a DEG in Supplemental Table 1. Meanwhile, IME1 transcript level was decreased at 2 h SPO condition in pATG8-CLN2 cells in Fig S4C.</p>
<p>Now this reviewer still wonders with confusion whether expression of IME1 transcripts per se is directly or in directly suppressed under SBF-activated gene expression program at 2 h SPO in pATG8-SWI4 and pATG8-CLN2 cells. This reviewer wonders how Fig S4C data reconciles with the model summarized in Fig 6F.</p>
<p>One interpretation could be that persistent overexpression of G1 cyclin caused active mitotic cell cycle, and consequently delayed exit from mitotic cell cycle, which may have given rise to an apparent reduction of cell population that was expressing IME1. For readers to better understand, it would be better to explain comprehensively this issue in the main text.</p>
<p>The % of cells with nuclear Ime1 was much reduced in pATG8-CLN2 cells (Fig 2B) than in pATG8-SWI4 cells (Fig 4C). Is the Ime1 protein level comparable or different between pATG8-CLN2 strain and pATG8-SWI4 strain? Since it is difficult to compare the quantifications of Ime1 levels in Fig S1D and Fig S4B, it would be better to comparably show the Ime1 protein levels in pATG8-CLN2 and pATG8-SWI4 strains.</p>
<p>
Further, it is uncertain how pATG8-CLN2 cells mimics the phenotype of pATG8-SWI4 cells in terms of meiotic entry. It would be nice if the authors could show RNA-seq of pATG8-CLN2/WT and/or quantification of the % of cells that enter meiosis in pATG8-CLN2.</p>
<p>The authors stated that reduced Ime1-Ume6 interaction is a primary cause of meiotic entry defect by CLN2 overexpression (Line 320-322, Fig 4J-L). This data is convincing. However, the authors also showed that GFP-Ime1 protein level was decreased compared to WT in pATG8-CLN2 cells by WB (Fig S4A). Further, GFP-Ime1 signals were overall undetectable through nuclei and cytosol in pATG8-CLN2 cells (Fig 4B), and accordingly cells with nuclear Ime1 were reduced (Fig 4C). Although the authors raised a possibility that the meiotic entry defect in the pATG8-CLN2 mutant arises from downregulation of IME1 expression (Line 282-283), causal relationship between meiotic entry defect and CLN2 overexpression is still not clear. Is the Ime1 protein level reduced in the pATG8-CLN2;UME6-⍺GFP strain compared to WT? It would be better to comparably show the Ime1 protein levels in the pATG8-CLN2 strain and the pATG8-CLN2;UME6-⍺GFP strain by WB. Also, it would be nice if the authors could show quantification of the % of cells that enter meiosis in the pATG8-CLN2;UME6-⍺GFP strain to see how and whether artificial tethering of Ime1 to Ume6 rescued normal meiosis program rather than simply showing % sporulation in Fig4A.</p>
<p>The authors showed Ume6 binding at the SWI4LUTI promoter (Figure 5K). However, since Ume6 forms a repressive form with Rpd3 and Sin3a and binds to target genes independently of Ime1, Ume6 binding at the SWI4LUTI promoter bind does not necessarily represent Ime1-Ume6 binding there. Instead, it would be better to show Ime1 ChIP-seq at the SWI4LUTI promoter.</p>
<p>The authors showed ∆LUTI mutant and WHI5-AA mutant did not significantly change the expression of SBF targets nor early meiotic genes relative to wildtype (Figure 6A, C). Accordingly, they concluded that LUTI- or Whi5-based repression of SBF alone was not sufficient to cause a delay in meiotic entry (Line451-452), and perturbation of both pathways led to a significant delay in meiotic entry (Figure 6E). This reviewer wonders whether Ime1 expression level and nuclear localization of Ime1 was normal in ∆LUTI mutant and WHI5-AA mutant.</p>

<p>The paper by Su, Yendluri and Unal reports several regulatory processes that control the activity of the SBF complex (Swi4/Swi6) in S. cerevisiae and its interaction with the meiotic inducer Ime1.</p>
<p>Entry into meiosis requires both the turning down of some components of the mitotic program and turning on meiotic genes. SBF (Swi4/Swi6) is an important player in entry in the mitotic cycle, acting at the G1/S transition. Previous data suggest the possibility that SBF may be differentially regulated during meiosis, potentially down-regulated. Here the authors first show a down regulation of Swi4 at the protein level, and then investigate downstream consequences. Overall the study is revealing several regulations of Swi4, with a repression of activity and a reduction of protein level by the Swi4-LUT1 transcript. The authors identify several components involved in this SWI4 pathway: 1) CLN1 and 2, which are targets of Swi4, and which mutation allows rescuing delay in meiotic entry when Swi4 is overexpressed; 2) Ime1 which activity is antigonized by Swi4, and more specifically its interaction with Ume6.</p>
