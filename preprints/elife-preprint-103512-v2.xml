<abstract>
<p>Forming an episodic memory requires binding together disparate elements that co-occur in a single experience. One model of this process is that neurons representing different components of a memory bind to an “index” — a subset of neurons unique to that memory. Evidence for this model has recently been found in chickadees, which use hippocampal memory to store and recall locations of cached food. Chickadee hippocampus produces sparse, high-dimensional patterns (“barcodes”) that uniquely specify each caching event. Unexpectedly, the same neurons that participate in barcodes also exhibit conventional place tuning. It is unknown how barcode activity is generated, and what role it plays in memory formation and retrieval. It is also unclear how a memory index (e.g. barcodes) could function in the same neural population that represents memory content (e.g. place). Here, we design a biologically plausible model that generates barcodes and uses them to bind experiential content. Our model generates barcodes from place inputs through the chaotic dynamics of a recurrent neural network and uses Hebbian plasticity to store barcodes as attractor states. The model matches experimental observations that memory indices (barcodes) and content signals (place tuning) are randomly intermixed in the activity of single neurons. We demonstrate that barcodes reduce memory interference between correlated experiences. We also show that place tuning plays a complementary role to barcodes, enabling flexible, contextually-appropriate memory retrieval. Finally, our model is compatible with previous models of the hippocampus as generating a predictive map. Distinct predictive and indexing functions of the network are achieved via an adjustment of global recurrent gain. Our results suggest how the hippocampus may use barcodes to resolve fundamental tensions between memory specificity (pattern separation) and flexible recall (pattern completion) in general memory systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Humans and other animals draw upon memories to shape their behaviors in the world. Memories of specific personal experiences — called episodic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tulving et al., 1972</xref>) — are particularly important for livelihood. In animals, episodic-like memory is operationally defined as the binding of the “where”, “what”, and “when” components that comprise a single experience. This information can later be retrieved from memory to affect behavior flexibly, depending on context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Clayton and Dickinson, 1998</xref>). The binding of memory contents into a discrete memory is thought to occur in hippocampus. Previous work proposed that hippocampus supports memory by generating an “index”, that is, a signal distinct from the contents of a memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Teyler and DiScenna, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Teyler and Rudy, 2007</xref>). In this scheme, during memory formation, plasticity links the neurons that represent memory contents with the neurons that generate this index. Later, re-experience of partial memory contents may reactivate the index, and reactivation of the index drives complete recall of the memory contents.</p>
<p>Indexing theory was originally articulated at an abstract level, without reference to particular neural representations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Teyler and DiScenna, 1986</xref>). More recently, signatures of index signals were identified in neural activity through experiments in food-caching chickadees (<italic>Poecile atricapillus</italic>), an influential animal model of episodic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sherry, 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref> identified “barcode”-like activity in the chickadee hippocampus during memory formation and suggested that barcodes function as memory indices. Barcodes are sparse, high-dimensional patterns of hippocampal activity that occur transiently during caching. They are unique to each cache and are uncorrelated between cache sites, even for nearby sites with similar place tuning. Barcodes are then reactivated when a bird retrieves the cached item. Chickadee hippocampus also encodes the bird’s location — as expected, given the presence of place cells — as well as the presence of a cached sunflower seed, irrespective of location. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref> found that hippocampal activity contains both putative memory indices (in the form of barcodes) and putative memory content (in the form of place and seed-related activity).</p>
<p>These findings raise several critical questions. How are barcodes generated and associated with place and seed-related activity during caching? How can hippocampal dynamics subsequently recall these same patterns during retrieval? Critically, neurons participate in both barcodes and place codes with near random overlap, in contrast with theoretical models where content and indexing functions occur in separate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Krotov and Hopfield, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bricken and Pehlevan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tyulmankov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Whittington et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kozachkov et al., 2023</xref>). It is unclear at a computational level how memory index and content signals can be functionally distinct when they coexist in the same network and even in the activities of single neurons.</p>
<p>In this paper, we use the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref> to guide the design of a biologically-plausible recurrent neural network (RNN) for cache memory formation and recall. The model generates barcodes and associates them with memory content in the same neural population. At recall time, the model can flexibly adjust the spatial scale of its memory retrieval, ranging from site-specific information to search of an extended area, depending on contextual demands. Using this model, we demonstrate the computational advantages of barcode-mediated memory by showing that it reduces interference between similar memories. We also show that place and barcode activities in the model play complementary roles in enabling memory specificity and flexible recall.</p>

<title>Barcode representations in the hippocampus are observed during caching</title>
<p>We first review the key experimental results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref>. Black-capped chickadees were placed in a laboratory arena comprised of a grid of identical sites. Each site had a perch to land on and a hidden compartment, covered by a flap, where a seed could be hidden. Chickadees were allowed to behave freely in this environment and collect sunflower seeds from feeders. A chickadee often visited sites without interacting with the hidden compartment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) but, at other times, the chickadee cached a seed into the compartment, or retrieved a previously cached seed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Previous experiments demonstrated that chickadees remember the precise sites of their caches in this behavioral paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Applegate and Aronov, 2022</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref> recorded hippocampal population activity during these behaviors. When chickadees visited sites, place cells were observed, similar to those previously found in birds and mammals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Payne et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Place cells did not change their spatial tuning after a cache. Instead, during caching and retrieval, neurons transiently displayed memory-related activity. During caching, neurons fired sparsely, with individual neurons producing large activity bursts for a small subset of caches at seemingly random locations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These bursts occurred in both place cells and non-place cells, with the location of cache bursts unrelated to a neuron’s place tuning. At the population level, activity during a cache consisted of both typical place activity and a cache-specific component orthogonal to the place code, termed a “barcode”. Strikingly, barcode activity for a particular cache reactivated during later retrieval of that cache. These findings were evident when examining the correlation between population activity vectors for visits, caches and retrievals at different sites. When comparing two visits, the correlation profile decayed smoothly with distance, as expected from place tuning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). When comparing caching with retrieval, a similar smooth decay was observed for most distances, indicating the presence of place tuning. However, there was a substantial boost in correlation for caches and retrievals at the exact same site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This site-specific boost resulted from reactivation of the cache barcode during subsequent retrieval.</p>
<p>Barcode activity during caching and retrieval, which are moments of memory formation and recall, suggests a mechanism supporting episodic memory. We hypothesize that the hippocampus generates a sparse, high-dimensional pattern of activity transiently during the formation of each memory, and that this serves as a unique index to which the contents of the memory are bound. Reactivation of the barcode at a later time drives the recall of the associated memory contents. In the food caching behavior studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref>, the contents of memory include the location (“where”) and presence of a seed (“what”). Below, we implement this hypothesis in a computational model.</p>

<title>Generating barcode activity with random recurrent dynamics</title>
<p>We model the hippocampus as a recurrent neural network (RNN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alvarez and Squire, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tsodyks, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hopfield, 1982</xref>) and propose that recurrent dynamics can generate barcodes from place inputs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). As in experiments, the model’s population activity during a cache should exhibit both place and barcode activity components. The network receives place inputs termed <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> which are spatially correlated as follows. Each neuron in the RNN receives inputs that are maximal at one location in the environment and decay with distance from that location, causing the neuron to have a single place field centered at that location. Across neurons, place fields uniformly span the environment. The firing rate activity of RNN units is denoted as <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The recurrent weights of the model are given by <italic>J</italic>, and the RNN activity <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> follows standard dynamics equations:

where <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the voltage signal of the RNN units and <italic>g</italic>(·) is a leak rate that depends on the average activity of the full network, representing a form of global shunting inhibition that normalizes network activity to prevent runaway excitation from recurrent dynamics. In our simulations, we simplify the task by using a 1D circular environment binned into 100 discrete spatial “states”. We set the spatial correlation length scale of place inputs such that the smallest distance between cache sites in the experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref> is equal to 8 of these states (see Methods for more details).</p>

<p>We initialize the recurrent weights from a random Gaussian distribution <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-8"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> is the number of RNN neurons and <italic>µ &lt;</italic> 0, reflecting global subtractive inhibition that encourages sparse network activity to match experimental findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref>. We first consider network activity before any learning-related changes. For the range of parameters we use, the network is in a chaotic state with a roughly constant overall level of activity but fluctuations in the activities of individual units. From an initial state of 0, we run recurrent dynamics until this steady-state level of overall activity has been achieved (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A,B</xref>). The chaotic recurrent dynamics induced by the random weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sompolinsky et al., 1988</xref>) effectively scrambles incoming place inputs. We demonstrate this by measuring the correlation of RNN activity across different locations and plotting this correlation as a function of distance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Place inputs show a smoothly decaying correlation curve. At low values of <italic>σ</italic>, the network is primarily input driven, showing a smoothly decaying correlation matching inputs. At high values of <italic>σ</italic>, recurrence is so strong that it entirely eliminates the spatial correlation of nearby sites: activity at each state is decorrelated from activity at all other states.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at an intermediate level of <italic>σ</italic> = 7, the network retains elements from both high and low recurrence regimes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The network exhibits a smoothly decaying correlation curve reflecting its inputs, but each state’s activity also contains a strong decorrelated component, apparent in the large drop in correlations for nearby but non-identical sites. This intermediate network regime closely resembles spatial correlation profiles observed during caching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The smoothly decaying component is caused by the place code, whereas the sharp peak at zero distance – reflecting barcode activity – is caused by the recurrent dynamics. We thus construct networks using intermediate <italic>σ</italic> values, which allow for the coexistence of place code and barcode components in population activity.</p>

(2024)</xref> is that the hippocampus exhibits both place code and barcode activity during caching and retrieval, but only place activity during visits. We propose that this effect can result from a network in which recurrent strength is flexibly modulated. In a low-recurrence condition, the network produces the place code, whereas in a high-recurrence condition the same network produces a combination of place code and barcode activity. To simulate this in our model, we modify <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">equation 2</xref> to
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="612073v4_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where the newly included <italic>r</italic> ∈ {0, 1} scales recurrent strength such that the network may be in a feedforward (<italic>r</italic> = 0) or recurrent regime (<italic>r</italic> = 1). During visits, we assume the network is operating with low recurrent strength (<italic>r</italic> = 0). As a result, the activity in the RNN exhibits the spatial profile of its place inputs. We verify this is the case by visualizing early and late RNN activity given a place input (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). With low recurrence, early and late RNN activity have similar spatial profiles, and late activity patterns for nearby states are highly correlated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, when recurrence is enabled (<italic>r</italic> = 1), network activity is sparse with a heavy tail of a few strongly active neurons, and is decorrelated between nearby states (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D,F</xref>). These changes match experimental observations of excitatory neurons during food caching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>We visualized neural activity during visits (<italic>r</italic> = 0) and caches (<italic>r</italic> = 1). During visits, RNN units display ordinary place tuning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1C</xref>). We also simulated spikes for all units at each location, and visualized this as a matrix where units were sorted by the preferred location of their inputs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). This matrix exhibits a diagonal structure reflecting strong spatial correlations. During caches, single neurons develop sparse, scrambled spatial responses relative to their place tuning (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">S1C</xref>). Accordingly, simulated spikes across the population have greater random, off-diagonal components during caching than during visits. Thus, recurrence in a randomly connected RNN is a simple and effective mechanism to generate barcode signals from spatially correlated inputs. We alternatively considered a feedforward mechanism to generate barcodes, in which barcodes are computed by a separate feedforward pathway (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). We found the feedforward mechanism required an unreasonably large number of neurons and sparsity levels to match the decorrelation level of the recurrent mechanism.</p>

<title>Storing memories by binding content inputs with a barcode</title>
<p>Having suggested a mechanism for the generation of barcode representations, we next propose how such a representation can be leveraged for memory storage in a network model. In our food-caching task, we assume that the contents of a memory include the location of the cache and the identity of a food item within the cache. Thus, we add an additional input source besides spatial location into our model – an input <italic>s</italic> representing the presence of a seed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The “seed” input projects randomly onto the RNN neurons. During caching, both place inputs and seed inputs arrive into the RNN, matching experimental findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al., 2024</xref>). This causes a mixed response in the network: one component of the response (place activity) is spatially tuned, another component (seed activity) indicates the presence of a seed and does not vary with location, and the third component (barcode activity) is generated by recurrent dynamics interacting with these inputs.</p>

where <italic>β &gt;</italic> 0 provides an overall inhibition of the stored pattern. This term helps to prevent network activity from collapsing to previously stored attractors. Memory storage works as follows, following the experimentally observed sequence in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref>: place inputs arrive into the RNN, recurrent dynamics generate a random barcode, seed inputs are activated, and then Hebbian learning binds a particular pattern of barcode activity to place- and seed-related activity. In this way, fixed-point attractors are formed corresponding to a conjunction of a barcode and memory content.</p>
<p>Memory recall in our network follows typical pattern completion dynamics, with recurrence strength set to <italic>r</italic> = 1 as for caches. As an example, consider a scenario in which an animal has already formed a memory at some location <italic>l</italic>, resulting in the storage of an attractor <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-9"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> into the RNN. The attractor <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-10"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> can be thought of as a linear combination of place input-driven activity <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic>), seed input-driven activity <italic>s</italic>, and a recurrent-driven barcode component <italic>b</italic>. Later, the animal returns to the same location and attempts recall (i.e. sets <italic>r</italic> = 1, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Place inputs for location <italic>l</italic> drive RNN activity towards <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic>), which is partially correlated with attractor <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-11"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and the recurrent dynamics cause network activity to converge onto attractor <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-12"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. In this way, barcode activity <italic>b</italic> is reactivated as part of attractor <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-13"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, along with the place and seed components stored in the attractor state <italic>p</italic>(<italic>l</italic>) and <italic>s</italic>. The seed input can also affect recall, as discussed in the following section.</p>
<p>As an initial test of memory function in our model, we analyzed the activity patterns that are stored and recalled in the model. We simulated caching at different sites in the arena and extracted the population activity that is stored via Hebbian learning (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, left). We then simulated retrieval as an event in which the animal returns to the same site and runs memory recall dynamics (<italic>r</italic> = 1) in the RNN. Population activity during retrieval closely matches activity during caching, and is substantially decorrelated from activity during visits (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To compare our model with the empirical results reproduced in 1E,F, we ran <italic>in silico</italic> experiments with caches and retrievals at varying sites in the circular arena. We simulated Poisson-generated spikes drawn from our network’s underlying rates to match the intrinsic variability in empirical data (see Methods). We find that population activity in the RNN is more strongly correlated between caches and retrievals at the same site than two visits to a site that are not seed related (<italic>r</italic> = 0; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, cache-retrieval correlations for non-identical sites rapidly drop to the level of visit-visit correlations because barcodes are orthogonal even for nearby sites. These correlation profiles closely resemble those observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al.

<title>Barcode-mediated memory supports precise and flexible context-based memory recall</title>
<p>What are the computational benefits of barcode-mediated memory storage? We designed two behavioral tasks for our model that quantify complementary aspects of memory performance. In both tasks, we simulate a sequence of three caches in the circular arena. We then test the model’s performance during memory recall (i.e. <italic>r</italic> = 1) using two distinct tasks. The “Cache Presence” task requires the network to identify the presence or absence of a cached seed at the current location (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). By evaluating the model on this task using different spacings between caches, we can measure the spatial precision of memory, i,e. how far apart two caches must be to prevent interference between their associated memories. The “Cache Location” task requires the network to identify the cache nearest to the current location by reactivating place activity corresponding to that cache location (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This task measures the robustness of recall and requires attractor dynamics to accurately retrieve memories from potentially distant locations. Together, these questions probe the ability of the memory system to be both specific (pattern separation) and searchable (pattern completion).</p>

<p>To enable readout from the model, we add an output layer containing place and seed units. During memory formation, these units receive a copy of place and seed inputs, respectively, and undergo Hebbian plasticity (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">equation 4</xref> with <italic>β</italic> = 0) with RNN units. This enables the RNN to reactivate a copy of the inputs that were provided during memory formation. We measure the activity of the seed output to determine cache presence, and we measure place outputs to determine cache location. We note that other readout mechanisms would likely function similarly – for example, plastic feedback connectivity from recurrent onto inputs units. The output layer used here is not intended to correspond to a specific brain region, but simply to provide a window into what could be read out easily from network activity by downstream neural circuits.</p>
<p>We first show model performance on a single example of the Cache Presence and Cache Location tasks, where caches are made at the locations 20%, 35%, and 70% of the way around the circular track. For the Cache Presence task, we evaluate the model at each spatial location and plot the activity of the seed output (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). After the first cache, we see that the seed output is only high at states around the vicinity of the first cache (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, top). The false positive rate is not zero since the states around the cache also have high output. However, the width of this false positive area is less than the distance between two sites in the arena used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref>, indicating that the model is able to identify caches at the spatial resolution observed in chickadee behavior in these experiments. After a second cache, the seed output correctly reports seeds in the areas around the two caches (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, middle). Importantly, the network separates the caches from each other, correctly identifying the absence of a seed at a position between the two caches. This behavior is maintained after the addition of the final third cache (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom).</p>
<p>For the Cache Location task, we examine the place outputs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, “Narrow Search”). When the current position is near a cache, the network correctly outputs a place field for the location of the nearest cache. However, an animal relying on memory to guide behavior may need to recall cache locations even when far away from a cache. To enable increased search radius, we make use of the seed input, which can bias network activity towards all memory patterns previously associated with this input. Activating the seed input greatly increases the range of current positions over which cache memories are retrieved (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, “Broad Search”). Critically, this does not cause interference between memories. For example, as current position moves from the location of cache 1 to cache 2, place outputs discretely jump from one cache location to the other, corresponding to correct selection of the nearest cache location. The search radius during recall can thus be flexibly adjusted according to task demands, allowing the trade-off between pattern completion and pattern separation to be dynamically regulated by simple scaling of a network input.</p>
<p>We next systematically quantified model performance on these tasks. For these analyses, we binarized the seed output as being above or below a threshold (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3AB</xref>). When caches are sufficiently spaced, memory recall is near perfect (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3AB</xref>). This led us to evaluate the resolution of the model’s memory as caches become more closely spaced. We decreased the distance between cache 1 and 2 to identify the minimum distance where caches are separable, i.e. where the model correctly indicates the absence of a cache at a midpoint between caches 1 and 2. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> shows this correct reject rate as a function of the distance from each cache and the seed input strength. With low seed input (e.g. <italic>s</italic> = 0), the correct reject rate is high when the current location is one site distance away from caches 1 and 2. In other words, if a cache is made at site 1 and site 3, our model recognizes that site 2 remains empty. This precision matches the single-site resolution measured by behavioral experiments in this arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Applegate and Aronov, 2022</xref>). As expected, performance on the Cache Presence task decreases with greater seed input strengths, as these are suited to searching over a broad spatial range.</p>
<p>For the Cache Location task, we measure the probability that the model outputs the location of the nearest cache. We plot this probability as a function of distance from the current location to the nearest cache (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). The model is able to correctly recall cache locations with almost perfect accuracy when it is near a cache. Performance drops sharply with distance when the seed input is low, but is substantially recovered by increasing the seed input strength. Critically, even when the search radius is broad enough to include multiple caches, attractor dynamics encourage selection of the single closest cache location rather than blending memories. Thus the seed input strength provides a flexible search radius during the recall process. Low values of <italic>s</italic> are more suitable for detecting the presence or absence of a seed near the current location, while high values of <italic>s</italic> are more suitable for finding remote caches. The complementary demands of the Cache Presence and Cache Location tasks demonstrate the utility of a flexible search radius within one memory system.</p>
<p>We further examined how model hyperparameters affected performance on these tasks. We find that the plasticity bias <italic>β</italic> is needed to prevent erroneous memory recall at sites without caches (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E-H</xref>). Without this, recall specificity is poor and model performance suffers on the Cache Presence task. We also verified that our model is robust to the order in which caches were made (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3CD</xref>). We found that adding noise to the network’s temporal dynamics had little effect on memory recall performance (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). However, large static noise vectors added to the network’s input and initial state decreased the overall probability of memory recall, but not its spatial profile (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). Finally, we extended our model to work with random, spatially correlated inputs, rather than receiving place cell-like inputs (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). This shows that our results apply regardless of the specific format of spatial inputs, which are experimentally undetermined.</p>

<title>Place activity and barcode activity play complementary roles in memory</title>
<p>We have shown that a barcode-mediated memory system is precise yet allows flexible, content-based retrieval. Below we identify the specific contributions of place and of barcode activity by ablating either of these components in our model. To ablate barcodes (“Place Code Only” in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), we initialize our model without the random recurrent weights that produce chaotic dynamics. This is akin to running caching dynamics in “visit mode”, i.e. <italic>r</italic> = 0 in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. To ablate place activity (“Barcode Only” in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), we eliminate spatial correlations in the networks inputs. This is akin to having place fields with extremely narrow precision, rather than a spatially smooth place code. We test both ablated models on the three-cache tasks from above and compare their performance to our full model.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="612073v4_fig5.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>The Place Code Only model directly binds memory contents of place and seed. This causes cache memories for nearby locations, where the place code is correlated, to interfere with each other. Interference is clearly visible in the performance on the Cache Presence task (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, left). The seed output of the place code only network is high across a wide area including caches 1 and 2 and the empty locations between them. Indeed this network is unable to identify the absence of a cache at locations between caches 1 and 2, even with a substantial distance between them (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, the memories for caches 1 and 2 sometimes appears to suppress memory for a distant cache 3. Further evidence of interference is apparent in the Cache Location task, where the network merges caches 1 and 2, and entirely fails to signal the cache at location 3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, left). This network has a low true negative rate, and often a single cache dominates the output (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A-D</xref>). Accordingly, the network is able to signal the location of a cache, but this location is often not the nearest cache (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Intuitively, without barcodes the network is unable to distinguish individual memories at nearby spatial locations. Without this barcode-mediated competition, it forms a single agglomerated memory that is inflexibly recalled.</p>
<p>If correlations in inputs cause memory interference, why not do away with them entirely? The Barcode Only model shows that this is not a good option. This model performs well on the Cache Presence task (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, right, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6E-G</xref>), correctly identifying the presence of all three caches, and the absence of caches in other locations (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). However, the Barcode Only model fails on the Cache Location task. The model is unable to recall place fields that are not precisely at its current location (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B,D</xref>). With greater seed input, the model can sometimes recall memories at remote locations, but these are selected randomly with no preference for nearby caches (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6H</xref>). Intuitively, the model cannot distinguish nearby and distant caches because it lacks input correlations, which establish the measure of proximity.</p>
<p>In summary, place and barcode activity play complementary roles in our model. Barcode activity functions like an index for individual memories. This function supports discriminability of memories even when memory contents overlap – for example, for two nearby caches with correlated place activity. Barcodes also support selective recall of individual memories in our model via competitive attractor dynamics. However the discriminability advantage of barcodes is only useful if they can be reactivated during memory recall. Spatially correlated place inputs (and the seed input) allow efficient memory retrieval by defining a measure of proximity in memory contents, and support remote memory recall. The presence of both index and content signals in our model allows all of these functions to be performed by the same network, and for the trade-offs between them to be adjusted flexibly.</p>

<title>Modulating recurrent strength allows the RNN to incorporate both predictive maps and barcode memory</title>
<p>We have constructed a model of a simple episodic memory, taking inspiration from hippocampal data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al., 2024</xref>). However, the hippocampus has also been suggested to support functions beyond episodic memory. An especially influential line of prior work proposes that the hippocampus plays a role in generating predictive maps, with evidence from both experiments (including in food-caching birds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Muller and Kubie, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mehta et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Payne et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Applegate et al., 2023</xref>) and theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blum and Abbott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stachenfeld et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Whittington et al., 2020</xref>). This raises the question – is our model consistent with predictive map theories? And if so, how might predictive maps influence episodic memory recall?</p>
<p>Interestingly, prior work has shown that biologically realistic RNNs can generate predictive maps with structured recurrent weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fang et al., 2023</xref>). Specifically, if recurrent weights encode the transition statistics of an animal’s experience, then predictive map-like activity will arise from the RNN dynamics, and can be controlled by recurrent strength (analogous to the value of <italic>r</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">equation 3</xref>). This prediction via structured recurrent weights invites comparison to the use of random recurrent weights in our model to generate barcodes. Inspired by this connection, we considered whether a single model could generate both predictive and barcode activity via recurrent dynamics. We constructed a hybrid model, in which recurrent weights are a blend of random weights, as above, and structured, predictive weights as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fang et al. (2023)</xref> (<xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7AB</xref>). We hypothesize that network activity changes from a predictive to a chaotic regime (supporting barcodes) with increasing recurrent strength, i.e. as we adjust <italic>r</italic> in the range 0 <italic>&lt; r &lt;</italic> 1.</p>
<p>We use the same circular arena for our simulations, but with the assumption that animal behavior is biased, i.e., the animal only moves clockwise (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We visualize population activity at each site, with units sorted by their place field. When recurrent strength is at its lowest (<italic>r</italic> = 0, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) network activity is place-like and reflects the current location of the animal provided in its inputs. When recurrent strength is slightly increased (<italic>r</italic> = 0.3, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), the network exhibits predictive activity. That is, neural activity of recurrent units is shifted to reflect an expected future position, relative to the current spatial position encoded in inputs. This is consistent with observations from experimental data collected from hippocampus of animals with biased movements in a linear track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mehta et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lisman and Redish, 2009</xref>). Finally, when recurrent strength is maximal (<italic>r</italic> = 1.0, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>) we observe barcodes, i.e. sparse activity at random positions relative to inputs. We plot spatial tuning curves of a few example RNN units under low, intermediate, and high recurrent strengths (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">S7C</xref>). Individual units can display typical place fields (blue), skewed predictive place fields (orange), and barcode activity (purple).</p>

<p>These results suggest that the structured and random components of recurrent connectivity can act somewhat independently of each other, with their relative contributions determined by recurrent strength. We quantify this by measuring the magnitude of the projection of population activity onto the place code, the predictive code, and barcodes as a function of recurrent strength (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). At the lowest recurrent strength (<italic>r</italic> = 0), the population activity is solely concentrated on the place code. As recurrent strength is increased, place coding decreases and predictive activity increases with a peak around <italic>r</italic> = 0.4. Beyond this, both place and predictive activity decrease as barcode activity rises to a peak when <italic>r</italic> = 1.0.</p>
<p>Finally, we explore the functional implications of including predictive maps into our memory model. We first verify that model performance in the previous three-cache tasks is not disrupted by including predictive weights in the model (<xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8</xref>). We then examine memory recall of a single cache for a predictive model, assuming a clockwise behavioral bias (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). The model exhibits a profound skew: the cache is recalled much earlier on the path leading up to the cache location, at further distance from the cache than on the path after the cache location. This indicates that knowledge of the environment and prior experience, as reflected in predictive place activity, can shape memory recall in our model.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have proposed a biologically realistic model for a simple form of episodic memory using barcodes. Our work is related to previous auto-associative memory models of the hippocampus such as Hopfield networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gardner-Medwin, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">McNaughton and Morris, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Marr et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alvarez and Squire, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tsodyks, 1999</xref>), but diverges in a few critical areas. Building on ideas from hippocampal indexing theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Teyler and DiScenna, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Teyler and Rudy, 2007</xref>), and following the discovery of barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al., 2024</xref>), we show how recurrent computation can implement memory indexing. Our model is further noteworthy in randomly intermixing representations of memory index and memory content in the activity of single neurons, matching experimental findings. This intermixing implies that single neurons cannot be definitively identified as “place cells” or “barcode cells”, despite clear differentiation between the place code and the barcode at the population level. A further innovation of our model is the ability to control the trade-off between pattern completion and pattern separation during memory recall, by simply turning up or down the strength of a memory content input (“search strength” in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In this work we considered only place and a single “seed” input, but it is straightforward to generalize this to naturalistic cases where different food types are stored, or to memory contents beyond cached food. In principle, our approach would allow independent control of search strength for each potential element of memory content.</p>
<p>To generate barcodes during caching and retrieval without affecting place activity during visits, our model changes recurrent strength in an RNN between different behaviors. A major question is how the brain could implement such gain changes in recurrence. One possible mechanism is a change in recurrent inhibition, which is consistent with dramatic changes in the activity of inhibitory neurons observed during caching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al., 2024</xref>). Neuromodulators like acetylcholine have been shown to bidirectionally modulate different inhibitory neuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Xiang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lovett-Barron et al., 2014</xref>), and proposed to control the recurrent gain of hippocampal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hasselmo, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2006</xref>). However, our model uses generic RNN units, and it is unclear precisely how units in the model should be mapped to real excitatory and inhibitory hippocampal neurons in the brain. Our model predicts a state change in hippocampal activity during memory formation and recall, allowing recurrent computation to generate or reactivate memory barcodes. Detailed modeling of realistic E-I networks is needed to further clarify its specific biological implementation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, other mechanisms may be involved in generating barcodes. We demonstrated that conventional feed-forward sparsification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Xie et al., 2023</xref>) was highly inefficient, but more specialized computations may improve this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Földiak, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Olshausen and Field, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sacouto and Wichert, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Muscinelli et al., 2023</xref>). Another possibility is that barcodes are generated in a separate recurrent network upstream of the recurrent network where memories are stored. In this 2-network scenario, the downstream network receives both spatial tuning and barcodes as inputs. This would not obviate the need for modulating recurrent strength in the downstream network to switch between input-driven modes and attractor dynamics. We suspect separating barcode generation and memory storage in separate networks would not fundamentally affect our conclusions.</p>
<p>We showed that barcodes allow for precise memory retrieval despite the presence of other correlated memories. This sharpened memory retrieval is similar to mechanisms used in key-value memory structures that are often embedded in machine learning architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Graves et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sukhbaatar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Le et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banino et al., 2020</xref>). At their simplest, these key-value memory structures consist of memory slots. Each slot consists of a memory that can be addressed via “keys” such that their stored memory is returned as “values”. In machine learning, key-value memory has been connected to the dot-product attention mechanism used in transformers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Krotov and Hopfield, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ramsauer et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, prior theoretical work has suggested neural implementations for both key-value memory and attention mechanisms, arguing for their usefulness in neural systems such as long term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kanerva, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Tyulmankov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bricken and Pehlevan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Whittington et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kozachkov et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Krotov and Hopfield, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gershman et al., 2025</xref>). In this framework, the address where a memory is stored (the key) may be optimized independently of the value or content of the memory. In our model, barcodes improve memory performance by providing a content-independent scaffold that binds to memory content, preventing memories with overlapping content from blurring together. Thus barcodes can be considered as a change in memory address, and our model suggests important connections between recurrent neural activity and key generation mechanisms. However we note that barcodes should not be literally equated with keys in key-value systems as our model’s memory is ‘content-addresable’—it can be queried by place and seed inputs.</p>
<p>Episodic memory is often studied at a behavioral level in humans performing free or cued recall of remembered word lists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kahana, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Naim et al., 2020</xref>). Temporal context models (TCM) of episodic memory have been highly successful in accounting for the sequential order effects observed reliably in this experimental setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Howard and Kahana, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Howard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sederberg et al., 2008</xref>), and the idea of a “context vector” in TCM is closely related to use of barcodes as a memory index in our model. However experiments have shown that chickadee cache retrieval does not exhibit temporal order effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Applegate and Aronov, 2022</xref>), suggesting that caches at different locations are likely not linked by a temporal context as in TCM. Interestingly, caches at the same location were found to have distinct but correlated barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al., 2024</xref>), which could be related to caches sharing a “spatial context” analogous to TCM. In the present study we did not consider memory for different caches at the same location, since it requires a mechanism for forgetting or overwriting cache memory following retrieval. Although such “directed forgetting” is observed in chickadee behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sherry, 1984</xref>), there is no definitive solution for Hopfield-like networks, and it is thus beyond the scope of our current work.</p>
<p>Our hippocampal model focused on the implementation of episodic memory. Importantly, the proposed barcode mechanism is capable of coexisting with other hippocampal functions, such as predictive coding as formalized by the successor representation (SR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stachenfeld et al., 2017</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that a hybrid network can switch between SR-generating and barcode-generating modes of operation by adjusting the gain of recurrent connectivity. Further work is needed to characterize the general conditions under which barcode and SR functions do or do not mutually interfere. It is also unclear if these are separate functions of the same circuit, or if they are complementary in certain scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Schapiro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barron et al., 2020</xref>). For example, we found that the SR could bias barcode-mediated memory recall. In a complex environment, the Euclidean distance between two points may not correspond to its proximity in a practical sense, which the SR better captures. In this case, experience-dependent biases in memory recall can be functionally advantageous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dasgupta and Gershman, 2021</xref>) and would be consistent with behavioral results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kahana, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Talmi and Moscovitch, 2004</xref>).</p>

            <p>We simulate a caching task in a circular track, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref>. The track consists of <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> connected states. The goal of this task is to test how well an agent equipped with a memory model can precisely recall the locations where a cache (or memory) has been stored.

For each state <italic>c</italic> ∈ <italic>C</italic> we assume the agent is currently at state <italic>c</italic> and allow the model to store a memory at that state.

However, we also randomly shuffle the order of caching in a supplementary figure (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3CD</xref>) and do not find any effects on model performance.</p>

            <title>Defining site distance in our simulation</title>
            <p>To allow comparisons to data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref>, we first determine the number of states in our simulation that’s equivalent to the distance between adjacent cache sites in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chettih et al. (2024)</xref>. To do so, we note that the spatial correlation between population activity at two adjacent cache sites is around 0.75 (when spatial correlation profile is normalized to [0, 1]). We identify the number of states in our simulation such that the normalized correlation between visit activity is also around 0.75. We find that this is around 8 states. Thus, we define 8 states in our simulation as equivalent to the distance between adjacent cache sites.</p>

To compare model results to the empirical data in 1E,F, which includes intrinsic neural variability, we sampled Poisson-generated spike counts from the rates output by our model.

            <p>We will construct a feedforward model to generate sparse, decorrelated barcodes (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). Place inputs to the model are fed through a hidden expansion layer before being compressed again by an output layer to generate the barcode. We first define these layers via the random matrices <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-46"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline43.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-47"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline44.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-48"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline45.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-49"><inline-graphic xlink:href="612073v4_inline46.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>

<p>(3) The authors successfully reproduce key experimental findings on hippocampal barcode activity from chickadee studies, including the distinct correlations observed during caching, retrieval, and visits.</p>
<p>(4) Overall, the study addresses a somewhat puzzling question about how memory indices and content signals coexist and interact in the same hippocampal population. By proposing a unified model, it provides significant conceptual clarity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The recurrent neural network model incorporates assumptions and mechanisms, such as the modulation of recurrent input strength, whose biological underpinnings remain unclear. The authors acknowledge some of these limitations thoughtfully, offering plausible mechanisms and discussing their implications in depth.</p>
<p>One thread of questions that authors may want to further explore is related to the chaotic nature of activity that generates barcodes when recurrence is strong. Chaos inherently implies sensitivity to initial conditions and noise, which raises questions about its reliability as a mechanism for producing robust and repeatable barcode signals. How sensitive are the results to noise in both the dynamics and the input signals? Does this sensitivity affect the stability of the generated barcodes and place fields, potentially disrupting their functional roles? Moreover, does the implemented plasticity mitigate some of this chaos, or might it amplify it under certain conditions? Clarifying these aspects could strengthen the argument for the robustness of the proposed mechanism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our model, chaos is used to produce a random barcode when forming memories, but memory retrieval depends on attractor dynamics. Specifically, the plasticity update at the end of the cache creates an attractor state, and then afterwards for successful memory retrieval the network activity must settle into this attractor rather than remaining chaotic. This attractor state is a conjunction of memory content (place and seed activity) and memory index (barcode activity). Thus a barcode is ‘reactivated’ when network dynamics during retrieval settle into this cache attractor, or in other words chaotic dynamics do not need to generate the same barcode twice.</p>
<p>The reviewer raises an important point, which is how sensitivity to initial conditions and noise would affect the reliability of our proposed mechanism. The key question here is how noise will affect the network’s dynamics during retrieval. Would adding noise to the dynamics make memory retrieval more difficult? We thank the reviewer for suggesting we investigate this further, and below describe our experiments and changes to the manuscript to better address this topic.</p>
<p>We first experimented with adding independent gaussian distributed noise into each unit, drawn independently at each timestep. We analyzed recall accuracy using the same task and methods as Fig. 4F while varying the magnitude of noise. Memory recall was quite robust to this form of noise, even as the magnitude of noise approached half of the signal amplitude. This first experiment added noise into the temporal dynamics of the network. We subsequently examined adding static noise into the network inputs, which can also be thought of as introducing noise into initial conditions. Specifically, we added independent gaussian distributed noise into each unit, with the random value held constant for the extent of temporal dynamics. This perturbation decreased the likelihood of memory recall in a graded manner with noise magnitude, without dramatically changing the spatial profile. Examination of dynamics on individual trials revealed that the network failed to converge onto a cache attractor on some random fraction of trials, with other trials appearing nearly identical to noiseless results. We now include these results in the text and as a new supplementary figure, Figure S4AB.</p>
<p>To clarify the network dynamics and the purpose of chaos in our model, we make the following modifications in text:</p>
<p>Section 2.3, paragraph 2 (starting at “To store memories…”):</p>
<p>“…place inputs arrive into the RNN, recurrent dynamics generate an essentially random barcode, seed inputs are activated, and then Hebbian learning binds a particular pattern of barcode activity to place- and seed-related activity.”</p>
<p>Section 2.3, paragraph 3 (starting at “Memory recall in our network…”): As an example, consider a scenario in which an animal has already formed a memory at some location <italic>l</italic>, resulting in the storage of an attractor \vec{a} into the RNN. The attractor \vec{a} can be thought of as a linear combination of place input-driven activity $p(l)$, seed input-driven activity $s$, and a recurrent-driven barcode component $b$. Later, the animal returns to the same location and attempts recall (i.e. sets <italic>r</italic> = 1, Figure 3B). Place inputs for location <italic>l</italic> drive RNN activity towards $p(l)$, which is partially correlated with attractor \vec{a}, and the recurrent dynamics cause network activity to converge onto attractor \vec{a}. In this way, barcode activity $b$ is reactivated, along with the place and seed components stored in the attractor state, $p(l)$ and $s$. The seed input can also affect recall, as discussed in the following section.</p>
<p>Section 2.4, final paragraph (starting “We further examined how model hyperparameters affected performance on these tasks”), added the following describing new results on adding noise: We found that adding noise to the network's temporal dynamics had little effect on memory recall performance (Figure S4A). However, large static noise vectors added to the network's input and initial state decreased the overall probability of memory recall, but not its spatial profile (Figure S4B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It may also be worth exploring the robustness of the results to certain modeling assumptions. For instance, the choice to run the network for a fixed amount of time and then use the activity at the end for plasticity could be relaxed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described above, chaotic dynamics are necessary to generate a barcode during a cache, but not to reactivate that barcode during retrieval. During a successful memory retrieval, network activity settles into an attractor state and thus does not depend on the duration of simulated dynamics. The choice of duration to run dynamics during caching <italic>is</italic> important, but only insofar as activity significantly decorrelates from the initial state. We show in Figure S1B that decorrelation saturates ~t=25, and thus any random time point t &gt; 25 would be similarly effective. We used a fixed duration runtime for caches only to avoid introducing unnecessary complication into our model.</p>

<p>Comments:</p>
<p>The model distinguishes between &quot;barcode activity&quot; and &quot;attractors&quot;. Which of the two corresponds to experimentally-recorded barcodes? I would presume the attractors. A potential issue is that the attractors are, as explained in the text (l.137), conjunctions of place activity, barcode activity and &quot;seed&quot; inputs. The fact that the seed activity is shared across attractors seems to imply that they have a non-zero correlation independent of distance. Is that the case in the model? If I understand correctly, Fig 3D shows correlations between an attractor and barcodes at different locations, but correlations between attractors at different locations are not shown. Fig 1 F instead shows that correlations between recorded retrieval activities decay to zero with distance.</p>
<p>More generally, the fact that the expression &quot;barcode&quot; is apparently used with different meanings in the model and in the experiments is potentially confusing (in the model they correspond to activity generating during caching, and this activity is distinct from the memories; my understanding is that in the experiments barcodes correspond to both caching and retrieval, but perhaps I am mistaken?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our intent is to use the expression “barcode” as similarly as possible between model and experimental work. The reviewer points out that the connection between barcodes in experimental and modeling work is unclear, as well as the relation of “attractors” in our model to previous experimental results. The meaning of ‘barcode’ is absolutely critical—we clarify below our intended meaning, and then describe changes to the manuscript to highlight this.</p>
<p>In experiments, we observed that activity during caching looked different than ordinary hippocampal activity (i.e. typical “place activity” observed during visits). Empirically there were two major differences. First, there was a pattern of neural activity which was present during every cache . This pattern was also present when birds visually inspected sites containing a cached seed, but not when visually inspecting an empty site. This is what we refer to as “seed activity”. Second, there was a pattern of neural activity which was unique to each cache. This pattern re-occurred during retrieval, and was orthogonal to place activity (see Fig. 1E-F). This is what we refer to as “barcode activity”. In summary, activity during a cache (or retrieval) contains a combination of three components: place activity, seed activity, and barcode activity.</p>
<p>These experimental findings are recapitulated in our model, as activity during a cache contains a combination of three components: place activity driven by place inputs, seed activity driven by seed inputs, and barcode activity generated by recurrent dynamics. Cache activity in the model corresponds to cache activity in experiments, and barcodes in the model correspond to barcodes in experiments. Our model additionally has “attractors”, meaning that network connectivity changes so that the activity generated during a simulated cache becomes an attractor state of network dynamics. “Attractors” refers to a feature of network dynamics, not a distinct activity state, and we do not yet know if these attractors exist in experimental data.</p>
<p>Figure 3D, as described in the figure legend, is a correlation of activity during cache and retrieval (in purple), for cache-retrieval pairs at the same or at different sites. We believe this is what the reviewer asks to see: the correlation between attractor states for different cache locations. The reviewer makes an important point: seed activity is shared across all attractors, so then why are correlations not high for all locations? This is because attractors also have a place component, which is anti-correlated for distant locations. This is evident in Fig. 3D by noticing that visit-visit correlations (black line, corresponding to place activity only) are negative for distant locations, and the correlation between attractors (purple line, cache-retrieval pairs) is subtly shifted up relative to the black line (place code only) for these distant locations. The size of this shift is due to the relative magnitude of place and seed inputs. For example, if we increase the strength of the seed input during caching (blue line), we can further increase the correlation between attractors even for quite distant sites:</p>

<p>To clarify the manuscript, we made the following modifications:</p>
<p>Section 2.2, first paragraph: We model the hippocampus as a recurrent neural network (RNN) (Alvarez and Squire, 1994; Tsodyks, 1999; Hopfield, 1982) and propose that recurrent dynamics can generate barcodes from place inputs. As in experiments, the model’s population activity during a cache should exhibit both place and barcode activity components.</p>
<p>Section 2.3, paragraph 3 (starting at “Memory recall in our network…”): As an example, consider a scenario in which an animal has already formed a memory at some location <italic>l</italic> , resulting in the storage of an attractor \vec{a} into the RNN . The attractor \vec{a} can be thought of as a linear combination of place input-driven activity $p(l)$, seed input-driven activity $s$, and a recurrent-driven barcode component $b$. Later, the animal returns to the same location and attempts recall (i.e. sets <italic>r</italic> = 1, Figure 3B). Place inputs for <italic>l</italic> drive RNN activity towards $p(l)$, which is partially correlated with attractor \vec{a}, and the recurrent dynamics cause network activity to converge onto attractor \vec{a}. In this way, barcode activity $b$ is reactivated as part of attractor \vec{a}, along with the place and seed components stored in the attractor state, $p(l)$ and $s$. The seed input can also affect recall, as discussed in the following section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The insights obtained from the network model for the computational role of barcode activity could be explained more clearly. The introduction starts by laying out the indexing theory, which proposes that the hippocampus links an index with each memory so that the memory is reactivated when the index is presented. The experimental paper suggests that the barcode activations play the role of indexes. Yet, in the model reactivations of memories are driven not by presenting bar-code activity, but by presenting place activity (Cache Presence task) or seed activity (Cache Location task). So it seems that either place activity and seed activity play the role of indexes. Section 2.5 nicely shows that ultimately the role of barcode activity is to decorrelate attractors, which seems different from playing the role of indexes. I feel it would be useful that the Discussion reassess more critically the relationship between barcodes, indexing theory, and key-value architectures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer highlights a failure on our part to clearly identify the connection between our findings on barcodes, indexing theory, and key-value architectures. This is another major component of the paper, and below we propose changes to the manuscript to clarify these concepts and their relationships. First, we will summarize the key points that were unclear in our original manuscript.</p>
<p>The reviewer equates the concept of an ‘index’ with that of a ‘query’: the signal that drives memory reactivation. This may be intuitive, but it is not how a memory index was defined in indexing theory (e.g. Teyler &amp; DiScenna 1986). In indexing theory, the index is a pattern of hippocampal activity that is (a) generated during memory formation, (b) separate from the activity encoding memory content, and (c) linked to memory content via associative plasticity. After memory formation, a memory might be queried by activating a partial set of the memory contents, which would then drive reactivation of the hippocampal index, leading to pattern completion of memory contents. See, for example, figure 1 of Teyler and DiScenna 1986. The ‘index’ is thus not the same as the ‘query’ that drives recall.</p>
<p>We propose in this work that barcode activity is such an index. Indexing theory originally posited that memory content was encoded by neocortex, and memory index was encoded by hippocampus. However the experiments of Chettih et al. 2024 revealed that the hippocampus contained both memory content and memory index signals, and furthermore there was no division of cells into ‘content’ and ‘index’ subtypes. Thus our model drops the assumption of earlier work that index and content signals correspond to different neurons in different brain areas—a significant advance of our work. Otherwise, the experimentally observed barcodes and the barcodes generated by our computational model play the role of indices as originally defined.</p>
<p>Our original manuscript was unclear on the relationship of indexing theory and key-value systems. Our work connects diverse areas of memory models, including attractor dynamics, key-value memory systems, and memory indexing. A full account of these literatures and their relationships may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, and we note that a recent review article (Gershman, Fiete, and Irie, 2025) further clarifies the relationship between key-value memory, indexing theory, and the hippocampus. We will cite this work in our discussion as a source for the interested reader.</p>
<p>Briefly, a key-value memory system distinguishes between the address where a memory is stored, the ‘key’, and the content of that memory, the ‘value’. An advantage of such systems is that keys can be optimized for purposes independent of the value of each memory. The use of barcodes in our model to decorrelate memories is related to this optimization of keys in key-value memory systems. By generating barcodes and adding this to the attractor state corresponding to a cache memory, the ‘address’ of the memory in population activity is differentiated from other memories. Our work is thus consistent with the idea that hippocampus generates keys and implements a key storage system. However it is not so straightforward to <italic>equate</italic> barcodes with keys, as they are defined in key-value memory. As the reviewer points out, memory recall can be driven by location and seed inputs, i.e. it is content-addressable. We think of the barcode as modifying the memory address to better separate similar memories, without changing memory content, and the resulting memory can be recalled by querying with either content or barcode. Given the complex and speculative nature of these relationships, we prefer to note the salient connection of our work with ongoing efforts applying the key-value framework to biological memory, and leave the precise details of this connection to future work.</p>
<p>We make the following changes in the manuscript to clarify these ideas:</p>
<p>Introduction, first paragraph: In this scheme, during memory formation the hippocampus generates an index of population activity, and the neurons representing this index are linked with the neurons representing memory content by associative plasticity . Later, re-experience of partial memory contents may reactivate the index, and reactivation of the index drives complete recall of the memory contents.</p>
<p>Discussion, 4th paragraph on key-value: Interestingly, prior theoretical work has suggested neural implementations for both key-value memory and attention mechanisms, arguing for their usefulness in neural systems such as long term memory (Kanerva, 1988; Tyulmankov et al., 2021; Bricken and Pehlevan, 2021; Whittington et al., 2021; Kozachkov et al., 2023; Krotov and Hopfield, 2020; Gershman 2025 ). In this framework, the address where a memory is stored (the key) may be optimized independently of the value or content of the memory. In our model, barcodes improve memory performance by providing a content-independent scaffold that binds to memory content, preventing memories with overlapping content from blurring together. Thus barcodes can be considered as a change in memory address, and our model suggests important connections between recurrent neural activity and key generation mechanisms. However we note that barcodes should not be literally equated with keys in key-value systems as our model’s memory is ‘content-addresable’—it can be queried by place and seed inputs.</p>

<p>The model includes a number of non-standard ingredients. It would be useful to explain which of these ingredients and which of the described mechanisms are essential for the studied phenomenon. In particular:</p>
<p>- the dynamics in Eq.2 include a shunting inhibition term. Is it essential and why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The shunting inhibition is important as it acts to normalize the network activity to prevent runaway excitation. We hope to clarify this further by amending the following sentence in section 2.2: <italic>“g</italic> (·) is a leak rate that depends on the average activity of the full network, representing a form of global shunting inhibition that normalizes network activity to prevent runaway excitation from recurrent dynamics.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- same question for the global inhibition included in the random connectivity;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The distribution from which connectivity strengths are drawn has a negative mean (global inhibition). This causes activity during caching (i.e. r = 1) to be sparser than activity during visits (i.e. r = 0), and was chosen to match experimental findings. In figures 2B and S2B we show that our model can transition between a mode with place code only, barcode only, or a mode containing both, by changing the variance of the weight distribution while holding the mean constant. We suggest clarifying this by editing the following in section 2.2, paragraph 2: “We initialize the recurrent weights from a random Gaussian distribution, <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-103512-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>. where 𝑁<sub>𝑋</sub> is the number of RNN neurons and μ &lt; 0, reflecting global subtractive inhibition that encourages sparse network activity to match experimental findings (Chettih et al. 2024).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- the model is fully rate-based, but for certain figures, spikes are randomly generated. This seems superfluous.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Spikes are simulated for one analysis and one visualization, where it is important to consider noise or variability in neural responses across trials. First, for Fig. 2H,J, we generated spikes to allow a visual comparison to figures that can be easily generated from experimental data. Second, and more significantly, for the analysis underlying Fig. 3D, it is essential to simulate variability in neural responses. Because our rate-based models are noiseless, the RNN’s rate vector at site distance = 0 will always be the same and result in a correlation of 1 for both visit-visit and cache-retrieval. However, we show that, if one interprets the rate as a noisy Poisson spiking process, the correlation at site distance = 0 between a cache-retrieval pair is higher than that of two visits. This is because under a Poisson spiking model, the signal-to-noise ratio is higher for cache-retrieval activity, where rates are higher in magnitude. The greater correlation for a cache-retrieval pair at the same site, relative to visits at the same site, is an experimental finding that was critical for our model to reproduce. We detail clarifications to the manuscript below in response to the reviewer’s following and related question.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How are the correlations determined in the model (e.g., Fig 2 B)? The methods explain that they are computed from Poisson-generated spikes, but over which time period? Presumably during steady-state responses, but are these responses time-averaged?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer points out a lack of clarity in our original manuscript. Correlations for events (caches, retrievals and visits) at different sites are calculated in two sections of the paper (2B, 3D), for different purposes and with slight differences in methods:</p>
<p>- For figure 2B, no spikes are simulated. Note that the methods mentioning poisson spike generation specify only Fig. 2H,J and Fig. 3D. We simply take the network’s rate vector at timestep t=100 (when the decorrelating effect of chaotic dynamics has saturated, S1A-B) and correlate this vector when generated at different locations. We now clarify this in the legend for Figure 2B: “We show correlation of place inputs (gray) and correlation of the RNN's rate vector at t = 100 (black).”</p>
<p>- For Figure 3D, we want to compare the model to empirical results from Chettih et al. 2024, and reproduced in this paper in Fig. 1E-F. These empirical results are derived from correlating vectors of spiking activity on pairs of single trials, and are thus affected by noise or variability in neural responses as described in our response to the reviewer’s previous question. We thus took the RNN’s rate vector at t=100 and simulated spiking data by drawing samples from a poisson distribution to get spike counts. Our original manuscript was unclear about this, and we suggest the following changes:</p>
<p>- Legend for Figure 3D: D. Correlation of Poisson-generated spikes simulated from RNN rate vectors at two sites, plotted as a function of the distance between the two sites.</p>
<p>- Section 2.3, last paragraph: Population activity during retrieval closely matches activity during caching, and is substantially decorrelated from activity during visits (Figure 3C). To compare our model with the empirical results reproduced in Figure 1E,F, we ran <italic>in silico</italic> experiments with caches and retrievals at varying sites in the circular arena. We simulated Poisson-generated spikes drawn from our network's underlying rates to match the intrinsic variability in empirical data (see Methods).</p>
<p>- Methods, subsection Spatial correlation of RNN activity for cache-retrieval pairs at different sites: To calculate correlation values as in Figure \ref{fig3}D, we simulated experiments where 5 sites were randomly chosen for caching and retrieval. To compare model results to the empirical data in Fig. 1E,F, which includes intrinsic neural variability, we sampled Poisson-generated spike counts from the rates output by our model. Specifically, for RNN activity \vec{r_i} at location i, using the rates at t=100 as elsewhere, we first generate a sample vector of spikes…</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I was confused by early and late responses in Fig 2 C. The text says that the activity is initialized at zero, so the response at t=0 should be flat (and zero). More generally, I am not sure I understand why the dynamics matter for the phenomenon at all, presumably the decorrelation shown in Fig 2B depends only on steady state activity (cf previous question).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for catching this mistake. The legend has been updated to indicate that the ‘early’ response is actually at t=1, when network activity reflects place inputs without the effects of dynamics. The reviewer is correct that we are primarily interested in the ‘late’ response of the network. All other results in the paper use this late response at t=100. As shown in Fig. S2A,B, this timepoint is not truly a steady state, as activity in the network continues to change, but the decorrelation of network activity with place-driven activity has saturated.</p>
<p>We include the early response in Fig. 2C for visual comparison of the purely place-driven early activity with the eventual network response. It is also relevant since, as the reviewer points out above, there is a shunting inhibition term in the dynamics that is present during both low and high recurrent strength simulations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to the previous point, the discussion of decorrelation (l.79 - 97) is somewhat confusing. That paragraph focuses on chaotic activity, but chaos decorrelates responses across different time points. Here the main phenomenon is the decorrelation of responses across different spatial inputs (Fig 2B). This decorrelation is presumably due to the fact that different inputs lead to different non-trivial steady-state responses, but this requires some clarification. If that is correct, the temporal chaos adds fluctuations around these non-trivial steady-state responses, but that alone would not lead to the decorrelation shown in Fig 2B.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that chaotic activity produces a decorrelation across time points. Because of chaotic dynamics, network activity does not settle into a trivial steady-state, and instead evolves from the initial state in an unpredictable way. The network does not settle into a steady-state pattern, but both the decorrelation of network state with initial state and the rate of change in the network state saturate after ~t=25 timesteps, as shown in Fig. S2A-B.</p>
<p>The initial activity for nearby states is similar, due to them receiving similar place inputs.</p>
<p>Because network activity is chaotically decorrelated from this initial state by temporal dynamics, ‘late stage’ network activity between nearby spatial states is less correlated than ‘early stage’ activity. Thus the temporal decorrelation produces a spatial decorrelation. We believe that the changes we have introduced to the manuscript in revision will make this point clearer in our resubmission.</p>

<p>A key ingredient of the model is that the recurrent interactions are switched on and off between &quot;caching&quot; and &quot;visits&quot;. The discussion argues that a possible mechanism for this is recurrent inhibition (l.320), which would need to be added. However two forms of inhibition are already included in the model. The text also says that it is unclear how units in the model should be mapped onto E and I neurons. However the model makes explicit assumptions about this, in particular by generating spikes from individual neurons. Altogether, I did not find that part of the Discussion convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this section is a limitation of our current work, and in fact it is an ongoing area of future research. However we think the advances in this current work warrant publication despite this topic requiring further research. We attempted to discuss this limitation explicitly, and note that the other reviewer pointed this section out as particularly helpful. We do not think it is problematic for a realistic model of the brain to ultimately include 3, or even more forms of inhibition. We do not think that poisson-generated spikes commit us to interpreting network units as single neurons. Spikes are not a core part of our model’s mechanism, and were used only as a mechanism of introducing variability on top of deterministic rates for specific analyses. Furthermore one could still view network units as pools of both E and I spiking neurons. We would welcome further recommendations the reviewer believes are important to note in this section on our model’s limitations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>On lines 117-120 the text briefly mentions an alternate feed-forward model and promptly discards it. The discussion instead says that a &quot;separate possibility is that barcodes are generated in a circuit upstream of where memories are stored, and supplied as inputs to the hippocampal population&quot;, and that this possibility would lead to identical conclusions. The two statements seem a bit contradictory. It seems that the alternative possibility would replace the need for switching on and off recurrent interactions, with a mechanism where barcode inputs are switched on and off. This alternate scenario is perhaps more plausible, so it would be useful to discuss it more explicitly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion here, which seems to be due to our phrasing in the discussion section. We do reject the idea that a simple feed-forward model could generate the spatial correlation profile observed in data, as mentioned in the text and included as Fig. S2. Our statement in the discussion may have seemed contradictory because here we intended to discuss the possibility that an upstream area generates barcodes, for example by the chaotic recurrent dynamics proposed in our work, while a downstream network receives these barcodes as inputs and undergoes plasticity to store memories as attractors. We did not intend to suggest any connection to the feedforward model of barcode generation, and apologize for the confusion. Our claim that this ‘2 network’ solution would lead to similar conclusions is because the upstream network would need an efficient means of barcode generation, and the downstream network would need an efficient means of storing memory attractors, and separating these functions into different networks is not likely to affect for example the advantage of partially decorrelating memory attractors. Moreover, the downstream network would still require some form of recurrent gating, so that during visits it exhibits place activity without activating stored memory attractors!</p>
<p>We thus chose a 1 network instead of a 2 network solution because it was simpler and, we believe, more interesting. It is challenging in the absence of more data to say which is more plausible, thus we wanted to mention the possibility of a 2 network solution. We suggest the following changes to the manuscript:</p>
<p>- Discussion, 3rd paragraph: “Alternatively, other mechanisms may be involved in generating barcodes. We demonstrated that conventional feed-forward sparsification (Babadi and Sompolinsky, 2014; Xie et al., 2023) was highly inefficient, but more specialized computations may improve this (Földiak, 1990; Olshausen and Field, 1996; Sacouto and Wichert, 2023; Muscinelli et al., 2023). Another possibility is that barcodes are generated in a separate recurrent network upstream of the recurrent network where memories are stored. In this 2-network scenario, the downstream network receives both spatial tuning and barcodes as inputs. This would not obviate the need for modulating recurrent strength in the downstream network to switch between input-driven modes and attractor dynamics. We suspect separating barcode generation and memory storage in separate networks would not fundamentally affect our conclusions.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As a minor note, the beginning of the discussion states that the presented model is similar to previous recurrent network models of the hippocampus. It would be worth noting that several of the cited works assign a very different role to recurrent interactions: they generate place cell activity, while the present model assumes it is inherited from upstream inputs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not sure how best to modify the paper to address this suggestion. As far as we know, all of the cited models which deal with spatial encoding do assume that the hippocampus receives a spatially-modulated or spatially-tuned input. For example, the Tsodyks 1999 paper cited in this paragraph uses exponentially-decaying place inputs to each neuron highly similar to our model. Furthermore we explore how our model would perform if we change the format of spatial inputs in Fig. S4, and find key results are unchanged. It is unclear how hippocampal place fields could emerge without inputs that differentiate between spatial locations. We think it is appropriate to highlight the similarity of our model to well known hopfield-type recurrent models, where memories are stored as attractor states of the network dynamics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we agree that a common line of hippocampal modeling proposes that recurrent interactions reshape spatial inputs to produce place fields. This often arises in the context of hippocampus generating a predictive map, where inputs may be one-hot for a single spatial state, in a grid cell-like format, or a random projection of sensory features. We attempted to address this in section 2.6, using a model which superimposes the random connectivity needed for barcode generation with the structured connectivity needed for predictive map formation. We found that such a model was able to perform both predictive and barcode functions, suggesting a path forward to connecting different lines of hippocampal modeling in future work.</p>
