<title>Abstract</title><p>Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone density and strength, increases fracture risk, pain, and limits mobility. Established therapies of Parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs effectively promote bone formation and reduce fractures in severe osteoporosis, but their use is limited by potential adverse effects. In the pursuit of safer osteoporosis treatments, we investigated <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, a PTH variant wherein the native arginine at position 25 is substituted by cysteine. These studies were prompted by our finding of high bone mineral density in a hypoparathyroidism patient with the R25C homozygous mutation, and we explored its effects on PTH type-1 receptor (PTH1R) signaling in cells and bone metabolism in mice. Our findings indicate that <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-84) forms dimers both intracellularly and extracellularly, and the synthetic dimeric peptide, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34), exhibits altered activity in PTH1R-mediated cAMP response. Upon a single injection in mice, dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1-34) induced acute calcemic and phosphaturic responses comparable to PTH(1-34). Furthermore, repeated daily injections increased calvarial bone thickness in intact mice and improved trabecular and cortical bone parameters in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, akin to PTH(1-34). The overall results reveal a capacity of a dimeric PTH peptide ligand to activate the PTH1R <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> as PTH, suggesting a potential path of therapeutic PTH analog development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Osteoporosis is a prevalent global bone disorder characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD), causing weakened bones leading to fragility fractures, particularly in the spine, hip, and wrist. The development of osteoporosis is influenced by factors including gender, being more prevalent in women; hormonal changes, like decreased estrogen levels during menopause; and age, with heightened susceptibility post-menopause in women contributing to bone loss. Recent meta-analysis of previous studies indicates a global osteoporosis prevalence of 23.1 % among women and 11.7 % among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Osteoporosis stands as a noteworthy risk factor over the age of 50 years that poses challenges to the preservation of autonomous mobility and overall well-being within an aging society. There is thus a pressing need for safe and efficacious therapies for osteoporosis that mitigate fractures, alleviate associated symptoms, and preserve physical functionality.</p>
<p>Anti-resorptive agents (e.g., bisphosphonates and denosumab) and romosozumab encompass a therapeutic approach that aims to specifically counteract the declines in bone mass by tempering the balance between bone resorption and formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). It is pertinent to acknowledge, however, that the prolonged use of most of such agents is limited due to potential long-term side effects. Furthermore, anti-resorptive therapies cannot stimulate new bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). In contrast, bone anabolic agents, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its analogs, such as teriparatide (recombinant human PTH(1–34)), increase BMD by stimulating bone formation more than bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). PTH has an exceptionally short half-life in the blood of approximately 2-4 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), which helps in avoiding excessive increases in blood calcium levels that can otherwise limit the utility of PTH-related medications, while yet inducing a desired anabolic effect on bone. It is also worth noting that studies in rodents reveal that long-term administration of a PTH anabolic agent can lead to bone overgrowth, osteosarcoma, as well as hypercalcemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Consequently, a goal of ongoing research is to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms driving the anabolic and catabolic effects of PTH to thereby secure more effective therapeutic alternatives for osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>PTH is produced and secreted by the parathyroid glands as a straight-chain monomeric polypeptide of 84 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). It plays a vital role in maintaining calcium and phosphate equilibrium by acting on the PTH1R, a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ­(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) that is expressed primarily in cells of bone and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The orchestrated downstream effects of PTH in target cells act to ensure optimal bone health and the maintenance of the ambient blood calcium and phosphate concentrations required for proper nerve conduction, muscle activity, and systemic cellular communication, whereas disturbances in this system can lead to multiple disorders.</p>
<p>Central to the PTH signaling cascade is the activation of intracellular G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), most prominently Gsα, which in turn activates transmembrane adenylyl cyclases, leading to the synthesis of the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), and the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). PTH can also activate other second messenger cascades, including the Gαq/phospholipase C (PLC) / inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG), and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), highlighting the diverse biology of PTH and the PTH1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Adding to this paradigm, the PTH1R also mediates the actions of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), a development protein that acts in the formation of bones and other tissues. PTHrP shares considerable sequence homology with PTH in the first 34 amino acids, which encompass the receptor-binding portions of the two respective ligands. The PTH1R thus has an intrinsic capacity for dual ligand recognition, which opens possibilities for exploring new modes of therapeutic development for diseases such as osteoporosis and hypoparathyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Pharmacologically, the PTH1R can adopt at least two distinct ligand-binding conformations, RG and R<sup>0</sup>, the selectivity for which can lead to altered modes of signaling <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> for peptides such as PTH, PTHrP, and various hybrid analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>The current study extends our prior investigation in which we identified in a patient with chronic hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia with a mutation that changes the arginine at position 25 in the mature PTH(1–84) polypeptide to cysteine (<sup>R25C</sup>PTH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Antibody assays revealed the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutant protein to be present in the patient’s blood at markedly elevated levels. We now have found that this patient expressing the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH variant has higher-than-normal BMD for age and sex. We further characterize the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH protein and find that it can manifest in two distinct molecular forms: as a monomer and as a dimer, and we demonstrate that a dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) synthetic peptide retains agonistic properties on the PTH1R that are driven by a moderate selectivity for the RG vs. R<sup>0</sup> receptor conformation. Finally, we demonstrate in mice that <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) can induce skeletal responses that are similar to those induced by PTH(1–34), but without triggering an excessive hypercalcemic response. Considering the proven bone-anabolic capacity of several established PTH agonist ligands, and the need for safe, long-term treatments for skeletal disorders, our studies on dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) suggest alternative strategies to consider in such drug development programs.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Dimerization of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84)</title>
<p>In our previous studies, we showed that synthetic monomeric peptide, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), as compared to PTH(1–34), exhibits a moderately diminished PTH1R-binding affinity and decreased cAMP signaling potency <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that with long-term infusion in mice, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) leads to only minimal calcemic and phosphaturic effects, which corroborates the hypocalcemia seen in the original patient, despite the significantly elevated levels of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH in the plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In subsequent analysis of this patient, we found a particularly high BMD for age and sex (Supplemental figure 1), which prompted us to further characterize the functional properties of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, as described herein. We produced recombinant PTH(1–84) with or without the R25C mutation by expression of the corresponding cDNA in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We considered the possibility that the introduction of a sole new cysteine within the polypeptide chain of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) might induce homologous bimolecular dimerization through a disulfide bond involving the thiol functional group in each monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). To specifically investigate this, we designed the cDNA constructs to express either pre-pro-PTH(1–115)-3xFLAG or <sup>R56C</sup>pre-pro-PTH(1–115)-3xFLAG, such that after intracellular processing and cleavage of the pre-pro regions, the mature PTH(1–84)-3xFLAG or <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84)-3xFLAG peptides would be generated upon transfection in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). We performed western blot analysis of total cell lysates and conditioned culture media collected from the transfected cells to specifically assess the possible presence of a disulfide-bonded dimeric form. Each sample was thus prepared in either reduced or non-reduced form and proteins were detected using an anti-flag antibody. The results demonstrated the presence of both a low molecular weight monomeric, and in the non-reduced samples, a higher molecular weight dimeric form of the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84)-3XFLAG protein in both the cell lysate and extracellular conditioned medium fractions, and the dimer appeared to be at an elevated proportion in the medium relative to the lysate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To control for potential artifact effects attributed to the 3xFLAG tag, we utilized plasmid constructs pcDNA3.0-(pre-pro-PTH)-IRES and pcDNA3.0-(<sup>R56C</sup>pre-pro-PTH)-IRES encoding non-tagged PTH variants and an anti-PTH(39–84) antibody for Western blot analysis, which again confirmed the presence of the dimer in total HEK293T cell lysates (Supplemental figure 2).</p>

</fig>
<p>We observed in the above studies that the expression level of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) was higher than that of wild-type PTH(1–84) in both cell lysate and medium, which we considered might be due to an intrinsic enhancement in protein stability and resistance to protein degradation in the dimeric molecule. To address this, we treated the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which acts by forming a hemiacetal with the hydroxyl groups of active site threonine residues, and compared the expression levels of wild-type PTH(1–84) and <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) in the treated vs. untreated cells. The results indicated that while the expression level of wild-type PTH was increased by MG132 treatment, it did not reach the level of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, suggesting that the difference in expression is not related to a difference in sensitivity to proteasome-mediated degradation (Supplemental figure 3).</p>
<p>Overall, we have confirmed that <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) can form a dimeric structure, and the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) secreted outside the cells predominantly exists in dimeric form. Thus, utilizing dimer <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) in the analysis would be more relevant to understanding the actual function of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH. Consequently, we aim to conduct further validation using dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH in our subsequent investigations.</p>

<title>Functional characterization of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To explore the functional properties of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, we conducted experiments using synthetic peptides of PTH(1–34), <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) (monomeric) and disulfide-bonded dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34). First, we examined the receptor-binding affinity of these ligands by performing competition experiments using membranes prepared from HEK293-derived GP-2.3 cells that stably express the human PTH1R and assay formats designed to assess binding to either the G protein-uncoupled R<sup>0</sup> or G protein-coupled RG receptor conformation. ­ The results revealed that monomeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) bound to both the R<sup>0</sup> and RG conformations with comparable, albeit slightly weaker affinity as compared to PTH(1–34), while dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) bound to each conformation with weaker affinity than did the monomeric form while showing an apparent selectivity for higher binding to the RG vs R<sup>0</sup> conformation of PTH1R (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate the signaling properties of the ligands, we measured the changes in the increase in intracellular levels of cAMP induced by each ligand in an osteoblastic SaOS-2 derived cell line (SGS-72 cells) that stably expresses the Glosensor cAMP reporter.­ These assays revealed that each ligand dose-dependently increased the cAMP levels in the cells, detected as an increase in luminescence in an Envision plate reader, and while the potencies were moderately and more substantially reduced for the monomeric and dimeric forms of the ligand, respectively, as compared to PTH(1–34), the maximum response attained by each ligand were comparable (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) thus retains signaling functionality at the PTH1R that is characterized by a potency approximately commensurate with its affinity for binding to the RG PTH1R conformation.</p>

<title>Effect of single injection of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) on calcium and phosphate regulation in mice</title>
<p>To assess whether dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH can function <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injected the ligand, and in parallel either vehicle or PTH(1–34) (each peptide at a dose of 50 nmol/kg) into CD1 female mice and measured levels of ionized calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) in the blood (n = 6 mice/group), inorganic phosphate (Pi) in plasma (n = 12 mice/group), and the excretion of Pi into urine (n = 6 mice/group). Blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were measured at serial time points of pre-injection, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post-injection. Both PTH(1–34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) induced increases in blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels that were significant, relative to the levels in vehicle-injected mice, at 1 and 2 hours post-injection, and the levels then returned to the baseline levels of vehicle control mice by 4 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Plasma Pi levels were measured in samples obtained pre-injection, at 6 minutes, and 1, 2, and 6 hours post-injection.

<p>To more directly assess the impact of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) on bone mass, we administered it to ovariectomized (OVX) mice, which serve as a well-established model for postmenopausal osteoporosis. The OVX mice were injected 5 times per week for 4 weeks with either the dimeric ligand (OVX + dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), PTH(1–34) (OVX + PTH(1–34)) or vehicle (OVX + vehicle, OVX-controls), and sham-operated (Sham) mice were used as further controls. Mice were euthanized at the end of the injection period and tissue samples were isolated for analysis. Quantitative micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) analysis of the femurs obtained from each group revealed that, as compared to OVX + vehicle controls, treatment with PTH(1–34) increased femoral trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV) by 121%, cortical bone volume fraction (Ct.BV/TV) by 128%, cortical thickness (Ct.Th) by 115%, cortical area (Ct.Ar) by 110%, and cortical area fraction (Ct.Ar/Tt.Ar) by 118%, while decreased total tissue area (Tt.Ar) by 93% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).

<p>The effects of the treatments on bone strength were assessed by conducting a three-point bending test on femurs isolated from the mice. The maximum load parameter was significantly decreased in the femurs from OVX-control versus Sham mice and was significantly increased, relative to the OVX-controls, by treatment with the PTH(1–34), but not dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The slope parameter was significantly decreased in the femurs from OVX-control versus Sham mice and tended to increase versus OVX-controls by treatment with either PTH(1–34) or <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), but the changes were not significant.We further analyzed the levels of bone metabolism markers in the serum obtained from the mice at the study endpoint (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). The levels of serum calcium were within the normal range in all treatment groups, while serum phosphate levels were modestly increased in the OVX mice treated with PTH(1–34) or dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) as compared to with vehicle, but the effect was significant only with PTH(1–34). The serum levels of CTX-1, a bone resorption marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), were elevated in each of the OVX groups versus the Sham group, and tended to be lower in the OVX-PTH(1–34) treatment group, but the change relative to OVX-vehicle was not significant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, serum P1NP and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels were significantly increased in dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34)-treated group, compared to the OVX-vehicle group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Histological staining of proximal tibial sections for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, a marker of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, revealed an apparent increase in this activity in bones of the OVX mice, as compared to those in Sham control mice, reflecting a heightened rate of bone turnover, as also suggested by the increased levels of serum CTX-1 in the OVX mice, and the TRAP staining appeared to be reduced in the tibiae of the OVX mice treated with PTH(1–34) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Further histomorphometric analysis confirmed a significant increase in the osteoclast surface area relative to bone surface area (Oc.S/BS) in the proximal tibiae of the OVX-vehicle mice, relative to that in the Sham-control mice, and this parameter was significantly decreased by treatment with PTH(1–34), but not with dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show the introduction of a cysteine mutation at the 25th amino acid position of mature parathyroid hormone (<sup>R25C</sup>PTH) facilitates the formation of homodimers comprised of the resulting dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH peptide <italic>in vitro</italic>. This dimerization surprisingly was compatible with receptor binding affinity and led to relatively minor deviations in functional behavior as assessed in our cell-based assays and compared to the standard monomeric control PTH peptide. The homozygous <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutation was identified in patients who presented with hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, despite elevated PTH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), and the mutation was found to impact the bioactive region of PTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Our initial research on this <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutant focused on the monomeric state of the peptide, and these studies revealed relatively moderate decreases in PTH1R binding affinity and cAMP-stimulating potency <italic>in vitro</italic> and moderately impaired calcemic effects upon infusion in mice. Additional clinical observations, however, revealed the patients to have a higher BMD than anticipated for age-matched averages. This elevated bone mass, coupled with the elevated serum PTH levels, prompted our further investigations into the properties of the mutant PTH, as described herein.</p>
<p>Our investigations brought to light the capacity of the cysteine-25 mutation to induce dimer formation in the otherwise monomeric PTH polypeptide as produced in transfected cells. This result was established by comparing western blots of transfected cell lysates analyzed under reducing versus non-reducing conditions of gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, we employed synthetic peptides to further explore the functional properties of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34). The results of our current studies show some divergence from our previous findings obtained using the monomeric counterpart, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH (1–34). Compared to the monomer, dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) exhibited a more preferential binding affinity for the RG versus R<sup>0</sup> PTH1R conformation, despite a diminished affinity for either conformation. We also observed that the potency of cAMP production in cells was lower for dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH as compared to the monomeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, in accordance with a lower PTH1R-binding affinity. Previous reports indicated that a mutation at the 25th position of PTH results in the loss of calcium ion allosteric effects on monomeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, leading to faster ligand dissociation, rapid receptor recycling, and a shorter cAMP time course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Correspondingly, the weaker receptor affinity and reduced cAMP production observed in dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH suggest a possibility that the formation of a disulfide bond at the 25th position significantly alters the function of PTH as a PTH1R ligand. While these structural effects are not yet fully understood and need to be investigated further.</p>
<p>We further pursued <italic>in vivo</italic> applications in mice. We assessed the calcemic and phosphatemic responses to a single injection of synthetic peptides of either PTH(1–34) or dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) in intact mice. We found the dimer could induce increases in plasma calcium levels that were at least as robust and as sustained as those induced by PTH(1–34) and were similarly phosphaturic (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Activation of the canonical Gαs-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway is generally thought to underlie most of the biological responses induced by PTH1R activation, and our studies in SGS-72 cells confirm that dimeric PTH can activate this pathway, albeit not as efficiently as a monomeric PTH peptide. Arg25 resides in the 20-34 (C-terminal region) of PTH(1–34), which plays a significant role in the binding of the ligand to the extracellular domain (ECD) of the PTH1R. In concert with the binding of the 20-24 region of PTH to the ECD, the N-terminal portion of PTH engages the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the PTH1R, inducing the conformational changes involved in G protein coupling and cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The precise binding mode used by dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH to the PTH1R is unknown, but it may be anticipated that it differs to some extent from that used by the monomeric peptide, due, for example, to the changes in bulk molecular size and display of accessible functional groups. Consequently, the receptor conformational changes and the modes of coupling to downstream effectors may differ for the monomeric versus dimeric ligands, which could potentially lead to altered signaling and biological responses <italic>in vivo</italic>. Whether such changes account for the increased bone density observed in the patient with the homozygous <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutation is unknown, but cannot be presently ruled out.</p>
<p>The results of practical assessments of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) for effects on calvarial bone after short-term (6-days) injection into normal mice, and for effects on bone mass after long-term (4-weeks) daily injection in osteoporotic OVX mice demonstrate the dimer can mediate significant influences on bone metabolism alike to wild-type PTH. In OVX mice, PTH and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH significantly increased bone formation markers P1NP and ALP. However, wild-type PTH, but not dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, decreased bone resorption markers such as TRAP staining and CTX-1 levels, suggesting different effects of wild-type monomeric PTH and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH. In this study, the increase of bone resorption markers of dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH compared to PTH may be one reason for low bone strength. In addition, the data showed an increase in cortical bone area (Ct.Ar) in the PTH treatment group but not in the PTH dimer treatment group. However, both dimeric and monomeric PTH treatments reduced total tissue area (Tt.Ar), suggesting potential effects on bone growth in the width of mice or humans. While further investigation is necessary, the current experimental data, along with patient symptoms showing no bone resorption despite lifelong exposure to high levels of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, imply that the dimeric form of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH can provide a new insight into PTH and PTH analogs with distinct functionalities compared to the wild-type PTH.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, it is urgently necessary to determine whether dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH is present in human patient serum. Second, TRAP staining showed an inhibitory effect of PTH treatment on the primary spongiosa area. However, the secondary spongiosa, which more accurately reflects bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>), was not examined due to the barely detectable bone in this area in OVX-induced osteoporosis mouse models. Third, it is unclear whether similar bone phenotypes exist in patients versus in mice treated with dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, particularly regarding low bone strength. Although the dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH-treated group showed higher cortical BMD compared to WT-Sham or PTH groups, there was no difference in bone strength compared to the osteoporotic mouse model. Fourth, our study demonstrated that PTH or <sup>R25C</sup>PTH treatment decreased circumferential length, which could affect bone growth in width. However, whether this phenotype is also observed in patients treated with PTH or <sup>R25C</sup>PTH remains uncertain. Finally, we did not analyze the <sup>R25C</sup>PTH mutant mouse model, which would allow us to compare phenotypes that most closely resemble those of human patients.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the recent identification of a young patient in Denmark displaying homozygous <sup>R25C</sup>PTH has opened avenues for observing the direct impacts of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH within the human biological system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). The continual monitoring and observation of patients will contribute to a more profound comprehension of the long-term consequences associated with <sup>R25C</sup>PTH exposure. This extensive observation is crucial in delineating the extended effects of this compound on individuals. Consequently, by conducting thorough investigations to confirm the potential bone anabolic effect of <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, we hope to develop a novel bone anabolic agent with a targeted focus on the PTH1R.</p>

<title>PTH1R competition binding assay</title>
<p>The binding of PTH and its analogs to G protein-uncoupled PTH1R (R<sup>0</sup> conformation) and G protein-coupled PTH1R (RG conformation) was assessed using a competition method with membranes prepared from GP-2.3 cells (HEK-293 cells stably expressing the hPTH1R). For tracer radioligands, we utilized <sup>125</sup>I-PTH(1–34) and <sup>125</sup>I-MPTH(1–15). The unlabeled ligands tested were PTH(1–34), <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34). Binding to the R<sup>0</sup> conformation was assessed using <sup>125</sup>I-PTH(1–34) as the tracer radioligand, while binding to the RG conformation was assessed using <sup>125</sup>I-MPTH(1–15). The addition of unlabeled ligands PTH(1–34), <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), or dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) caused dissociation of the tracer radioligand from each receptor if it had affinity to the receptors.

<p>CD1 female mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Massachusetts, USA), and all animal care and experimental procedures were conducted under the guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment, with 4-5 mice per cage, under a 12-hour light cycle at a temperature of 22±2°C.</p>
<p>Eight-week-old C57BL/6N female mice were purchased from KOATECH (Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea), and stabilized mice for 2 weeks. All animal care and experimental procedures were conducted under the guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Kyungpook National University (KNU-2021-0101). The mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free environment, with 4-5 mice per cage, under a 12-h light cycle at 22 ± 2°C. They were provided with standard rodent chow and water ad libitum.</p>
<p>An ovariectomizing (OVX) osteoporosis mouse model was established using 10-week-old C57BL/6N female mice. Following surgery, mice were divided into the following four groups (n = 6 mice/group) as follows: Sham, OVX control group, OVX + PTH (1–34) treated group (40 µg/kg/day), and OVX + dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH treated group (40-80 µg/kg/day). OVX mice were allowed to recover for 4 weeks after surgery. Afterward, PTH (1–34) or <sup>R25C</sup>PTH was injected subcutaneously 5 times a week for 4 weeks.

<title>Acute injections</title>
<p>The peptides PTH(1–34) and dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) were diluted in a solution comprising 0.05% Tween 80, 10 mM citric acid, and 150 mM NaCl at a pH of 5.0. Intravenous injections of these peptides were administered at doses ranging from 50-100 μg/kg into 9-week-old CD1 female mice. As a control, mice received only the vehicle. Levels of ionized calcium (Ca2+) in the blood (n = 6 mice/group) were measured at serial time points of pre-injection, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours post-injection. Inorganic phosphate (Pi) in plasma (n = 12 mice/group), and the excretion of Pi into urine (n = 6 mice/group) were measured in samples obtained at serial time points of pre-injection, at 6 minutes, and 1, 2, and 6 hours post-injection.</p>

Subcutaneous injections of the respective drugs were administered once daily for 6 days. On the sixteenth day, the mice were sacrificed, and their bone tissues were harvested and fixed in 10 % formaldehyde at 4°C. The fixed bone tissues were then decalcified in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 moles of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Following decalcification, the tissues were embedded in paraffin, and paraffinized tissues were sectioned to a thickness of 5-7 µm. Histological analysis was performed using the sectioned tissue slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). The area of new bone formation, which displays a more intense coloration compared to the existing bone tissue, was examined.</p>

<title>μ-CT analysis</title>
<p>Mouse femurs were fixed in a 4 % paraformaldehyde solution for 24 hours at 4°C. In μ-CT, we used the Quantum FX μ-CT (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). The images were acquired at a 9.7 μm voxel resolution, with settings of 90 kV and 200 μA, a 10 mm field of view, and a 3-minute exposure time. Serial cross-sectional images were reconstructed using the Analyze 12.0 software (Overland Park, KS, USA). To ensure consistent analysis, identical regions of interest (ROIs) were selected for the trabecular and cortical bones. Bone parameters and density were analyzed in the region between 0.3–1.755 mm (150 slices) from the bottom of the growth plate. Analysis of bone structure was performed using adaptive thresholding in CT Analyser. Thresholds for analysis were determined manually based on grayscale values for each experimental group: trabecular bone: 3000; cortical bone: 5000 for all samples. All bone parameters were evaluated according to the guidelines of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>).</p>

<title>Three-point bending test</title>
<p>The left femur of the mouse was immersed in 0.9 % NaCl solution, wrapped in gauze, and stored at −20°C until ready for a three-point bending test. In this test, we placed the mouse femurs horizontally with the anterior surface facing upwards, centered on the supports, and the compressive force was applied vertically to the mid-shaft. The pressure sensor was positioned at a distance that allowed maximum allowable pressure (200N) without interfering with the test (20.0 mm for the femur). A miniature material testing machine (Instron, MA, U.S.A.) was used for this test. The crosshead speed was decreased to 1 mm/min until failure. During the test, force-displacement data were collected to determine the maximum load and slope of the bones.</p>

<title>Bone histological analyses</title>
<p>The tibiae were initially fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C overnight. The following day, samples were decalcified using 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution (pH 7.4) for 4 weeks at 4°C. The decalcified tibiae were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 3 μm thick. For TRAP staining, dehydrated paraffin sections were fixed in an acetone/ethanol mixture (1:1) for 1 minute, followed by complete air-drying at RT for 20 minutes. Thereafter, the sections were immersed in TRAP reagent for 30 minutes at 37°C. In the histomorphometry analysis for TRAP staining, we used the primary spongiosa for the trabecular ROI because of the barely detectable in the secondary spongiosa of OVX model.

<title>Dynamic bone histomorphometric analysis</title>
<p>To conduct dynamic histomorphometry analysis, we injected the mice with 25 mg/kg body weight of calcein (Sigma-Aldrich) or Alizarin Red S (Sigma-Aldrich) intraperitoneally before sacrifice, with 3- or 10-day intervals between injections as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Briefly, femurs or vertebrates were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution for 24 hours at 4°C. The following day, the samples were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution and then dehydrated using a gradient of ethanol (50 %, 70 %, 85 %, 90 %, and 100 %). Subsequently, we embedded the dehydrated femurs or vertebrates in methyl methacrylate (Sigma) to prepare resin blocks. The resin blocks were sectioned at 6 μm thick by using a Leica SP1600 microtome (Leica Microsystems, Germany). The fluorescence signals of calcein (green) and Alizarin Red S (red) from ROIs were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). For vertebral bone analysis, bone mineralization was evaluated by von Kossa staining. The sections were placed in 2-methoxyethyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes, followed by rehydration with serial ethanol solutions (100 %, 90 %, 80 %, 70 %, and 50 %) and distilled water for 2 minutes each. The sections were subsequently dipped in a 1 % AgNO<sub>3</sub> solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 minutes under ultraviolet (UV) light photons, washed in distilled water for 5 minutes, and dipped in 5 % sodium thiosulfate solution for 5 minutes to remove nonspecific binding. Finally, we covered the sections with mounting solution and captured images by using a Leica microscope. The parameters of dynamic bone histomorphometry were analyzed using the Bioquant Osteo 2019ME program (Bioquant Osteo, Nashville, TN, USA).</p>

<p>This work investigates the functional difference between the most commonly expressed form of PTH, and a mutant form of PTH, identified in a patient with chronic hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia which characterizes hypoparathyroidism. The authors investigate the hypothesis that this mutant PTH assumes a dimeric form in vivo and serves anabolic functions in the bone. The data are <bold>compelling</bold> and the translational aspects are <bold>fundamental</bold> in understanding PTH-1 Receptor activation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors investigate the functional difference between the most commonly expressed form of PTH, and a novel point mutation in PTH identified in a patient with chronic hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The value of this mutant form of PTH as a potential anabolic agent for bone is investigated alongside PTH(1-84), which is a current anabolic therapy. The authors have achieved the aims of the study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is novel, as it describes the function of a novel, naturally occurring, variant of PTH in terms of its ability to dimerise, to lead to cAMP activation, to increase serum calcium, and its pharmacological action compared to normal PTH.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions: No further recommendations for revisions. Acceptable as the paper stands.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors investigate the functional difference between the most commonly expressed form of PTH, and a novel point mutation in PTH identified in a patient with chronic hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The value of this mutant form of PTH as a potential anabolic agent for bone is investigated alongside PTH(1-84), which is a current anabolic therapy. The authors have achieved the aims of the study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is novel, as it describes the function of a novel, naturally occurring, variant of PTH in terms of its ability to dimerise, to lead to cAMP activation, to increase serum calcium, and its pharmacological action compared to normal PTH.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>(1) In your response to the reviewers you included a figure. You said it was for the reviewers only. We are *not* including it here. Is that correct or should it be in the Public Reviews?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion and appreciate your thorough review. The phrase “data only for reviewers” was intended to indicate that the content was included in the revision based on reviewers’ comments, not in the main text (article). However, we acknowledge that this phrasing may be inappropriate. We are agree to make the figure included in the previous author response of the public reviews. Accordingly, we propose to revise the previous author response as follows:</p>
<p>- Remove &quot;(data only for reviewers)&quot;.</p>
<p>-  Correct the typo from &quot;perosteal&quot; to &quot;periosteal&quot;.</p>
<p>- “Thank you for your comment. First, we ensured that the bones sampled during the experiment showed no defects, and we carefully separated the femur bones from the mice to preserve their integrity. In the 3-point bending test, PTH treatment significantly increased the maximum load of the femur bone compared to the OVX-control group. Additionally, the maximum load in the PTH treatment group was significantly greater than that observed in the PTH dimer group. Furthermore, structural factors influencing bone strength, such as the periosteal perimeter and the endocortical bone perimeter, were also increased in the PTH treatment group compared to the PTH dimer group.”</p>

<p>(2) Do you mean to always have R<sup>0</sup> (have a superscript) and RG (never have a superscript) or should they be shown in the same way throughout your paper?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thorough review. Based on previous studies that addressed the conformation of PTH1R, R<sup>0</sup> is typically shown with a superscript, while RG is not (Hoare et al., 2001; Dean et al., 2006; Okazaki et al., 2008). We have followed this notation and will ensure consistency throughout our paper.</p>
