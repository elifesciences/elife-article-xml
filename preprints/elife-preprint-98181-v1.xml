<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Reactive astrocytes play critical roles in the occurrence of various neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Activation of astrocytes is often accompanied by a glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch. However, the role and molecular mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in activation of astrocytes have not been clarified. Here, we found that PKM2, a notoriously known rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, displayed nuclear translocation in astrocytes of EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Prevention of PKM2 nuclear import by DASA-58 significantly reduced the activation of primary astrocytes, which was observed by decreased proliferation, glycolysis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, we identified the ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear import by ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. TRIM21 interacted with PKM2, promoted its nuclear translocation and stimulated its nuclear activity to phosphorylate STAT3, NF-κB and interact with c-myc. Further single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that TRIM21 expression was upregulated in astrocytes of EAE. TRIM21 overexpressing in primary astrocytes enhanced PKM2-dependent glycolysis and proliferation, which could be reversed by DASA-58. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of a lentiviral vector to knockdown TRIM21 in astrocytes or intraperitoneal injection of TEPP-46, which inhibit the nuclear translocation of PKM2, effectively decreased disease severity, CNS inflammation and demyelination in EAE. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the pathological function of nuclear glycolytic enzyme PKM2 and ubiquitination-mediated regulatory mechanism that are involved in astrocyte activation. Targeting this axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of astrocyte-involved neurological disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which accounts for the leading cause of neurological disability in young adults. The hallmarks of this disease is varied and complex, ranging from astrocyte proliferation, microglia activation, neuroinflammation and damage to myelin sheaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kuhlmann et al., 2023</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests the critical roles of neurons in MS pathology. However, with the deepening of research, local glia cells have been shown to potentiate inflammation and lead to neurodegeneration, among which astrocytes have attracted much attention with their diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Lee et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glia cells and provide physical, structural and metabolic support for neurons. Astrocytes respond to CNS diseases through a process of activation that encompasses cell proliferation, morphological, molecular and functional modifications. This phenomenon, also termed reactive astrocyte or astrogliosis, results in loss of brain homeostatic functions and leads to the occurrence of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Verkhratsky et al., 2023</xref>). The presence of activated astrocytes which is evidenced by increased GFAP staining, was found before immune cell infiltration in MS and its animal model, EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Correale and Farez, 2015</xref>). Several lines of evidence bolster the conception that activated astrocytes are considered to be early events and contributors to lesion development in MS and EAE etiopathology (das Neves et al., 2021). With the accepted notion of astrocyte contributions to MS or EAE, mounting interest has been focused on dissecting how astrocytes are reactive.</p>
<p>Activated immune cells, like cancer cells, require higher biosynthetic and energy needs for immune response, proliferation and survival. This involves reprogramming of their metabolic pathways. Proinflammatory immune cells, including reactive astrocytes, usually undergo a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to Warburg-type glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Vaupel and Multhoff, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, elevated level of aerobic glycolysis have been characterized in astrocyte of MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Afzal et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Nijland et al., 2015</xref>). Elevated glycolysis is crucial for sustaining astrocyte proliferation, the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and neurotrophic factors and subsequent neuronal loss in the CNS. As such, deciphering glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch in astrocytes is the basis for understanding astrogliosis and the development of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, is a key molecule that governs aerobic glycolysis. Low glycolytic enzyme activity of PKM2 promotes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which leads to aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). In the cytoplasm, PKM2 exists in tetrameric form and possesses high pyruvate kinase activity. Specifically, PKM2 can translocate to the nucleus in its dimeric form. With a low-glycolytic function, nuclear PKM2 can act as a protein kinase or transcriptional coactivator to regulate proliferation, inflammation and metabolic reprogramming of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The overexpression and nuclear translocation of PKM2 have been well documented in CNS disease. Moreover, nuclear PKM2 was upregulated in neutrophils and macrophages in patients with ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dhanesha and Patel, 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Nuclear PKM2 in neurons was shown to promote neuronal loss in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Traxler et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that PKM2 is a key player in the development of neurological disease. Although previous studies have suggested that PKM2 could regulate astrocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), its potential function in astrocyte metabolic reprogramming and the upstream mechanisms underlying PKM2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling are still elusive.</p>
<p>In this report, we identified TRIM21 as the interacting protein of PKM2 and found that TRIM21 promoted the nuclear translocation of PKM2, thus contributing to astrocyte glycolysis and proliferation in EAE. Most importantly, we used the EAE model to demonstrate that targeting TRIM21-PKM2 axis alleviated the disease process.</p>
<p>Our finding might help to understand the mechanism underlying astrocyte activation in neurological diseases and provide therapeutic target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</p>

<title>Identification of PKM2 nuclear translocation in astrocytes during EAE</title>
<p>To investigate whether PKM2 repositioning or aberrant expression drives astrocyte dysfunction in EAE mice, we obtained tissue samples from the spinal cords of different phases of EAE and control mice. Nuclear translocation of PKM2 was initially observed at the onset phase, which sustained to the peak and chronic phases of the disease. Compared to the cytoplasmic localization of PKM2 in control mice, the expression level of PKM2 was elevated in different phases of EAE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-stimulated splenocytes from EAE mice were previously shown to mimic MS pathology and are frequently used as an in vitro autoimmune model to investigate MS and EAE pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Kozela et al., 2015</xref>). To validate the expression pattern of PKM2 in astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic>, primary astrocytes were isolated and cultured with supernatants from MOG<sub>35-55</sub>-stimulated splenocytes (MOG<sub>sup</sub>) of EAE. Activated astrocytes were observed following co-culture with the above-mentioned supernatant, showing obviously increased expression of GFAP, a marker of reactive astrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Consistently, compared with those in control astrocytes, nuclear ratio and expression of PKM2 were significantly greater in MOG<sub>sup</sub>-stimulated astrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C and D</xref>). Together, these data demonstrated the nuclear translocation of PKM2 in astrocytes from EAE mice.</p>

<title>Prevention of PKM2 nuclear transport suppresses aerobic glycolysis and proliferation in astrocytes</title>
<p>Metabolic switch of astrocytes to aerobic glycolysis and proliferation of astrocytes are early events in MS and EAE. To explore the contribution of PKM2 nuclear translocation to the alternation of astrocyte metabolism and function, DASA-58, the inhibitor of PKM2 nuclear transport that favors its tetramerization was used. Pretreatment with DASA-58 effectively reduced the nuclear ratio of PKM2 in MOG<sub>sup</sub> stimulated astrocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and B</xref>). As expected, MOG<sub>sup</sub> stimulation, which mimics the autoimmune response in MS patients, induced an increase in the glycolytic activity of astrocytes, as evidenced by glucose consumption and lactate production. However, these effects were significantly counteracted by DASA-58 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). To further confirm these result, glycolysis-related enzymes and transcription factors including LDHA, PKM2 and c-myc were examined. Among these proteins, DASA-58 pretreatment severely impaired the upregulation of phosphorylated c-myc induced by MOG<sub>sup</sub> stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To determine whether DASA-58 could alter astrocyte proliferation, CCK-8 and EdU assays were performed. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> showed that treatment with 25 μM and 50 μM DASA-58 impaired the proliferation of astrocytes, and 50 μM owned better effect. Additionally, EdU incorporation assays showed that 50 μM DASA-58 mostly abrogated the MOG<sub>sup</sub>-induced astrocyte proliferation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F and G</xref>). In addition, DASA-58 pretreatment reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α and iNOS in MOG<sub>sup</sub>-stimulated astrocytes (Fig. S1). From the above results we can conclude that abrogation of PKM2 nuclear transport can markedly decrease the proliferation and glycolysis of astrocytes.</p>

<title>Nuclear PKM2 promotes the activation of NF-κB and STAT3 pathways</title>
<p>Upon nuclear translocation, PKM2 acquires protein kinase and transcriptional coactivator activities. As nuclear PKM2 has been reported to interact with STAT3 and NF-κB, which are dominant signaling pathways involved in orchestrating cell proliferation, inflammation and glycolysis, we were curious to investigate whether nuclear PKM2 regulates the activation of these two pathways. The activation of STAT3 and NF-κB requires two critical steps: phosphorylation of key components, nuclear translocation and retention of STAT3 or p65/p50 subunits. As expected, DASA-58 pretreatment partially attenuated the phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-κB pathways following MOG<sub>sup</sub> stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). Phosphorylation only contributes to the transient activation of STAT3 and NF-κB, and constant activation also requires the nuclear retention of STAT3 and p50/p65. To test our hypothesis that nuclear PKM2 might promote the retention of p50/p65 and STAT3, we purified nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Western blotting assays showed that inhibiting PKM2 nuclear localization with DASA-58 suppressed the nuclear retention of p50/p65 and STAT3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>

(C) Western blotting analysis showed that DASA-58 inhibited the activation of NF-κB and STAT3 induced by MOG<sub>sup</sub> stimulation. (D) Nuclear-cytoplasmic protein extraction analysis showed the reduced nuclear fraction of STAT3 and p50/p65 upon DASA-58 treatment. (E) Immunoprecipitation demonstrated the interaction between PKM2 and STAT3, c-myc and p50/p65 subunits of NF-κB.

<p>To further clarify the mechanism by which PKM2 regulated the nuclear retention of STAT3 and NF-κB, immunoprecipitation was performed. The results verified that endogenous PKM2 could directly bind to NF-κB subunits p50/p65 and STAT3 in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Therefore, nuclear PKM2 interacts with p50/p65 and STAT3, favoring their nuclear retention and constant activation of NF-κB and STAT3 pathways.</p>

<title>E3 ligase TRIM21 interacts with PKM2 in astrocytes</title>
<p>With deepening of the research, amounting evidences support that post-translational modifications (PTMs), representing by ubiquitination, acetylation, sumoylation and phosphorylation are major mechanisms to regulate the process of PKM2 nuclear translocation. To illustrate underlying mechanism accounting for nuclear translocation of PKM2 in astrocytes, mass spectrometry combined with immunoprecipitation of PKM2 were performed. Several enzymes involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis including ENO1, ALDOA, MDH2, LDHA and LDHC were identified to be interacted with PKM2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Analysis of biological processes according to Gene Ontology (GO) terms confirmed that the binding proteins of PKM2 are enriched in metabolic processes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Moreover, the results of KEGG and Wikipathway enrichment analysis indicate that PKM2-interacting proteins were enriched in glycolysis, glucogeogenesis and NF-κB pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Amongst these potential interacting proteins, the most attracting one is TRIM21, an E3 ligase involved in the process of ubiquitination (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Coincidentally, we previously reported the proinflammatory role of TRIM21 in keratinocytes by ubiquitylating the p50/p65 subunits of NF-κB(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). We were curious to verify whether TRIM21 interacted with and regulated the subcellular localization of PKM2 in astrocytes. Molecular docking revealed a strong binding affinity between PKM2 and TRIM21 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, left). TRIM21 is bound to PKM2 via hydrogen bonds between the amino acids of the two molecules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, right). By immunoprecipitation assays, we demonstrated the endogenous binding of PKM2 with TRIM21 in primary astrocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). To further confirm the results of PKM2-TRIM21 interaction, plasmids of Myc-tagged TRIM21 and Flag-tagged PKM2 were constructed. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation with either Myc or Flag antibodies verified exogenous binding between PKM2 and TRIM21 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). To map the binding domains between PKM2 and TRIM21, a series of truncation with deletion (Δ) of various domains of TRIM21 and PKM2 were constructed. The deletion of C-terminal PRY-SPRY domain abolished the binding between TRIM21 to PKM2, which indicated that PRY-SPRY domain of TRIM21 was responsible for the interaction with PKM2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). However, the deletion of either N- or C-terminal of PKM2 did not affect the binding between TRIM21 to PKM2, indicating that AB domain (44 to 388 amino acids) of PKM2 might interact with TRIM21 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>).</p>

<title>Upregulated TRIM21 expression in astrocytes of EAE mice and in activated primary astrocytes</title>
<p>Previous studies have documented upregulated expression of TRIM21 in various types of cancers. Moreover, our previous study is the first to uncover the upregulation of TRIM21 in the epidermis of psoriatic patients, an autoimmune skin disease characterized by hyperproliferation of epidermal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Yang et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). To determine the relative expression of TRIM21 in astrocytes of EAE mice, we firstly performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on brain samples from the control, EAE peak and chronic stages. ScRNA-seq analysis revealed differential expression of TRIM21 in multiple cell populations. Compared to that in other cell types, TRIM21 expression in astrocytes was relatively high (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We identified 12 astrocyte subpopulations, whereas TRIM21 expression was divergent in different astrocyte clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Most importantly, TRIM21 expression was augmented in astrocytes in both peak and chronic phases of EAE compared to that in control mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Consistently, bioinformatic analysis of the GEO database (GSE136358) revealed significant elevation of TRIM21 expression in astrocytes at the onset, peak and chronic phases of EAE disease (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>

<p>To further confirm the results of TRIM21 expression from scRNA-seq and GEO datasets, activated astrocytes were mimicked by stimulating primary astrocytes with MOG<sub>sup</sub>.

Moreover, immunofluorescence staining further demonstrated that TRIM21 expression was greater in astrocytes from EAE mice when compared with control mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>).

<title>TRIM21 ubiquitylates and promotes the nuclear translocation of PKM2</title>
<p>Ubiquitination is endowed with multifaceted function to regulate degradation, localization and activation of substrate proteins. As PKM2 has been demonstrated to be the interacting protein and substrate of TRIM21, we next examined the impact of TRIM21 on PKM2 localization. Overexpression of TRIM21 induced a robust increase in the nuclear ratio of PKM2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, Fig. S2A). In contrast, knockdown of TRIM21 led to a reduction in the nuclear ratio of PKM2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, Fig. S2B). To a greater extent, TRIM21 was found to be a potent driver of PKM2 translocation in astrocytes of EAE. To deeply unveil the mechanism of TRIM21-mediated binding with PKM2, the ubiquitination linkage type was investigated. In addition to K48-linked ubiquitination, which directs proteins for degradation, K63-linked ubiquitination is implicated in the regulation of protein localization and activation. Immunoprecipitation implied that K63-linked ubiquitination of PKM2 was enhanced upon overexpression of TRIM21 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Collectively, the data showed that TRIM21 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of PKM2 and facilitated its nuclear translocation in astrocytes.</p>

<title>TRIM21 promotes aerobic glycolysis and proliferation by enhancing PKM2 nuclear function in astrocytes</title>
<p>As TRIM21 promoted the nuclear translocation of PKM2, we explored the impact of TRIM21 on the nuclear function of PKM2. Our results showed that the levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and p65 were significantly increased upon TRIM21 overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). We next examined whether TRIM21 could affect the binding of PKM2 to c-myc, STAT3 and NF-κB subunits. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, overexpression of TRIM21 promoted the binding of PKM2 to c-myc, STAT3 and p50 subunit of NF-κB. Nuclear PKM2 contributed to nuclear retention of STAT3 and NF-κB, which retained the constant activation of these two signaling pathways. We were curious to investigate whether TRIM21 is involved in this process. Notably, fractionation analysis revealed that overexpression of TRIM21 increased the nuclear accumulation of c-myc, STAT3 and p50/p65 subunits. Conversely, pretreatment with DASA-58, which abrogated the nuclear translocation of PKM2, diminished the nuclear retention of the aforementioned transcription factors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). These findings revealed that the TRIM21-mediated nuclear translocation of PKM2 promoted its nuclear function.</p>
<p>To further assess the functional consequences of TRIM21-mediated nuclear translocation of PKM2, the glycolytic activity and proliferation of astrocytes were measured. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, TRIM21 overexpression increased the ratio of EdU positive cells. However, the increase in astrocyte proliferation caused by TRIM21 upregulation was significantly antagonized by the DASA-58 treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Similarly, upregulated TRIM21 promoted lactate production and glucose consumption, which were reversed by DASA-58 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). In summary, our results indicate that nuclear PKM2-mediated metabolic reprogramming is crucial for TRIM21-stimulated proliferation of astrocytes.</p>

<title>TRIM21 knockdown in astrocyte or TEPP-46 treatment inhibits the development of EAE</title>
<p>To determine the therapeutic effect of TRIM21 knockdown in astrocytes on EAE, shTRIM21 and control lentivirus were given to mice by intracerebroventricular administration at disease onset (15 days post immunization). As expected, shTRIM21 treatment suppressed disease severity of EAE. At the end time point at day 22 p.i., shTRIM21-treated group showed reduced disease scores, although no statistical difference was observed compared to control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). To further measure the effect of TRIM21 knockdown in astrocytes on pathological changes in EAE mice, HE and LFB staining were performed. As expected, inflammation and demyelination were less pronounced in shTRIM21-treated group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Staining for TRIM21 showed that TRIM21 expression was reduced in astrocytes after intracerebroventricular injection of shTRIM21 lentivirus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Demyelination lesions were also evaluated by myelin basic protein (MBP) staining. Knockdown of TRIM21 in astrocytes significantly increased MBP positive areas, which indicated the inhibited demyelination in shTRIM21-treated group compared with control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). In EAE, microglia and astrocyte activation are linked with demyelination, we next stained GFAP and IBA1 to measure the activation of astrocytes and microglia. Knocking down TRIM21 in astrocytes decreased GFAP expression on spinal cord sections. The decrease of GFAP<sup>+</sup> cell numbers was observed in both gray and white matter from shTRIM21-treated mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>).

<p>Therapeutic potential of PKM2 nuclear translocation inhibition with TEPP-46 was also tested in the EAE model. TEPP-46 is an allosteric activator that blocks the nuclear translocation of PKM2 by promoting its tetramerization. Intraperitoneal treatment with TEPP-46 during prevention stage resulted in decreased disease severity (Fig. S3A). TEPP-46-treated mice exhibited reduced inflammation and demyelination (Fig. S3B-S3E). The activation of GFAP positive astrocytes and IBA1 positive microglia were correspondingly reduced in TEPP-46-treated mice (Fig. S3D and S3E). Taken together, these results showed that TRIM21 deficiency in astrocytes or prevention of PKM2 nuclear translocation substantially inhibited inflammation and myelin depletion in EAE mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Reactive astrocytes, or astrocyte activation are recognized as common feathers of CNS pathology, including neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Patani et al., 2023</xref>). Preferential metabolic switch toward aerobic glycolysis favors astrocyte transfer from “resting” to “reactive” state. Thus, deciphering the mechanism responsible for astrocyte metabolic switch in response to neurological disease will provide new insights and new therapeutic targets for CNS diseases. Previous studies have detected nuclear translocation of PKM2 in astrocytes after spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) and in a chronic inflammatory pain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Wei et al., 2020</xref>), in which the regulatory effect of PKM2 on aerobic glycolysis and proliferation has been indicated. However, in EAE model of multiple sclerosis, whether PKM2 nuclear translocation can be observed in astrocytes and the causal mechanisms involved are still unclarified. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to document the nuclear translocation of PKM2 in astrocytes of EAE. Furthermore, we clarified a ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear transport. Our newly identified upregulated expression of E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 in astrocytes from EAE mice promotes the nuclear translocation of PKM2 to further activate astrocytes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p>

<p>Among the PTMs that regulate expression and localization of PKM2, phosphorylation is the most frequently reported type, it remains less well known whether ubiquitination could be a potential player. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of PKM2 has been reported. Recently, in ovarian cancer, E3 ligase CHIP was shown to directly interact with PKM2 and mediate its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Shang et al., 2017</xref>). TRIM family E3 ligase TRIM35 was previously shown to mediate the degradation of PKM2 in cardiomyocytes and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lorenzana-Carrillo et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Wu et al.,2022</xref>). Although laforin/malin E3 ligase-induced ubiquitination of PKM2 did not lead to its degradation, ubiquitination in this case impaired its nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Viana et al., 2015</xref>). Different from these findings, it should be emphasized that our study adds to the current knowledge that ubiquitination, in addition to SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>) and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), could induce the relocalization of PKM2 in the nucleus.</p>
<p>TRIM21 is found in our study to interact with and ubiquitylate PKM2. As a traditional E3 ubiquitin ligase, multiple key molecules involved in metabolism, immunity and inflammation have been recognized as substrates of TRIM21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to the well-known function of TRIM21 in inflammation, an increasing number of studies have suggested that TRIM21 plays a regulatory role in glucose metabolism. Glycolytic-related enzymes including PFK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Tang et al., 2022</xref>), GLUT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Gu et al., 2022</xref>) and glycolysis-related transcription factor HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) were identified to be substrates of TRIM21, and TRIM21 mediated the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of these proteins, thereby inhibiting aerobic glycolysis. Hereby, we recognized PKM2 as a substrate of TRIM21. The fate of the ubiquitinated protein varies greatly, depending on the linkage type present in the ubiquitin chain. Here, we found that TRIM21 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of PKM2, the second common type of linkage that is typically not associated with protein degradation. These findings imply that enzymes and proteins implicated in glycolysis are potential substrates of TRIM21, further suggesting that TRIM21 as a regulator of glycolysis. The limitation of the current study is the lack of mechanistic insight into the signaling pathways resulting in TRIM21 upregulation in EAE. Future studies are needed to investigate whether TRIM21 is also elevated in other CNS diseases.</p>
<p>Although our study shed light on the role of PKM2 in astrocytes, whether PKM2 functions in a cell-specific manner or acts as a generalist warrants further studies. For example, microglia activation is a key step that contributes to CNS disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Long et al., 2024</xref>). Activated M1 microglial cells exhibit a metabolic switch toward aerobic glycolysis similar to that of astrocytes. Thus, it is highly possible that PKM2 may also be involved in microglia metabolic change and activation. As such, PKM2 might be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of CNS disease. However, further studies are needed to decipher the role of nuclear localized PKM2 in different cells under pathological conditions to provide a thorough understanding of the biological functions of PKM2.</p>
<p>In addition to identifying the contribution of TRIM21 to PKM2 nuclear translocation and TRIM21-PKM2 axis in promoting astrocyte glycolysis and proliferation, the therapeutic effect of TRIM21 in EAE was also tested. By using lentivirus with astrocyte-specific GFAP promoter, the knockdown of TRIM21 in astrocytes has been successfully achieved. This approach by using lentivirus to deliver shRNA into astrocytes has been previously reported by our group, in which shAct1 lentivirus showed potency for the treatment of EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Yan et al., 2012</xref>). In the presented study, we showed that blocking TRIM21 pathway effectively ameliorated disease severity of EAE, which is evidenced by the reduced inflammation, demyelination, activation of astrocytes and microglia. Moreover, we have tested the effect of blocking PKM2 nuclear translocation with TEPP-46. Although TEPP-46 has been shown to inhibit T cell activation in EAE development, its effect on CNS inflammation has not been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Angiari et al., 2020</xref>). We found that TEPP-46 treatment also reduced inflammatory infiltration and demyelination of the white matter. Moreover, a reduced activation of microglia and astrocytes was also observed in TEPP-46-treated group. Our in vivo results suggested that targeting TRIM21-PKM2 is a promising approach for clinical treatment of multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study revealed that PKM2 nuclear translocation is the key mechanism accounting for glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch and proliferation of astrocytes. We propose a post-translational modification mechanism for the regulation of PKM2 nuclear translocation by the ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. From the perspective of metabolism, our study provides a rationale for targeting glycolysis metabolism to ameliorate astrocyte-mediated CNS diseases.</p>

<title>Cell proliferation assays</title>
<p>Cells were plated at a density of 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> per well and cultured overnight. After treatment, the proliferation of astrocytes was assessed by an EdU-488 or EdU-594 cell proliferation detection kit (Beyotime, C0071S and C0078S). For Cell Counting Kit-8 analysis, cells were seeded separately in each 96-well plate and cultured for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h respectively. 1 h before the endpoint of incubation, 10 μl CCK-8 reagent was added, OD<sub>450nm</sub> value was determined by Infinite F50 (Tecan) microplate reader.</p>

<title>Protein extraction and western blotting</title>
<p>Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer supplemented with proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Topscience, Shanghai, China). Whole cell lysates were obtained after centrifugation. Nuclear protein was extracted using Nuclear and cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein concentrations were determined by using a BCA kit, and then subjected to western blotting. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. After being blocked for 2h in 5% skim-milk buffer, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: antibodies against PKM2 (1:5000, 60268-1-Ig, Proteintech), phospho-c-myc (1:500, ET1609-64, Huabio), c-myc (1:1000, CPA1778, Cohesion Biosciences), LDHA (1:1000, ET1608-57, Huabio), STAT3 (1:5000, 60199-1-Ig, Proteintech), phospho-STAT3 (1:1000, bs-1658R, Bioss), phospho-p65 (1:1000, GB113882-100, Servicebio), p65 (1:1000, CPA2000, Cohesion Biosciences), phospho-IKK(1:1000, bs-3237R, Bioss), IKK (1:1000, GB11292-1-100, ServiceBio), Lamin (1:1000 CPA1693, Cohesion Biosciences), Tubulin (11224-1-AP, Proteintech), Flag (1:1000, AE004, Abclonal), Myc (1:3000, AE010, Abclonal), TRIM21 (1:1000, 12108-1-AP, Proteintech), and β-actin (1:2000, GB12001-100, ServiceBio). Membranes were then washed and probed with HRP conjugated secondary antibodies. Membranes were visualized with ECL detection system (Tanon 4600, Shanghai, China).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work describes the activation of astrocytes via the nuclear translocation of PKM2 in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. This study provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence of the interaction between TRIM21 and PKM2 as the crucial molecular event leading to the translocation of PKM2 and a metabolic shift towards glycolysis dominance, fostering proliferation in stimulated astrocytes. This finding is significant as it underscores the potential of targeting glycolytic metabolism to mitigate neurological diseases mediated by astrocytes, offering a strong rationale for potential therapeutic interventions. However, control experiments and imaging analyses with higher magnification images should be performed to better support the main claims of the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Yang, Hu et al. examined the molecular mechanisms underlying astrocyte activation and its implications for multiple sclerosis. This study shows that the glycolytic enzyme PKM2 relocates to astrocyte nuclei upon activation in EAE mice. Inhibiting PKM2's nuclear import reduces astrocyte activation, as evidenced by decreased proliferation, glycolysis, and inflammatory cytokine release. Crucially, the study identifies TRIM21 as pivotal in regulating PKM2 nuclear import via ubiquitination. TRIM21 interacts with PKM2, promoting its nuclear translocation and enhancing its activity, affecting multiple signaling pathways. Confirmatory analyses using single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence demonstrate TRIM21 upregulation in EAE astrocytes. Modulating TRIM21 expression in primary astrocytes impacts PKM2-dependent glycolysis and proliferation. In vivo experiments targeting this mechanism effectively mitigate disease severity, CNS inflammation, and demyelination in EAE.</p>
<p>The authors supported their claims with various experimental approaches, however, some results should be supported with higher-quality images clearly depicting the conclusions and additional quantitative analyses of Western blots.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the function and molecular mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in the activation of astrocytes, a critical aspect of various neurological diseases, especially multiple sclerosis. The study uses the EAE mouse model, which closely resembles MS. This makes the results relevant and potentially translational. The research clarifies how TRIM21 regulates the nuclear import of PKM2 through ubiquitination by integrating advanced techniques. Targeting this axis may have therapeutic benefits since lentiviral vector-mediated knockdown of TRIM21 in vivo significantly reduces disease severity, CNS inflammation, and demyelination in EAE animals.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors reported that PKM2 levels are elevated in the nucleus of astrocytes at different EAE phases compared to cytoplasmic localization. However, Figure 1 also shows elevated cytoplasmic expression of PKM2. The authors should clarify the nuclear localization of PKM2 by providing zoomed-in images. An explanation for the increased cytoplasmic PKM2 expression should provided. Similarly, while PKM2 translocation is inhibited by DASA-58, in addition to its nuclear localization, a decrease in the cytoplasmic localization of PKM2 is also observed. This situation brings to mind the possibility of a degradation mechanism being involved when its nuclear translocation of PKM2 is inhibited.</p>
<p>In Figure 3D, the authors claim that PKM2 expression causes nuclear retention of STAT3, p65, and p50, and inhibiting PKM2 localization with DASA-58 suppresses this retention. The western blot results for the MOG-stimulated group show high levels of STAT3, p50, and p65 in nuclear localization. However, in the MOG and DASA-58 treated group, one would expect high levels of p50, p65, and STAT3 proteins in the cytoplasm, while their levels decrease in the nucleus. These western blot results could be expanded. Additionally, intensity quantification for these results would be beneficial to see the statistical difference in their expressions, especially to observe the nuclear localization of PKM2.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between Figure 7A and its explaining text is confusing. The expectation from the knocking down of TRIM21 is the amelioration of activated astrocytes, leading to a decrease in inflammation and the disease state. The presented results support these expectations, while the images showing demyelination in EAE animals are not highly supportive. Clearly labeling demyelinated areas would enhance readers' understanding of the important impact of TRIM21 knockdown on reducing the disease severity.</p>

<p>This study significantly advances our understanding of the metabolic reprogramming underlying astrocyte activation in neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. By employing an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model, the authors discovered a notable nuclear translocation of PKM2, a key enzyme in glycolysis, within astrocytes.</p>
<p>Preventing this nuclear import via DASA 58 substantially attenuated primary astrocyte activation, characterized by reduced proliferation, glycolysis, and inflammatory cytokine secretion.</p>
<p>
Moreover, the authors uncovered a novel regulatory mechanism involving the ubiquitin ligase TRIM21, which mediates PKM2 nuclear import. TRIM21 interaction with PKM2 facilitated its nuclear translocation, enhancing its activity in phosphorylating STAT3, NFκB, and c-myc. Single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining further supported the upregulation of TRIM21 expression in astrocytes during EAE.</p>
<p>Manipulating this pathway, either through TRIM21 overexpression in primary astrocytes or knockdown of TRIM21 in vivo, had profound effects on disease severity, CNS inflammation, and demyelination in EAE mice. This comprehensive study provides invaluable insights into the pathological role of nuclear PKM2 and the ubiquitination-mediated regulatory mechanism driving astrocyte activation.</p>
<p>The author's use of diverse techniques, including single-cell RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence staining, and lentiviral vector knockdown, underscores the robustness of their findings and interpretations. Ultimately, targeting this PKM2-TRIM21 axis emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy for neurological diseases involving astrocyte dysfunction.</p>
<p>While the strengths of this piece of work are undeniable, some concerns could be addressed to refine its impact and clarity further; as outlined in the recommendations for the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is a rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis and its translocation to the nucleus in astrocytes in various nervous system pathologies has been associated with a metabolic switch to glycolysis which is a sign of reactive astrogliosis. The authors investigated whether this occurs in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAA), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). They show that in EAA, PKM2 is ubiquitinated by TRIM21 and transferred to the nucleus in astrocytes. Inhibition of TRIM21-PKM2 axis efficiently blocks reactive gliosis and partially alleviates symptoms of EAA. Authors conclude that this axis can be a potential new therapeutic target in the treatment of MS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is well-designed, controls are appropriate and a comprehensive battery of experiments has been successfully performed. Results of in vitro assays, single-cell RNA sequencing, immunoprecipitation, RNA interference, molecular docking, and in vivo modeling etc. complement and support each other.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Though EAA is a valid model of MS, a proposed new therapeutic strategy based on this study needs to have support from human studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report the role of the Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2) enzyme nuclear translocation as fundamental in the activation of astrocytes in a model of autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). They show that astrocytes, activated through culturing in EAE splenocytes medium, increase their nuclear PKM2 with consequent activation of NFkB and STAT3 pathways. Prevention of PKM2 nuclear translocation decreases astrocyte counteracts this activation. The authors found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 interacts with PKM2 and promotes its nuclear translocation. In vivo, either silencing of TRIM21 or inhibition of PKM2 nuclear translocation ameliorates the severity of the disease in the EAE model.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work contributes to the knowledge of the complex action of the PKM2 enzyme in the context of an autoimmune-neurological disease, highlighting its nuclear role and a novel partner, TRIM21, and thus adding a novel rationale for therapeutic targeting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the relevance of the work and its goals, some of the conclusions drawn would require more thorough proof:</p>
<p>I believe that the major weakness is the fact that TRIM21 is known to have per se many roles in autoimmune and immune pathways and some of the effects observed might be due to a PKM2-independent action. Some of the experiments to link the two proteins, besides their interaction, do not completely clarify the issue. On top of that, the in vivo experiments address the role of TRIM21 and the nuclear localisation of PKM2 independently, thus leaving the matter unsolved.</p>
<p>Some experimental settings are not described to a level that is necessary to fully understand the data, especially for a non-expert audience: e.g. the EAE model and MOG treatment; action and reference of the different nuclear import inhibitors; use of splenocyte culture medium and the possible effect of non-EAE splenocytes.</p>
<p>The statement that PKM2 is a substrate of TRIM21 ubiquitin ligase activity is an overinterpretation. There is no evidence that this interaction results in ubiquitin modification of PKM2; the ubiquitination experiment is minimal and is not performed in conditions that would allow us to see ubiquitination of PKM2 (e.g. denaturing conditions, reciprocal pull-down, catalytically inactive TRIM21, etc.).</p>
