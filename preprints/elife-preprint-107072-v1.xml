<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Many biological processes emerge as frequency-dependent responses to trains of external stimuli. Heart rhythm disturbances, i.e. cardiac arrhythmias, are important examples as they are often triggered by specific patterns of preceding stimuli. In this study, we investigated how ectopic arrhythmias can be induced by external stimuli in cardiac tissue containing a localised area of depolarisation. Using optogenetic <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments and <italic>in silico</italic> modelling, we systematically explored the dynamics of these arrhythmias, which are characterized by local oscillatory activity, by gradually altering the degree of depolarization in a predefined region. Our findings reveal a bi-stable system, in which transitions between oscillatory ectopic activity and a quiescent state can be precisely controlled, i.e. by adjusting the number and frequency of propagating waves through the depolarized area oscillations could be turned on or off. These frequency-dependent responses arise from collective mechanisms involving stable, non-self-oscillatory cells, contrasting with the typical role of self-oscillations in individual units within biophysical systems. To further generalize these findings, we demonstrated similar frequency selectivity and bi-stability in a simplified reaction-diffusion model. This suggests that complex ionic cell dynamics are not required to reproduce these effects; rather, simpler non-linear systems can replicate similar behaviour, potentially extending beyond the cardiac context.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biological systems like the heart typically display complex dynamical behaviour through interactions among components such as genes, proteins, or cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dana et al. (2008)</xref>). These systems exhibit non-linear dynamics, feedback loops, and adaptability, reflecting phenomena like homeostasis, evolution, and rhythm stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Xiong and Garfinkel (2023)</xref>). Central to the framework of dynamical systems is the concept of the phase space, a multidimensional representation in which each point corresponds to a unique state of the system. In geography when a small ball rolls on a raised-relief map, a state would include the planar position, elevation, speed and acceleration of the ball.</p>
<p>Within the phase space, the long-term behaviour of a system can often be described in terms of attractors, which are subsets of the phase space that trajectories tend toward over time. Attractors can take various forms, including fixed points, periodic orbits, and chaotic sets, reflecting the rich diversity of behaviours possible in dynamical systems. By replacing the ball by local rain in the raised-relief map, rivers, lakes and other bodies of water are attractors where that rain is collected. A watershed, also known as a drainage basin, is an area of land where any rain that falls will drain into the same river, lake or body of water. Therefore they are basins of attraction. Mountain ridges are separatrices that divide the watersheds, or more formally theoretical surfaces that divide the phase space into different basins of attraction. A separatrix therefore denotes the transition between different regions of the phase space. The terminology introduced here comes back throughout our paper, with the addition of a “state”, i.e. one of the attractors in the system. When the system is not interacted with, it will stay at the same point(s) in phase space.</p>
<p>Some systems only have a single basin of attraction. However, in others the phenomenon of bi-stability emerges, where two distinct attractors coexist, each with its own basin of attraction. Bistability is a hallmark of many natural and engineered systems, from climate dynamics to neural networks, ecological models, and cardiac dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Angeli et al. (2004)</xref>). The interplay between basins in such systems can give rise to complex behaviours, making the characterization of these basins a critical component of a system’s analysis.</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the focus is on the complex system of the heart. At rest, ventricular cardiomyocytes (i.e muscle cells of the lower heart chamber) have a membrane potential of −80 to −90 <italic>mV</italic>. This resting state is an attractor of the system. When pushed out of equilibrium (e.g. due to an influx of <italic>Na</italic><sup>+</sup> ions or electrical stimulation), cardiomyocytes first depolarize and subsequently get attracted again towards the resting state by an efflux of <italic>K</italic><sup>+</sup> ions. In phase space the trajectory that gets mapped out resembles a cycle, corresponding to one heartbeat. When multiple of these cells are connected to each other, emergent behaviour can arise. Within this dynamic system of cardiomyocytes, we investigated emergent bi-stability in cell monolayers under the influence of spatial depolarization patterns. By using a train of external (electrical) waves, the system could be actively moved from one basin of attraction to another.</p>
<p>Cardiac arrhythmias are typically initiated by specific triggers, with point-source waves, i.e. ectopic waves being the most prevalent. To study ectopy in laboratory settings, control needs to be exerted over the depolarisation of cardiomyocytes. This can be achieved by optogenetics, i.e. a biological technique to control the activity of cells with light. This approach relies on the introduction of recombinant genes encoding light-activatable proteins into cells to endow them with a new biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Tan et al. (2022)</xref>). One way to depolarise a cardiomyocyte is by using mini-singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG). Upon activation with blue light, miniSOG converts molecular oxygen from its ground state (<sup>3</sup><italic>O</italic><sub>2</sub>) into highly reactive singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup><italic>O</italic><sub>2</sub>). The resulting oxidative damage induces a state of prolonged depolarisation in cardiomyocytes following electrical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Jangsangthong et al. (2016)</xref>). In such a system, it was previously observed that spatiotemporal illumination can give rise to collective behaviour and ectopic waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Teplenin et al. (2018)</xref>) originating from illuminated/depolarised regions (with high curvature). These waves resulted from the interplay between the diffusion current and the bi-stable state that was induced in the illuminated region.</p>
<p>Although miniSOG can create depolarised areas, it is difficult to control the process precisely since it depolarises cardiomyocytes through an indirect pathway. Therefore, in this manuscript, we used light-sensitive ion channels to obtain more refined control over cardiomyocyte depolarisation. These ion channels allow the cells to respond to specific wavelengths of light, facilitating either depolarization or hyperpolarisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ördög et al. (2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">2023</xref>)) through a direct pathway. By inducing cardiomyocyte depolarisation or hyperpolarisation only in the illuminated areas, optogenetics enables precise spatiotemporal control of cardiac excitability, an attribute we exploit in this manuscript (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 1</xref>). With the aid of the light-gated ion channel CheRiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hochbaum et al. (2014)</xref>), ectopic waves similar to those obtained in the miniSOG system could be elicited (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 2</xref>). Due to the superior control over depolarisation imposed by CheRiff, we uncovered new effects and unobserved behaviour related to the transition from a mono-stable cardiac system to a bi-stable one that displays periodic oscillations. This transition resulted from the interaction of an illuminated region with depolarized cardiomyocytes and an external wave train. More specifically, we found that our system displayed frequency selectivity: it oscillated only as a reaction to a specific range of inter-pulse external stimuli times. In neuroscience, this behaviour is classified as “resonance”. However, to avoid confusion with classical resonance, where the strength of the response is dependent on the input, here the phenomenon is called “induced pacemaker activity”. Evidence for this induced pacemaker activity will be presented both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Bi-stability in cardiomyocyte monolayers was realised both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> this happened through patterned illumination applied to neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) monolayers, which were optogenetically modified using the blue light-activatable cation channel CheRiff (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 1</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic>, use was made of a slightly modified (see Methods and Materials) NRVM computational model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Majumder et al. (2016)</xref>) complemented with a model for a depolarising light-gated ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Williams et al. (2013)</xref>). In both cases, the illumination pattern consisted of a rectangle of variable light intensities. After initiating a periodic wave train (of variable pulse number and interpulse interval/period) from a pacing electrode, two main outcomes and one special case were observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The first outcome was that the tissue stayed in the stationary rest state (STA). The second outcome was that the illuminated region became a pacemaker, which sent out pulses from its edges as a form of oscillatory behaviour (OSC). The special case consisted of an in-between case, in which the illuminated region only sends out a limited amount of pulses before returning to the stationary state thus showing transient oscillatory behaviour (TR. OSC). Except for the occasional mention, this last behaviour of transient oscillations will be reserved for more detailed discussion in the supplement. All light intensity-influenced monolayer behaviours are visualised together in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 3</xref>. Here, we will focus on the two main behaviours after periodic wave trains: STA and OSC. As shown below, these two behaviours can exist within the same monolayer under bi-stability and transitions from one state to the other are possible using periodic wave trains. The occurrence of this phenomenon appears to be influenced by the light intensity applied to the illuminated region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In a step-by-step manner, we unravelled the intricacies of this tissue level (i.e. collective) bi-stability between oscillatory and stationary behaviour, linking experiment to theory.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> realisation of collective light-induced bi-stability</title>
<p>To test the scope of collective bi-stability <italic>in vitro</italic>, multiple parameters were varied within our experimental set-up. The first one of these was the frequency of stimulation, visualised in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, where the number of electrical pulses and the light intensity (in the range 0.03125-0.25 <italic>mW</italic> ∕<italic>mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) were kept fixed. In every NRVM monolayer (26 biological replicates/monolayers), three frequencies (stimulation periods 200, 600, and 1200 <italic>ms</italic>) were tested subsequently, with a total of three repetitions (technical replicates) of the full set, totalling 26 × 3 = 78 observations at each pacing frequency. Optical voltage signals were measured both at the center of the illuminated area (top traces) as well as in the bulk of the tissue (bottom traces), in order to visualise action potentials throughout the tissue. Underneath these optical voltage traces is a space-time plot of the experimental monolayer, the vertical axis showing space and the horizontal one showing time. At each moment in time, the middle line of the monolayer image was plotted. White shows depolarized tissue, while black signifies repolarised cells. From these plots, intermediate stimulation periods (600 <italic>ms</italic>) were observed to change the monolayer from a collective stationary state to a collective oscillatory state, while low (200 <italic>ms</italic>) or high (1200 <italic>ms</italic>) ones had no effect. It was observed that the oscillatory state consisted of ectopic pacemaker activity with a frequency (735 <italic>ms</italic>-period) that was different from the stimulus train frequency (600-<italic>ms</italic> period). Similar results were found for the transient oscillatory state (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 4A</xref>). In short, we found that collective bi-stability becomes apparent in the mid-range of electrical pacing frequencies.</p>

<p>A second parameter tested was the number of pulses, visualised in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, where the period of stimulation (600 <italic>ms</italic>) and the light intensity (in the range 0.03125-0.25 <italic>mW</italic> ∕<italic>mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) were kept fixed. In every NRVM monolayer (7 biological replicates/monolayers), two different pulse numbers (2 and 4) were tested subsequently, with a total of three repetitions (technical replicates) of the full set, totalling 7 × 3 = 21 observations for each number of pulses. Once again optical voltage traces were taken from the center of the illuminated area and from the bulk of the tissue. Our observations show that a minimum number of pulses is needed to change the collective behaviour of the monolayer from stationary to oscillatory.</p>
<p>Taken together, we found a way to control transitions of collective behaviour of cardiomyocyte monolayers from stationary to oscillatory through two different parameters, i.e. the frequency and number of pulses.</p>

<title><italic>In silico</italic> realisation of collective light-induced bi-stability</title>
<p>Using the power of state-of-the-art computational modelling, we performed similar experiments to the <italic>in vitro</italic> ones with a modified version of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Majumder et al. (2016)</xref> model for NRVMs combined with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Williams et al. (2013)</xref> model for the H134R mutant of <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> channelrhodopsin-2. As this light-sensitive ion channel slightly differs from CheRiff in its biophysical properties, the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings will have a qualitative rather than a quantitative correspondence to the <italic>in silico</italic> results, which are visualised in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. Under fixed constant illumination (1.7124 <italic>mW</italic> ∕<italic>mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) and a fixed number of 4 pulses, frequency dependency of collective bi-stability was reproduced in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. Once again, only intermediate electrical pacing frequencies (500-<italic>ms</italic> period) caused transitions from collective stationary behaviour to collective oscillatory behaviour and ectopic pacemaker activity had periods (710 <italic>ms</italic>) that were different from the stimulation train period (500 <italic>ms</italic>). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> shows the accumulation of pulses necessary to invoke a transition from the collective stationary state to the collective oscillatory state at a fixed stimulation period (600 <italic>ms</italic>). Once more, ectopic pacemaker activity had periods (750 <italic>ms</italic>) that were different from the stimulation train period (600 <italic>ms</italic>). Also for the transient oscillatory state, the simulations show frequency selectivity (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Having established a qualitative correspondence between the <italic>in silico</italic> model and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, the unique properties of the computational model were exploited to assert control over all variables in order to determine the parameter ranges of the state transitions. We previously identified three important parameters influencing such transitions: illumination strength, number of pulses, and frequency of pulses. Scanning through all three variables revealed the specific conditions at which transition from the stationary state towards the oscillatory state occurred as shown in the rightmost panel of <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> with slices for fixed illumination extracted from this 3D-plot shown at the left. With increasing light intensity, the parameter range (pulse and period) in which bi-stability can be detected increases (the total area of TR.OSC. + OSC. becomes larger), and transient oscillatory states transition towards oscillatory states.</p>
<p>Except for the three aforementioned parameters, a fourth one was found to have an influence on the state transitions: the size of the illuminated region. Also this parameter was first tested <italic>in vitro</italic> resulting in 5 biological replicates/monolayers showing transitions to the oscillatory state and 6 biological replicates/monolayers showing transient oscillations. The effect of the size of the illuminated area on the occurrence of bi-stability was qualitatively reproduced <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 5</xref>). Varying the number and frequency of pulses together with the illuminated area at a fixed light intensity of 1.7200 <italic>mW</italic> ∕<italic>mm</italic><sup>2</sup> resulted in the dynamic behaviour shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>. For the conditions that resulted in stable oscillations, the green vertical lines in the middle and right slices represent the natural pacemaker frequency in the oscillatory state. After the transition from the stationary towards the oscillatory state, the illuminated region settles into this period of sending out pulses. The location of this line depends on the light intensity and the size of the illuminated region. However, it is independent of the number of pulses and the frequency of the stimulus train. Figures <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> also illustrate that no oscillatory state could be induced with a high number of pulses for stimulus trains of high frequency (i.e. low stimulation period).</p>

<title>Termination of collective pacemaker activity</title>
<p>A closer look at the high frequency range showed that it not only prevented the initiation of ectopic pacemaker activity, but can also cause its termination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In NRVM monolayers (3 biological replicates/monolayers), collective ectopic pacemaker activity was first initiated using a stimulus train of 3 pulses with a period of 500 <italic>ms</italic>. Once ongoing, 8 pulses in the high frequency range (period 200 <italic>ms</italic>) terminated the ectopic pacemaker activity and made the tissue go back to its resting state. When copying this experimental protocol <italic>in silico</italic>, qualitative correspondence was shown using 4 pulses with a period of 500 <italic>ms</italic> to initiate pacemaker activity, and 7 pulses with a period of 180 <italic>ms</italic> to terminate it.

<p>Once again, the qualitative <italic>in silico</italic> correspondence allows us to determine the specific conditions at which initiation and termination of collective ectopic pacemaker activity occur in more detail (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

<title>The collective nature of wave train-induced pacemaker activity</title>
<p>After exploring collective bi-stability in practice, we aimed to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. Bi-stability is a wide-spread phenomenon and can take place at the single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Guevara (2003)</xref>), which would be the simplest assumption for our monolayer system as well. When this would be the case, all cells would become oscillatory under illumination. We tested this hypothesis by making use of one of the four parameters we investigated earlier: the illuminated area. This parameter shows a transition from the stationary state towards the oscillatory state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) just like the light intensity parameter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) resulting in spontaneous oscillatory behaviour with waves emanating from the center of the illuminated area for a large area size and at a constant low light intensity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These circumstances allowed us to compare the voltage traces between the center of the irradiated area and the bulk of the tissue, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic>. While the cells outside of the illuminated area showed oscillating membrane potentials those in the center of the illuminated region, i.e. those least affected by the coupling current of neighbouring cells, displayed a stable elevation of membrane potential. Hence, this implies that not all illuminated cells became oscillatory. We can therefore reject the simplest hypothesis of bi-stability at the single cell level, but have to speak of a collective phenomenon. It is for this reason that throughout the manuscript the observed effects are referred to as “collective” pacemaker activity.</p>

<p>As was shown in all figures from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, illuminated cells do not show dampening oscillations when reaching the stationary state after a transition from the oscillatory state. This behaviour is justified when looking at a projection of the phase space of the model where the voltage <italic>V</italic> and the gating variable <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> for the rapid delayed outward rectifier <italic>K</italic><sup>+</sup> current were chosen for the x- and y-axis, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). The stable fixed point (STA) is not located inside the stable limit cycle (OSC) (right panel), hence showing no Hopf bifurcation (left panel) with its associated damped oscillations. The two attractor regions (STA and OSC) were also reconstructed from experimental data and showed two distinct trajectories (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 6</xref>).</p>
<p>Since we are dealing with a high-dimensional phase space in the <italic>in silico</italic> model, the visualisation of trajectories in time and the corresponding dynamic behaviour is rather complex. However, from the two-dimensional projections onto the <italic>V</italic> and <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> variables, we can see what causes the frequency and pulse dependency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) of ectopic pacemaker activity initiation, as visualised in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>. Four different pairs of stimulation period and number of pulses were selected, corresponding to different behaviour areas in the parameter space slice for a fixed illumination intensity (1.72 <italic>mW</italic> ∕<italic>mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) and size of the illuminated area (67 pixels edge length) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The first point (<italic>⍺</italic>) comes from the region that shows no transition towards collective pace-maker activity for a low number of pulses (2) and intermediate stimulation periods of 800 <italic>ms</italic>. The phase space projection (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) shows that the pulses cycle around the stable limit cycle, and return back to the stable fixed point, indicating that two pulses are not enough to move within the attractor zone of the stable limit cycle. When the number of pulses is increased to 4 (<italic>β</italic>), the attractor zone of the stable limit cycle is reached from the outside, and collective ectopic pacemaker activity is induced. After switching to a faster stimulation period of 250 <italic>ms</italic> and sticking to just 3 pulses (<italic>γ</italic>), the phase space trajectories end up inside the stable limit cycle, but still within the attractor zone. Hence, also this time collective pacemaker activity was induced. If we now increase the number of pulses again, this time to 8 (<italic>δ</italic>), we are inside the stable limit cycle, but move again out of the region of attraction. Instead of resulting in oscillations, the system moves back to the stationary state through other dimensions by the electrotonic current.</p>
<p>Thus, there is frequency selectivity due to the region of attraction of the stable limit cycle, where too low and too high frequencies result in stationary behaviour. Also pulse accumulation is shown, where more pulses move the system closer to the attractor region. However, we are not dealing with a Hopf bifurcation, because otherwise we would not get back to the stationary state when the number of pulses is increased too much.</p>

<title>Insight into the termination of ectopic pacemaker activity</title>
<p>Let us look once more at a cell inside the illuminated tissue undergoing a stimulus train with a short period of 180 <italic>ms</italic> from outside and extract all time-dependent variables. In response to a high number of stimuli (17 pulses), the time trace in the phase-space projection plot goes inside the limit cycle (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>) towards a quasi-steady-state, and returns back to the stationary state through a strangely curved line (black). This quasi-steady-state is hidden within the oscillatory trajectory and no pacemaker activity is initiated. When the number of pulses is increased from 17 to 37, the voltage trace shows exactly the same behaviour, indicating that the number of pulses has no influence on the mechanism that moves the tissue back to the stationary state (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). However, repolarisation reserve does have an influence and makes the transition longer (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 7</xref>). This can be observed by either moving closer to the boundary of the illuminated region where there is a stronger diffusion/electrotonic influence from the non-illuminated region, or by introducing ionic changes.</p>

<p>To understand what is going on, we studied single cell dynamics under illumination. We already know from <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> that we are dealing with a purely collective phenomenon. Therefore, the single cell dynamics itself showed nothing peculiar, i.e. a standard current-voltage relationship (IV) curve with a single stable equilibrium (not shown). To add a multicellular component to our single cell model we introduced a current that replicates the effect of cell coupling and its associated diffusion. This so-called bias current equals the average in time and space of the current inside the illuminated region using wave trains with a period of 180 <italic>ms</italic> (the current produced during the quasi-steady-state in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). When this bias current is present, the IV curve of the single cell displays two stable equilibria and shows bi-stability (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-1</xref>). The second stable equilibrium cannot be reached with a single pulse, but needs a stimulus train and can only be reached with short stimulation periods (180 <italic>ms</italic>) and intermediate stimulation amplitudes (−0 <italic>mV</italic>) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-2</xref>).</p>
<p>Building on this result, we next applied global stimuli with a period of 180 <italic>ms</italic> and amplitudes 58, −20, and 50 <italic>mV</italic> to a virtual cardiomyocyte monolayer with an illuminated square in the center (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). These pulses were applied when the tissue was either in the oscillatory state (top two rows) or the stationary state (bottom two rows). The stimulus amplitude of −20 <italic>mV</italic> that was necessary to get the single cell with a bias current into the second stable equilibrium, also terminates oscillatory behaviour (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D-2</xref>) while the other two amplitudes of −58 and 50 <italic>mV</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D-1,3</xref>) don’t alter the behaviour of the tissue. However, when starting from the stationary state, the behaviour is opposite and the intermediate amplitude of −20 <italic>mV</italic> fails to induce collective oscillatory behaviour while the other two amplitudes do elicit this behaviour. We thus conclude that high stimulation frequencies and intermediate stimulus amplitudes are capable of terminating collective oscillatory behaviour by transitioning through a quasi-steady-state.</p>
<p>We call this kind of bi-stability capable of terminating collective oscillatory behaviour “<italic>hidden bistability</italic>” for two reasons: (1) Single cell bi-stability depends on electronic interactions. Hence it can be said that this bi-stability is “hidden” and only emerges in collective behaviour. (2) It’s possible to escape the region of attraction of the oscillatory trajectory through opposite paths.</p>

<title>It’s complex, but not as complex as it seems</title>
<p>While it may be believed that the observed phenomena and explanations are intrinsic to entangled interactions specific to the complexity of a biological sample (<italic>in vitro</italic>) and a realistic computational model (<italic>in silico</italic>), we show here that this is not the case. By reducing the model equations, we show that collective oscillatory behaviour is not limited to the specific case of NRVMs. We started from the initial NRVM equations and reduced them to contain only a single depolarising current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na</italic></sub>), two repolarising currents (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Kr</italic></sub> and the time-independent <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>K</italic>1</sub>), and a spatially dependent optogenetic current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ChR</italic>2</sub>).

At a low frequency, the phase space projection (again projected onto the <italic>V</italic> and <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> variable plane) shows that the limit cycle is approached from the outside, while at high frequencies it is approached from the inside. Altogether, these results show frequency selectivity and pulse accumulation in the simplified model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). To explain the findings in the rightmost panel of <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>, we had a closer look at the single cell dynamics under high stimulation frequencies.

<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Firstly, we demonstrated the existence of transitions from stationary cardiac monolayers towards ones that show pacemaker activity coming from an illuminated region, which are induced by wave trains of external pulses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) as a manifestation of collective bi-stability. This transition between the two states is dependent on four variables: the light intensity applied to the illuminated region, the size of the illuminated region, the number of pulses of an incoming wave-train, and the frequency of the pulses of the incoming wave train (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments were quantitatively reproduced <italic>in silico</italic>, thereby establishing a link between model and experiment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>)).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Secondly, we studied the mechanisms underlying the initiation and termination of pacemaker activity. In the presence of a diffusion current (or bias current in the case of a single cell), the illuminated cells transition to a second equilibrium under high frequency pacing. Because this second equilibrium only appears in a coupled system (or in the presence of a bias current), we can also speak of a hidden bi-stability. Hence, hidden bi-stability (high vs. low stationary resting membrane) is shown to underlie the collective phenomena (stationary vs. oscillatory behaviour) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 6</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 7</xref>).</p></list-item>

<p>Below, we compare these phenomena to different types of arrhythmic events and mechanisms of bi-stability in cardiac tissue, and extend the relevance of our mechanisms to spiking behaviour in neuronal and other biophysical systems.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Ectopic pacemaker activity in cardiology</title>
<p>The generation of ectopic beats is considered as one of the main mechanisms triggering and maintaining cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pogwizd et al. (1992)</xref>). In most cases, ectopic sources are believed to be a result of triggered activity, which can manifest itself as early afterdepolarizations (EADs) or delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Qu et al. (2014)</xref>). Such ectopic sources are typically initiated by high frequency pacing resulting in a <italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup> overload that triggers EADs and DADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lerman et al. (2024)</xref>). However, as we didn’t observe <italic>Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup>overload, the phenomenon observed in this study resembles induced pacemaker activity instead. In contrast with ectopy, this pacemaker activity is initiated at low pacing frequencies. Therefore our findings might explain the phenomenon of bradycardia-induced triggered activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brachmann et al. (1983)</xref>). The initiation of oscillations in our monolayers is the result of the spatial dynamics of the system, which stands in contrast with the frequency dependency of EADs that can be explained on a single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Qu et al. (2014)</xref>). Our optogenetic current is absent in normal cardiac tissue, but its associated depolarisation could be caused by other late activating inward currents, which are also essential in the induction of EADs or DADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Song et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Qu et al. (2014)</xref>): e.g. the late Na current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na</italic>,<italic>L</italic></sub>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Belardinelli et al. (2015)</xref>), reactivation of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>CaL</italic></sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tran et al. (2009)</xref>), or NCX activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Song et al. (2015)</xref>). In addition, collective bi-stability might be observed in the presence of oxidative stress, ischemia or chronic heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Belardinelli et al. (2015)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shryock et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Undrovinas et al. (1999)</xref>), where there is depolarisation-induced automaticity (triggered activity) caused by a background current (e.g. <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na</italic>,<italic>L</italic></sub>).</p>
<p>The ectopic pacemaker activity in this study is a direct result of the combination of single cell depolarisation with spatial effects. Due to the additional inward current produced by the activation of CheRiff, a single uncoupled illuminated cell goes to a steady depolarised state (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). However, in a multicellular environment there is a repolarising electrotonic coupling current working against this depolarising light-induced current. This repolarising current is a consequence of the interaction between depolarised and non-depolarised parts in the monolayer. By playing with the illumination intensity and the size of the illuminated region, we were able to balance these de- and re-polarising effects to create a bi-stable regime (STA vs. OSC). This also explains why there are no oscillations present in the center of a large illuminated region, since there the electrotonic current is lower than at its edges. (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). On the other hand, if the electrotonic current is too strong, it will prevent depolarisation by the optogenetic current and, as a consequence, the system wil stay in the stationary state. The balancing of currents also explains why the oscillatory boundary moves closer to the edge of the illuminated region at higher light intensities, since under those circumstances the depolarising current will overpower the spatial effects. However, when the illumination is very strong, it is possible to have oscillations that don’t need to be induced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and can even come from the corners of the illuminated region (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Teplenin et al. (2018)</xref>). This last-mentioned phenomenon appears because the curvature of the boundary between illuminated and not-illuminated regions influences the electrotonic current.</p>

<p>Collective bi-stability, as described in the previous section, is a bi-stability between two distinct behaviours (stationary STA and oscillatory OSC behaviour) that occur at the macroscopic level (mono-layer). However, by looking more deeply at the dynamics that happen at the microscopic level (single cell), we can get more insight into the underlying mechanism(s). At the single cell level, the dynamic transition between a stationary monolayer and one showing induced pacemaker activity relies on two main processes:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>For the initiation of pacemaker activity, pulse accumulation (at intermediate frequencies) is necessary to bring the system into the attracting region of the oscillatory state.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For the termination of pacemaker activity, an interaction takes place between “hidden” bistable dynamics and coupling currents at high frequencies.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Both these processes occur as a consequence of wave pulses outside of the illuminated region. At low frequencies, no oscillatory activity can be induced. At intermediate frequencies, it is possible to escape the attracting zone of the stationary state and cross the separatrix into the attracting zone of the oscillatory state. However, for even higher frequencies, the system gets pushed out of the attracting zone of the oscillatory state again and through hidden bi-stability it returns to the stationary state.</p>
<p>Our data on the termination mechanism of induced pacemaker activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>) indicate that we are not dealing with classical STA-OSC bi-stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Winfree (2001)</xref>). In systems displaying classical bi-stability between a limit cycle and the resting state, pacemaker annihilation can be achieved by applying sufficiently high frequency voltage perturbations. Through pulse accumulation it is then possible to exit the basin of attraction in the reverse direction from which it was entered. In contrast, our system enters (from outside the limit cycle) and leaves (towards the inside of the limit cycle) the attraction zone in opposite directions. This was concluded from the absence of a Hopf bifurcation in our system (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>The seemingly fragile nature of hidden bi-stability might be a requirement for coexistence of excitable (non-illuminated) and bi-stable (illuminated) regimes. Otherwise, if the hills and dips of the N-shaped steady-state IV curve are large (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-1</xref>), they would be in the same range as the big currents of fast ion channels, thereby preventing the subtle interaction between the large ionic cell currents and small repolarising coupling currents.</p>
<p>Although the termination mechanism was shown to be amplitude-dependent (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-D</xref>), the appropriate perturbation amplitudes are “automatically” selected by a high frequency train of travelling waves of excitation without any <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge about the state of the system. This wave train terminated ectopic triggers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), which is in accordance with previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Moak and Rosen (1984)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Glikson et al. (2021)</xref>). These publications also showed that uniform high voltage shocks are unable to terminate ectopic sustained activity, similar to our findings (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Although its manifestations are clear in a monolayer system, hidden bi-stability might be challenging to be observed in single cell patch-clamp experiments. In <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C-1</xref>, the height of dips and hills of the N-shaped steady-state IV curve under bias current are ≈ 0.2<italic>pA</italic>∕<italic>pF</italic>. While it is possible to perform patch-clamping on individual cells in a monolayer experiencing diffusion currents, measurements of small amplitudes can be hindered by the statistical and instrumental errors of voltage-clamp recordings. The voltage bi-stability we are looking for can, for example, easily be lost via a shift in current balance due to the non-zero resistance of the patch pipette in current clamp mode. This might explain why the phenomenon of hidden bi-stability has only rarely been reported, for example in an <italic>in silico</italic> study dedicated to myotony in muscle fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cannon et al. (1993)</xref>).</p>

<title>Extrapolation and translation</title>
<p>All key aspects of the initiation and termination of induced pacemaker activity, i.e. the points itemized above, were also demonstrated in a simplified 3 variable reaction-diffusion model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 8</xref>), implicating the more general nature of this observed phenomenon. A rigorous mathematical analysis can be accomplished in future work, but might be challenging due to the lack of efficient analytical tools to describe fully developed limit cycle oscillations in reaction-diffusion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Sherratt and Smith (2008)</xref>). Based on the reproduction of our results in such a simplified model, we showed that we don’t need the full complexity of an ionic cardiomyocyte model, enabling extrapolation and translation of our results towards other scientific disciplines.</p>
<p>Frequency-dependent initiation and termination of oscillatory activity is not exclusive to cardiac systems, but is well known in a variety of non-linear biophysical systems. For example, the actomyosin cortex in the social amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> responds to short pulses of 3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by damped oscillations in average actin content, thereby allowing fine time-selective responses to either internal (pseudopodia initiation) or external (cAMP release) perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Westendorf et al. (2013)</xref>). Moreover, in synthetic gene regulatory networks, subthreshold stimuli might be used to discriminate environmental stimuli (e.g. growth factor release, heat shock) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Guantes and Poyatos (2006)</xref>). Also neurons can differentiate external stimuli depending on their frequency. As mentioned in the introduction, the frequency-dependent initiation and termination of oscillatory activity is known as ‘<italic>resonance</italic>’ in neuroscience. It is interesting to compare the resonance properties of our system with those actively studied in neurons.</p>
<p>Resonant neurons, also known as resonate-and-fire neurons or type II excitability neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Izhikevich (2000)</xref>), are governed by sub-threshold oscillations initiated due to proximity of the resting state to a Hopf bifurcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hutcheon and Yarom (2000)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Roach et al. (2018)</xref>). They react to a stimulus train as follows: The first pulse initiates a damped sub-threshold oscillation of the membrane potential, while the effect of the second pulse depends on its timing. If timed correctly, it adds to the first pulse and either increases the amplitude of the sub-threshold oscillation or evokes repetitive spiking (transition to a limit cycle). Thus, the response and spiking of the resonator neuron depends on the frequency content of the input. These types of spiking neurons are usually associated with Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Izhikevich (2000)</xref>). However, another type of bifurcation, a saddle-node-loop (SNL) bifurcation, is also capable of generating spiking neurons and allows a bi-stability regime, in which the stable state lies outside the limit cycle similar to our case (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>
<p>SNL bifurcations were previously identified in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hesse et al. (2017)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hesse and Schreiber (2019)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schleimer et al. (2021)</xref>), in a model of transcriptional regulation of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ciliberto et al. (2005)</xref>), and in the design of combined genetic switches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Perez-Carrasco et al. (2018)</xref>). Our result might represent the emergent analogue of a SNL bifurcation with resonant transitions on a neuronal/non-linear network level. SNL bifurcations have already been identified in the networks of coupled Kuramoto limit cycle oscillators both in a broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Martens et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Childs and Strogatz (2008)</xref>) and in a neuroscience context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Buendía et al. (2021)</xref>). In these studies, SNL bifurcations were identified using dimensionality reduction techniques while ignoring the whole wealth of transient and finite-size phenomena. Moreover the Kuramoto model is a model without many physical details, describing a weak forcing regime on an idealized limit cycle oscillator, in which oscillations cannot be destroyed but only phase shifted. In our case, we provide a more realistic biophysically motivated model, which allows a strong forcing regime and destruction of oscillations due to the phenomenon of hidden bi-stability. This gives us reason to believe that idealized Kuramoto models could possess resonant properties if augmented/modified with sufficient physical/biophysical details. SNL bifurcations and hidden bi-stability could also be studied in a range of other unexplored biophysical situations including high frequency stimulation for the termination of neuronal oscillations during Parkinson disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Touboul et al. (2020)</xref>), multi compartment cable computational models of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Schwemmer and Lewis (2012)</xref>), and bi-stability in neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Le et al. (2006)</xref>). Additional studies can be carried out in neuroscience by local optogenetic activation of depolarizing ion channels, both <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lu et al.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Using both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in silico</italic> models, we explored a mechanism for frequency-dependent initiation and termination of oscillatory activity (i.e. induced pacemaker activity) in non-homogeneous cardiac tissue. This mechanism could be extended to more general excitable systems and is in neuroscience also known under the term resonance. Our collective “resonance” mechanism could be used to study or control collective states in cardiac but also other excitable systems.</p>

<title>Preparation of monolayers of NRVMs expressing the light-activatable cation channel CheRiff</title>
<p>All animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the Animal Experiments Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center and carried out in accordance with Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Union on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.. Monolayers of NRVMs were established as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Engels et al. (2015)</xref>. Briefly, the hearts were excised from anaesthetised 2-day-old Wistar rats. The ventricles were cut into small pieces and dissociated in a solution containing 450 U∕ml collagenase type I (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) and 18,75 Kunitz/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The resulting cell suspension was enriched for cardiomyocytes by preplating for 120 minutes in a humidified incubator at 37<sup>◦</sup>C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using Primaria culture dishes (Becton Dickinson, Breda, the Netherlands). Finally, the cells were seeded on round glass coverslips (<italic>d</italic> = 15 mm; Gerhard Menzel, Braunschweig, Germany) coated with bovine fibronectin (100 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) to establish confluent monolayers. After incubation overnight in an atmosphere of humidified 95% air-5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37<sup>◦</sup>C, these monolayers were treated with Mitomycin-C (10 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hours to minimise proliferation of the non-cardiomyocytes. At day 4 of culture, the NRVM monolayers were incubated for 20-24 h with lentiviral vector particles encoding CheRiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hochbaum et al. (2014)</xref>), a light-gated depolarising ion channel of the channelrhodopsin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al.

<title>Optical voltage mapping and patterned illumination of NRVM monolayers</title>
<p>After 8-10 days of culturing, NRVM monolayers were optically mapped using the voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANBDQBS (52.5 <italic>μ</italic>M final concentration; ITK diagnostics, Uithoorn, the Netherlands) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Feola et al. (2017)</xref>). The mapping setup (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Appendix 2 Figure 1</xref>) was based on a 100 × 100 pixel CMOS Ultima-L camera (Scimedia, Costa Mesa, CA). The field of view was 16 × 16 mm resulting in a spatial resolution of 160 <italic>μ</italic>m/pixel. For targeted illumination of monolayers the setup was optically conjugated to a digitally controlled micro-mirror device (DMD), the Polygon 400 (Mightex Systems, Toronto, ON), with a high power blue (470 nm) LED (BLS-LCS-0470-50-22-H, Mightex Systems). Before starting the actual experiments, all monolayers were mapped during 1-Hz electrical point stimulation to check baseline conditions. Electrical stimulation was performed by applying 10-ms-long rectangular electrical pulses with an amplitude of 8 V to a bipolar platinum electrode with a spacing of 1.5 mm between anode and cathode. Only cultures with an action potential duration (APD) at 80% repolarization (APD<sub>80</sub>) below 350 <italic>ms</italic> and a conduction velocity (CV) above 18 <italic>cm</italic>∕<italic>s</italic> were used for further experiments. Stimuli were applied in trains that varied in number and period. Whenever the outcome was reproducible three consecutive times in a single monolayer, it was counted as successful and included as one measurement in the total dataset. The constant light intensity was varied in the range of (0.03125-0.25 <italic>mW</italic> ∕<italic>mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) to search the critical value for the bi-stable regime. For experiments in which the light intensity was varied the rectangular-shaped area of illumination was in the range of 4 × 4 to 6 × 6 mm. The highest achievable irradiation intensity (0.3125 <italic>mW</italic> ∕<italic>mm</italic><sup>2</sup>) was used to perform size modulation experiments. The resulting electrical activity was recorded for 6-24 <italic>s</italic> at exposure times of 6 <italic>ms</italic> per frame.</p>

<title>Detailed electrophysiological model</title>
<p>In this study, the Majumder-Korhonen model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Majumder et al. (2016)</xref>) of NRVM monolayers was used, whose monodomain reaction-diffusion equation is formulated as follows:

In comparison to the original model, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Na</italic></sub> was increased 1.3-fold and, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Ca</italic></sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>Kr</italic></sub> were both reduced 0.7-fold. The steady-state voltage dependency for the inactivation variable <italic>h</italic> of the fast Na<sup>+</sup> current was changed to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="650000v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>V</italic> is the transmembrane potential. The resulting CV was 20 cm/s. The optogenetic current <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>ChR</italic>2</sub> was formulated based on the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boyle et al.

<p>The forward Euler method was used to integrate the equations with a time step Δ<italic>t</italic> = 0.02<italic>ms</italic> and a centered finite-differencing scheme to discretise the Laplacian with a space step of Δ<italic>x</italic> = 0.0625<italic>mm</italic>. The total computational domain size was 256 × 256 grid points; while the centrally irradiated square with the optogenetic current consisted of 80 × 80 grid points.

<p>Exposure of a squared region in the center of the NRVM monolayer to light of different intensities generates of a photocurrent of different strength by the light-gated depolarising ion channel. Application of a periodic wave train to these NRVM monolayers results in 5 different outcomes, which are each visualised by representative snapshots and a linear time-extract. Going from a high (top) to low (bottom) light intensity these outcomes are: (1) monostable surface oscillations, S.OSC, (2) monostable ectopic oscillations, OSC, (3) bi-stability, (4) transient oscillations, TR.OSC, and (5) stationary state with no activity, STA.(1). The bi-stability region (STA-&gt;OSC) and the transient oscillations (STA-&gt;TR.OSC) (green box) are described in the main manuscript and supplemental material of this manuscript, respectively.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work provides mechanistic insights into the development of cardiac arrhythmia and establishes a new experimental use case for optogenetics in studying cardiac electrophysiology. The agreement between computational models and experimental observations provides a <bold>convincing</bold> level of evidence that wave train-induced pacemaker activity can originate in continuously depolarized tissue, with the limitation that there may be differences between depolarization arising from constant optogenetic stimulation, as opposed to pathophysiological tissue depolarization. Future experiments in vivo and in other tissue preparations would extend the generality of these findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Teplenin and coworkers assesses the combined effects of localized depolarization and excitatory electrical stimulation in myocardial monolayers. They study the electrophysiological behaviour of cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes expressing the light-gated cation channel Cheriff, allowing them to induce local depolarization of varying area and amplitude, the latter titrated by the applied light intensity. In addition, they used computational modeling to screen for critical parameters determining state transitions and to dissect the underlying mechanisms. Two stable states, thus bistability, could be induced upon local depolarization and electrical stimulation, one state characterized by a constant membrane voltage and a second, spontaneously firing, thus oscillatory state. The resulting 'state' of the monolayer was dependent on the duration and frequency of electrical stimuli, as well as the size of the illuminated area and the applied light intensity, determining the degree of depolarization as well as the steepness of the local voltage gradient. In addition to the induction of oscillatory behaviour, they also tested frequency-dependent termination of induced oscillations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data from optogenetic experiments and computational modelling provide quantitative insights into the parameter space determining the induction of spontaneous excitation in the monolayer. The most important findings can also be reproduced using a strongly reduced computational model, suggesting that the observed phenomena might be more generally applicable.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the study is thoroughly performed and provides interesting mechanistic insights into scenarios of ventricular arrhythmogenesis in the presence of localized depolarized tissue areas, the translational perspective of the study remains relatively vague. In addition, the chosen theoretical approach and the way the data are presented might make it difficult for the wider community of cardiac researchers to understand the significance of the study.</p>

<p>In the presented manuscript, Teplenin and colleagues use both electrical pacing and optogenetic stimulation to create a reproducible, controllable source of ectopy in cardiomyocyte monolayers. To accomplish this, they use a careful calibration of electrical pacing characteristics (i.e., frequency, number of pulses) and illumination characteristics (i.e., light intensity, surface area) to show that there exists a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where oscillatory excitations can emerge proximal to the optogenetically depolarized region following electrical pacing cessation, akin to pacemaker cells. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that a high-frequency electrical wave-train can be used to terminate these oscillatory excitations. The authors observed this oscillatory phenomenon both in vitro (using neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocyte monolayers) and in silico (using a computational action potential model of the same cell type). These are surprising findings and provide a novel approach for studying triggered activity in cardiac tissue.</p>
<p>The study is extremely thorough and one of the more memorable and grounded applications of cardiac optogenetics in the past decade. One of the benefits of the authors' &quot;two-prong&quot; approach of experimental preps and computational models is that they could probe the number of potential variable combinations much deeper than through in vitro experiments alone. The strong similarities between the real-life and computational findings suggest that these oscillatory excitations are consistent, reproducible, and controllable.</p>
<p>Triggered activity, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac sudden death, has been largely attributed to sub-cellular phenomena, such as early or delayed afterdepolarizations, and thus to date has largely been studied in isolated single cardiomyocytes. However, these findings have been difficult to translate to tissue and organ-scale experiments, as well-coupled cardiac tissue has notably different electrical properties. This underscores the significance of the study's methodological advances: the use of a constant depolarizing current in a subset of (illuminated) cells to reliably result in triggered activity could facilitate the more consistent evaluation of triggered activity at various scales. An experimental prep that is both repeatable and controllable (i.e., both initiated and terminated through the same means).</p>
<p>The authors also substantially explored phase space and single-cell analyses to document how this &quot;hidden&quot; bi-stable phenomenon can be uncovered during emergent collective tissue behavior. Calibration and testing of different aspects (e.g., light intensity, illuminated surface area, electrical pulse frequency, electrical pulse count) and other deeper analyses, as illustrated in Appendix 2, Figures 3-8, are significant and commendable.</p>
<p>Given that the study is computational, it is surprising that the authors did not replicate their findings using well-validated adult ventricular cardiomyocyte action potential models, such as ten Tusscher 2006 or O'Hara 2011. This may have felt out of scope, given the nice alignment of rat cardiomyocyte data between in vitro and in silico experiments. However, it would have been helpful peace-of-mind validation, given the significant ionic current differences between neonatal rat and adult ventricular tissue. It is not fully clear whether the pulse trains could have resulted in the same bi-stable oscillatory behavior, given the longer APD of humans relative to rats. The observed phenomenon certainly would be frequency-dependent and would have required tedious calibration for a new cell type, albeit partially mitigated by the relative ease of in silico experiments.</p>
<p>For all its strengths, there are likely significant mechanistic differences between this optogenetically tied oscillatory behavior and triggered activity observed in other studies. This is because the constant light-elicited depolarizing current is disrupting the typical resting cardiomyocyte state, thereby altering the balance between depolarizing ionic currents (such as Na+ and Ca2+) and repolarizing ionic currents (such as K+ and Ca2+). The oscillatory excitations appear to later emerge at the border of the illuminated region and non-stimulated surrounding tissue, which is likely an area of high source-sink mismatch. The authors appear to acknowledge differences in this oscillatory behavior and previous sub-cellular triggered activity research in their discussion of ectopic pacemaker activity, which is canonically expected more so from genetic or pathological conditions. Regardless, it is exciting to see new ground being broken in this difficult-to-characterize experimental space, even if the method illustrated here may not necessarily be broadly applicable.</p>
