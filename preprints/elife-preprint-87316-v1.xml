<title>Abstract</title><p>Trained immunity is the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells, which results in altered responses toward a secondary challenge. Despite indoxyl sulfate (IS) being a potent stimulus associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD)-related inflammation, its impact on trained immunity has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that IS induces trained immunity in monocytes <italic>via</italic> epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, resulting in augmented cytokine production. Mechanistically, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contributes to IS-trained immunity by enhancing the expression of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism-related genes such as Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase (ALOX5) and ALOX5 Activating Protein (ALOX5AP). Inhibition of AhR during IS training suppresses the induction of IS-trained immunity. Monocytes from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients have increased ALOX5 expression and after 6-day training, they exhibit enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production to LPS. Furthermore, healthy control-derived monocytes trained with uremic sera from ESRD patients exhibit increased production of TNF-α and IL-6. Consistently, IS-trained mice and their splenic myeloid cells had increased production of TNF-α after <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> LPS stimulation compared to that of control mice. These results provide insight into the role of IS in the induction of trained immunity, which is critical during inflammatory immune responses in CKD patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last decade, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that innate cells can build up immunological memory resulting in enhanced responsiveness to subsequent stimulation, a phenomenon termed trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Compared with classical epitope-specific adaptive immunological memory based on an antigen-receptor, trained immunity of monocytes and macrophages is the long-term functional reprogramming elicited by an initial primary insult, mainly pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which leads to an altered response towards a subsequent, unrelated secondary insult after the return to a homeostatic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). It has been well demonstrated that exposure of monocytes or macrophages to <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, fungal cell wall component β-glucan, or BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine enhances their subsequent responses to unrelated pathogens or pathogen components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The induction of trained immunity is associated with the interaction of epigenetic modifications and metabolic rewiring, which can last for prolonged periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Mechanistically, certain metabolites derived from the upregulation of different metabolic pathways triggered by primary insult can influence enzymes involved in remodeling the epigenetic landscape of cells. This leads to specific changes in epigenetic histone markers, such as histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) or histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac), which regulate genes resulting in a more rapid and stronger response upon a subsequent, unrelated secondary insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In addition, it has been recently reported that long non-coding RNAs induce epigenetic reprogramming <italic>via</italic> the histone methyltransferase, MLL1. Subsequently, transcription factors such as Runx1 regulate the induction of proinflammatory cytokines following the secondary insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>).</p>
<p>Many studies have provided evidence that trained immunity likely evolved as a beneficial process for non-specific protection from future secondary infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, it has also been suggested that augmented immune responses resulting from trained immunity is potentially relevant to deleterious outcomes in immune-mediated and chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune diseases, allergy, and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Thus, although most studies have focused on the ability of exogenous microbial insults to induce trained immunity, it is also conceivable that sterile inflammatory insults can evoke trained immunity. In support of this idea, oxLDL, lipoprotein a (Lpa), uric acid, hyperglycemia, and the Western diet have all been recently identified as endogenous sterile insults that induce trained immunity in human monocytes <italic>via</italic> epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that many endogenous insults that cause chronic inflammatory conditions may be involved in the induction of trained immunity in human monocytes and macrophages.</p>
<p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is recognized as a major non-communicable disease with increasing worldwide prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Loss of renal function in CKD patients causes the accumulation of over 100 uremic toxins, which are closely associated with cardiovascular risk and mortality due to their ability to generate oxidative stress and a proinflammatory cytokine milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Reflecting this, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a major uremic toxin derived from dietary tryptophan <italic>via</italic> fermentation of gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Since it is poorly cleared by hemodialysis, IS is one of the uremic toxins present at higher than normal concentrations in the serum of CKD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and is associated with the progression of CKD and the development of CKD-related complications such as CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). We and others have shown that IS promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β by monocytes and macrophages through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling and organic anion transporting polypeptides 2B1 (OATP2B1)-Dll4-Notch Signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), suggesting a role of IS as an endogenous inflammatory insult in monocytes and macrophages. Moreover, pretreatment with IS greatly increases TNF-α production by human macrophages in response to a low dose of LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Despite the function of IS as an endogenous inflammatory insult in monocytes and macrophages, little is known with regard to whether IS induces trained immunity. Thus, we investigated whether exposure to IS triggers trained immunity in an <italic>in vitro</italic> human monocyte model and an <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse model, as well as the mechanisms involved in IS-induced trained immunity. Our data show that IS triggers trained immunity in human monocytes/macrophages <italic>via</italic> AhR-dependent alteration of the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway, epigenetic modifications, and metabolic rewiring. Thus, this suggests IS plays a critical role in the initiation of inflammatory immune responses in patients with CKD.</p>

<title>Indoxyl sulfate (IS) induces trained immunity in human monocytes</title>
<p>To explore whether exposure to IS is involved in the induction of trained immunity in human monocytes, an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of trained immunity was applied as previously reported by the Netea group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Freshly isolated human CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes were preincubated for 24 hrs with or without IS and, after a subsequent 5-day culture in human serum, restimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Pam3cys for final 24 hrs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Preincubation of monocytes with IS led to enhanced production of TNF-α, a major monocyte/macrophage-derived inflammatory cytokine, upon LPS stimulation. Since 10 ng/ml of LPS significantly increased both TNF-α and IL-6 secretion in IS-trained macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), we used this concentration of LPS in subsequent experiments. A clinically relevant concentration of IS in severe CKD has reported the range from 0.5 to 1.0 mmol/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The preincubation effect of IS on cytokine production was observed at a concentration as low as 250 μM, which is the average IS concentration in patients with ESRD in our cohort (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Unlike IS, preincubation with other protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs), such as <italic>p</italic>-cresyl sulfate (PCS), Hippuric acid (HA), Indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) and kynurenic acid (KA), did not cause increased secretion of TNF-α or IL-6 in response to LPS stimulation (Fig. S1A). In addition, there was no obvious effect on cell viability following pre-incubation of macrophages with 1,000 μM of IS after a subsequent 5-day culture in human serum or after LPS stimulation (Fig. S1B). We also found that the enhanced cytokine production of IS-trained macrophages was not attributable to potassium derived from IS potassium salt (Fig. S1C). Moreover, the increased TNF-α and IL-6 production in IS-trained macrophages was not limited to LPS stimulation, as similar phenomena were observed following stimulation with Pam3cys, a TLR1/2 agonist (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). β-glucan-pretreated macrophages exhibit a prototypic feature of trained immunity, characterized by enhanced production of inflammatory cytokines upon restimulation with heterologous stimuli, LPS or Pam3cys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). As seen in Figure S1D, the level of TNF-α secreted by IS-trained macrophages was comparable with that secreted by β-glucan-trained macrophages, although β-glucan had a more potent effect on IL-6 production than did IS, suggesting that IS plays a role in the induction of trained immunity of human monocytes. In addition to TNF-α and IL-6, mRNA expression of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>MCP-1 (CCL2)</italic> was significantly increased in IS-trained macrophages, whereas the anti-inflammatory cytokine <italic>IL-10</italic> was greatly reduced in the same cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Circulating monocytes have been identified as a major immune cell subset that responds to IS in the serum of ESRD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To examine whether uremic serum induces trained immunity of monocytes/macrophages, pooled sera from ESRD patients (184 ± 44 μM of average IS level) or from HCs were used to treat monocytes isolated from HCs for 24 hr at 30% (v/v), followed by training for 5 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Training with pooled uremic serum of ESRD patients increased the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon restimulation with LPS compared to monocytes treated with the pooled sera of HCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-I</xref>). In addition, expression of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>MCP-1</italic> mRNA was also augmented by training with the pooled uremic sera of ESRD patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). These results suggest that IS induces trained immunity in human monocytes, characterized by the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and reduced expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in response to secondary TLR stimulation.</p>

<title>Epigenetic modifications control IS-induced trained immunity</title>
<p>The induction of trained immunity relies on two key, closely intertwined mechanisms, epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring of innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). We first sought to determine whether increased expression of TNF-α and IL-6 is a result of epigenetic changes. To this end, chromatin modification of histone 3 trimethylation of lysine 4 (H3K4me3) at the promoter sites of <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> was analyzed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR data illustrate that IS-trained macrophages exhibit enhanced H3K4me3 of <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters by day 6 after treatment with 1,000 μM of IS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">B</xref>). This reflects what was previously demonstrated in trained innate immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Moreover, IS-mediated enrichment of H3K4me3 was maintained even after secondary stimulation with LPS compared with non-trained cells (Fig. S2A-B). When IS-trained macrophages were pretreated with 5’-methylthioadenosine (MTA), a non-selective methyltransferase inhibitor, their production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS stimulation was reversed to baseline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), implying that IS-induced trained immunity is associated with epigenetic modification. To further elucidate epigenetic modifications in IS-induced trained immunity, we performed a whole-genome assessment of the histone marker H3K4me3 by ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in IS-trained cells on day 6. Among 7,136 peaks, 59 differentially upregulated peaks and 316 downregulated peaks were detected in IS-trained cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and Table S1). To identify the biological processes affected in IS-mediated trained immunity, 59 upregulated peaks in IS-trained macrophages were analyzed through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis with Go biological process and the Reactome Gene Set. Activation of the innate immune response and positive regulation of the defense response were identified as major processes <italic>via</italic> Go biological process analysis.

<title>IS-induced trained immunity is regulated by metabolic rewiring</title>
<p>Metabolic rewiring is one of the most crucial processes regulating the trained immunity of monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Assessment of the metabolic profile of IS-trained macrophages on day 6 (prior to restimulation with LPS) showed that training with IS led to an enhanced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a measure of lactate production, indicating increased glycolysis and glycolysis capacity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">B</xref>). Moreover, basal and maximal respiration and ATP production gauged by the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) were also increased compared to that of non-trained cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>). Enhanced glycolysis and glycolytic capacity in IS-trained cells remained higher even after re-stimulation with LPS (Fig. S3A-B), implying that the IS-training effect on metabolic rewiring is sustained regardless of the secondary stimulation. To further examine whether the metabolic rewiring by IS-trained cells is linked to the regulation of trained immunity, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a general inhibitor of glycolysis, was added to monocytes before training with IS. 2-DG completely inhibited the augmented production of TNF-α and IL-6 in IS-trained macrophages in response to re-stimulation with LPS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Our findings were corroborated by the finding that on day 6 IS-trained macrophages showed an enhanced enrichment of H3K4m3 on promoter sites of <italic>HK2</italic> and <italic>PFKP</italic>, major glycolysis-related genes (Fig. S3C). These data demonstrate that IS-trained immunity is linked to metabolic rewiring characterized by both enhanced glycolysis and augmented oxidative respiration.</p>

<title>AhR, a potent endogenous receptor for IS, contributes to the induction of IS-trained immunity</title>
<p>Our previous study demonstrated that IS-induced TNF-α production in macrophages is regulated through a complex mechanism involving the interaction of NF-κB and SOCS2 with AhR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of IS-trained immunity, we investigated the role of AhR, a potent endogenous receptor for IS. Ligand-bound activated AhR is known to be immediately translocated into the nucleus and rapidly degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Immunoblot data in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> shows that IS-mediated degradation of AhR was not fully recovered even on day 6 (prior to restimulation with LPS) and was completely inhibited by treatment with GNF351, an AhR antagonist, on day 6. Inhibition of AhR by GNF351 during IS training suppressed the increase in production of TNF-α and IL-6 following LPS restimulation on day 6 in IS-trained cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">C</xref>), implying that IS-mediated AhR activation may be involved in trained immunity. In addition to TNF-α and IL-6, enhancement of <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>MCP-1</italic> mRNA expression in IS-trained cells was also completely inhibited, whereas decreased <italic>IL-10</italic> expression was completely reversed by GNF351 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). To confirm the regulatory role of AhR in trained immunity, we tested whether 6-Formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), a tryptophan-derived agonist of AhR, also induced trained immunity in human monocytes. FICZ-pretreated monocytes exhibited augmented expression of TNF-α and IL-6 in response to secondary stimulation with LPS compared to non-trained cells (Fig. S4A). Thus, this suggests an important role of ligand-bound activated AhR in the trained immunity of human monocytes. We next examined whether inhibition of AhR with GNF351 influences epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring. Our ChIP-qPCR assay showed that enrichment of H3K4m3 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters in IS-trained macrophages was inhibited by GNF351 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Of note, assessment of the metabolic profile by measuring ECAR and OCR illustrates that GNF351 has no effect on metabolic rewiring, including enhanced glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, in IS-trained cells on day 6 as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> (Fig. S4B-C). This finding was corroborated by the immunoblotting data, which showed GNF351 had no inhibitory effect on IS-mediated enhancement of S6K activity, which is critical for inducing the aerobic glycolysis in human monocytes/macrophages (Fig. S4D). Our findings suggest that IS-activated AhR is involved in regulating epigenetic modifications of IS-trained macrophages.</p>

<title>AhR-dependent induction of the arachidonic acid pathway is involved in IS-induced trained immunity</title>
<p>To explore which molecular mechanism is involved in the induction of IS-trained immunity, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) on day 6 (prior to restimulation with LPS) in IS-trained human macrophages. A total of 218 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), consisting of 71 upregulated and 147 downregulated genes, were identified in IS-trained macrophages compared to non-trained cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and S5A; FC ≥ ± 2, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these expression data using the Reactome Gene Set is displayed in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>. IS-trained macrophages had upregulated pathways including those involved in neutrophil degranulation, integrin cell surface interactions, extracellular matrix organization and arachidonic acid metabolism, whereas pathways associated with kinesins, cell cycle, and the Gα(i) signaling pathway were downregulated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Considering the key role of the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway in many inflammatory disorders, we decided to focus on this pathway in the induction of trained immunity by IS. Our findings were supported by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB), in which genes related to AA metabolism were enriched in IS-trained macrophages compared to non-trained cells and more importantly, upregulated expression of these genes was inhibited by treatment with GNF351 as illustrated by heatmap analysis of major genes related to AA metabolism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">D</xref> and Fig. S5E). Among AA metabolism pathways, the leukotriene metabolic process, but not the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, was primarily involved in the induction of IS-mediated trained immunity (Fig. S5B). Confirmatory RT-qPCR analysis on major AA metabolism-related genes was conducted using IS-trained macrophages obtained from independent, HCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The mRNA expression of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (<italic>ALOX5</italic>: also known as <italic>5-LOX</italic> or <italic>5-LO</italic>) and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (<italic>ALOX5AP</italic>: also known as <italic>FLAP</italic>), the enzymes catalyzing AA into leukotrienes (a group of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>), was higher in IS-trained macrophages than non-trained cells. In addition, the mRNA expression of <italic>LTB4R1</italic> (also known as <italic>BLT1</italic>), a high-affinity receptor for leukotriene B4 (LTB4), was also upregulated. The augmented expression of these AA metabolism-related genes was repressed by GNF351 pretreatment as shown by changes in expression of <italic>CYP1B1</italic>, a typical AhR target gene. Thus, this suggests that the IS-activated AhR pathway is involved in enhanced AA-metabolism in IS-induced trained immunity. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the expression of ALOX5 and ALOX5AP is upregulated in IS-trained immunity and is inhibited by GNF351 at the protein level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p>

<p>We previously reported alterations in the transcriptome signature of <italic>ex vivo</italic> monocytes of ESRD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Comparison of the fold changes of RNA-Seq data in the present study and microarray data reported previously (GSE155326) revealed that the expression of <italic>ALOX5</italic> and <italic>LTB4R1</italic> is enhanced in IS-trained macrophages and <italic>ex vivo</italic> monocytes of ESRD patients (Fig. S5C). To further investigate the roles of the AA metabolism pathway in IS-trained immunity, Zileuton, an ALOX5 inhibitor, and U75302, a BLT1 receptor inhibitor were used during the induction of trained immunity by IS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G-H</xref>, S5D). We found that IS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 production were largely suppressed by both zileuton and U75302 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G-H</xref>). Therefore, these findings suggest that AA metabolism plays an important role in the induction of IS-trained immunity. We next tested whether training with uremic serum leads to increased expression of AA pathway-related genes within 6 days (prior to restimulation with LPS) as found in IS-trained macrophages. The expression of <italic>ALOX5</italic>, <italic>ALOX5AP</italic>, and <italic>LTB4R1</italic> mRNA was augmented by training with pooled uremic sera of ESRD patients compared with HCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), and this augmented expression was maintained after re-stimulation with LPS (Fig. S5F).</p>

However, RNA-Seq data of IS-trained macrophages showed no obvious change in the expression profile of major histone-modifying enzymes (Fig. S6A).

<p>CKD is associated with increased risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD) including traditional risk factors, such as hypertension, age and dyslipidemia, as well as non-traditional risk factors, such as oxidative stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Further, recent cohort studies have shown that CKD is an independent risk factor for CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Uremia accompanying renal failure causes immune dysfunction, which is closely linked to the pathogenesis of CKD-related CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Among over 100 uremic toxins identified, IS is a prototypical protein-bound uremic toxin most likely to be participating in progressive pathophysiology of CVD including endothelial dysfunction, vascular calcification, and increased atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Mounting evidence suggests that a prolonged hyperactivation of trained immunity is intimately related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the major contributor to cardiovascular diseases. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), hyperglycemia, and the Western diet, all known to be associate with the progression of atherosclerosis, have been reported to induce trained immunity through epigenetic reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). These findings suggest that IS plays a role as a typical endogenous inflammatory insult in activating monocytes and macrophages and modulating their responses. Given that IS is difficult to clear by hemodialysis, this toxin has a chronic effect on the immune system of patients. Nonetheless, little is known about the effects of IS on trained immunity.</p>
<p>As observed using a common <italic>in vitro</italic> model of trained immunity established by Netea and other groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which are exposed for 24 h to the first insult with IS and rested for 5 days without IS, produced an augmented level of TNF-α and IL-6 and decreased level of IL-10 in response to an unrelated second insult with LPS or Pam3cys, which is a feature typical of trained immunity of monocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-E</xref>). Mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the induction of trained immunity is coordinated through the interplay of epigenetic modifications and metabolic rewiring, which is broadly characterized as prolonged changes in transcription programs and cell physiology that do not involve permanent genetic changes, such as the mutations and recombination events crucial for adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In the present study, ChIP-Seq and real-time metabolic analysis show that the induction of IS-trained immunity in human monocytes is attributable to epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), trimethylation of histones at H3K4 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters was increased in IS-trained macrophages and maintained even after secondary stimulation with LPS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and Fig. S2B). Furthermore, the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS stimulation was completely inhibited by pretreatment with 5’-methylthioadenosine (MTA), a methyltransferase inhibitor (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), demonstrating that IS-induced trained immunity is associated with epigenetic modification. Moreover, H3K4me3-ChIP-Seq data showed that IS-induced trained immunity accompanied by epigenetic reprogramming and H3K4me3 was enriched in genes related to activation of the innate immune responses as illustrated by gene ontology (GO) analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified AhR as a critical mediator of IS-trained immunity in human monocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). AhR is a ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor (TF), which is activated by several exogenous compounds, such as benzo[a]pyrene environmental pollutants and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-<italic>p</italic>-dioxin (TCDD), as well as by multiple endogenous ligands including tryptophan and indole metabolites(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). AhR plays a multifaceted role in modulating cellular mechanisms such as inflammation, cell growth, and antioxidant responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). AhR is expressed by various immune cells, and its signaling exerts integrative effects on the cellular environment and metabolism of the immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). However, little is known about the role of AhR in the induction of trained immunity.</p>
<p>In the present study, we show that IS-trained immune responses, characterized by the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, were inhibited by GNF351, an AhR antagonist (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B-D</xref>), accompanied by repression of enriched H3K4me3 on <italic>TNFA</italic> and <italic>IL6</italic> promoters in IS-trained macrophages (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), indicating an AhR-dependent mechanism. However, increased glycolysis and mitochondria respiration in IS-trained macrophages were not suppressed by the blockade of AhR activation with GNF351, suggesting the AhR activation is not directly involved in metabolic rewiring in IS-trained immunity (Fig. S4B-C).</p>
<p>Metabolic rewiring, especially upregulation of aerobic glycolysis, is known as a major mechanism underlying the induction of trained immunity <italic>via</italic> regulation of epigenetic modification by metabolites, such as mevalonate and fumarate generated from this metabolic rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). In addition to the bidirectional link between enhanced glycolysis and activating histone modifications, recent studies have demonstrated that immune priming long non-coding RNAs (IPLs) also induce epigenetic reprogramming by influencing 3D nuclear architecture(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) and that RUNX1, a transcription factor, contributes to the induction of trained immunity by overexpression of RUNX1 target genes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), suggesting that a variety of mechanism is involved in epigenetic modification in trained immunity.</p>
<p>Although inducers of trained immunity, such as β-glucan, BCG, uric acid, and oxLDL, initiate intracellular signaling and metabolic pathways, each <italic>via</italic> different receptors, the most common pathway is the Akt/mTOR/HIF1α-dependent induction of aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Our data also revealed that training with IS led to enhanced glycolysis, which is critical for the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS stimulation as confirmed by experiments with 2DG, a glycolysis inhibitor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). Recent studies have shown that IS activates mTORC1 in a variety of cells such as epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and THP-1 cells mainly <italic>via</italic> the Organic Anion Transporters (OAT)/NADPH oxidase/ROS pathway, but not the AhR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Our findings suggest that IS-trained macrophages acquire the characteristics of trained immunity by AhR-dependent and -independent mechanisms and enhances proinflammatory responses upon secondary stimulation. Thus, addressing the mechanism underlying AhR-independent metabolic rewiring in IS-trained macrophages will require further investigations.</p>
<p>A finding of particular interest in our study is that the induction of IS-induced trained immunity is dependent on the AhR-ALOX5/ALOX5AP axis, as depicted by RNA-Seq analysis and confirmatory <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of mRNA and protein expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and Fig. S5). ALOX5 and ALOX5AP are major rate-limiting enzymes associated with the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway, involved in the production of leukotrienes, proinflammatory lipid mediators derived from AA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Among leukotrienes, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), an extremely potent inflammatory mediator, binds to G protein-coupled protein, LTB4R, and enhances inflammatory responses by increased phagocytosis and activation of the signaling pathway for the production of cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Mechanistically, the LTB4-LTB4R signaling pathway induces the PI3K/Akt or NF-κB pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). AhR-dependent LTB4 production through enhanced ALOX5 expression in hepatocytes reportedly induces hepatotoxicity <italic>via</italic> neutrophil infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). The increase in ALOX5 activity and LTB4 expression has been reported in patients with ESRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) and ALOX5 mediates mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in mononuclear cells of ESRD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Thus, antagonists of ALOX5/ALOX5AP have been used for treatment in CKD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Consistent with these findings, peripheral monocytes derived from ESRD patients in our cohort have increased expression of ALOX5 and this increase was maintained after differentiation into macrophages with M-CSF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-H</xref>). Considering that pretreatment with the uremic serum of ESRD patients elicits a change in gene expression and cytokine production as observed in IS-trained macrophages, it is likely that increased ALOX5 in monocytes and macrophages of ESRD patients is mediated by IS in uremic serum. Our previous studies have shown that IS is an important uremic toxin in the serum of ESRD patients that elicits proinflammatory responses of monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Furthermore, the AhR-ALOX5-LTB4R1 pathway is involved in IS-induced trained immunity of patients with ESRD.</p>
<p>Recent studies have demonstrated that trained immunity of macrophages is implicated in the pathogenesis of CVD, such as atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Considering a higher plasma level of IS in ESRD patients even after hemodialysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), this is potentially difficult to reconcile with trained immunity in which there typically is a short exposure to the training stimulus followed by a period of rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, when ESRD monocytes exposed to the IS in the circulation enter atherosclerotic plaques and differentiate into macrophages, they are no longer exposed to IS, because this is protein-bound and hence not expected to the present in the plaque microenvironment.</p>
<p>Murine models have been widely used to investigate the specific contribution of inducers of trained immunity and the underlying mechanisms to a long-term functional modification of innate cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Mice trained with β-glucan enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β by monocytes and macrophages in response to secondary microbial stimuli and subsequently obtain increased protection against various microbial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> mouse experiments for trained immunity demonstrate that IS-trained immunity has biological relevance (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Previous studies have shown that intraperitoneal injection of exogenous IS into wild-type C57BL/6 mice leads to an increase of IS in the plasma until 3∼6 hr post-injection despite its rapid excretion by the kidney. In this period, the expression of pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and pro-apoptotic genes in peritoneal macrophages was upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of IS daily for 3 days elevates IS in the plasma of mice and activates the mTORC1 signaling pathway in the mouse kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). This suggests that the IS-injected mouse model is suitable for investigating the mechanisms underlying IS-mediated immune responses. Our data show increased TNF-α in serum after injection of LPS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). Moreover, ALOX5 protein expression was increased in splenic myeloid cells derived from IS-trained mice and <italic>ex vivo</italic> stimulation with LPS for 24 hr induced TNF-α expression in these splenic myeloid cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6K-M</xref>). Thus, this suggests a systemic induction of IS-trained immunity in the mouse model.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the current study provides new insight into the role of IS as an inducer of trained immunity as well as the underlying mechanisms in human monocytes/macrophages by investigating the effect of IS <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> using experimental models of trained immunity. Here, we demonstrate that IS, a major uremic toxin, induces trained immunity characterized by the increased proinflammatory TNF-α and IL-6 in human monocytes following secondary stimulation through epigenetic modification and metabolic rewiring. IS-mediated activation of AhR is involved in the induction of trained immunity through enhanced expression of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism-related genes such as ALOX5 and ALOX5AP. Monocytes from patients with ESRD exhibit increased expression of ALOX5 and after 6-day resting, they exhibit enhanced TNF-α and IL-6 production to LPS. Furthermore, the uremic serum of ESDR patients causes HC-derived monocytes to increase the production of TNF-α and IL-6 upon LPS restimulation, implying IS-mediates trained immunity in patients. Supporting our <italic>in vitro</italic> findings, mice trained with IS and their splenic myeloid cells had increased production of TNF-α after <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic> LPS stimulation. These results suggest that IS plays an important role in the induction of trained immunity, which is critical in inflammatory immune responses in patients with CKD and thus, it holds potential as a therapeutic target.</p>

<p>In this study, Kim et al. investigated the mechanism by which uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS) induces trained immunity, resulting in augmented pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as TNF and IL-6. The authors claim that IS treatment induced epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-mediated arachidonic acid pathway is required for establishing trained immunity in human monocytes. They also demonstrated that uremic sera from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients can generate trained immunity in healthy control-derived monocytes.</p>
<p>These are interesting results that introduce the important new concept of trained immunity and its importance in showing endogenous inflammatory stimuli-induced innate immune memory. Additional evidence proposing that IS plays a critical role in the initiation of inflammatory immune responses in patients with CKD is also interesting and a potential advance of the field. This study is in large part well done, but some components of the study are still incomplete and additional efforts are required to nail down the main conclusions.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>1. Of greatest concern, there are concerns about the rigor of these experiments, whether the interpretation and conclusions are fully supported by the data. 1) Although many experiments have been sporadically conducted in many fields such as epigenetic, metabolic regulation, and AhR signaling, the causal relationship between each mechanism is not clear. 2) Throughout the manuscript, no distinction was made between the group treated with IS for 6 days and the group treated with the second LPS (addressed below). 3) Besides experiments using non-specific inhibitors, genetic experiments including siRNA or KO mice should be examined to strengthen and justify central suggestions.</p>
<p>2. The authors showed that IS-trained monocytes showed no change in TNF or IL-6, but increased the expression levels of TNF and IL-6 in response to the second LPS (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the different LPS responsiveness in IS-trained monocytes caused altered gene expression of TNF and IL-6. However, the authors also showed that IS-trained monocytes without LPS stimulation showed increased levels of H3K4me3 at the TNF and IL-6 loci, as well as highly elevated ECAR and OCR, leading to no changes in TNF and IL-6. Therefore, it is unclear why or how the epigenetic and metabolic states of IS-trained monocytes induce different LPS responses. For example, increased H3K4me3 in HK2 and PFKP is important for metabolic rewiring, but why increased H3K4me3 in TNF and IL6 does not affect gene expression needs to be explained.</p>
<p>3. The authors used human monocytes cultured in human serum without growth factors such as MCSF for 5-6 days. When we consider the short lifespan of monocytes (1-3 days), the authors need to explain the validity of the experimental model.</p>
<p>4. The authors' ELISA results clearly showed increased levels of TNF and IL-6 proteins, but it is well established that LPS-induced gene expression of TNF and IL-6 in monocytes peaked within 1-4 hours and returned to baseline by 24 hours. Therefore, authors need to investigate gene expression at appropriate time points.</p>
<p>5. It is a highly interesting finding that IS induces trained immunity via the AhR pathway. The authors also showed that the pretreatment of FICZ, an AhR agonist, was good enough to induce trained immunity in terms of the expression of TNF and IL-6. However, from this point of view, the authors need to discuss why trained immunity was not affected by kynurenic acid (KA), which is a well-known AhR ligand accumulated in CKD and has been reported to be involved in innate immune memory mechanisms (Fig. S1A).</p>
<p>6. The authors need to clarify the role of IL-10 in IS-trained monocytes. IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can be modulated by AhR, whose expression (Fig. 1E, Fig. 4D) may explain the inflammatory cytokine expression of IS-trained monocytes.</p>
<p>7. The authors need to show H3K4me3 levels in TNF and IL6 genes in all conditions in one figure. (Fig. 2B). Comparing Fig. 2B and Fig. S2B, H3K4me3 does not appear to be increased at all by LPS in the IL6 region.</p>
<p>8. The authors need to address the changes of H3K4me3 in the presence of MTA.</p>
<p>9. Interpretation of ChIP-seq results is not entirely convincing due to doubts about the quality of sequencing results. First, authors need to provide information on the quality of ChIP-seq data in reliable criteria such as Encode Pipeline. It should also provide representative tracks of H3K4me3 in the TNF and IL-6 genes (Fig. 2F). And in Fig. 2F, the author showed the H3K4me3 track of replicates, but the results between replicates were very different, so there are concerns about reproducibility. Finally, the authors need to show the correlation between ChIP-seq (Fig. 2) and RNA-seq (Fig. 5).</p>
<p>10. AhR changes in the cell nucleus should be provided (Fig. 4A).</p>
<p>11. Do other protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs), such as PCS, HA, IAA, and KA, change the mRNA expression of ALOX5, ALOX5AP, and LTB4R1? In the absence of genetic studies, it is difficult to be certain of the ALOX5-related mechanism claimed by the authors.</p>
<p>12. Fig.6 is based on the correlated expression of inflammatory genes or AA pathway genes. It does not clarify any mechanisms the authors claimed in the previous figures.</p>

<p>The manuscript entitled, &quot;Uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate induces trained immunity via the AhR-dependent arachidonic acid pathway in ESRD&quot; demonstrates that indoxyl sulfate (IS) induces trained immunity in monocytes via epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, resulting in augmented cytokine production. The authors conducted well-designed experiments to show that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contributes to IS-trained immunity by enhancing the expression of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism-related genes such as arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5) and ALOX5 activating protein (ALOX5AP). Overall, this is a very interesting study that highlights that IS mediated trained immunity may have deleterious outcomes in augmented immune responses to the secondary insult in ESRD. Key findings would help to understand accelerated inflammation in CKD or RSRD.</p>
