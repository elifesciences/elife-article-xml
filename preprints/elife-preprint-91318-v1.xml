<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Aldosterone is a potent cholesterol-derived steroid hormone that plays a major role in controlling blood pressure via regulation of blood volume. The release of aldosterone is typically controlled by the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, situated in the adrenal glands, kidneys, and lungs. Here, we reveal that the class A scavenger receptor MARCO, expressed on alveolar macrophages, negatively regulates aldosterone production and suppresses angiotensin converting enzyme (Ace) expression in the lung. Collectively, our findings point to alveolar macrophages as additional players in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and introduce a novel example of interplay between the immune and endocrine systems.</p>

<p>The scavenger receptor MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure), a class A scavenger receptor, is primarily expressed on macrophages including tumour-associated macrophages, and lung macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. MARCO, upregulated in response to pathogenic challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, has been implicated in defence against pathogens in the lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, phagocytosis and clearance of tumor cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, internalisation of exosomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and has been touted as a potential target in anti-cancer immunotherapy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The class A scavenger receptors have a broad ligand specificity and similar domain structures, comprising a cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane region, spacer region, α helical coiled domain, collagenous domain, and a C-terminal cysteine- rich domain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Known endogenous ligands for the receptor include, like other class A receptors, modified forms of low-density lipoprotein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> indicating that this receptor could be involved in the modulation of cholesterol availability. Scavenger receptors have previously been implicated in corticosteroid output from the adrenal gland. Specifically, Scavenger Receptor BI (SR-BI) was shown to regulate glucocorticoid responses via binding of serum cholesterol, the necessary substrate for adrenal corticosteroids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Aldosterone, the other major adrenal cortex-derived corticosteroid, is known to be regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is situated in the adrenals, lung, and kidney.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. While a role for scavenger receptors in regulating glucocorticoid responses has been demonstrated, the role of macrophage-expressed scavenger receptors in the regulation of adrenal corticosteroid output at steady state has not yet been explored.</p>
<p>It is known that statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs have been shown to reduce aldosterone levels in humans <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that cholesterol supplementation boosts the production of aldosterone from cultured cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Given that the adrenal-derived mouse corticosteroids, most notably corticosterone and aldosterone, derive from cholesterol as the common precursor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) we hypothesised that cholesterol binding scavenger receptors could modulate adrenal corticosteroid output by regulating the availability of cholesterol that could feed into the steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway. To test this hypothesis, we measured the concentrations of aldosterone and corticosterone in the plasma of Marco<sup>-/-</sup> and wild-type mice. We found that male Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice had significantly elevated levels of plasma aldosterone relative to wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In contrast, plasma corticosterone levels were not significantly altered in mice lacking Marco (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Marco- deficient female mice did not have altered levels of aldosterone or corticosterone relative to wild-type counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d, e</xref>). We observed that the adrenal glands from Marco-deficient mice were significantly lighter than wild type controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). To establish whether cholesterol could explain the elevated plasma aldosterone we observe in Marco-deficient mice, we measured the levels of total serum cholesterol and intra-adrenal cholesterol. To our surprise, we found that Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice had reduced serum cholesterol relative to wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), while the normalised levels of intra-adrenal cholesterol were similar between both mouse strains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Taken collectively, these findings suggest that, while Marco-deficient mice have elevated plasma aldosterone concentrations, this is not dependent on systemic or local cholesterol availability.</p>

<p>We next hypothesised that adrenal gland-derived <italic>Marco</italic> could play a role in modulating aldosterone output. Analysis of publicly available Single cell sequencing data from murine adrenal glands shows that adrenals do contain a substantial population of macrophages expressing <italic>Ptprc</italic> (CD45), <italic>Adgre1</italic> (F4/80), and <italic>Cd68</italic> (CD68). However, we did not detect Marco expression in this cluster of cells, nor any other cluster identified in our analyses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This finding was corroborated by immunostaining of male murine adrenal glands, which showed CD68+ macrophages in the adrenal zona fasciculata and zona glomerulosa that did not stain positively for MARCO (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Given that the lung is another site in the RAAS axis, we postulated that Marco-expressing cells in the lung could be involved in mediating the aldosterone phenotype we observed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. Indeed, single cell RNA seq analysis of the murine lung shows that <italic>Ptprc</italic> (CD45), <italic>Adgre1</italic> (F4/80), and <italic>Cd68</italic> (CD68) expressing cells (Alveolar Macrophages) also express <italic>Marco (</italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>), a finding corroborated by immunostaining in the lung (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). To further validate our single cell sequencing and immunofluorescence data, we carried out qPCR for <italic>Marco</italic> in the lungs and adrenal glands from WT and Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which further demonstrated that the lung is the primary site of Marco expression in the RAAS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>

<p>Aldosterone is a potent blood pressure-regulating hormone, the dysregulation of which can cause severe hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk. It therefore follows that its production is tightly regulated. Aldosterone biosynthesis is fundamentally regulated intra- adrenally by cytochrome P450 family members in the corticosteroid biosynthetic pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We therefore tested whether altered expression of enzymes in this pathway could explain the hyperaldosteronism observed in Marco-deficient mice. Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed similar expression of aldosterone biosynthetic enzymes (<italic>Star, Cyp11a1. Hsd3b1, Cyp11b1, Cyp11b2)</italic> as wild type mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-e</xref>). While <italic>Cyp11b2</italic> (aldosterone synthase) is only expressed in the adrenal zona glomerulosa, other biosynthetic enzymes essential for aldosterone production are expressed in the zona fasciculata.</p>

<p>CYP11B1 catalyses the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone. Corticosterone can be catalysed to aldosterone by CYP11B2. In this sense, the route via CYP11B1 is a bona fide route for the generation of aldosterone, as evidenced by the fact that <italic>Cyp11b1</italic> deletion in mice results in a significant reduction in aldosterone production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. This route is one that is suppressible via the suppressive action of dexamethasone on ACTH and <italic>Cyp11b1</italic> expression. Moreover, ACTH is a known stimulator of aldosterone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Dexamethasone-mediated suppression of the zona fasciculata (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>) (Finco et al. 2018) was used to test whether the elevated aldosterone phenotype was zona fasciculata-dependent. Marco-deficient mice fed dexamethasone-supplemented drinking water had plasma aldosterone concentrations comparable to vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>), indicating zona fasciculata activity does not contribute to elevated aldosterone levels in Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Taken collectively, these findings indicate that elevated aldosterone observed in Marco-deficient mice arises extra-adrenally and can therefore be considered a form of secondary hyperaldosteronism. Kidney-derived renin is the initiating hormone in the enzymatic cascade that generates angiotensin II, a potent stimulator of adrenal aldosterone production. We therefore compared plasma renin activity between WT and Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice, finding no significant differences between the two strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated whether lung-derived angiotensin converting enzyme (<italic>Ace</italic>) could explain the elevated aldosterone levels observed in Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice. ACE in the lung catalyses the conversion of Angiotensin I to the aldosterone-stimulating peptide Angiotensin II. We carried out a qPCR test for <italic>Ace</italic> in the lungs of WT and Marco<sup>-/-</sup> mice, finding that Marco- deficient animals had elevated levels of lung <italic>Ace</italic> relative to WT controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining of WT and Marco<sup>-/-</sup> lungs revealed a substantially higher level of ACE protein in Marco-deficient mice, while myeloid presence, as measured by CD68 staining, remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). While low levels of ACE expression could be detected in CD68+ cells (data not shown), the vast majority of ACE was outside of monocytes and macrophages. We used image analysis software to quantify these changes, finding that ACE median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was significantly increased in Marco-deficient lungs, while CD68+ myeloid cells were present in wild type and knock-out animals at similar levels. We then turned back to analysis of single cell RNA-seq data to identify the cells in the lung that could be mediating this effect. In the lung, unsupervised cluster analysis revealed a total of 12 cell clusters with distinct gene expression signatures (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). We determined the identity of each cell cluster based on the expression of established cell type-specific marker genes, aided by the marker genes identified and outlined in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>. We next used dot plots to visualize expression of <italic>Marco</italic> and <italic>Ace</italic> across the different cell clusters. We observed notable <italic>Marco</italic> expression only in Alveolar Macrophages amongst the different cell clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). <italic>Ace</italic> was shown to be primarily expressed by lung endothelial clusters 1 and 2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>), in agreement with what is known about lung <italic>Ace</italic> expression. Taken collectively, these data suggest a model whereby MARCO+ Alveolar Macrophages, in responses to an as-of-yet unidentified factor, inhibit <italic>Ace</italic> expression at the gene and protein level, and thereby negatively regulate the cleavage of Angiotensin I to form Angiotensin II, and thereby aldosterone production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>).</p>

<p>In conclusion, we hereby demonstrate that Marco is a negative regulator of aldosterone production, via suppression of angiotensin converting enzyme expression in the lung. We propose a model in which extra-adrenal Marco+ alveolar macrophages, through tissue crosstalk with lung endothelial cells, actively inhibit Ace expression and thereby inhibit the production of aldosterone from the adrenal glands.</p>
<p>Multiple studies over preceding decades have shown that macrophages are much more than simply immune and inflammatory cells. Macrophages have been shown to mediate a wide variety of physiological functions and support homeostasis in virtually every tissue they are found <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Our original hypothesis centred on the regulation of corticosteroid output via modulation of cholesterol availability. While we ended up disproving this hypothesis, we did provide a novel example of the non-immune functions of tissue macrophages. It was recently shown that tissue infiltrating macrophages cause neuronal cell death and effective denervation, which disrupts normal melatonin secretion in a model of cardiovascular disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to report that macrophages are involved in the regulation of hormonal output <italic>in vivo</italic> at steady state. It is known that immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine can increase blood pressure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> yet the mechanism remains incompletely understood. This observation is consistent with our data showing macrophage-mediated negative regulation of the blood pressure-controlling hormone aldosterone. Additionally, the fact that higher ACE/ACE2 ratios have been linked to hypertension and worse outcomes in Covid-19 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> could implicate MARCO in the susceptibility to severe disease. However, important questions remain to be answered, such as the precise mechanism by which MARCO+ alveolar macrophages suppress Ace expression, and the ligand(s) responsible for stimulating this effect via the MARCO receptor. Our findings presented here nevertheless introduce a new immune-centred paradigm in the renin angiotensin aldosterone system that could be amenable to therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Tissue collection</title>
<p>All tissues were collected from 8-11 week old male mice that were culled between 0930-1100. Mice were euthanised by intraperitoneal injection of 10μL/g 200mg/mL Pentoject (pentobarbital sodium; Animalcare). Following cessation of the pedal motor reflex a sample of blood was taken from the right atrium prior to perfusion through the left ventricle with 20mL 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma Aldrich). Adrenal glands were dissected, and the peri-adrenal fat removed using a stereomicroscope. Following harvest, adrenal glands and lungs were frozen at -80°C until subsequent molecular analyses or fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) prior to histological analyses. Bloods obtained prior to perfusion were collected into EDTA coated tubes to prevent clotting and centrifuged at 1000g for 15 minutes to separate plasma. Plasma samples were frozen at -80°C in 1.5mL Eppendorf tubes until subsequent analyses.</p>

<p>Publicly available single cell RNA-seq datasets (steady- state adrenal: PMID 33571131, GEO accession number GSE161751; steady-state lung: PMID 30283141, GEO accession number GSE109774) were processed, explored and visualised using Cellenics® community instance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biomage.net/">https://scp.biomage.net/</ext-link>) hosted by Biomage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biomage.net/">https://biomage.net/</ext-link>). For the adrenal dataset the classifier filter was disabled as the sample had been pre-filtered. The cell size distribution filter was disabled. A mitochondrial content filter was used, with the absolute threshold method used (bin step = 0.05, maximum fraction = 0.1). The number of genes vs UMI filter was used with a linear fit and P value = 0.0004906771. The doublet filter was used (bin step = 0.05, probability threshold = 0. 8743427. The harmony algorithm was used for data integration (2000 genes, log normalisation). The RPCA method was used for dimensionality reduction (13 principal components). Cells and clusters were visualised using UMAP embedding with the cosine distance metric (minimum distance = 0.2). Louvain clustering was the clustering algorithm used in this analysis (resolution = 0.6). For the lung dataset the classifier filter was disabled as the sample had been pre-filtered. A cell size distribution filter was utilised with binStep = 200 and minimum cell size = 1669. A mitochondrial content filter was used, with the absolute threshold method used, bin step = 0.3, maximum fraction = 0. The number of genes vs UMI filter was used with a linear fit and P value = 0.001. The doublet filter was used with bin step = 0.02 and probability threshold = 0.7616616. The harmony algorithm was used for data integration (2000 genes, log normalisation). The RPCA method was used for dimensionality reduction (24 principal components). Cells and clusters were visualised using UMAP embedding with the cosine distance metric (minimum distance = 0.3). Louvain clustering was the clustering algorithm used in this analysis (resolution = 0.8).</p>

<title>Cryo-sectioning and antibody staining</title>
<p>Prior to tissue embedding, adrenal glands were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose solution (in PBS) overnight. Cryoprotected adrenal glands were embedded in OCT embedding medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. 15um sections were cut from embedded tissues using a Leica cryostat and mounted onto charged microscope slides. Cryosectioned tissue slices were thawed in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, tissue sections were circled using a super PAP pen (Life Technologies), blocked and permeabilised for 1 hour at room temperature in perm/block solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 2% goat serum, 1% Triton X-100, 0.01% NaN3 in PBS). Slides were stained with CD68-AF647 (clone FA-11, BioLegend), chicken anti-GFP (ab13970, Abcam) with goat anti-chicken AF488 (A11039, Invitrogen), mouse anti-MARCO (ED31, BioRad) with goat anti-mouse AF546 (A-11030, Invitrogen), and rabbit anti-ACE (MA5-32741, Invitrogen) with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 Tyramide Super Boost kit (Invitrogen, B40922). Primary stains were done overnight at 4°C and secondary stains were done for 1 hour at room temperature. The goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 Tyramide Super Boost kit was used as per manufacturer’s instructions. DAPI counterstains were done at 1:1000 for 5 minutes at room temperature. Fluoromount G mounting medium (Invitrogen) was used to mount coverslips to slides which were then sealed with clear nail varnish. Immunofluorescence images were acquired using the Zeiss 880 confocal microscope and images were analysed in FIJI.</p>

<title>RT-PCR</title>
<p>Tissues were homogenised using the Precellys Hard Tissue Grinding Kit (MK28-R; Bertin Technologies). Total RNA from homogenised adrenals or lungs was isolated using RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (Qiagen, cat# 74034). cDNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) and random primers (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) in C1000 Touch™ Thermal Cycler (BioRad). B-actin was used as the housekeeping gene to normalize samples. We used the following formula to calculate the relative expression levels: RQ = 2<sup>^−ΔCt</sup> × 100 = 2<sup>−(Ct gene of interest – Ct β actin)</sup> × 100.

<title>Digital image analysis</title>
<p>Quantitation of the area and intensities of immunofluorescent stains was done using FIJI image analysis software. Three cryosections of stained lung tissue (∼5mm<sup>2</sup> tissue acquired per section) were analysed per mouse. CD68+ cells were segmented using the Otsu thresholding plugin. The parameters were adjusted manually to ensure optimum cell segmentation. DAPI- stained nuclei were segmented using the Otsu thresholding plugin. Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for ACE was measured via the integrated density of the stain, which was normalised to the area of DAPI staining.</p>

However, the strength of evidence, as of now, is <bold>incomplete</bold>, as the sole description of the phenotype of MARCO-deficient mice is insufficient to claim that MARCO in alveolar macrophages can negatively regulate ACE expression and aldosterone production at steady-state. The work will be of broad interest to cell biologists and immunologists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The investigators sought to determine whether Marco regulates the levels of aldosterone by limiting uptake of its parent molecule cholesterol in the adrenal gland. Instead, they identify an unexpected role for Marco on alveolar macrophages in lowering the levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the lung. This suggests an unexpected role of alveolar macrophages and lung ACE in the production of aldosterone.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The investigators suggest an unexpected role for ACE in the lung in the regulation of systemic aldosterone levels.</p>
<p>
The investigators suggest important sex-related differences in the regulation of aldosterone by alveolar macrophages and ACE in the lung.</p>
<p>
Studies to exclude a role for Marco in the adrenal gland are strong, suggesting an extra-adrenal source for the excess Marco observed in male Marco knockout mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the investigators have identified important sex differences in the regulation of extrapulmonary ACE in the regulation of aldosterone levels, the mechanisms underlying these differences are not explored.</p>
<p>
The physiologic impact of the increased aldosterone levels observed in Marco -/- male mice on blood pressure or response to injury is not clear.</p>
<p>
The intracellular signaling mechanism linking lung macrophage levels with the expression of ACE in the lung is not supported by direct evidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tissue-resident macrophages are more and more thought to exert key homeostatic functions and contribute to physiological responses. In the report of O'Brien and Colleagues, the idea that the macrophage-expressed scavenger receptor MARCO could regulate adrenal corticosteroid output at steady-state was explored.

<p>Public Reviews:</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The investigators sought to determine whether Marco regulates the levels of aldosterone by limiting uptake of its parent molecule cholesterol in the adrenal gland. Instead, they identify an unexpected role for Marco on alveolar macrophages in lowering the levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme in the lung. This suggests an unexpected role of alveolar macrophages and lung ACE in the production of aldosterone.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The investigators suggest an unexpected role for ACE in the lung in the regulation of systemic aldosterone levels.
The investigators suggest important sex-related differences in the regulation of aldosterone by alveolar macrophages and ACE in the lung.
Studies to exclude a role for Marco in the adrenal gland are strong, suggesting an extra-adrenal source for the excess Marco observed in male Marco knockout mice.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the investigators have identified important sex differences in the regulation of extrapulmonary ACE in the regulation of aldosterone levels, the mechanisms underlying these differences are not explored.
The physiologic impact of the increased aldosterone levels observed in Marco -/- male mice on blood pressure or response to injury is not clear.
The intracellular signaling mechanism linking lung macrophage levels with the expression of ACE in the lung is not supported by direct evidence.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Tissue-resident macrophages are more and more thought to exert key homeostatic functions and contribute to physiological responses. In the report of O'Brien and Colleagues, the idea that the macrophage-expressed scavenger receptor MARCO could regulate adrenal corticosteroid output at steady-state was explored. The authors found that male MARCO-deficient mice exhibited higher plasma aldosterone levels and higher lung ACE expression as compared to wild-type mice, while the availability of cholesterol and the machinery required to produce aldosterone in the adrenal gland were not affected by MARCO deficiency. The authors take these data to conclude that MARCO in alveolar macrophages can negatively regulate ACE expression and aldosterone production at steady-state and that MARCO-deficient mice suffer from secondary hyperaldosteronism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>If properly demonstrated and validated, the fact that tissue-resident macrophages can exert physiological functions and influence endocrine systems would be highly significant and could be amenable to novel therapies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data provided by the authors currently do not support the major claim of the authors that alveolar macrophages, via MARCO, are involved in the regulation of a hormonal output in vivo at steady-state. At this point, there are two interesting but descriptive observations in male, but not female, MARCO-deficient animals, and overall, the study lacks key controls and validation experiments, as detailed below.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. According to the reviewer's own experience, the comparison between C57BL/6J wild-type mice and knock-out mice for which precise information about the genetic background and the history of breedings and crossings is lacking, can lead to misinterpretations of the results obtained. Hence, MARCO-deficient mice should be compared with true littermate controls.</p>
<p>1. The use of mice globally deficient for MARCO combined with the fact that alveolar macrophages produce high levels of MARCO is not sufficient to prove that the phenotype observed is linked to alveolar macrophage-expressed MARCO (see below for suggestions of experiments).</p>
<p>1. If the hypothesis of the authors is correct, then additional read-outs could be performed to reinforce their claims: levels of Angiotensin I would be lower in MARCO-deficient mice, levels of Antiotensin II would be higher in MARCO-deficient mice, Arterial blood pressure would be higher in MARCO-deficient mice, natremia would be higher in MARCO-deficient mice, while kaliemia would be lower in MARCO-deficient mice. In addition, co-culture experiments between MARCO-sufficient or deficient alveolar macrophages and lung endothelial cells, combined with the assessment of ACE expression, would allow the authors to evaluate whether the AM-expressed MARCO can directly regulate ACE expression.</p>
<p>Recommendations for the authors: please note that you control which revisions to undertake from the public reviews and recommendations for the authors</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. Corticosterone levels in male Marco -/- mice are not significantly different, but there is (by eye) substantially more variability in the knockout compared to the wild type. A power analysis should be performed to determine the number of mice needed to detect a similar % difference in corticosterone to the difference observed in aldosterone between male Marco knockout and wild-type mice. If necessary the experiments should be repeated with an adequately powered cohort.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We are prepared to carry out these power calculations and repeat the experiment if necessary.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. All of the data throughout the MS (particularly data in the lung) should be presented in male and female mice. For example, the induction of ACE in the lungs of Marco-/- female mice should be absent. Similar concerns relate to the dexamethasone suppression studies. Also would be useful if the single cell data could be examined by sex--should be possible even post hoc using Xist etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are prepared to measure the levels of Ace, biosynthetic enzyme expression in female mice by qPCR, and ACE protein expression by IF. Additionally, we will test females using the dexamethasone suppression study. The single cell RNA seq analysis was used primarily to inform our model, not for experimental readout. We will explore the dataset as the reviewer suggests and will add additional plots if the analysis substantively changes our previous findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. IF is notoriously unreliable in the lung, which has high levels of autofluorescence. This is the only method used to show ACE levels are increased in the absence of Marco. Orthogonal methods (e.g. immunoblots of flow-sorted cells, or ideally CITE-seq that includes both male and female mice) should be used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have negative controls for antibody staining. Additionally, we also used qPCR to show an increase in Ace mRNA expression in the lung.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Given the central importance of ACE staining to the conclusions, validation of the antibody should be included in the supplement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The vendor of this antibody has verified by cell treatment to ensure that the antibody binds to the antigen stated .We are prepared to additionally validate the antibody using other tissues as control, though we point out that ACE is expressed, albeit at lower levels, in endothelial cells throughout the body and so some signal is to be expected in most if not all tissues.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The link between alveolar macrophage Marco and ACE is poorly explored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are prepared do co-culture experiments of alveolar macrophages and endothelial cells and measure ACE/Ace expression as a consequence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Mechanisms explaining the substantial sex difference in the primary outcome are not explored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We argue that this would be outside the scope if this project, though we would consider exploring such experiments in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Are there physiologic consequences either in homeostasis or under stress to the increased aldosterone (or lung ACE levels) observed in Marco-/- male mice?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are prepared to measure blood electrolytes and blood pressure in Marco-deficient and Marco-sufficient mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Below is a suggestion of important control or validation experiments to be performed in order to support the authors' claims.</p>
<p>1. It is imperative to validate that the phenotype observed in MARCO-deficient mice is indeed caused by the deficiency in MARCO. To this end, littermate mice issued from the crossing between heterozygous MARCO +/- mice should be compared to each other. C57BL/6J mice can first be crossed with MARCO-deficient mice in F0, and F1 heterozygous MARCO +/- mice should be crossed together to produce F2 MARCO +/+, MARCO +/- and MARCO -/- littermate mice that can be used for experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We recognise the concern of the reviewer but due to limited experimenter availability we are unable to undertake such a breeding programme to address this particular concern.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The use of mice in which AM, but not other cells, lack MARCO expression would demonstrate that the effect is indeed linked to AM. To this end, AM-deficient Csf2rb-deficient mice could be adoptively transferred with MARCO-deficient AM. In addition, the phenotype of MARCO-deficient mice should be restored by the adoptive transfer of wild-type, MARCO-expressing AM. Alternatively, bone marrow chimeras in which only the hematopoietic compartment is deficient in MARCO would be another option, albeit less specific for AM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognise the concern of the reviewer. We have access to an AM cell line which we plan to use to do co-culture experiments with an ACE-expressing endothelial cell line. In this way we will test whether this effect is linked to AMs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. If the hypothesis of the authors is correct, then additional read-outs could be performed to reinforce their claims: levels of Angiotensin I would be lower in MARCO-deficient mice, levels of Antiotensin II would be higher in MARCO-deficient mice, Arterial blood pressure would be higher in MARCO-deficient mice, natremia would be higher in MARCO-deficient mice, while kaliemia would be lower in MARCO-deficient mice. Similar read-outs could also be performed in the models proposed in point 2).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are prepared to measure blood electrolytes and blood pressure (via tail cuff method) in Marco-deficient and Marco-sufficient mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Co-culture experiments between MARCO-sufficient or deficient alveolar macrophages and lung endothelial cells, combined with the assessment of ACE expression, would allow the authors to evaluate whether the AM-expressed MARCO can directly regulate ACE expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this concern, we plan to do a co-culture experiment as outlined above.</p>
<p>Broadly, we thank the reviewers for taking the time to critically appraise this manuscript. The reviewers primary concern seems to be the lack of direct evidence of an effect of AMs on endothelial Ace expresion, which we plan to address as outlined above. We will adjust our conclusions as appropriate based on the results of the experiments outlined above.</p>
