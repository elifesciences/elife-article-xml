<abstract>
<p>Visualizing the structures of small proteins and complexes has been a longstanding challenge in single-particle cryo-EM. Some of these targets have been successfully resolved by binding to antibody fragments (Fabs) or fusing with external scaffolds to increase their size. Recent advances in conventional single-particle techniques have enabled the determination of an in-creasing number of structures smaller than 100 kDa, achieving resolutions relevant to drug research. Compared to X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM preserves the near-native states of biomolecules, can resolve structural heterogeneity, and has the potential to apply to a wide range of targets. In this work, we demonstrate that the alignment and reconstruction of small macromolecular complexes can be significantly improved using high-resolution structures as priors combined with 2D template matching. Using this method, we were able to reconstruct previously intractable targets under 50 kDa and improve the density of the ligand-binding sites in the reconstructions. We envision that this method will further lower the molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM, enabling its application to important drug-binding complexes that are below 50 kDa.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the “resolution revolution” in 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become widely used, emerging as a powerful alternative, and in some cases surpassing X-ray crystallography for structurally challenging samples. In particular, the 1.2 Å reconstruction of apoferritin, where individual hydrogen atoms are resolved, demonstrates that single-particle cryo-EM has now reached true atomic resolution for well-defined systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite recent advances in single-particle cryo-EM, structure determination for sub-50 kDa complexes remains challenging. Among EM structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) since 2015 with resolutions better than 4 Å, 97% correspond to macromolecules larger than 50 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Small complexes contain fewer atoms and scatter fewer electrons, leading to images with lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Particle alignment, typically based on calculating the cross-correlation coefficients between the particle and reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), depends on the amount of phase contrast (signal) in the image. The weak contrast of small complexes against back-ground noise makes it difficult to align particles accurately to calculate a high-resolution reconstruction. Moreover, single-particle experiments typically apply a total exposure of 30-50 electrons per Å<sup>2</sup>, leading to accumulating radiation damage. The diffusion of small particle due to beam-induced motion may further damage the alignable high-resolution signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Extending single-particle cryo-EM to sub-50 kDa targets will open new avenues for studying critical drug-binding interactions and advance structure-based drug discovery. Approximately 75% of proteins in the human proteome are below 50 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). While X-ray crystallography is not inherently limited by small molecular weight, it requires well-ordered crystals, which are often difficult to obtain. Solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, on the other hand, provide atomic-level information derived from observables such as chemical shifts. However, these methods are generally limited to smaller particles, require highly concentrated samples, and data analysis is laborious, making them less suitable for high-throughput studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Single-particle cryo-EM offers unique benefits compared to these two techniques, producing rich structural data in the form of images and enabling the visualization of biomolecules in near-native states at high resolution without the need for crystallization. To overcome the lower size barrier in cryo-EM, many strategies focus on increasing the apparent size and rigidity of small particles by binding them to external scaffolds or antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, finding good scaffolds or antibodies is difficult, and they sometimes create structural artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Thus, there remains an incentive to develop approaches that enable high-resolution structure determination of isolated sub-50 kDa complexes in their near-native conformations.</p>
<p>Theoretical estimates of the lower molecular weight limit, dating back to 1995, suggested that a 3D reconstruction at 3 Å resolution is possible for particles as small as 38 kDa, given that ∼12,600 images are averaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). This calculation assumed perfect images, a perfect reference to align the particle images, and a total exposure limited to 5 electrons Å<sup><italic>−</italic>2</sup>. Later, using the Rose criterion, a more optimistic prediction of 17 kDa was calculated, requiring only one-ninth as many images to be averaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Since those early calculations, single-particle cryo-EM has seen significant technical advancements. The introduction of direct electron detectors (DEDs), combined with exposure weighting, now al-lows much higher electron exposures by recording data as movies and improving image resolution through motion correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). More recently, the development of a laser phase plate offers the potential to further improve image contrast by using a high-intensity laser beam to introduce a stable and tunable phase shift to enhance low-resolution features in samples with weak contrast such as small complexes (19– 22). Additionally, cooling specimens at liquid-helium temperatures can slow the effects of radiation damage and reduce information loss during imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Recent work has shown that using gold specimen support with 100 nm diameter holes at liquid-helium temperatures allowed imaging with better quality compared to liquid-nitrogen temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). 2D template matching (2DTM) was previously developed to identify particles in cellular cryo-EM images using a high-resolution template with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). In a 2DTM search, cross-correlation coefficients are calculated between the image and the template to determine the targets’ location and orientation. Previous work from our lab has shown that molecular features not in the template can be reconstructed from 2DTM-derived targets with high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Building upon this, in this paper, we show that the alignment of sub-50 kDa complexes can be improved using 2DTM and stringent particle selection. We apply this method to a previously published dataset of the ∼41 kDa catalytic domain of protein kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and demonstrate improved reconstruction of its ligand-binding sites. We develop a theoretical framework showing that the lower molecular weight limit can be further reduced to approximately 7.1 kDa with an exhaustive five-dimensional search, and to 5.7 kDa with a constrained search, assuming phase plate and liquid-helium cooling are used. Our findings highlight the potential of 2DTM to expand the applicability of cryo-EM to a broader range of biologically and pharmaceutically important targets, paving the way for structural studies of previously inaccessible small complexes.</p>

<title>Unbiased reconstruction of omitted densities in a 41 kDa protein kinase</title>
<p>We evaluated the ability of 2DTM to recover ligand densities without model bias by performing a template matching search and reconstruction with specific features omitted from the template. We used the published dataset of a 41.3 kDa protein kinase (EMPIAR-10252) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Particle stacks were generated from single-particle data using coordinates output from 2DTM searches with templates missing certain structural components. A subset of particles was then selected based on 2DTM statistics and image quality measurement from fits of the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the micrographs these particles came from. The selected particle stack was used for 3D reconstruction. This “omit-template” strategy follows the <italic>baited reconstruction</italic> approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and was designed to detect template bias in reconstructions calculated from targets detected by 2DTM. Here, we use it to show that we can reconstruct the density of small ligands that are not included in the template but are bound to the imaged molecules in the cryo-EM dataset. We explored a range of template deletion scenarios: from omitting ATP and residues on an alpha-helix, to removing the binding pockets around ATP at various radii. Below, we detail how each deletion strategy affected the final density map. Consistently, we found that ATP density was robustly recovered even when ATP was deleted from the 2DTM search template. These results demonstrate that 2DTM can recover ligand densities, providing biological insights into ligand binding and flexibility. The density is free of template bias where corresponding density in the template was omitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Deleting ATP, inhibitor, and an alpha-helical turn</title>
    <p>We used the 2.2 Å X-ray model (PDBID: 1ATP, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)) to generate a high-resolution 3D template in which the ATP, two Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions, and six alpha-helix residues (residues 222-227) were deleted from the model. The final template, with a molecular weight of 40.7 kDa, was simulated using the <monospace>simulate</monospace> program in <italic>cis</italic>TEM with a uniform B-factor of 30 Å<sup>2</sup> at a pixel size of 1.117 Å/pixel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Using the previously developed 2DTM p-value for particle picking and angular alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), we performed 2DTM searches at Nyquist resolution and generated an initial stack of candidate particles, which were then subjected to further selection using 2DTM-derived statistics and CTF fitting parameters. A final stack of 7,353 particles were used for 3D reconstruction in <italic>cis</italic>TEM. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> compares the cryo-EM maps from the single-particle reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), the 2DTM template, and the 2DTM-based reconstruction. The angular distribution of the 2DTM-derived particle stack and the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) curve are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. Because particles were aligned to a single high-resolution template during 2DTM, the reported 2.6 Å resolution is <bold>not a gold-standard</bold> FSC and does not reliably reflect true map quality. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> provides a close-up view of the ATP-binding site and the deleted resides. The average Q-score between the 2DTM reconstruction and the X-ray model was calculated using the MapQ commond line tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Q-scores approaching 1 suggests atomic resolution, where individual atoms are resolved. Values near 0.5 indicate visible side chains while scores around 0.2 reflect unresolved side chains but resolved secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The Q-score for ATP was 0.605, indicating good agreement between the 2DTM reconstruction and the X-ray model. Additionally, the shape of the alpha-helix turn is clearly resolved, despite being absent in the template. Since these features were not included in the search template, they did not originate from template bias.</p>

<title>Robust reconstruction of the ATP binding pocket</title>
<p>To test the robustness of 3D reconstruction as more atoms are excluded from the template, we performed a series of 2DTM searches and reconstructions using templates with residues deleted within specified radii of the bound ATP. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, we show the results of three different templates. We tested spherical deletion radii of 3.0 Å (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>) and 5.5 Å (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) centered on the ATP position in the X-ray model. In addition to the ATP binding pocket, we also deleted Mn<sup>2+</sup> in all templates and furthermore deleted IP20, an inhibitory pseudo-peptide substrate, in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>. The molecular weights of templates and numbers of particles in the final stacks are shown in the figure.</p>

</fig>
<p>In all three cases, the reconstructions showed well-defined ATP and Mn<sup>2+</sup> densities in the binding pocket. Average Q-scores between the reconstructed maps and the X-ray model were calculated using MapQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The average Q-score of ATP were 0.607, 0.578, and 0.616, respectively. Although some discontinuity was observed at the chosen contour level (<italic>σ</italic> = 5) in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, the ATP densities in all reconstructions closely matched the ligand shape in the X-ray model. These results suggest that ATP and Mn<sup>2+</sup> densities can be robustly recovered from the data, even when the search template lacks these ligands and nearby residues.</p>
<p>We also found that nearby protein residues were more affected by template deletion than ATP. When residues within 3 Å of ATP were deleted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), most backbone residues were still recovered with Q-scores above 0.50, except for residues 53 (Ser) and 127 (Glu). However, when the deletion radius increased to 5.5 Å (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), the densities corresponding to those residues began to show visible discontinuities. This likely was caused by the overall reduction of signal in the template that contributes to the cross-correlation signal. In contrast, ATP density was consistently recovered more robustly than nearby residues. This may be because small angular misalignments disproportionately blur peripheral residues as their displacement scales with distance from the alignment center, whereas the centrally buried ATP density remains relatively unaffected.</p>
<p>Finally, by comparing <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, we observed that deleting IP20 strongly reduced signal at several residues. IP20 not only contributes to the overall mass (2.2 kDa) of the template but also sits at the edge of the protein, where it may generate distinct low-resolution features that can facilitate alignment. Altogether, our experiments demonstrate that it is safe to delete a ligand and residues in the nearby regions to avoid template bias without destroying too much signal in the re-construction.</p>

<title>2DTM provides more accurate alignments than RELION refinement in omitted regions</title>
<p>To evaluate the quality of particles and poses obtained from 2DTM, we imported the stack of 7,353 particles described in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> into RELION and per-formed skip-alignment 3D classification using five classes. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, Class 5 exhibited noticeably lower resolution than the other classes. We therefore combined Class 1-4 into a new stack of 7,197 particles and carried out both skip-alignment and regular (alignment-enabled) 3D auto-refinement in RELION. Each resulting map was then post-processed and low-pass filtered for comparison. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, in both maps, densities for the deleted residues were recovered. Specifically, the densities at ATP and residues 222-227 obtained with the directly imported 2DTM Euler angles were sharper and more continuous than the same region produced with RELION angular refinement. These results suggest that the 2DTM-derived orientations are more accurate than those determined by RELION. A more quantitative assessment of the alignment accuracies attained by 2DTM and RELION requires further work.</p>

<title>Effective selection strategy enables reconstruction of ATP binding site from around 8k articles</title>
<p>An important difference between our 2DTM approach and the traditional single-particle workflow is the way particles were included in the final 3D reconstruction. In the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), a final stack of 74,413 particles was used to obtain a reconstruction at ∼4.3 Å resolution by gold-standard FSC. The resulting density, however, lacked the expected features at 4 Å, but rather appeared more consistent with a ∼6-7 Å map. In particular, the ATP-binding pocket was not resolved in the map (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). This particle stack included both untilted and 30°-tilted data to reduce preferred orientation. The paper noted that multiple optimizations were attempted, including iterative particle selection based on RELION metadata metrics, but none led to significant improvement.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we implemented a different strategy focused on more stringent particle selection. At the image level, CTF fitting scores from untilted images were computed using CTFFIND5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), and only images with scores between 0.05 and 0.2, corresponding to well-fit CTFs, were retained for subsequent 2DTM searches (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Examples of micro-graphs excluded from 2DTM searches are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. At the particle level, we applied two main selection criteria prior to 3D reconstruction:</p>

<title>2DTM-derived statistics</title>
<p>Due to the small molecular weight of the target, the 2DTM z-score threshold, calculated from the cross-correlations, led to the rejection of most particles and did not yield meaningful detections. Instead, we used the newly developed 2DTM p-value approach to extract particles during the initial processing step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Specifically, instead of using the standard first-quadrant p-values, we calculated a three-quadrant p-value to retain particles with low 2DTM z-scores but high 2DTM SNRs. We found that a p-value threshold of 8.0 consistently gave us the best reconstruction. Following the initial extraction, as described in the Methods section, we applied additional selection steps based on several 2DTM-derived metrics, including 2DTM SNR, and the pixel-level average and standard deviation of cross-correlations from the angular search.</p>

<title>CTF-based ice thickness</title>
<p>We excluded images of thicker samples with reduced high-resolution signal, as indicated by their estimated sample thickness from CTF fitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The distribution of mean defocus and thickness of untilted images are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">c</xref>. The mean defocus was 9900 Å. Given that the largest dimension of the protein ki-nase is ∼65 Å, we selected images with estimated thickness between 100 and 800 Å. We found that images with thick-ness at 300-400 Å contained the most particles based on our criteria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>).</p>
<p>Applying these selection criteria drastically reduced the final stack size. For experiments in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, around ∼8,000 particles were used to generate the reconstruction, only approximately 10% of what was used in the original single-particle pipeline. Despite the order-of-magnitude re-duction in data, the resulting 3D map showed a significant improvement at the ATP and IP20 binding sites. However, we note that the global FSC in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> is not reliable due to the use of the high-resolution template and the resulting template bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Nevertheless, the recovery of density not included in the template confirms that the alignment of the selected particles was sufficiently accurate to generate clear density for the binding sites.</p>
<p>Our experiments underline the importance of selecting good particles, rather than maximizing the number of particles selected. Previous studies have pointed out that many particles in the final stack are unnecessary and removing them can improve reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). In our experiments, we found that including a larger number of low-quality or mis-aligned particles, or false positives, may boost the global FSC but blur out weak features such as ligand densities. To test this, we generated a particle stack using a lowered p-value threshold of 7.0. This larger stack (13,669 particles) led to the degradation of signal in the deleted regions, likely due to increased false positives interfering with the true signal (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Similarly, applying a 2DTM SNR threshold of 7.5 produced a particle stack of comparable size but lower quality, as demonstrated by poor reconstructions in the deleted regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). We also observed preferred orientation as shown by the angular distribution plot of the final stack in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. Since we applied very stringent selection, only 2,551 particles were extracted from the tilted images. However, adding these particles did not improve the density at the deleted regions, as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>. Specifically, the Q-score of the ATP density decreased from 0.605 to 0.584 when keeping other parameters constant. Although particles from tilted images provide additional angular views, the images often have thicker ice, reducing high-resolution information for accurate alignment.</p>

<title>Using predicted structures as templates</title>
<p>It is possible that experimental structures are unavailable for the target of interest. We examine whether predicted structures can be used as templates to validate the predictions, or identify novel structures or interactions. We generated a predicted structure for the protein kinase chain E using AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The atomic model includes IP20, ATP, and Mn<sup>2+</sup>. A high-resolution template was simulated using the same parameters as above using the <monospace>simulate</monospace> program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). We show the comparison between the X-ray model and AlphaFold3 model in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>. Overall, the structures show good agreement, with an RMSD of 0.45 Å across 336 aligned residue pairs. The differences between the AlphaFold3 model and the X-ray structure of protein kinase A are mainly found in the flexible loop regions (e.g., residues 53–55), the surface-exposed side chains, and IP20. In the experiment in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, residues within 3 Å of ATP were removed from the X-ray-derived template. Here, the same residues were deleted from the AlphaFold3-derived template, resulting in a remaining molecular weight of 40.2 kDa. Shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>, the densities of ATP in the AlphaFold3-derived reconstruction was slightly worse than that obtained using the X-ray–derived template, highlighting the importance of template accuracy in enabling efficient detection and reconstruction of small complexes. We also observed that both reconstructions resemble closely the search templates, including differences in the side chain densities (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>). This suggests potential template bias and false positives remained in the particle stack despite the use of stringent selection criteria. Further improvements could involve systematically deleting residues from the predicted model and assessing the impact on the reconstruction, as demonstrated in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>

<title>How small a particle can we study by single-particle cryo-EM</title>
<p>The cross-correlation between the particle image and the reference needs to be larger than the expected cross-correlation between noise and the reference to be alignable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). This lower molecular weight limit of single-particle cryo-EM was estimated as 38 kDa assuming a total exposure (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) of 5 e/Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Later, the estimated limit was lowered to 17 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The primary difference between these two predictions lies in the statistical criteria used to assess image visibility: Henderson in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) required that the intensity of the average Fourier component should be three times the standard deviation of the shot noise, while Glaeser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) applied the Rose criterion. More recent work has shown that it is now possible to reconstruct proteins below 50 kDa and even smaller nucleic acids, with predictions that the lower molecular weight limit could be extended below 20 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Specifically, a high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the 14 kDa hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was obtained from a simulated dataset generated with an ideal phase plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Here, following the rationale of 2DTM, we sought to calculate the lower molecular weight limit for hydrated biological samples for single-particle cryo-EM that takes into account advancements in instrumentation made over the past decades. During 2DTM, cross-correlation coefficients are calculated between the particle image and 2D projections of the template. <italic>Peaks</italic> in the cross-correlation map indicate regions of high similarities between the image and the template. A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be defined as the maximum correlation observed when aligning an image against a reference, divided by the standard deviation of the correlations from the background. We consider two scenarios: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) the image contains pure random noise and the corresponding SNR is SNR<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) the image contains real phase contrast from the target and the corresponding SNR is SNR<sub><italic>s</italic></sub>. In both scenarios, the SNR is expected to be larger than zero because even in the presence of pure noise, a positive correlation will be obtained after aligning the noise image to a reference. Deter-mining the lower molecular weight limit is equivalent to identifying the intersection at which SNR<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> and SNR<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> are equal. When SNR<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> is smaller than SNR<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>, it will be impossible to distinguish signal from noise.</p>
<p>For the first case, cross-correlation coefficients between two pure Gaussian noise images with <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> pixels can be approximated with a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a variance of 1<italic>/N</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>, where <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> is the number of pixels in the image. In cryo-EM particle alignment, a five-dimensional search is performed for each particle, including two translational parameters (<italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic>) and three orientational parame-ters (<italic>φ, θ, ψ</italic>). For each particle, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> correlation coefficients are calculated to find the correct alignment. <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> is dependent on the size of the particle and the resolution limit of the alignment. A larger particle and higher resolution limit require a more finely sampled search space. The parameter set, Θ<sub>0</sub> = {<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>φ</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>θ</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>ψ</italic><sub>0</sub>}, corresponding to the maximum value among <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> correlations, is then used to register the particle’s alignment. We define SNR<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> using the maximum and standard deviation of <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> correlation coefficients. Based on Supporting Information A,
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="675606v1_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This means the more search locations are evaluated, the higher the likelihood of observing a large correlation value purely by chance.</p>
<p>For the second case, we follow Henderson’s assumption that the particle is roughly spherical and consists of only randomly positioned carbon atoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Cross-correlations are calculated between a <italic>M</italic> -frame summed image and 2D projections from the perfect reference. An exposure filter function, <italic>Q</italic>, is applied to reweigh the frames to maximize signal content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Similarly, SNR<sub><italic>s</italic></sub> is defined as the ratio between the maximum cross-correlation and the standard deviation of background correlations. Based on Supporting Information B,
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="675606v1_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>k</italic> is the spatial frequency, <italic>N</italic><sub>0</sub> is the exposure per frame, <italic>D</italic> is the particle diameter, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the cumulative exposure at the <italic>i</italic>th frame, and <italic>f</italic> is the fraction of electrons being elastically scattered. Assuming a total exposure of 5 <italic>e/</italic>Å<sup>2</sup> and a single-frame acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), we derived a simplified form of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref> by assuming a realistic CTF with multiple oscillations, such that the integral ∫<sub><italic>k</italic></sub> CTF(<italic>k</italic>)<sup>2</sup><italic>dk</italic> ≈0.5.

</p>
<p>Under these conditions, we estimate a minimum detectable molecular weight of 38.0 kDa. While this result is numerically similar to Henderson’s original estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), the underlying assumptions differ somewhat. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) assumed ideal imaging conditions without CTF oscillations. In contrast, we assume standard cryo-EM conditions with a realistic CTF and compute the signal and noise terms using different models. In particular, our calculation of the number of correlations calculated (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) is different. Nevertheless, the agreement in molecular weight limit suggests that this value is a reasonable estimate given the main experimental assumptions (single frame acquisition, 5 <italic>e/</italic>Å<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>For movies with multiple frames, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref> can be numerically integrated over spatial frequency range [<italic>k</italic><sub>min</sub>,<italic>k</italic><sub>max</sub>] to calcu-late SNR<sub><italic>s</italic></sub>. <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eqs. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">2</xref> are then plotted across a range of molecular weights to identify their intersection point, shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. The parameters used for these calculations, along with their corresponding values, are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Using conventional single-particle analysis conditions with a resolution limit of 2 Å, which can be achieved by collecting images using a pixel size of 1 Å/pixel, assuming a perfect beam (i.e., no envelope function), and using a total exposure of 45 <italic>e</italic><sup><italic>−</italic></sup><italic>/</italic>Å<sup>2</sup>, particles as small as 14.8 kDa can be accurately aligned through a full search. If considering the inelastic scat-tering from ice with a thickness of 30 nm, particles needs to be at least 16.3 kDa to be detected, which is closely consistent with the prediction of 17 kDa in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Ideally, if thin ice can be obtained, which is just thick enough to embed the particle, considering the defocus variation across the particle along its diameter, and assuming 10% amplitude contrast, the smallest alignable particle is 14.8 kDa. In practice, such thin ice may be difficult to achieve, leading to an increase in the weight limit. If the low-resolution contrast of the particle allows it to be roughly centered in the x,y plane, we may not need to search the entire area covered by the particle. By constraining the translational search to a 5-by-5 pixel region, the molecular weight limit can be reduced to 11.8 kDa under previously mentioned conditions. Further incorporating a 90° phase plate and using zero defocus lower the limit to 7.4 kDa under constrained search conditions. Previous work has shown that electron diffraction spots fade more slowly at liquid-helium temperatures by a factor between 1.2 and 1.8, compared to those at liquid-nitrogen temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Assuming an additional cryo-protection factor of 1.8, particles as small as 5.7 kDa are theoretically alignable by 2DTM.</p>

<title>The reference quality may be a limiting factor of single-particle reconstruction</title>
<p>Images collected in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) are of high quality, where particles in many images can be visually observed. Our CTF analysis shows that 2,108 images in the untilted dataset exhibited Thon rings extending beyond 4 Å. However, the traditional single-particle processing done in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) was limited to 4.3 Å resolution, and features at the ATP-binding site were not resolved. In the same work, the authors analyzed two other sub-100 kDa complexes, the 82 kDa homodimeric enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and the 64 kDa methemoglobin (metHb), and found that very few particles from many images, rather than many particles from very few images, contributed to the final stack used for reconstruction. This was consistent with our results of selecting a subset of particles for the protein kinase dataset, where most images yielded fewer than 10 particles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>). So, what is the limiting factor of the single-particle pipeline? In our assessment, we speculate that the images themselves contain sufficient signal to support a reconstruction beyond 4.3 Å resolution. A possible contributing factor is the suboptimal reference used during 3D refinement. In the work-flow in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), an <italic>ab initio</italic> volume generated by cryoSPARC was low-pass filtered to 20 Å and then used as the initial reference for 3D auto-refinement in RELION. Because this starting map lacked high-resolution features, particle alignment may have been less accurate. Once these misalignments were introduced, subsequent refinement iterations may not be able to fully correct them from the local refinement op-timum that was created earlier. By contrast, the SAM-IV riboswitch, despite having a comparable molecular weight, has distinct asymmetric features even at low resolution. Combined with the stronger scattering of nucleic acids, this likely facilitated more accurate alignment, allowing the traditional single-particle workflow to achieve a high-resolution reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>).</p>

<title>Remaining gaps between experimental and theoretical limits</title>
<p>Despite the progress in cryo-EM, there is still a gap between our predicted lower molecular weight limit in Table. 1 and the smallest template used in our tests (37.3 kDa). Several factors may contribute to this difference: <bold>Beam-induced motion</bold> particularly affects small particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Uncorrected motion can blur high-resolution features and lead to missed detections or misalignments. Al-though Bayesian polishing can partially compensate for beam-induced motion, it depends on sufficient particle signal to model individual trajectories. For very small particles, the per-particle signal may be too weak to reliably support this analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). The protein kinase dataset was collected using UltrAuFoil grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) which have been shown to reduce specimen motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Nevertheless, beam-induced motion remains a factor limiting the signal in cryo-EM images.</p>
<p>Another factor is the <bold>electron beam energy</bold> used for imaging. The images were collected at 200 keV whereas the theoretical calculation presented here assumes 300 keV. Both elastic and inelastic scattering cross-sections increase at lower voltage. A recent study of sub-200 kDa complexes showed that there is no obvious choice of electron energy for imaging smaller complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Any gain in image contrast from stronger elastic scattering may be offset by the increasing inelastic scattering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). However, the lens aberrations are more noticeable at lower energies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). Detectors are also generally optimized for 300 keV electrons. Our calculation assumed a perfect beam whereas the experimental images suffer from spherical and chromatic aberrations. New developments in aberration correction will help obtain atomic-resolution structures of small complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).</p>
<p><bold>Non-ideal experimental conditions</bold> will also widen the gap between theoretical and experimental limits. For example, we assumed the ice is just thick enough to accomodate the particle whereas the images in the protein kinase dataset have varying ice thickness as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>. Additionally, we did not perform a defocus search during 2DTM, instead, we used the average defocus values estimated by CTFFind. Incorporating the defocus search directly into 2DTM may give more accurate estimations in certain cases.</p>
<p>Another contributing factor is the <bold>template generation strategy</bold>. In <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>, the difference map between the template and the reconstruction for the experiment in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> reveals extra densities in the reconstruction at the ATP binding site, as well as at residues 222-227, which were deleted from the template. However, we also observed noisy densities in other regions of the difference map, indicating a limitation of the current template generation approach, which may not fully capture the solvent background.</p>

<p>Considering all these factors, it is clear why single-particle alignment of proteins much below ∼40 kDa remains an outstanding challenge despite the remarkable algorithmic improvement over recent years.

<title>Implications for structure-based drug design</title>
<p>For structure-based drug design (SBDD), obtaining a high-resolution structure of the target (and its ligand complex) is a critical step. X-ray crystallography has long been the dominant method for this purpose, but many protein targets are hard to crystallize, especially those that are flexible or membrane-embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). NMR can handle very small proteins or nucleic acids in solution, but typically offers lower resolution information and is limited to proteins below 25 kDa, otherwise spectra become too complex to interpret without isotope labeling and extra processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Cryo-EM is emerging as a powerful alternative and complementary method and enables structural and functional studies under conditions more closely resembling the native cellular context. One of the major caveat for cryo-EM, however, is the reconstruction of sub-50 kDa complexes.</p>
<p>The 2DTM-based single-particle alignment and reconstruction workflow we proposed here <bold>simplifies</bold> the conventional single-particle pipeline by foregoing iterative rounds of 2D classification, <italic>ab initio</italic> modeling, 3D classification and refinement. 2DTM directly returns particles with their <italic>x, y</italic> position, Euler angles and defocus in <italic>one pass</italic>. Aside from the computational cost of the search itself, the workflow is trivial compared to a single-particle pipeline.</p>
<p>Another motivation for 2DTM is overcoming the <bold>size limit</bold> of cryo-EM. Conventional single-particle workflows have struggled to achieve good reconstructions for particles below 50 kDa, where low contrast makes alignment unreliable with an imperfect reference. To date, only a handful of isolated sub-100 kDa structures have been solved at &lt; 4 Å resolution. Notable examples include the 52 kDa streptavidin tetramer resolved to 3.2 Å using a Volta phase plate and Cs corrector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>), and to 2.6 Å using graphene grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>); the 64 kDa methemoglobin at ∼2.8 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>); and the 39 kDa SAM-IV riboswitch at 3.7 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The 2DTM-based reconstruction method we describe here improves the alignment of small particles, utilizing the high-resolution in-formation from the perfect reference. Our theoretical estimation of the lower molecular weight limit further highlights that for perfect images and a perfect reference, complexes as small as 5.7 kDa can be accurately aligned when using liquid helium cooling and a phase plate.</p>
<p>The workflow we describe here also has the potential to operate as a <bold>screening platform</bold>, enabling structure-guided optimization of small-molecule ligands even for targets below the traditional cryo-EM size limit. High-resolution cryo-EM is already being applied to drug targets that resist crystallization: for example, the high-resolution (up to 1.8 Å) maps of human CDK-activating kinase bound to 15 different inhibitors revealed detailed inhibitor interactions and water net-works in the active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). In another case, cryo-EM captured a novel allosteric mechanism for protein inhibition of the human ATP-citrate lyase that enhances the target’s “druggability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). These studies show that resolving the ligand-bound structures can directly guide design of novel therapeutics. Our workflow can broaden this approach to smaller drug targets. In principle, one could incubate a sub-50 kDa target with various inhibitors then apply 2DTM using the apo structure as the template, which can be determined from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment or AlphaFold predictions. The ligand-bound complex can be located, aligned and reconstructed using 2DTM. 2DTM thus offers a structure-based assay: binding of each inhibitor produces a distinct density feature at the binding site, streamlining hit validation.</p>
<p>In summary, by overcoming the ∼50 kDa barrier, 2DTM opens the door to structural studies of many previously in-accessible drug targets, with the ultimate goal of integrating cryo-EM into high-throughput SBDD.</p>

<title>Toward data-driven refinement of AlphaFold3 models via 2DTM</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that AlphaFold3-predicted structures can be used directly as templates in 2DTM searches to pick particles and reconstruct high-resolution maps, even in the absence of any experimentally determined model. This validates the use of AlphaFold3 as a starting point for structure determination. While the predicted structure may deviate from the true conformation, as shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, the resulting cryo-EM map provides information that can guide further refinement of the AlphaFold3 model. This refined model could then be used as an improved template in a second round of particle picking and reconstruction, allowing recovery of more accurate particles and a higher-quality map. In <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>, we show a deleted residue and the reconstructed densities obtained using both the X-ray template and the AlphaFold3 template. Although the densities are weak and discontinuous, both maps are consistent with the side chain conformation observed in the X-ray model. While we have not yet tested this type of refinement, these preliminary results suggest that this data-driven approach could progressively improve both the structural model and the final reconstruction, starting entirely from prediction.</p>

<p>For two independent Gaussian noise images of <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> pixels, the normalized cross-correlation, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>, is zero on average.

</p>
<p>In cryo-EM particle alignment, normalized cross-correlations are computed between a noisy particle image and a set of clean 2D projections generated at sampled orientations, in order to determine the best-matching position (<italic>x, y</italic>) and orientation. For each particle image, <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> cross-correlations are evaluated, and the alignment is assigned based on the position and orientation corresponding to the maximum cross-correlation. This process is equivalent to drawing the maximal value from <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> Gaussian distributed random variables with zero mean and variance of <inline-formula id="inline-eqn-1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="675606v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper describes an application of the high-resolution cryo-EM 2D template matching technique to sub-50kDa complexes. The paper describes how density for ligands can be reconstructed without having to process cryo-EM data through the conventional single particle analysis pipelines.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This paper contributes additional data (alongside other papers by the same authors) to convey the message that high-resolution 2D template matching is a powerful alternative for cryo-EM structure determination. The described application to ligand density reconstruction, without the need for extensive refinements, will be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry, where often multiple structures of the same protein in complex with different ligands are solved as part of their drug development pipelines. Improved insights into which particles contribute to the best ligand density are also highly valuable and transferable to other applications of the same technique.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the convenient visualisation of small molecules bound to protein targets of a known structure would be relevant for the pharmaceutical industry, the evidence described for the claim that this technique &quot;significantly&quot; improves alignment of reconstruction of small complexes is incomplete. The authors are encouraged to better evaluate the effects of model bias on the reconstructed densities in a revised paper.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Zhang et al describe a method for cryo-EM reconstruction of small (sub-50kDa) complexes using 2D template matching. This presents an alternative, complementary path for high-resolution structure determination when there is a prior atomic model for alignment. Importantly, regions of the atomic model can be deleted to avoid bias in reconstructing the structure of these regions, serving as an important mechanism of validation.</p>
<p>The manuscript focuses its analysis on a recently published dataset of the 40kDa kinase complex deposited to EMPIAR. The original processing workflow produced a medium resolution structure of the kinase (GSFSC ~4.3A, though features of the map indicate ~6-7A resolution); at this resolution, the binding pocket and ligand were not resolved in the original published map. With 2DTM, the authors produce a much higher resolution structure, showing clear density for the ATP binding pocket and the bound ATP molecule. With careful curation of the particle images using statistically derived 2DTM p-values, a high-resolution 2DTM structure was reconstructed from just 8k particles (2.6A non-gold standard FSC; ligand Q-score of 0.6), in contrast to the 74k particles from the original publication. This aligns with recent trends that fewer, higher-quality particles can produce a higher-quality structure. The authors perform a detailed analysis of some of the design choices of the method (e.g., p-value cutoff for particle filtering; how large a region of the template to delete).</p>
<p>Overall, the workflow is a conceptually elegant alternative to the traditional bottom-up reconstruction pipeline. The authors demonstrate that the p-values from 2DTM correlations provide a principled way to filter/curate which particle images to extract, and the results are impressive. There are only a few minor recommendations that I could make for improvement.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Due to the low SNR of cryo-EM micrographs necessitated by radiation damage, determining the structure of proteins smaller than 50 kDa is exceedingly challenging, such that only a handful have been solved to date. This work aims to improve the reconstruction of small proteins in single-particle cryo-EM by using high-resolution 2D template matching, an algorithm previously used to locate and align macromolecules in situ, to align and reconstruct small proteins. This approach uses an existing macromolecular structure, either experimentally determined or predicted by AlphaFold, to simulate a noise-free 3D reference and generates whitened projections, crucially including high-spatial-frequency information, to align particles by the orientation with maximal cross-correlation. They demonstrate the success of this approach by generating a 3D reconstruction from an existing dataset of a 41.3 kDa protein kinase that had previously evaded attempts at high-resolution structure determination. To alleviate concerns that this is purely from template bias, they demonstrate clear density at two regions that were not present in the template: 6 residues in an alpha helix and an ATP in the ligand binding pocket. The latter is particularly important for its implications in determining structures of ligand-bound proteins for drug discovery. Additionally, the authors provide an update to the classic calculation in Henderson 1995 to predict the minimum molecular mass of a protein that can be solved by single-particle cryo-EM.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I am in no doubt that this technique can be used to gain valuable insights into the structures of small proteins, and this is an important advancement for the field. The ability to determine the structure of ligands in a binding site is particularly important, and this paper provides a method of doing that which outperforms traditional single-particle cryo-EM processing workflows.</p>
<p>The claim that using high-spatial frequency information is essential for aligning small proteins is a valuable insight. A recent pre-print published at a similar time to this manuscript used high-resolution information in standard ab-initio reconstruction to generate a high-resolution reconstruction from the same dataset, supporting the claims made in the manuscript.</p>
<p>The theoretical section outlined in the appendix is also theoretically sound. It uses the same logic as Henderson, but applies more up-to-date knowledge, such as incorporating dose-weighting and altering the cross-correlation-based noise estimation. This update is valuable for understanding factors preventing us from reaching the theoretical limit.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given that this technique creates template bias, only parts of the reconstruction not in the template can be trusted, unlike standard single-particle processing, where the independent half-maps from separate, ab initio templates are used to generate a 3D reconstruction. Although, in principle, one could perform the search many times such that every residue has been omitted in at least one search, this will be extremely computationally intensive and was not demonstrated in this manuscript. It is therefore currently only realistically applicable when only a small portion of the sub-50 kDa protein is of interest.</p>
<p>The applicability of this technique to more than a single target was also not demonstrated, and there are concerns that it may not work effectively in many cases. The authors note in the results that &quot;the ATP density was consistently recovered more robustly than nearby residues&quot; and speculate that this may be because misalignments disproportionately blur peripheral residues. Since the region of interest in a structure is not necessarily in the center, this may need further investigation. The implications of this statement may also be unclear to the reader. For example, can this issue be minimized by having the region of interest centered in the simulated volume?</p>
<p>In Figure 3, the authors demonstrate that it is not solely improved particle filtering and a noise-free reference that improves alignment, but that the high spatial frequency information is important. This information is very valuable since it can be applied to other, more standard methods. However, this key figure is not as clear or convincing as it could be. The FSC curves are possibly misleading, since the reduced resolution could be explained by reduced template bias when auto-refining with a map initially low-pass filtered to 10 Å. Moreover, although the helix reconstruction does look slightly better using the 2DTM angles, the improvement in density for ATP in the binding pocket is not clear. A qualitative argument only clear in one out of two cases is not as convincing as a quantitative metric across more examples.</p>
