<title>Summary</title><p>The brain regulates food intake in response to internal energy demands and food availability. However, can internal energy storage influence the type of memory that is formed? We show that the duration of starvation determines whether <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> forms appetitive short-term or longer-lasting intermediate memories. The internal glycogen storage in the muscles and adipose tissue influences how intensely sucrose associated information is stored. Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons integrates internal energy storage into memory formation. Octopamine, in turn, suppresses the formation of long-term memory. Octopamine is not required for short-term memory, because octopamine-deficient mutants can form appetitive short-term memory for sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status. The reduced positive reinforcing effect of sucrose at high internal glycogen levels combined with the increased stability of food-related memories due to prolonged periods of starvation could lead to increased food intake.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To ensure survival, the internal energy status of an animal needs to be adjusted to the energy expenditure of the organism and the availability of external food. Increased storage of energy correlates with increased food intake in the past. Dysregulation of food intake can lead to diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Sucrose is a carbohydrate enriched in Western diets, and the breakdown product of sucrose - glucose - can be stored in the organism as glycogen, primarily in the liver and muscles. Elevated glycogen levels are a hallmark of glycogen storage diseases that are accompanied by defects in the liver, muscles and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ellingwood and Cheng, 2018</xref>). Similar to vertebrates, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> uses glucose as its primary energy source and stores glycogen primarily in the muscles—the main site of energy expenditure—and the fat body—the equivalent of the vertebrate liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Galikova and Klepsatel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wigglesworth, 1949</xref>). As in vertebrates, glycogen levels are also found in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yamada et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the monoamine octopamine - functionally related to noradrenalin in vertebrates - is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. In tyramine-β-hydroxylase (<italic>Tβh</italic>) mutants lacking the neurotransmitter octopamine, the glucose and trehalose concentrations in the hemolymph change less upon starvation, and the life span is extended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Damrau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants show an increased threshold to respond to sucrose with the extension of their proboscis when sucrose is offered to their tarsi – a structure that contains gustatory receptor neurons. The reduced responsiveness to sucrose correlates with a reduced sucrose intake in <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Scheiner et al., 2014</xref>). Octopaminergic neurons potentiate the response of sugar-sensing gustatory receptor neurons in satiated flies, suggesting that octopaminergic neurons regulate feeding behavior by changing the sensitivity of taste receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Youn et al., 2018</xref>). The reduced responsiveness to sucrose is also thought to be responsible for defects observed in habituation in <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Scheiner et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to their changes in simple forms of neuronal plasticity, <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants fail to form a positive association with a food reward in a classical olfactory conditioning paradigm. Flies quickly learn to associate an odorant with sucrose, and T<italic>β</italic>h mutants do not show this positive association directly after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). However, when a longer time after training has elapsed, memory appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Das et al., 2014</xref>). The release of octopamine mediates the reinforcing effect of sweet taste in short-term memory and the anesthesia-resistant form of long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). The question arises how the internal energy supply is integrated into the formation of food related memories and feeding behavior in <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>The peptide hormone insulin regulates glycose homeostasis at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Saltiel and Kahn, 2001</xref>). Insulin and its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart, insulin-like peptides, perform their functions through well-conserved signal transduction cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chatterjee and Perrimon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>). In vertebrates, in addition to its function in fat tissue and muscles, the insulin receptor is broadly expressed in the brain and regulates neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nakai et al., 2022</xref>). For example, in rats, reduced insulin receptor function in the hypothalamus results in loss of long-term potentiation and impaired spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Grillo et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the insulin receptor substrate Chico is required for the development of mushroom bodies, a brain region required for learning and memory, and loss of Chico results in learning defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Naganos et al., 2012</xref>). Disrupting the function of the insulin receptor in the mushroom bodies also results in learning defects, whereas the insulin receptor and Chico are required in the ellipsoid body for protein biosynthesis-dependent long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>). While there is evidence that insulin receptor signaling regulates cellular physiology, it is not clear how the internal energy supply of the animal influences the formation of food-related memories.</p>
<p>To analyze the relationship between energy status, the evaluation of a food reward and the formation of memory and food intake, we used the olfactory associative learning and memory paradigm. Using nutrients as a positive reward allows for investigating how the internal energy status influences the evaluation of the reinforcer and in turn learning and memory. As a step to understand the interconnection between reward evaluation, nutrient intake and the formation of food-related memories, we analyzed the function of octopamine in the regulation of internal energy homeostasis, learning and memory and food intake.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Starvation increases learning and memory performance when using a food-related reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>). However, how the internal energy status is integrated into the evaluation of the reward and the stability of food-related memories and whether there is a correlation between the perceptions of the food reward, food-related memories and food intake are not clear.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>The duration of hunger influences the strength and stability of memories</title>
<p>To investigate whether changes in internal energy storage influence food-related memories, we used the olfactory associative learning and memory paradigm using sucrose as a food-related reinforcer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). In the paradigm, flies learn to associate an odorant with sucrose and are later tested on whether they remember the association. A prerequisite for this association to be made is that the animals are hungry. During the training, starved flies were exposed for 2 min to the unconditioned odorant, 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH), followed by a 2 min exposure to a second odorant, 3-octanol (3-OCT), that was paired with the reward of 2 M sucrose. After the training, flies were given a choice between the two odorants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Normally, flies prefer the rewarded odorant already 2 min after the training. To avoid a bias towards one odorant, in a reciprocal experiment, the first odorant was rewarded. The performance index presents the average positive association between the reward and both odorants and describes whether information is learnt and remembered. To ensure that observed differences in learning and memory were not due to changes in odorant perception, odorant evaluation or sucrose sensitivity, different fly populations of the same genotypes were tested for their odorant acuity, odorant and sucrose preference (Table S1). The flies of the different genotypes sensed the odorants and evaluated them as similar salient in comparison. This is important to a avoid bias where flies have to choose between the two odorants after training. They also sensed sucrose. We next determined whether differences in sucrose preference influence sucrose intake during training. Therefore, we measured the intake of food-colored sucrose of starved flies in the behavioral set up. After 2 min, we evaluated whether there was dyed food in the abdomen of the fly (Table S1). Flies of both genotypes fed sucrose within 2 min and there was no difference between <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> flies.</p>

</fig>
<p>To alter the internal energy status, flies were starved either for 16 h or for 40 h before the training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). We used 3- to 5-day-old male flies to minimize differences in body weight and to control for differences in food preferences. We included <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants lacking octopamine in the experiments, since they showed defects in energy metabolism and sucrose reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). Flies that were starved for 16 h established a positive association between the odorant and the reward. They remembered this association for 2 min, but not for 6 h or 24 h. Consistent with previous results, learning and memory performance was significantly improved by prolonged starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>). The memory was also remembered for longer, since it was still detectable 6 h after training. The <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants starved for 16 h did not show 2 min memory but emerged memory 6 h later that lasted up to 24 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants remembered the rewarded odorant after only 2 min following starvation extended to 40 h. The memory was still detectable after 6 h and 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We repeated similar experiments using a lower concentration of 0.15 M sucrose as reinforcer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast to the experiments using 2 M sucrose as a reward, 16 h starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form a negative association with 0.15 M sucrose directly after the training, that turns into a positive association when the flies were starved longer 40 h. Again, prolonged starvation significantly increased learning and memory performance in controls and <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants. Thus, the length of starvation and the reinforcer strength influence appetitive memory strength.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated how starvation affects the stability of memory. Protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory is still labile immediately after training and can be blocked by 4°C cold-shock anesthesia immediately after training. After consolidation, long-term memory is cold shock resistant and insensitive to a cold shock 1 h before the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>). To investigate how hunger influences the stability of food-related memories, we administered cold shock anesthesia immediately after the training and 1 h before the test and analyzed the effect on memory formation in differently starved control and <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We reduced the time for the memory test after training from 6 h to 3 h to be able to detect memory in 16 h starved flies. The memory was completely abolished by a cold shock directly after training or shortly before the test. Prolonging the starvation period resulted in memory that was sensitive to cold-shock directly after training but not shortly before the test. In contrast, 16 h starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants developed memory that was sensitive to cold shock directly after training and cold shock insensitive shortly before the test. The results together with the observed memory 24 h later of <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> after the same training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) support that <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutant develop long-term memory. Longer periods of starvation in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants resulted in anesthesia-resistant long-term memory.</p>

<p><bold>A</bold>, Appetitive STM training with 2 M sucrose and cold shock directly or 2 h after training. Mildly starved control flies exhibit an appetitive memory sensitive to cold shock 3 h after training. Severely starved control flies develop a memory that is initially sensitive to cold shock, but becomes insensitive after 2 h. This phenotype is shared with mildly starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants. Prolonged starvation in the mutants shifts memory to cold shock insensitive memory. <bold>B</bold>, To block neuronal activity and the formation of LTM, a 30-min heat shift was applied immediately after training to flies expressing a temperature-sensitive <italic>shibire</italic> transgene under the control of the R1504-Gal4 driver.

<graphic xlink:href="543187v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To further confirm that the observed memory in 16 h starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> is indeed long-term memory, we wanted selectively inhibit long-term memory in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants and analyze their food-related memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We analyzed memory performance 6 h after training, as control flies show no memory at this time point (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The R15A04-Gal4 driver targets dopaminergic neurons of the PAM cluster, which are specifically required for appetitive long-term memory but not short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>). Blocking the function of these dopaminergic neurons immediately after training using a temperature-sensitive <italic>shibire</italic> transgene (UAS-shi<sup>ts</sup>) and a 30-min heat pulse of 31°C resulted in loss of memory in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Control flies carrying one copy of the Gal4 transgene showed no memory. Without heat shock, the <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants carrying the UAS-shi<sup>ts</sup>, the R15A04-Gal4 or both transgenes developed memory (Figure S1). Thus, although they do not show memory immediately after training, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants that were briefly starved develop long-term memory.</p>
<p>These results, together with the course of memory loss, show that lightly hungry flies form a memory that lasts up to 3 h and is sensitive to anesthesia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Since no memory can be observed 24 h later, this indicates that it is an anesthesia-sensitive intermediate memory (ITM). Prolonged starvation results in anesthesia-resistant ITM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, mildly starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form a long-term memory that is sensitive to anesthesia-sensitive and detectable 24 h after the training. Prolonged starvation in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants leads to anesthesia-resistant long-term memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the longer the starvation lasts, the more stable the memory becomes. Depending on the duration of starvation after the same training phase, the animals first form an STM memory, then anesthesia-sensitive or insensitive intermediate memory. Mildly starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants do not form a short-term memory, but a long-term memory and after prolonged starvation, short-term and anesthesia resistant memory.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Octopamine is a negative regulator of memory</title>
<p>Since the <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants lack the neurotransmitter octopamine and form LTM, we next investigated whether octopamine normally suppresses LTM. To do so, we first blocked the function of octopamine receptors in controls immediately after the training by feeding the octopamine antagonist epinastin for 1 h and analyzed memory 5 h later (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). If the octopamine receptor function is required for long-term memory, prolonged memory should also occur in control flies that normally show no memory after 16 hours of starvation. This was the case. Consistent with the idea that octopamine is a negative regulator of long-term memory, feeding octopamine to <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants immediately after training blocked long-term memory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To analyze whether octopamine is also able to block STM, we fed octopamine prior to training to control flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).

<p>We were wondering whether octopamine could reduce the appetite in starved animals and thereby reducing the value of the food reward. To investigate this, we fed starved flies with a short octopamine pulse and assayed their sucrose intake after 3 h (Figure S2). Flies fed with octopamine showed a significant reduction of sucrose intake, but not flies fed with a similar amount of tyramine or a 10-fold increase in tyramine concentration. Therefore, it is possible that increased octopamine content influences how food is evaluated. This is consistent with a function of octopamine as a signal for food or high internal energy levels. Taken together, octopamine is a negative regulator of appetitive long-term memory and STM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Starvation influences sucrose consumption preference</title>
<p>Starvation reduces the internal energy storage. The reduction could lead to a reassessment of the external food cues and increased food consumption to restore the energy supplies. First, we investigated how starvation reduces the glycogen storage in whole animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In controls and <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants, starvation reduces the glycogen level. However, non-starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutant males had significantly higher glycogen levels at baseline. After 40 h of starvation, the glycogen levels of <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants were still higher than those of controls that were starved for the amount of time.

The assessment of external food sources might be reflected in the choice of food. To examine whether hunger influences the evaluation of an external food stimulus, we starved flies and determined the preference for consuming sucrose over protein-enriched food using the capillary feeder assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Non-starved flies reared on standard fly food preferred sucrose over protein-enriched food, but <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants to a significantly lesser extent than controls.18 h of starvation resulted in a decreased sucrose preference in controls and <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants, but to a significantly lower level in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants.

<title>Internal glycogen storage influences sucrose-related memories</title>
<p>Since memory performance increases when the internal energy supply is reduced by starvation, we wanted to investigate whether the internal energy supply influences memory performance. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, glycogen is mainly found in the fat bodies - the major energy storage organ - and the muscles, a major site of energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wigglesworth, 1949</xref>). Glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase control glycogen content in the body (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

In addition, we quantified the glycogen levels in the bodies of adult flies (Figure S3).

<p>Increasing glycogen levels in the muscles had no effect on the short-term memory of the 16 h starved flies, but decreasing glycogen levels significantly improved memory performance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Increasing or decreasing glycogen levels in the fat bodies had no effect on memory performance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). When the muscles and fat bodies glycogen levels were significantly increased, flies showed a reduced memory to odorants paired with sucrose. An increase in memory performance was observed when glycogen levels were significantly reduced in both tissues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that energy metabolism in mushroom bodies is important for the formation of LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Placais et al., 2017</xref>). To analyze the function of the mushroom bodies, the expression of <italic>GlyS<sup>HMS01279</sup>-RNAi</italic> under the control of the Mef2-Gal4 driver was repressed in the mushroom bodies using the mb247-Gal80 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>).

<title>Internal glycogen levels reduce sucrose-related memories in Tβh mutants</title>
<p>The increased glycogen levels in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants could be responsible for the reduced STM.

<title>Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic neurons regulates STM</title>
<p>How is the internal energy status integrated into the reward system? Insulin-like signaling regulates glycogen levels in invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Semaniuk et al., 2021</xref>). Loss of the insulin receptor results in more circulating sugar but not increased glycogen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shingleton et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the insulin receptor might be a good candidate that links the internal energy level to reinforcing neurons. First, we analyzed whether the insulin receptor is expressed in octopaminergic reward neurons in the brain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). To detect the expression of an activated insulin receptor, we used an insulin antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the insulin receptor (InR). This region is highly conserved between humans and flies. First, we tested whether the antibody indeed recognized the activated insulin receptor. Therefore, we overexpressed the activated insulin receptor using the UAS-InR.A1325D transgene under the control of the <italic>dTdc2</italic>-Gal4 driver (Figure S6). The InR.A1325D protein variant mimics the human V938D protein variant, which is constitutively active,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Longo et al., 1992</xref>) and the <italic>dTdc2</italic>-Gal4 driver targets octopaminergic reward neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Busch et al., 2009</xref>). The expression of activated InR resulted in increased immunoreactivity (Figure S6). The InR antibody therefore detects the activated InR. In the brain, activated InR is broadly expressed in a punctate manner and more specifically in the soma of <italic>dTdc2</italic>-Gal4-targeted neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). To uncouple energy sensing via the insulin receptor in reward neurons, we expressed UAS-InR.K1409A under the control of the <italic>dTdc2</italic>-Gal4 driver. The transgene encodes a dominant negative variant of the InR (InR<sup>DN</sup>) and disrupts with InR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). In animals starved for 16 h, the expression of InR<sup>DN</sup> under the control of the <italic>dTdc2</italic>-Gal4 driver did not alter STM, but uncoupling of InR-dependent energy sensing in reward neurons in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> restored STM to normal levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate whether the improved STM also affects the emerging LTM of the <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants, we performed cold shock experiments in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants in which InR<sup>DN</sup> was expressed in octopaminergic reward neurons (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). The 3 h memory in controls is cold shock sensitive, but the memory in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants is cold shock insensitive, supporting the idea that the mutants formed anesthesia-resistant memory. Given that octopamine is a negative regulator of memory and that it is still absent in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants with blocked insulin signaling on octopaminergic reward neurons, it is not surprising that ARM is still observed in the mutants.</p>
<p>The results can be described with the following model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Insulin receptor signaling on reward neurons integrated the internal energy status into memory formation. When energy levels are high enough due to increased glycogen levels or food intake, the insulin pathway suppresses the formation of STM. In return, the system releases octopamine to suppress the formation of food-related LTM. In mildly starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants, the integration of the internal energy status into the reward neurons is still intact. In addition, the level of the internal energy supply combined with the loss of octopamine is still high enough to support the formation of protein biosynthesis-dependent LTM. In <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants, two functionally different memory traces are formed after training, an insulin receptor-sensitive appetitive short-term memory and a long-term memory. In starved control animals, the glycogen levels are more severely depleted and octopamine is still present. This supports the formation of STM and an intermediate form of memory (ITM).</p>

<title>Increased starvation results in overconsumption in Tβh<sup>nM18</sup> mutants</title>
<p>To analyze whether the increased glycogen levels and the reduced sucrose reward of <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants correlate with food consumption, the energy requirements in flies under different starvation conditions were analyzed by measuring food intake (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Control flies starved for shorter or longer periods consumed similar amounts of 5% sucrose. In contrast, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants starved for 16 h consumed significantly less sucrose than controls. Longer-starved mutants consumed approximately 34% more sucrose (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). After longer starvation, the glycogen levels in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants were still higher than those in controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Depending on the duration of starvation, flies develop STM and an anesthesia-sensitive intermediate type of a food-related memory. The extending the hunger period, memory formation shifts to an anesthesia-resistant intermediate memory. Presentation of the reward leads to the release of octopamine and this the suppression of LTM. The shifting of different memories phases in response to different energy supplies has been also described for memories that are formed of aversive non-food-related memories. Depending on the reduction of the internal energy supply, flies initially form protein-dependent aversive olfactory LTM and later ARM, a protein synthesis-independent form of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). In times of energy shortage, the organism exchanges the costly protein biosynthesis-dependent LTM for the “less costly” protein biosynthesis-independent ARM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mery and Kawecki, 2005</xref>). The effect of memory transition can also be observed at the level of appetitive LTM. In <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants, mild starvation along with elevated glycogen levels leads to the formation of LTM and prolonged starvation leads to the formation of anesthesia-resistant LTM. Furthermore, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form only anesthesia-sensitive aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form cold shock-resistant LTM. Therefore, Tβh<sup>nM18</sup> mutants are not defective in appetitive anesthesia-resistant types of memories rather the internal energy status defines how quickly anesthesia-resistant appetitive memories forms.</p>

<title>Octopamine gates memory formation</title>
<p>What function does octopamine play in memory formation? Octopamine is a negative regulator of LTM, as feeding octopamine receptor antagonists to control flies results in memory, and emerging memory in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants is suppressed by octopamine after conditioning. Octopamine acts in the formation of LTM upstream of dopaminergic neurons, as blocking neurotransmitter release of dopaminergic LTM-mediating neurons immediately after conditioning blocks memory formation in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants. The results are consistent with the model describing that dopamine release is not required during the pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the reward rather than as gain control after the training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adel and Griffith, 2021</xref>). The inhibitory function of octopamine controls the gain.</p>
<p>During the acquisition of appetitive STM, octopamine acts upstream of dopaminergic neurons M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). However, at first glance, the function of octopamine appears to differ in STM and LTM. Loss of octopamine in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants results in loss of STM, indicating that octopamine is required as a positive regulator for appetitive STM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). The loss of STM in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants has been attributed to the loss of labile STM which forms in response to the sweetness of sucrose, but not due to defects in stable LTM, which forms in response to the caloric value of sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fujita and Tanimura, 2011</xref>). Sweetness is sensed by taste receptor that change their sensitivity during hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Marella et al., 2012</xref>) and thereby influencing the response to the external reinforcer. The responsiveness could be regulated by the octopaminergic system, as octopaminergic neurons regulate the sucrose sensitivity of gustatory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Youn et al., 2018</xref>). However, the reduced sensitivity of gustatory receptors cannot explain why octopamine-deficient mutants do not form STM. The <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form aversive memory to lower concentrations of sucrose and the differences in sucrose preference of <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> do not translate to differences in food intake during training.</p>
<p>The internal energy status influences how the external source of sucrose is evaluated rather than octopamine being directly involved in the acquisition of appetitive STM. Consistently, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants can exhibit STM after prolonged periods of starvation. In mildly starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> flies that do not show STM, uncoupling of energy sensing in reward neurons by blocking insulin receptor function leads to STM. Furthermore, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutant females with different energy requirements form appetitive STM, and a short pulse of octopamine before conditioning can even block STM. Thus, octopamine is not required in the acquisition of appetitive STM but rather suppresses LTM when enough energy is available. The function of octopamine as a suppressor of different memory types allows for selecting the memory type depending the internal and external information. This gating function in memory formation can also be observed in other behaviors. For example, octopamine regulates the decision to approach or turn away from a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Classen and Scholz, 2018</xref>). Taken together, the octopaminergic system integrates internal energy demands and the evaluation of external food supplies.</p>

<title>The internal energy level of the animal influences memory formation</title>
<p>At the cellular level, insulin receptor signaling regulates energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chatterjee and Perrimon, 2021</xref>). The broad expression pattern of the insulin receptor in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) indicates that every cell in the brain needs to regulate its own energy homeostasis. However, the fly’s entire energy resources and the evaluation of the external food supply must also be integrated. The reward system evaluates the external food supply. In mice, insulin receptor signaling in dopaminergic neurons mediates food reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Konner et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, insulin receptor function in octopaminergic reward neurons regulates the rewarding properties of sucrose in appetitive STM memory (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) and during food intake (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>The systemic metabolic rate is regulated by fat bodies. For example, after food intake, the fat body secretes Unpaired 2 (Upd2), which in turn regulates the secretion of Drosophila insulin-like peptides via GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>). We show that the reduction of glycogen in the fat bodies is not sufficient to change appetitive STM, but reduction in the muscles or both tissues is. The results support a feedback mechanism between the assessment of glycogen levels in the muscles and the brain. In addition, the muscles and the fat bodies communicate about the energy content of both structures, and this information is signaled back to the brain. Such long-range signals from the muscles exist. Skeletal muscles are secretory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012</xref>). For example, the muscle-secreted Amyrel amylase reduces the age-related accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Rai et al., 2021</xref>). Regardless of how the glycogen levels of both tissues are communicated to the brain, they influence how the reinforcer is evaluated. The feedback between the energy levels in both structures is still intact in octopamine-deficient mutants, as <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants still form STM when the energy storage is sufficiently reduced.</p>

<title>Are food-related memories and internal glycogen levels predictive of food intake?</title>
<p>The feeding behavior in hungry animals is regulated by various neural systems, including networks that receive and process sensory information and networks that assign reward properties to food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berridge, 2009</xref>). Blocking insulin receptor function in dopaminergic neurons results in increased food intake and weight gain in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Konner et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, blocking insulin receptor function in octopaminergic reward neurons in flies with increased glycogen levels and reduced food intake increases food intake. Thus, the octopaminergic system assigns reward properties to food. However, blocking insulin receptor signaling on reward neurons does not result in extensive overconsumption, supporting that the regulation of the food quantity is still intact and is not due to insulin receptor resistance in reward neurons. Increased levels of internal energy, e.g., glycogen, reduced the reward properties of food, resulting in a decreased positive association of food-related memories (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) and decreased food consumption (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This is intended to prevent increased food intake when there is excess food. Insulin resistance could contribute to weight gain, because in addition to high internal levels of glycogen, the flies show normal food intake. However, the overconsumption only becomes visible after a prolonged period of hunger, which correlates with the emerging stable appetitive long-term memory. This suggests that the stability of appetitive memory could lead to the re-evaluation of food and could trigger the overconsumption of food.</p>
<p>In summary, the octopaminergic neurotransmitter system integrates several aspects that influence the regulation of food memories. Octopamine modulates the sensory perception of the conditioned stimulus and the sensory perception of the reward. Here, we show that the evaluation of food reward in the context of the energy storage is integrated by the octopaminergic system and influences the stability of food-related memories. The function of octopamine as a negative regulator of various forms of memories allows for selective regulation of food related behaviors such as food intake, and the loss of this regulation could also promote dysregulation of food intake. The close relationship between the octopaminergic neurotransmitter and the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system suggests that the integrator function may be conserved.</p>

<title>Olfactory learning and memory</title>
<p>Associative olfactory learning and memory was trained and tested with a modified version of the Tully and Quinn olfactory conditioning apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). Approximately 70 one- to two-day-old male flies were collected with CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia and were kept for 2 days at 25°C to recover from CO<sub>2</sub> sedation. Briefly, three- to five-day-old male flies were starved for 16 h or 40 h in vials with water-soaked filter paper at the bottom. Flies were transferred to training tubes and exposed to the first odorant for 2 min, either 3-octanol (3-OCT diluted 1:80 in paraffin oil) or 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH diluted 1:100 in paraffin oil). After that, they were transferred to a second tube and exposed to the second odorant in the presence of filter paper soaked with either 0.15 M sucrose, 2 M sucrose or 5% yeast. To analyze the abilities of the flies to learn and remember the odorant paired with the reward, 2 min, 3 h, 6 h or 24 h after training, flies were given the choice between odorant 1 (CS+) and odorant 2 (CS-) for 2 min. The performance index (PI) was calculated as PI = (# (CS+) + # (CS-) / (total # flies), where CS+ indicates the odorant associated with the appetitive reinforcer and CS-indicates the odorant that was not associated with the reinforcer. To exclude non-associative effects, each “n” consists of a reciprocally trained, independent group of naïve flies. For pharmacological experiments, flies were fed water, 3 mM OA or 2 M sucrose before training or with 3 mM OA or 3 mM epinastine between training and testing. The assay was performed at RT with 60% relative humidity. For cold shock experiments, flies in vials were placed in ice-cold water for 2 min.</p>
<p>Odorant acuity and odorant balance were tested with naïve flies that were not used later for learning and memory experiments. For testing, the flies were placed into the Tully Quinn setup. They chose between the odorant- or the solvent paraffin oil-containing sides or between both odorants for 2 min. The sucrose and yeast preference was determined by analyzing whether they preferred the side with a sucrose or yeast-soaked filter paper over a water-soaked filter paper. To determine sucrose intake, flies were fed with a food-safe colored sucrose solution and food intake was analyzed by the color in the abdomen (Table S1).</p>

Briefly, eight three- to five-day-old male or female flies that were either non-starved or starved for 18 h or 40 h had access to 4 capillaries filled with either 5% sucrose or 5% yeast or a mixture of both for 24 h at 25°C and 60% humidity. The solution was colored with red food dye. During starvation, flies were kept in vials with wet filter paper at 25°C and 60% humidity. The amount of consumed solution was determined using an electronic caliper. To account for evaporation, the average evaporation of three CAFE setups without flies was measured and used to normalize the average food intake per fly. To normalize food intake to body weight, at least 5 times 100 male flies per genotype and condition were weighed, and the average body weight of a single fly was determined. The total consumption per µg fly was calculated by dividing the total consumption per fly by the mean weight of a fly. N indicates the number of tested groups.</p>

<p>The present study conducted by Berger et al. delves into the extent to which memory formation relies on available energy reserves. While aversive memory formation has been extensively studied in this context, the investigation into appetitive memory formation has been comparatively sparse. It has long been recognized that flies can only form appetitive memory under conditions of starvation. However, the authors of this study go beyond this understanding by revealing that not only the duration of starvation matters, but it also dictates the type of memory formed, whether short- or long-term memory. The authors illustrate that internal glycogen stores play a crucial role in this process, facilitated by insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons, which integrates internal energy reserves into memory formation. Consequently, the authors propose that octopamine serves as a negative regulator of various forms of memory, shedding light on the enduring question of the octopaminergic neuronal system's involvement in appetitive memory formation, which has been overshadowed by the focus on the dopaminergic system in recent years. Additionally, the findings contribute to the ongoing debate concerning the role of insulin receptors, whether they function within neurons themselves or in glial cells. Moreover, the authors not only convincingly demonstrate that octopamine negatively regulates appetitive memory formation, but they also propose a mechanism whereby the insulin receptor in octopaminergic neurons senses the internal energy status and subsequently modulates the activity of these neurons. The experiments are meticulously designed, employing a variety of behavioral assays, genetic tools for manipulating neuronal activity, and state-of-the-art imaging techniques. The conclusions are well supported by the data and carefully performed controlled experiments, yielding high-quality data.</p>

<p>How organism physiological state modulates establishment and perdurance of memories is a timely question that the authors aimed at addressing by studying the interplay between energy homeostasis and food-related conditioning in Drosophila. Specifically, they studied how starvation modulates the establishment of short-term vs long-term memories and clarified the role of the monoamine Octopamine in food-related conditioning, showing that it is not per se involved in formation of appetitive short-term memories but rather gates memory formation by suppressing LTM when energy levels are high. This work clarifies previously described phenotypes and provides insight about interconnections between energy levels, feeding and formation of short-term and long-term food-related memories.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>

- Previous studies have documented the impact of Octopamine on different aspects of food-related behaviors (regulation of energy homeostasis, feeding, sugar sensing, appetitive memory...), but we currently lack a clear understanding of how these different functions are interconnected. The authors have used a variety of experimental approaches to systematically test the impact of internal energy levels in establishment of different forms of appetitive memory and the role of Octopamine in this process.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Berger et al. study how internal energy storage influence learning and memory. Since in Drosophila melanogaster, octopamine (OA) is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis they focus on the roles of OA. To do so they use the tyramine-β-hydroxylase (Tbh) mutant that is lacking the neurotransmitter OA and study short term memory (STM), long-term memory (LTM) and anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM). They show that the duration of starvation affects the magnitude of both short- and long-term memory. In addition, they show that OA has a suppressive effect on learning and memory. In terms of energy storage, they show that internal glycogen storage influences how long sucrose is remembered, and high glycogen suppresses memory. Finally, they show that insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic neurons, which is also related to internal energy storage, suppresses learning and memory.</p>
<p>The revised version of the manuscript is greatly improved, and I thank the authors for taking the comment seriously. This is an important study that extends our knowledge on OA activity in learning and memory and the effects the metabolic state has on learning and memory. The authors nicely use the genetic tools available in flies to try and unravel the complex circuitry of metabolic state level, OA activity and learning and memory. The overall take-home message of the manuscript is clear and supported by the data presented.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The present study by Berger et al. analyzes to what extent memory formation is dependent on available energy reserves. This has been dealt with extensively in the case of aversive memory formation, but only very sparsely in the case of appetitive memory formation. It has long been known that an appetitive memory in flies can only be formed by starvation. However, the authors here additionally show that not only the duration of starvation plays a role, but also determines which form of memory (short- or long-term memory) is formed. The authors demonstrated that internal glycogen stores play a role in this process and that this is achieved through insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons that integrates internal energy stores into memory formation. Here, the authors suggest that octopamine plays a role as a negative regulator of different forms of memory.</p>
<p>The study sheds light on an old question, to what extent the octopaminergic neuronal system plays a role in the formation of appetitive memory, since in recent years only the dopaminergic system has been in focus. Furthermore, the data are an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate whether insulin receptors play a role in neurons themselves or in glial cells. The experiments are very well designed and the authors used a variety of behavioural experiments, genetic tools to manipulate neuronal activity and state-of-the-art imaging techniques. In addition, they not only clearly demonstrated that octopamine is a negative regulator of appetitive memory formation, but also proposed a mechanism by which the insulin receptor in octopaminergic neurons senses the internal energy status and then controls the activity of those neurons. The conclusions are mostly supported by the data, but some aspects related to the experimental design, some explanations and literature references need more clarification and revision.</p>
<p>(1) Usually, long-term memory (LTM) is tested 24 hours after training. Here, the authors usually refer to LTM as a memory that is tested 6 hours after training. The addition of a control experiment to show that LTM that the authors observe here lasts longer would increase the power of this study immensely.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, as it helped greatly to clarify the matter.</p>
<p>We measured memory of control and mutant flies 24 h after the training and included the data into the manuscript (Figure 1B and summarized in a model in Figure 2C). We show that control flies develop an intermediate type of memory, that is depending on the length of starvation either anesthesia-sensitive or resistant. Mutants lacking octopamine develop either anesthesia-sensitive or resistant long-term memory.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors define here another consolidated memory component as ARM, when they applied a cold-shock 2 hours after training. However, some publications showed that LTM is formed after only one training cycle (Krashes et al 2008, Tempel et al 1983). This makes it difficult to determine, whether appetitive ARM can be formed. Furthermore, one study showed that appetitive ARM is absent after massed training (Colomb et al 2009). Therefore, the conclusion could be also, that different starvation protocols, would lead to different stabilities of LTM. Therefore, additional experiments could help to clarify this opposing explanation. From these results, it can then be concluded either that different stable forms of LTM are formed depending on the starvation state, or that two differently consolidated memory phases (LTM, ARM) are formed, as has already been shown for aversive memory. This is also important for other statements in the manuscript, and therefore the authors should address this. For example, the findings about the insulin receptor (is it two opposing memories or different stabilities of LTM).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The flies indeed develop different types of memory depending on the length of starvation and the internal energy supply.</p>

This work clarifies previously described phenotypes and provides insight about interconnections between energy levels, feeding and formation of short-term and long-term food-related memories. In the absence of population-specific manipulation of octopamine signaling, it however does not reach a circuit-level understanding of how these different processes are integrated.</p>

<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) In the tbh mutant flies, Tyramine -to- Octopamine conversion is inhibited, resulting not only in a lack of Octopamine, but also in elevated levels of Tyramine. If and how elevated levels of Tyramine contributes to the described phenotypes is unclear. In the current version of the manuscript, only one set of experiments (Figure 2) has been performed using Octopamine agonist. This is particularly important in light of recent published data showing that starvation modifies Tyramine levels.
(2) Octopamine (and its precursor Tyramine) have been implicated in numerous processes, complicating the analysis of the phenotypes resulting from a general inhibition of tbh.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these points. The observed memory defects of the Tbh mutants can be solely explained by loss of octopamine. We included models into the manuscript to illustrate this (Figure 2 C and Figure 7E).</p>
<p>To address whether the elevated levels of tyramine observed in Tbh mutants interfere with food consumption, we analyzed the effect of increased levels of tyramine and octopamine on food consumption.  We included the data (Figure S2). An increase in tyramine levels did not result in a change in food intake, rather the increase in octopamine levels reduced food intake. Our data show that the reduction of food intake observed in starved Tbh mutants is due to the increased internal energy supply.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The manuscript explores various aspects of the impact of energy levels on food-related behaviors and the underlying sensing and effector mechanism, both in wild-type and tbh mutants, making it difficult to follow the flow of the results.</p>

<p>We included models illustrating the results to clarify the content of the manuscript.</p>

<p>This is an important study that extends our knowledge on OA activity in learning and memory and the effects the metabolic state has on learning and memory. The authors nicely use the genetic tools available in flies to try and unravel the complex circuitry of metabolic state level, OA activity and learning and memory.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I do have some comments that I think require attention:</p>
<p>(1) The authors use RNAi to reduce the level of glycogen synthase or glycogen phosphorylase. These manipulations are expected to affect the level of glycogen. Using specific drivers the authors attempt to manipulate glycogen level at the muscles and fat bodies and examine how this affects learning and memory. The conclusions of the authors arise solely from the manipulation intended (i.e. the genetics). However, the authors also directly measured glycogen levels at these organs and those do not follow the manipulation intended, i.e. the RNAi had very limited effect on the glycogen level. Nevertheless, these results are ignored.</p>

<p>We agreed with the reviewer and repeated the experiments. While we could not detect differences in whole animals, we detected differences in tissues enriched for muscles or fat, e.g. thorax or abdomen. We added the data.</p>

<p>(2) The authors claim in the summary that OA is not required for STM. However, according to one experiment OA is required for STM as Tbh mutants cannot form STM. In another experiment OA is suppressive to STM as wt flies fed with OA cannot form STM. Therefore, it is very difficult to appreciate the actual role of OA on STM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>During mild starvation, the internal energy supply is greater in Tbh mutants than in control flies. This information is integrated into the reward system via insulin receptor signaling. Therefore, the association between the odorant and sucrose is not meaningful to the mutants and no STM is formed. At the same time there is no release of octopamine and therefore no repression of LTM. In starved animals, octopamine suppresses food intake (we added the data). This is consistent with a function of Octopamine as a signal for the presence of food. Depending on when the signal comes, this might suppress the formation of STM or LTM.</p>

<p>(3) The authors use t-test and ANOVA for most of the statistics, however, they did not perform normality tests. While I am quite sure that most datasets will pass normality test, nevertheless, this is required.</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have included a description in the “Materials and Methods” section that explains how we tested the data for normal distribution. We corrected the figure legends accordingly.</p>

<p>(4) While it is logical to assume that OA neurons are upstream to R15A04 DA neurons, I am not sure this really arises from the experiment that is presented here. It is well established that without activity in R15A04 DA neurons there is no LTM. Since OA acts to decrease LTM, can one really conclude anything about the location of OA effect when there is no learning?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Normally control flies did not form memory 6 h after training, only Tbh mutants. We wanted to investigate what kind of memory develops in Tbh mutants. During the experiments of the manuscript, we kept the training procedure constant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) It is unclear how expression of a dominant negative form of insulin receptor (InR) in OA neurons can rescue the lack of OA due to the Tbh mutation. If OA neurons cannot release anything to the presumably downstream DA neurons, how can changing their internal signaling has any effect?</p>
<p>The expression of the dominant negative form of the insulin receptor signals no food or low energy levels and activation of the insulin receptor that there is enough food. The reward is a source of food, but the energy content is not high enough to fill the energy stores. The insulin receptor activation can activate at least three different signaling cascades, one of which might regulate octopamine release.</p>
<p>While I stressed some comments that need to be addressed, the overall take-home message of the manuscript is supported and the authors do show that the metabolic state of the animal affects learning and memory. I do think though, that some more caution is required for some of the conclusions.</p>

<p>(4) In the title as well as in the abstract the influence of octopamine on appetitive memory formation is described in more detail, this is also the main focus of this study. However, in the introduction, the influence of the insulin receptor on memory formation is discussed first. Personally, I would describe this later in the manuscript, ideally in the results section. At this point in the manuscript, this leads to an interruption in the flow of reading.</p>

<p>(6) All evaluations and statistical tests are state of the art. However, I have one comment. For each statistical test, a correction should be made depending on the number of tests. However, I could not determine whether this was also done for the parametric or non-parametric one-sample t-test. From the results and the methods section, I would guess not. Here I would recommend a Bonferroni correction or even better a Sidak-Holm correction. Furthermore, the authors could also go into more detail about which non-parametric one-sample t-test they used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We described the statistic used in more detail in the material and method section.</p>
<p>“We used the Shapiro-Wilk test (significance level P &lt; 0.05) followed by a QQ-Plot chart analysis to determine whether the data were normal distributed.  For normal distributed data, we used the Student’s t test to compare differences between two groups and the one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc HSD test for differences between more than two groups. For nonparametric data, we used the Mann-Whitney U test for differences between two groups and for more than two groups the Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Duenn analysis and Bonferroni correction. The nonparametric one-sample sign test was used to analyze whether behavior was not based on random choice and differed from zero (P &lt; 0.5). The statistical data analysis was performed using statskingdom (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.statskingdom.com">https://www.statskingdom.com</ext-link>).”</p>

<p>Suggestions</p>
<p>(1) Assessing the contribution of Tyramine in the observed phenotypes (for example by reducing the levels of Tyramine or its specific receptor) would help understand the contribution of Tyramine in the observed phenotypes.</p>
<p>See comments above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these points. The observed memory defects of the Tbh mutants can be solely explained by loss of octopamine. We included models into the manuscript to illustrate this (Figure 2 C and Figure 7E).</p>
<p>To address whether the elevated levels of tyramine observed in Tbh mutants interfere with food consumption, we analyzed the effect of increased levels of tyramine and octopamine on food consumption.  We included the data (Figure S2). An increase in tyramine levels did not result in a change in food intake, rather the increased octopamine levels reduced food intake. Our data show that the reduction of food intake observed in starved Tbh mutants is due to the increased internal energy supply.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Cell-specific inhibition of octopamine receptors should thus be performed to precisely interpret the observed phenotypes and dissect how interconnected the different phenotypes are, which is the object of this publication.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observed that the time point and duration of octopamine application changes the behavioral output. The behavior analyzed depends on pulses of octopamine and differences of the internal energy status. A cell-specific inhibition via RNAi knock down of octopamine receptors might not clarify the issue.</p>

<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) Can one really conclude from Figure 2A that OA acts on R15A04 DA neurons? It is well established that without activity in these DA neurons there is no LTM. Since OA acts to decrease learning, how one can conclude anything about the location of OA effect when there is no learning? With STM the situation was opposite, OA supported learning and this was abolished when DA neurons were silenced.
I think some supporting experiment are required, i.e. how OA affects DA neurons activity or, alternatively, tone down a bit the writing.</p>

<p>Normally control flies did not form memory 6 h after training, only Tbh mutants. We wanted to investigate what kind of memory develops in Tbh mutants. During the experiments of the manuscript, we kept the training procedure constant. The inhibition of dopaminergic neurons blocks the memory of Tbh mutants. Taken together the duration of the memory, the cold-shock experiments and the inhibition of the dopaminergic neurons, Tbh develops LTM after training. This training does not evoke memory in controls.</p>
<p>The loss of STM in mildly starved Tbh mutants depends on the integration of the high internal energy levels via InR signaling. Reducing the internal energy levels further by extension of starvation result in STM supporting that OA is not directly involved in the formation of STM.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 4 requires some clarifications. In Supplementary Figure S2 the authors show that they could not manipulate glycogen levels in muscles. However, in Figure 4B they show that &quot;Increasing glycogen levels in the muscles did not change short-term memory in 16 h starved flies, but the reduction in glycogen significantly improved memory strength (Figure 4B)&quot; (lines 231-233). How can this be reconciled?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we could not detect differences in whole animals, we detected differences in glycogen content in body parts enriched with muscles or fat, e.g. thorax or abdomen when using UAS-GlyP-RNAi or UAS-GlyS-RNAi under the control of the respective Gal4 drivers.</p>
<p>We added the data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Likewise, the authors write that &quot;Increasing or decreasing glycogen levels in the fat bodies had no effect on memory performance (Figure 4C)&quot; Line (233-234). However, in Figure S2 they show that they can only increase glycogen levels but not decrease them.</p>
<p>As explained above the conclusion of Figure 4 &quot;Thus, low levels of glycogen in the muscles upon starvation positively influence appetitive short-term memory, while high levels of glycogen in the muscles and fat body reduce short-term memory&quot; lines 245-246, is not supported by the direct measurements of glycogen presented in Figure S2.</p>

<p>We analyzed how much sucrose the animals consumed in the behavioral test. Tbh and controls fed and there was no difference in feeding behavior between the mutants and the controls.</p>
<p>“We next determined whether differences in preferences influence sucrose intake during training. Therefore, we measured the sucrose intake of starved flies in the behavioral set up. We used a food-colored sucrose solution and evaluated the presence of food in the abdomen of the fly after two 2 min (Table S1).

If some do not pass normality, please use a suitable non-parametric test.</p>

<p>(5) The authors show that OA suppresses also STM. This result is in contradiction to previous published results. This by itself is not a problem. However, this result also seems to me in contradiction to the authors own results. According to Figure 1B, OA is required for STM as it absence in the tbh mutant results in loss of STM. According to Figure 2C, OA is reducing STM as wt flies fed with OA just prior to learning do not form STM. This appears in other places in the manuscript as well.</p>
<p>In addition, in the text lines 178-180, the authors write &quot;A short pulse of octopamine before the training inhibits the STM. Thus, octopamine is a negative regulator of appetitive dopaminergic neuron-dependent long-term memory and can block STM.&quot; But in the summary they write &quot;Octopamine is not required for short-term memory, since octopamine deficient mutants form appetitive short-term memory to sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status.&quot;
So, the take-home message regarding OA and STM is unclear.</p>
<p>The authors need to better clarify this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified these points. See comments above. The loss of memory in Tbh mutants is not due to loss of octopamine, but increased energy levels that changes the reward properties of sucrose.</p>

<p>(6) The manuscript is very difficult to follow. The authors constantly change between 16 and 40 hours starvation, short term memory, 3 hour memory and 6 hour memory. I think it would have been better to have a more focused manuscript. However, if this is not possible, I recommend preparing a diagram with the different neurons or signaling pathways (i.e. insulin) and how they affect each other. Also, perhaps add to each figure a panel describing exactly the experimental conditions. I think also simplifying the text and adding more conclusions throughout the results section will help the readers to follow. Finally, I think that it would help understanding the conclusions if the authors can add a diagram of the flow that they think occurs. For example, the authors show that glycogen suppresses learning as its reduction increases learning. They also show that InR activity receptor suppresses learning as its KD also increases learning. If I am not mistaken the link between the two is not straight forward (but I may be wrong here). A diagram of the flow would be very helpful.</p>

<p>Minor</p>
<p>(1) I may not have understood correctly as I am not sure that I found Table S1.</p>
<p>Also, there was no legend for Table S1.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if I understood correctly, the authors write that &quot;Before the experiments, flies were tested to determine whether they perceived the odorants, preferred one odorant over other and responded to the reward similarly to ensure that the observed differences in behavior were not due to changes in odorant perception or sucrose sensitivity (Table S1).&quot; However, according to the Table that I found it seems that following 40h starvation wt flies show preference to OCT whereas this does not occur for the mutant. Also, it seems that at 16h the mutant has a much higher preference to the odors than after 40h. This is a bit odd. I am also not sure what the balance value refers to. Finally, the mutant shows really low 2M sucrose preference after 40h. In general, this set of experiments requires a bit more explanation.</p>
<p>I think it is better to show these experiments using graphs and add this to the supplementary figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified the experiments in the result section as follows and added an explanation to the material and method section. We tested the odorant acuity and sucrose preference for all genotypes used in the manuscript and added the data to the Table S1.</p>
<p>“The flies of the different genotypes sensed the odorants and evaluated them as similar salient in comparison. This is important to a avoid a bias in the situation where flies have to choose between the two odorants after training. They also sensed sucrose.  We next determined whether differences in preferences influence sucrose intake during training. Therefore, we measured the sucrose intake of starved flies in the behavioral set up. We used a food-colored sucrose solution and evaluated the presence of food in the abdomen of the fly after two 2 min (Table S1). Flies fed sucrose within 2 min and there was no difference between w1118 and TβhnM18 flies.”</p>

<p>The effect of glucose might be doses dependent. 0.15 M sucrose is a much closer to a realistic concentration found in fruits than 2 M sucrose and might therefore elicit aversion.
