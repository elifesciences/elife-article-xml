<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Individuals with Down syndrome (DS), the genetic condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21), display clear signs of immune dysregulation, including high rates of autoimmune disorders and severe complications from infections. Although it is well established that T21 causes increased interferon responses and JAK/STAT signaling, elevated autoantibodies, global immune remodeling, and hypercytokinemia, the interplay between these processes, the clinical manifestations of DS, and potential therapeutic interventions remain ill defined. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of immune dysregulation at the clinical, cellular, and molecular level in hundreds of individuals with DS. We demonstrate multi-organ autoimmunity of pediatric onset concurrent with unexpected autoantibody-phenotype associations. Importantly, constitutive immune remodeling and hypercytokinemia occur from an early age prior to autoimmune diagnoses or autoantibody production. We then report the interim analysis of a Phase II clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib through multiple clinical and molecular endpoints. Analysis of the first 10 participants to complete the 16-week study shows a good safety profile and no serious adverse events. Treatment reduced skin pathology in alopecia areata, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis, while decreasing interferon scores, cytokine scores, and levels of pathogenic autoantibodies without overt immune suppression. Additional research is needed to define the effects of JAK inhibition on the broader developmental and clinical hallmarks of DS. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT04246372.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Trisomy of human chromosome 21 (T21) occurs at a rate of â¼1 in 700 live births, causing Down syndrome (DS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Individuals with DS display a distinct clinical profile including developmental delays, stunted growth, cognitive impairments, and increased risk of leukemia, autism spectrum disorders, seizure disorders, and Alzheimerâs disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. People with DS also display widespread immune dysregulation, which manifests through severe complications from respiratory viral infections and high prevalence of myriad immune conditions, including autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, celiac disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, alopecia areata, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), vitiligo, and psoriasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, people with DS display signs of neuroinflammation from an early age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Although it is now well accepted that immune dysregulation is a hallmark of DS, the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic implications are not yet fully defined.</p>
<p>We previously reported that T21 causes consistent activation of the interferon (IFN) transcriptional response in multiple immune and non-immune cell types with concurrent hypersensitivity to IFN stimulation and hyperactivation of downstream JAK/STAT signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Plasma proteomics studies identified dozens of inflammatory cytokines with mechanistic links to IFN signaling that are elevated in people with DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. A large metabolomics study revealed that T21 drives the production of neurotoxic tryptophan catabolites via the IFN-inducible kynurenine pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Deep immune profiling revealed global immune remodeling with hypersensitivity to IFN across all major branches of the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and dysregulation of T cell lineages toward a hyperactive, autoimmunity-prone state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These results could be partly explained by the fact that four of the six IFN receptors (IFNRs) are encoded on chr21, including Type I, II and III IFNR subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In a mouse model of DS, normalization of <italic>IFNR</italic> gene copy number rescues multiple phenotypes of DS, including lethal immune hypersensitivity, congenital heart defects (CHDs), cognitive impairments, and craniofacial anomalies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. JAK inhibition rescues lethal immune hypersensitivity in these mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and attenuates the global dysregulation of gene expression caused by the trisomy across multiple murine tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Furthermore, prenatal JAK inhibition in pregnant mice prevents the appearance of CHDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Altogether, these results support the notion that T21 elicits an interferonopathy in DS, and that pharmacological inhibition of IFN signaling could have multiple therapeutic benefits in this population.</p>
<p>Although it is now well established that T21 disrupts immune homeostasis toward an autoimmunity-prone state, the interplay between overexpression of chromosome 21 genes, hyperactive interferon signaling, dysregulation of immune cell lineages, autoantibody production, hypercytokinemia, and the various developmental and clinical features of DS remain to be elucidated. Previous studies established similarities between the immune profiles of typical aging, autoimmunity in the general population, and DS, proposing a role for accelerated immune aging in the pathophysiology of DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Other studies indicate a role for elevated cytokine production, hyperactivated T cells, and ongoing B cell activation as drivers of autoimmunity in DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. However, given the relatively small sample sizes and observational nature of these studies, it has not been possible to define the contribution of specific dysregulated events to breach of tolerance leading to clinically evident autoimmunity in DS. Therefore, additional research is needed to define driver versus bystander events that could illuminate therapeutic strategies to decrease the burden of autoimmunity in DS.</p>
<p>Within this context, we report here a comprehensive analysis of the immune disorder of DS, including detailed annotation of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions and quantification of autoantibodies in hundreds of research participants, which reveals widespread autoimmune attack on all major organ systems in DS from an early age, including unexpected autoantibody-phenotype associations. Then, using deep immune mapping and quantitative proteomics, we demonstrate that T21 causes widespread immune remodeling toward an autoimmunity-prone state accompanied by hypercytokinemia prior to clinically evident autoimmunity or autoantibody production. Lastly, we report the interim analysis of a clinical trial investigating the safety and efficacy of the JAK1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib (Xeljanz, Pfizer) in DS. These results demonstrate that JAK inhibition improves multiple immunodermatological conditions in DS, normalizes interferon scores, decreases levels of major pathogenic cytokines (e.g., TNF-Î±, IL-6), and reduces levels of pathogenic autoantibodies [e.g., anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO)]. Altogether, these results point to hyperactive JAK/STAT signaling as driver of autoimmunity in DS and justify the ongoing trials of JAK inhibitors in DS for multiple clinical endpoints.</p>

<title>Widespread multi-organ autoimmunity and autoantibody production in Down syndrome</title>
<p>Previous studies have documented increased rates of diverse autoimmune conditions in DS relative to the general population including autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, celiac disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, autoimmune skin conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and type I diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, many of these studies were limited by relatively small sample sizes, independent analysis of individual autoimmune conditions, or a focus on specific age ranges. In order to complete a more comprehensive analysis of autoimmune conditions in DS across the lifespan, we analyzed the harmonized clinical profiles of 441 research participants with DS, aged 6 months to 57 years, enrolled in the Human Trisome Project cohort study (HTP, NCT02864108), which annotates clinical data through a combination of participant/caregiver surveys and expert abstraction of electronic health records (EHRs) (see <bold>Materials and Methods</bold>, <bold>Supplementary file 1</bold>). In this analysis, the most common autoimmune condition is AITD, affecting 53.1% of the total cohort (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â figure supplement 1a</xref>). Grouped together, autoimmune and inflammatory skin conditions represent the second most common category, affecting 43% of the cohort, including: atopic dermatitis / eczema (27.9%), hidradenitis suppurativa / folliculitis / boils (20.6%), alopecia areata (7.7%), psoriasis (6.1%), and vitiligo (1.9%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - supplement 1b</xref>). The rate of celiac disease (9.6%) is also highly elevated over that of the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We observed 10 cases (2.2%) of juvenile Type I diabetes, which has been reported to be more common in DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Other autoimmune conditions common in the general population, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or multiple sclerosis, were not observed in the HTP cohort.</p>

<p>In the general population, the risk of autoimmune conditions increases with age and is higher in females, with autoimmune conditions tending to cluster, whereby occurrence of one autoimmune condition predisposes to a second condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Within the HTP cohort, analysis of age trajectories of immune-related conditions in DS revealed early onset, with &gt;80% of AITD, autoimmune/inflammatory skin conditions, and celiac disease being diagnosed in the first two decades of life (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â supplement 1c-e</xref>). The cumulative burden of autoimmunity and autoinflammation is similar in males versus females with DS, albeit with slightly increased rates of AITD and hidradenitis suppurativa in females (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - supplement 1f</xref>). In terms of co-occurrence, when evaluating the adult population (18+ years old) for AITD, autoimmune/inflammatory skin conditions and celiac disease, we found that 75% of participants had a history of at least one condition, 38.4% had at least two, and 13.6% had three or more conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, analysis of medical records found an unexpectedly low number of individuals with records of autoantibodies against the thyroid gland [4.3%, e.g., anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO), anti-thyroglobulin (TG)] within the HTP cohort (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 - supplement 1a</xref>). This could be explained by the fact that thyroid disease is commonly diagnosed through measurements of thyroid-relevant hormones (TSH, T3, T4) without concurrent testing of autoantibodies. To investigate further, we measured anti-TPO levels as well as levels of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), a more general biomarker of autoimmunity (<bold>Supplementary file 2</bold>). Remarkably, 82.4% of adults with DS show positivity for at least one of these autoantibodies, with 41.2% being positive for both (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). Indeed, 62% of individuals with history of hypothyroidism were TPO+, whereby anti-TPO is just one of the possible autoantibodies associated with AITD. Prompted by these results, we next completed a more comprehensive analysis of autoantibodies in DS using protein array technology, with a focus on â¼380 common autoepitopes from 270 proteins (see <bold>Materials and Methods, Supplementary file 2</bold>). These efforts identified 25 autoantibodies significantly over-represented in people with DS relative to age- and sex-matched controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>), with 98.3% of individuals with DS being positive for at least one of these autoantibodies, and 63.3% being positive for six or more (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-e</xref>). In addition to autoantibodies against TPO, which is expressed exclusively in the thyroid gland, we identified autoantibodies targeting proteins that are either broadly expressed across multiple tissues (e.g., TOP1, UBA1, LAMP2) or preferentially expressed in specific organs across the human body, including liver (e.g., CYP1A2), pancreas (e.g., SLC30A8), skin (e.g., DSG3), bone marrow (e.g. SRP68), and brain tissue (e.g., AIMP1) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref><bold>, f</bold>).</p>
<p>Analysis of autoantibody positivity relative to history of co-occurring conditions produced several interesting observations. Expectedly, individuals with hypothyroidism are more likely to be positive for anti-TPO antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g-h</xref>). However, unexpectedly, TPO+ status also associates with higher rates of use of pressure equalizing (PE) tubes employed to alleviate the symptoms of recurrent ear infections and otitis media with effusion (OME), which is common in DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g-h</xref>). Possible interpretations for this result are provided in the Discussion. Positivity for additional autoantibodies was more common in those with other co-occurring neurological conditions, a broad classification encompassing various seizure disorders, movement disorders, and structural brain abnormalities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g-h</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â figure supplement 1g</xref>). Salient examples are antibodies against MUSK, a muscle-associated receptor tyrosine kinase involved in clustering of the acetylcholine receptors in the neuromuscular junction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>; UBA1, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme involved in antigen presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>; and MYH6, a cardiac myosin heavy chain isoform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g-h</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â figure supplement 1g</xref>). Individuals with history of tricuspid valve regurgitation display higher rates of four different autoantibodies, most prominently against WARS1, a tryptophan tRNA synthetase mutated in various neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, and SRP68, a protein commonly targeted by autoantibodies in necrotizing myopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 â figure supplement 1g</xref>). Individuals with a history of frequent pneumonia present a higher frequency of autoantibodies against DSG3 (desmoglein 3), a cell adhesion molecule targeted by autoantibodies in paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP), an autoimmune disease of the skin and mucous membranes that can involve fatal lung complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g-h</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results demonstrate widespread multi-organ autoimmunity across the lifespan in people with DS, with production of multiple autoantibodies that could potentially contribute to a number of co-occurring conditions more common in this population.</p>

<title>Trisomy 21 causes global immune remodeling regardless of evident clinical autoimmunity</title>
<p>Several immune cell changes have been proposed to underlie the autoimmunity-prone state of DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, but specific immune cell-to-phenotype associations have not been established in previous studies using smaller sample sizes. Therefore, we next investigated immune cell changes associated with various clinical and molecular markers of autoimmunity in DS. Toward this end we analyzed mass cytometry data from 292 individuals with DS relative to 96 euploid controls and tested for potential differences in immune cell subpopulations, identified using FlowSOM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, within the DS cohort based on number of autoimmune/inflammatory disease diagnoses, ANA positivity, TPO positivity, and positivity for additional autoantibodies. In agreement with previous analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we observed massive immune remodeling in all major myeloid and lymphoid subsets, including increases in basophils, along with depletion of eosinophils and total B cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-c</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 1a</xref><bold>-c</bold>). When comparing various subgroups within the DS cohort based on autoimmunity status, we observed that these global immune changes are largely independent of the presence of clinical diagnoses or autoantibody positivity, with very few additional changes significantly associated with these measures of autoimmunity (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 1d</xref>). For example, the significant depletion of B cells and enrichment of basophils in DS is not significantly different among the various subgroups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 â figure supplement 1c</xref>).

<title>Trisomy 21 causes hypercytokinemia from an early age independent of autoimmunity status</title>
<p>It is well established that individuals with DS display elevated levels of many inflammatory markers, including several interleukins, cytokines, and chemokines known to drive autoimmune conditions, such as IL-6 and TNF-Î±<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.

Therefore, we analyzed data available from the HTP cohort for 54 inflammatory markers in plasma samples from 346 individuals with DS versus 131 euploid controls and cross-referenced these data with the presence of autoimmune conditions and autoantibodies. These efforts confirmed the notion of profound hypercytokinemia in DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, with significant elevation of multiple acute phase proteins (e.g. CRP, SAA, IL1RA), pro-inflammatory cytokines (TSLP, IL-17C, IL-22, IL-17D, IL-9, IL-6, TNF-Î±) and chemokines (IP-10, MIP-3a, MIP-1a, MCP-1, MCP-4, Eotaxin), as well as growth factors associated with inflammation and wound healing (FGF, PlGF, VEGF-A) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>).

<p>Previous studies have reported signs of early immunosenescence and inflammaging in DS, including accelerated progression of immune lineages toward terminally differentiated states, early thymic atrophy, and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers associated with age in the typical population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. However, the extent to which the inflammatory profile of DS represents accelerated ageing versus other processes remains ill-defined. To address this, we first identified age-associated changes in immune markers within the euploid and DS cohorts separately (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - figure supplement 1b-c</xref>). This exercise identified multiple immune markers that were up- or down-regulated with age, with an overall conserved pattern of age trajectories in both groups (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - figure supplement 1c</xref>). For example, increased age is associated with increased CRP levels and decreased IL-17B levels in both cohorts (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 â figure supplement 1d</xref>). We then compared the effects of age versus T21 status on cytokine levels in the DS cohort, which identified many inflammatory factors elevated in DS across the lifespan that do not display a significant increase with age, such as IL-9 and IL-17C, or that increase with age only in the DS cohort, such as IP-10 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e-f</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - figure supplement 1e</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results indicate that T21 induces a constitutive hypercytokinemia from early childhood, with only a fraction of these inflammatory changes being exacerbated with age.</p>

This trial is a single-site, open-label, Phase II clinical trial enrolling individuals with DS between the ages of 12 and 50 years old affected by alopecia areata, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or vitiligo (see qualifying disease scores in <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). After screening, qualifying participants are prescribed 5 mg of tofacitinib twice daily for 16 weeks, with an optional extension to 40 weeks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, see <bold>Materials and Methods</bold>). After enrollment and assessments at a baseline visit, participants attend five safety monitoring visits during the main 16-week trial period.

<title>Tofacitinib normalizes IFN scores and decreases pathogenic cytokines and autoantibodies</title>
<p>It is well demonstrated that individuals with DS display elevated IFN signaling across multiple immune and non-immune cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Using an IFN transcriptional score composed of 16 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> measured via bulk RNA sequencing of peripheral blood RNA, individuals with DS in the HTP cohort study show a significant increase in these scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). Reduction of IFN scores is designated as a primary endpoint in the trial. At baseline, clinical trial participants show IFN scores within the typical range for DS, but values are decreased at 2, 8, and 16 weeks of tofacitinib treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref><bold>, Supplementary file 6</bold>). Time course analysis revealed that most participants show a decrease in IFN scores as soon as two weeks of treatment which is sustained over time, with two clear exceptions (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1a</xref>). At the 8-week study midpoint, 9 of 10 participants had decreased IFN scores relative to baseline, except participant AA2 who reported a COVID-19 vaccination three days prior to the visit and was pausing tofacitinib at the time of the blood draw (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1a</xref>). At the 16-week time point, nine of ten participants had decreased IFN scores, with the exception being AA4, who developed an URI in the week prior to the blood draw (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1a</xref>). Therefore, although all participants displayed decreased IFN scores at one or more time points during the treatment, IFN scores could be sensitive to immune triggers. Analysis of individual ISGs composing the IFN score revealed that whereas many ISGs elevated in DS display reduced expression upon tofacitinib treatment (e.g., <italic>RSAD2</italic>, <italic>IFI44L</italic>), others do not (e.g., <italic>BPGM</italic>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1b</xref>). To investigate this further, we defined the impact of tofacitinib on all 136 ISGs significantly elevated in DS that are not encoded on chr21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>). Collectively, ISGs as a group are significantly downregulated upon tofacitinib treatment, but the effect is not uniform across all ISGs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c</xref>), indicating that JAK1/3 inhibition does not reduce all IFN signaling elevated in DS, which could be explained by the fact that the IFN pathways also employ JAK2 for signal transduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Global analysis of transcriptome changes revealed that tofacitinib treatment reverses the dysregulation of many gene signatures observed in DS, effectively attenuating many pro-inflammatory signatures beyond IFN gamma and alpha responses, such as Inflammatory Response, TNF-Î± signaling via NFkB, IL-2 STAT5 signaling, and IL-6 JAK STAT3 signaling (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1c</xref>). Tofacitinib also reversed elevation of genes involved in Oxidative Phosphorylation and dampened downregulation of gene sets involved in Wnt/Beta Catenin and Hedgehog Signaling (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1c</xref><bold>-d</bold>). Conversely, tofacitinib did not rescue elevation of genes involved in Heme Metabolism or Mitotic Spindle (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1c</xref><bold>-d</bold>), suggesting that these transcriptome changes are not tied to the inflammatory profile of DS.</p>

<p>A secondary endpoint in the trial is decrease of peripheral inflammatory markers as defined by a composite cytokine score derived from measurements of TNF-Î±, IL-6, CRP, and IP-10, and which is significantly increased in participants with DS in the HTP study (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>). At baseline, clinical trial participants show cytokine scores within the range observed for DS, but these values decrease at 2, 8 and 16 weeks relative to baseline (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d-e</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1e</xref>). The decreases in TNF-Î± and IL-6 observed upon tofacitinib treatment indicates that elevation of these potent inflammatory cytokines requires sustained JAK/STAT signaling in DS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6e</xref>). As for the IFN scores assessment, time course analysis revealed that most participants show decreases in cytokine scores within two weeks of treatment that are sustained over time, again with the exception of AA2 at week 8 and AA4 at week 16. This reveals a correspondence between RNA-based transcriptional IFN scores and circulating levels of these cytokines in plasma, while also illustrating that both metrics may remain sensitive to immune triggers (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1f</xref><bold>-g</bold>).</p>
<p>One tertiary endpoint of the trial investigates the impact of tofacitinib treatment on levels of autoantibodies and markers employed to diagnose AITD [e.g., anti-TPO, anti-TG, anti-thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR)] and celiac disease [e.g., anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG), anti-deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP)]. Seven of the 10 participants presented at baseline with anti-TPO levels above the upper limit of normal (ULN, 60U/mL), and all seven experienced a decrease in these auto-antibodies at 8 weeks and 16 weeks relative to baseline (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6f</xref>). In fact, for one participant (HS1) the levels decreased below the ULN while on the trial. All seven of these participants had a history of thyroid disease (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>), which was being medically managed and/or clinically monitored with acceptable TSH and T4 values. Additionally, three of these seven participants also had anti-TG levels above the ULN (4 IU/mL) and all three showed a decrease from baseline levels while on tofacitinib at both 8 and 16 weeks, with one participant (AA6) falling below the ULN upon treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6f</xref>). Three participants also had anti-TSHr levels above the ULN, but no clear changes were observed upon treatment (<bold>Supplementary file 5</bold>). None of the 10 participants displayed anti-tTG or anti-DGP levels detected above ULN at screening.</p>
<p>Altogether, these results indicate that tofacitinib treatment decreases IFN scores, levels of key pathogenic cytokines, and key autoantibodies involved in AITD. Importantly, tofacitinib treatment lowers IFN scores and cytokine levels to within the range observed in the general population, not below, indicating that this immunomodulatory strategy can provide therapeutic benefit in DS without overt immune suppression.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An increasing body of evidence indicates that immune dysregulation contributes to the pathophysiology of DS and that immunomodulatory therapies could provide multidimensional benefits in this population. In mouse models, triplication of four <italic>IFNR</italic> genes contributes to multiple hallmarks of DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> and JAK inhibition attenuates global dysregulation of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> while rescuing key phenotypes, such as lethal immune hypersensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and CHDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The fact that gene signatures of IFN hyperactivity are present in human embryonic tissues with T21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> and embryonic tissues from mouse models of DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> indicates that the harmful effects of IFN hyperactivity could start <italic>in utero</italic>, supporting the notion that DS could be understood, in part, as an inborn error of immunity with similarities to monogenic interferonopathies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Results presented here demonstrate that T21 causes widespread multi-organ autoimmunity of pediatric onset, with production of autoantibodies targeting every major organ system. These results justify additional efforts to define the key pathogenic autoantibodies in DS beyond those commonly associated with AITD and celiac disease. Our analysis found significant associations between specific autoantibodies and some conditions more common in DS, but the diagnostic value of these observations will require validation efforts in much larger cohorts, which could lead to a personalized medicine approach for the management of autoimmunity in DS. For example, we found autoantibodies associated with various forms of auditory dysfunction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>), suggesting the possibility of autoimmune hearing loss in DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Elevated levels of anti-TPO in individuals with history of use of ear tubes suggests an interplay between otitis media and endocrine dysfunction in DS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. For example, it is possible that recurrent ear infections cause a chronic immune stimulus that lead to eventual breach of tolerance in this autoimmunity-prone population, even perhaps through epitope mimicry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Antibodies targeting MUSK, which we found to be elevated in DS and associated with co-occurring neurological phenotypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g-h</xref>), have been linked to development of myasthenia gravis, a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in the skeletal muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Whether MUSK antibodies associate with similar phenotypes in DS will require further investigation. Elevation of SRP68 autoantibodies in DS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d,f</xref>), which are common in necrotizing myopathies with cardiovascular involvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, suggests a potential autoimmune basis for musculoskeletal and cardiovascular complications in DS, which also warrants additional research.</p>
<p>We observed constitutive global immune remodeling and hypercytokinemia regardless of reported diagnoses of autoimmune disease or measurable autoantibody production from an early age, indicative of an autoimmunity-prone state throughout the lifespan. Therefore, measurements of specific immune cell types or cytokines in the bloodstream are unlikely to provide diagnostic value for autoimmunity in DS. However, antigen-specific immune assays, such as T cell or B cell activation assays, may reveal the specific timing of loss of tolerance and transition to clinical phenotypes. Future studies should also include analysis of tissue-resident immune cells, which may identify sites of local autoimmune attack in DS.</p>
<p>Among the many strategies that could be used to attenuate IFN hyperactivity, JAK inhibitors are the most well-studied and have the most approved indications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Of the more than ten globally-approved JAK inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, we chose to employ in our clinical trial the JAK1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib, which is used to treat diverse autoimmune/inflammatory conditions and which was approved in 2020 for treatment of polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA) in children 2 years and older<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Notably, all four IFNRs encoded on chr21 utilize JAK1 for signal transduction in combination with either JAK2 or TYK2, making JAK1 inhibitors the most logical choice to dampen the effects of <italic>IFNR</italic> gene triplication. As part of the clinical trial protocol, the approved interim analysis was designed to qualitatively evaluate feasibility and initial safety data on the first 10 participants completing a 16-week course of tofacitinib treatment. This analysis established that there were no AEs that required a change or cessation of tofacitinib dosing and that this medicine is well tolerated in individuals with DS. The clear benefits observed for diverse autoimmune skin conditions align with an increasing body of evidence supporting the use of JAK inhibition for immunodermatological conditions, including their recent approval for alopecia areata and atopic dermatitis in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. At this sample size, the effects of tofacitinib on HS are inconclusive. Although some participants and caregivers reported benefits in terms of fewer flares of lesser severity, the MSS metric did not show a clear trend, which may reveal the need for more frequent or different types of monitoring for HS, a condition that cycles periodically in severity. Our results indicate that tofacitinib does not fully suppress the immune response in people with DS, but rather attenuates IFN scores and cytokine scores to levels observed in the general population, which is an important consideration given the likely requirement for long-term use of the drug in this population. Furthermore, the effects of the drug are clearly gene-specific, highlighting the presence of inflammatory processes that may not be attenuated with this inhibitor, which could be beneficial in terms of preserving immune activity. Importantly, during treatment, both IFN scores and cytokine scores remain sensitive to immune stimuli, as evidenced by participants who had received a vaccine or experienced an URI before a blood draw (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 â figure supplement 1f</xref>). Overall, it is encouraging that key inflammatory markers decreased in a relatively short timeframe, likely offering systemic benefits beyond skin pathology. Importantly, the fact that levels of IL-6 and TNF-Î± are reduced upon tofacitinib treatment supports the use of JAK inhibitors over TNF-blockers or anti-IL-6 agents in this population. Although TNF-Î±-blockers are recommended to be used first in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, the value of this recommendation in people with DS remains to be defined. The clear decrease in anti-TPO and anti-TG levels indicates that autoreactive B cell function requires elevated JAK/STAT signaling, but whether this effect is cell-autonomous versus a consequence of a reduced systemic inflammatory milieu will require further investigation. Defining the effect of tofacitinib on other autoantibodies elevated in DS will also require a larger sample size and may be revealed in the full dataset after completion of this trial.</p>
<p>Lastly, this ongoing clinical trial includes measurements of various dimensions of neurological function not reported here. Although the absence of a placebo control arm may impede a clear interpretation of any effect of JAK inhibition on cognitive function, preliminary results have prompted the design and launch of a second trial (NCT05662228) aimed at defining the relative safety and efficacy of tofacitinib, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and the benzodiazepine lorazepam for Down syndrome Regression Disorder (DSRD), a condition characterized by sudden loss of neurological function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Altogether, these findings justify both a deeper investigation of all the deleterious effects of autoimmunity and hyperinflammation in DS and the expanded testing of immunomodulatory strategies for diverse aspects of DS pathophysiology, even perhaps from an early age.</p>

Research samples and technical controls (commercial plasma; Seralab) were diluted (1:250) in assay buffer, which consisted of 3% BSA, 5% milk, 0.05% Tween-20, and 160 Î¼g/ml His6ABP tag in PBS. Diluted samples and controls were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature then subsequently incubated with the antigen bead array for 2 hour. The reactions were then fixed for 10 minutes using 0.02% paraformaldehyde, then incubated for 30 minutes with goat Fab specific for human IgG Fc-Î³ tagged with the fluorescent marker R-phycoerythrin (Invitrogen). Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and number of beads for each reaction was analyzed using a FlexMap 3D instrument (Luminex Corp.). Quality control was performed using MFI and bead count to exclude antigens and samples not passing technical criteria including minimal bead counts and antigen coupling efficiency. To adjust for sample specific backgrounds, MFI values were transformed per reaction median absolute deviations (MADs) using the following calculation:</p>
<p>MADssample= (MFI - mediansample(MFI)) / MADsample(MFI)</p>
<p>Subsequent data analysis and handling was performed using R. For each antigen, positivity was defined as &gt;90th percentile MAD value for D21 samples only. Overrepresentation of positivity for each antigen in the T21 versus D21 group was determined using Fisherâs exact test, excluding antigens detected in &lt;18 samples (&lt;10% of total experiment). Correction for multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg approach and significance defined as q&lt;0.1 (10% FDR). Similarly, within the T21 group, Fisherâs exact test was used to test for overrepresentation of antigen positivity in cases versus controls for co-occurring conditions, with only those with at least 5 cases considered in the analysis.</p>

<title>Immune profiling via mass cytometry</title>
<p>Generation of the mass cytometry dataset was described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, but a full description is included here for reference. Two 0.5 mL aliquots of EDTA whole blood samples underwent RBC lysis and white blood cell fixation using TFP FixPerm Buffer (Transcription Factor Phospho Buffer Set, BD Biosciences). WBCs were then washed in 1x in PBS (Rockland), resuspended in Cell Staining Buffer (Fluidigm) and stored at â80Â°C. For antibody staining, samples were thawed at room temperature, washed in Cell Staining Buffer, barcoded using a Cell-ID 20-Plex Pd Barcoding Kit (Fluidigm), and combined per batch. Each batch was able to accommodate 19 samples with a common reference sample. Antibodies were either purchased pre-conjugated to metal isotopes or conjugation was performed in-house using a Maxpar Antibody Labeling Kit (Fluidigm). See <bold>Supplementary file 7</bold> for antibodies. Working dilutions for antibody staining were titrated and validated using the common reference sample and comparison to relative frequencies obtained by independent flow cytometry analysis. Surface marker staining was carried out for 30 min at 4Â°C in Cell Staining Buffer with added Fc Receptor Binding Inhibitor (eBioscience/ThermoFisher Scientific). Staining was followed by a wash in Cell Staining Buffer. Next, cells were permeabilized in Buffer III (Transcription Factor Phospho Buffer Set, BD Pharmingen) for 20 min at 4Â°C followed by washing with perm/wash buffer (Transcription Factor Phospho Buffer Set, BD Pharmingen). Intracellular transcription factor and phospho-epitope staining was carried out for 1 hour at 4Â°C in perm/wash buffer (Transcription Factor Phospho Buffer Set, BD Pharmingen), followed by a wash with Cell Staining Buffer. Cell-ID Intercalator-Ir (Fluidigm) was used to label barcoded and stained cells. Labeled cells were analyzed on a Helios instrument (Fluidigm). Mass cytometry data were exported as v3.0 FCS files for pre-processing and analysis.</p>

<p>Bead-based normalization via polystyrene beads embedded with lanthanides, both within and between batches, followed by bead removal was carried out as previously described using the Matlab-based Normalizer tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Batched FCS files were demultiplexed using the Matlab-based Single Cell Debarcoder tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Reference-based normalization of individual samples across batches against the common reference sample was then carried out using the R script <italic>BatchAdjust()</italic>. For the analyses described in this manuscript, CellEngine (CellCarta) was used to gate and export per-sample FCS files at four levels: Firstly, CD3+CD19+ doublets were excluded and remaining cells exported as âLiveâ cells; Live cells were then gated for hematopoietic lineage (CD45-positive) non-granulocytic (CD66-low) cells and exported as CD45+CD66low. Lastly, CD45+CD66low cells were gated on CD3-positivity and CD19-positivity and exported as T- and B-cells, respectively. Per-sample FCS files were then subsampled to a maximum of 50,000 events per file for subsequent analysis.</p>

<title>Unsupervised clustering</title>
<p>For each of the four levels (live, non-granulocytes, T cells, and B cells), all 388 per-sample FCS files were imported into R as a flowSet object using the <italic>read.flowSet()</italic> function from the flowCore R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Next a SingleCellExperiment object was constructed from the flowSet object using the <italic>prepData()</italic> function from the CATALYST package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Arcsinh transformation was applied to marker expression data with cofactor values ranging from â¼0.2 to â¼15 to give optimal separation of positive and negative populations for each marker, using the <italic>estParamFlowVS()</italic> function from the flowVS R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> and based on visual inspection of marker histograms (see <bold>Supplementary file 7)</bold>. Quality control and diagnostic plots were examined with the help of functions from CATALYST and the tidySingleCellExperiment R package. Unsupervised clustering using the FlowSOM algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> was carried out using the <italic>cluster()</italic> function from CATALYST, with grid size set to 10 x 10 to give 100 initial clusters and a maxK value of 40 was explored for subsequent meta-clustering using the ConsensusClusterPlus algorithm. Examination of delta area and minimal spanning tree plots indicated that 30-40 meta clusters gave a reasonable compromise between gains in cluster stability and number of clusters for each level. Each clustering level was re-run with multiple random seed values to ensure consistent results.</p>

<title>Cell type classification</title>
<p>To aid in assignment of clusters to specific lineages and cell types, the MEM package (marker enrichment modeling) was used to call positive and negative markers for each cell cluster based on marker expression distributions across clusters. Manual review and comparison to marker expression histograms, as well as minimal spanning tree plots and tSNE plots colored by marker expression, allowed for high-confidence assignment of most clusters to specific cell types. Clusters that were insufficiently distinguishable were merged into their nearest cluster based on the minimal spanning tree. Relative frequencies for each cell type / cluster were calculated for each sample as a percentage of total live cells and as a percentage of cells used for each level of clustering: total CD45+CD66low cells, total T cells, or total B cells.</p>

<title>Beta regression analysis</title>
<p>To identify cell clusters for which relative frequencies are associated with either trisomy 21 status or with various clinical subgroups (e.g. ANA+) among individuals with trisomy 21, beta regression analysis was carried out using the betareg R package, with each model using cell type cluster proportions (relative frequency) as the outcome/dependent variable and either T21 status or clinical subgroups as independent/predictor variables, along with adjustment for age and sex, and a logit link function. Extreme outliers were classified per-karyotype and per-cluster as measurements more than three times the interquartile range below or above the first and third quartiles, respectively (below Q1 - 3*IQR or above Q3 + 3*IQR) and excluded from beta regression analysis. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR) approach. Effect sizes (as fold-change in T21 vs. euploid controls or among T21 subgroups) for each cell type cluster were obtained by exponentiation of beta regression model coefficients. Fold-changes were visualized by overlaying on tSNE plots using ggplot2. For visualization of individual clusters, data points were adjusted for age and sex, using the <italic>adjust()</italic> function from the datawizard R package, and visualized as sina plots (separated by T21 status or clinical subgroup).</p>

<title>Analysis of immune marker data</title>
<p>Plasma concentration values (pg/mL) for each of the cytokines and related immune factors measured across multiple MSD assay plates was imported to R, combined, and analytes with &gt;10% of values outside of detection or fit curve range flagged. For each analyte, missing values were replaced with either the minimum (if below fit curve range) or maximum (if above fit curve range) calculated concentration per plate/batch and means of duplicate wells used for subsequent analysis. For the HTP study analysis, extreme outliers were classified per-karyotype and per-analyte as measurements more than three times the interquartile range below or above the first and third quartiles, respectively, and excluded from further analysis. Differential abundance analysis for inflammatory markers measured by MSD was performed using mixed effects linear regression as implemented in the <italic>lmer()</italic> function from the lmerTest R package (v3.1-2) with log2-transformed concentration as the outcome/dependent variable, T21 status or clinical subgroup (e.g., ANA+) as the predictor/independent variable, age and sex as fixed covariates, and sample source as a random effect. Multiple hypothesis correction was performed with the Benjamini-Hochberg method using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 10% (q &lt; 0.1).

<title>Clinical trial design and oversight</title>
<p>All aspects of this study were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All study activities were approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB, protocol # 19-1362, NCT04246372) with an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) appointed by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). Written consent was obtained from all participants, or their legally authorized representative if the participant was unable to provide consent, in which case participant assent was obtained. The Clinical Trial Protocol is provided in the <bold>Supplementary file 8</bold>. We report here interim results of a single-site, open-label phase 2 clinical trial enrolling individuals with DS between the ages of 12 and 50 years old with moderate-to-severe alopecia areata, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, or vitiligo. Qualifying disease scores are shown in <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>. After screening, qualifying participants are prescribed 5 mg tofacitinib twice daily for 16 weeks, with an optional extension arm to week 40. During the main 16-week trial, participants attend five safety monitoring visits after enrollment at the Baseline visit.</p>

<sec id="s4i">
<title>Trial Population</title>
<p>The recruitment goal for this trial is 40 participants completing 16 weeks of tofacitinib treatment, with a qualitative interim analysis triggered when 10 participants completed the main 16-week trial. Of the 10 participants included in the interim analysis, 4 are female, 100% identify as White/Caucasian, 3 identify as Hispanic or Latino, and mean age at enrollment was 23.1 years old (range 15-38.1 years old) (<bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). Baseline qualifying conditions of the 10 participants were alopecia areata: n=6 (46.1%), hidradenitis suppurativa: n=3 (30.8%), or psoriasis: n=1 (7.7%). Two participants also had atopic dermatitis, and two others had vitiligo, albeit below the severity required to be the qualifying condition. <bold>Outcome Measures.</bold></p>
<sec id="s4i1">
<title>Primary endpoints</title>
<p>The two primary outcome measures for this trial are safety and reduction in IFN transcriptional scores derived from peripheral whole blood. Based on the safety profile for tofacitinib in the general population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, the safety primary endpoint was defined as no more than two serious adverse events (SAEs) definitely attributable to tofacitinib over the course of 16 weeks for 40 participants. Adverse events were classified based using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0). IFN scores are commonly used to monitor disease severity and response to treatment in IFN-driven pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> and their calculation form RNAseq data is described above.</p>

<sec id="s4i2">
<title>Secondary endpoints</title>
<p>The secondary outcome measures for this trial include improvements in skin health as defined by a global assessment, the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), as well as the disease-specific assessments. Overall skin pathology, accounting for all present skin conditions regardless of severity, was assessed using a modified IGA which scores on a five-point scale for each skin condition (six points for HS) with a range of 0-21. Another secondary endpoint assessing global skin health is a change in the Dermatological Quality of Life Index (DLQI), used to assess participant-reported impact of skin conditions on self-image, relationships, and daily activities. Possible total scores range from 0-30, with higher scores indicating a more impaired quality of life. Condition-specific assessments used are Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) for AA affecting at least 25% of the scalp (qualifying score is â¥ 25); Hidradenitis Suppurativa-Physicians Global Assessment (HS-PGA) to define eligibility (qualifying score â¥3) and Modified Sartorius Scale (MSS) to monitor changes throughout the study for HS; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI, qualifying score is â¥10) for psoriasis; Vitiligo Extent Tensity Index (VETI, qualifying score is â¥2), for moderate-to-severe vitiligo; and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI, qualifying EASI score â¥16) for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The last secondary endpoint is reduction in a cytokine score coalescing information on four inflammatory markers elevated in DS: Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-Î±), interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and IFN-inducible protein 10 (IP10, CXCL10)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper represents a huge amount of work on a condition whose patients' health and well-being have not always been prioritized, and only relatively recently has the immune dysregulation seen in patients with Down Syndrome (DS) been garnering major research interest.</p>
<p>This paper provides an unparalleled examination of immune disorders in patients with DS. The authors also report the results from a clinical trial with the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in DS patients.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript reports a herculean effort and provides an unparalleled examination of immune disorders in a large number of patients with DS.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Not a major weakness but, apart from finding an elevation of CD4 T central memory cells and more differentiated plasmablast, several of the alterations reported in this manuscript had already been suggested by a few case reports and a very small series. On the other hand, the number of patients (and controls) utilized for this study is remarkable and allows for drawing much firmer conclusions.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Rachubinski and colleagues provide a comprehensive clinical, immunological, and autoantibody assessment of autoimmune/inflammatory manifestations of patients with Down syndrome (DS) in a large number of patients with this disorder. These analyses confirm prior results of excess interferon and cytokine signals in DS patients and extend these observations to highlight early-onset immunological aberrancies, far before symptoms occur, as well as characterizing novel autoantibody reactivities in this patient population. Then, the authors report the interim analysis of an open-label, Phase II, clinical trial of the JAK1/3 inhibitor, tofacitinib, that aims to define the safety, clinical efficacy, and immunological outcomes of DS patients who suffer from inflammatory conditions of the skin. The clinical trial analysis indicates that the treatment is tolerated without serious adverse effects and that the majority of patients have experienced clinical improvement or remission in their corresponding clinical cutaneous manifestations as well as improvement or normalization of aberrant immunological signals such as cytokines.</p>
<p>The major strength of the study is the recruitment and uniform, systematic evaluation of an impressive number of DS patients. Moreover, the promising early results from the tofacitinib clinical trial pave the way for analysis of a larger number of patients within the Phase II trial and otherwise, which may lead to improved clinical outcomes for affected patients. An inherent weakness of such studies is the descriptive nature of several parameters and the relatively small size of tofacitinib-treated DS patients. However, the descriptive nature of some of the correlative research analyses is of scientific interest and is useful to generate hypotheses for future additional (including mechanistic) work, and treatment of 10 DS patients in a formal clinical trial at interim analysis is not a trivial task for a disease like this. The manuscript achieves the aims of the authors and the results support their conclusions. The authors appropriately acknowledge areas that require more research and areas that are not well understood. The results are represented in a useful manner and statistical methods and analyses appear sound.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have high rates of autoimmunity and can have exaggerated immune responses to infection that can unfortunately cause significant medical complications. Prior studies from these authors and others have convincingly demonstrated that individuals with DS have immune dysregulation including increased Type I IFN activity, elevated production of inflammatory cytokines (hypercytokinemia), increased autoantibodies, and populations of dysregulated adaptive immune cells that pre-dispose to autoimmunity. Prior studies have demonstrated that using JAK inhibitors to treat patient samples in vitro, in small case series of patients, and in mouse models of DS leads to improvement of immune phenotype and/or clinical disease. This manuscript provides two major advances in our understanding of immune dysregulation and therapy for patients. First, they perform deep immune phenotyping on several hundred individuals with DS and demonstrate that immune dysregulation is present from infancy. Second, they report a promising interim analysis of a Phase II clinical trial of a JAK inhibitor in 10 people with DS and moderate to severe skin autoimmunity.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>The relatively large cohort and careful clinical annotation here provide new insights into the immune phenotype of patients with DS. For example, it is interesting that regardless of autoimmune disease or autoantibody status, individuals with DS have elevated cytokines and CRP. Analysis of the cohorts by age demonstrated that some cytokines are significantly elevated in people with DS starting in infancy (e.g., IL-9 and IL-17C). Nearly all adults with DS in this study had autoantibodies (98%) and most had six or more autoantibodies (63%), which differed significantly from euploid study participants. This implies that all patients with DS might benefit from early intervention with therapy to reduce inflammation. However, it is also worth considering that an alternative interpretation that since hypercytokinemia does not vary based on disease state in individuals with DS, this may not be a key factor driving autoimmunity (although it may be relevant for other clinical symptoms such as neuroinflammation).</p>
<p>Small case series have suggested the benefit of JAK inhibitors to treat autoimmunity in DS. This is the first report of a prospective clinical trial to test a JAK inhibitor in this setting. The clinical trial entry criteria included moderate to severe autoimmune skin disease in patients aged 12-50 years with DS, and treatment was with the JAK1/3 inhibitor tofacitinib. This clinical trial is a critically important step for the field. The early results support that treatment is well tolerated with an improvement of interferon scores in patients and reduction of autoantibodies. Most patients experienced clinical improvement, with alopecia areata having the greatest response. Treatment may not affect all skin diseases equally, for example of the 5 patients with hidradenitis suppurativa, only 1 showed clinical improvement based on skin score. While very promising, the clinical trial results reported here are preliminary and based on an interim analysis of 10 patients at 16 weeks. Individuals with DS have a lifelong risk of immune dysregulation and thus it is unclear how long therapy, if of benefit, would need to be continued. The results of longer-term therapy will be informative when considering the risks/benefits of this therapy.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This paper represents a huge amount of work on a condition whose patients' health and well-being have not always been prioritized, and only relatively recently has the immune dysregulation seen in patients with Down Syndrome (DS) been garnering major research interest.</p>
<p>This paper provides an unparalleled examination of immune disorder in patients with DS. In a truly herculean effort, the authors provided the cumulative examination of over 440 patients with DS, confirmed the alterations in immune cell subsets (n=292, 96 controls) and multi-organ autoimmunity seen in these patients as they age, and identified autoantibody production that could contribute to conditions co-occurring in patients with DS. They also sought to look at whether the early immunosenescence seen in DS was due to the inflammatory profile by comparing age-associated markers in DS patients and euploid controls separately, finding that several markers are regulated with age regardless of group, while comparing the effect of age versus DS status on cytokine status identified inflammatory markers elevated in DS patients across the lifespan that do not increase with age or that increase with age only in the DS cohort. This is very interesting in the context of DS in particular, and immunity during aging in general.</p>
<p>The second part of the manuscript presents the results from a clinical trial with the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in DS patients. While the number of DS patients treated with tofacitinib was small, the results were often quite striking. Treatment was well-tolerated and the improvement of dermatological conditions was clear. The less responsive patients AA4 and AA2 provide a very clear illustration that these patients are sensitive to immune triggers during treatment. Additionally, the demonstration that patients' IFN scores and cytokine levels decreased without clear immunosuppression with tofacitinib treatment is encouraging, since treatment with this drug would need to be continuous. I would be curious to see if the patients added past the cutoff for interim analysis follow a similar trajectory. I would not ask the authors to add any data; the paper is well-written and logically constructed.</p>
<p>I only have a small comment: I really did not like how Figure 2 a, d, and g tethered the coloring to the magnitude of fold change to show the effect of DS particularly for 2a and 2g. Given that these fold changes are quite modest, the coloring is very light and hard to distinguish. The clear takeaway is that the effect on T cells is greatest, but there must be a better way to illustrate this. Perhaps displaying this graph on a non-white background could help with contrast.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the Reviewerâs very positive assessment of the manuscript and constructive feedback. We want to assure the Reviewer that similar analyses will be completed in the future for the entire cohort recruited into the trial to determine if similar trajectories and results are observed with the larger sample size. Additionally, following Reviewerâs guidance, we will explore alternative ways to present the data in Figure 2 for greater clarity in a revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>â¢ Although the focus of the patients in the first part of the paper is on autoimmune/inflammatory conditions, it will be useful to also list the non-autoimmune infectious manifestations for reference with prevalence data. For example, otitis media, or lung infections (mentioned within the paper), or mucosal candidiasis. Same for other manifestations such as cardiac or malignant conditions. Given the impressive number of patients, it will be useful to the readers to have prevalence data for these as well, even in brief statements within the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this inquiry by the Reviewer and will present additional data on the co-occurring conditions mentioned by the Reviewer in a revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ Have the authors looked at DN T cells and whether they may be enriched in DS patients, given their enrichment in some autoimmune conditions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for this inquiry. We did examine DN T cells (double negative T cells), which we referred to in our Figure 2 and Figure 2 â figure supplement 1 as non-CD4+ CD8+ T cells. Although this T cell subset is mildly elevated (in terms of frequency among T cells) in individuals with Down syndrome, the result did not reach statistical significance after multiple hypothesis correction. This negative result is shown in the heatmap in Figure 2 â figure supplement 1d.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ It would be useful to move the segment of the discussion that discusses the interim predefined analysis of the phase 2 trial to the corresponding segment of the results. As this reviewer was reading the paper, it was unclear why the interim analysis was done, whether it was predefined and it was not until the discussion that it became apparent. I believe it will help the readers to have a brief mention that this interim analysis was predefined and set to occur at the first 10 DS enrollees. Also, it would be helpful to state what is the total number of DS patients planned for enrollment in the Phase 2 trial which is continuing recruitment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment and will modify the text following the Reviewerâs guidance in the revised manuscript. The trial will be considered complete once a total of 40 participants undergo 16-weeks of treatment with good medicine compliance (less that 15% missed doses).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>â¢ Although the authors present data on TPO autoantibodies before and after tofacitinib, it remains unclear whether the other non-TPO autoantibodies were altered during treatment or whether this was a TPO autoantibody-specific phenomenon. Was there an alteration in mature B cells or plasmablast populations after tofacitinib? If these data are available, they would further enhance the manuscript. If they are not available, it would be useful for the authors to discuss those in the discussion of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for this comment, which strongly aligns with our future research interests and plans for the analysis of the full cohort once the trial is completed. In the interim analysis, we analyzed only auto-antibodies related to autoimmune thyroid disease and celiac disease, as shown in the manuscript. However, we plan to complete a more comprehensive analysis of the effects of JAK inhibition on autoantibody production once the full sample set is available at the end of the trial. Likewise, the clinical trial protocol contemplates collection and processing of blood samples for immune mapping using mass cytometry, which will enable us to answer the question from the Reviewer about potential changes in B cells or plasmablasts populations. Following Reviewerâs guidance, we will discuss these planned analyses in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Cellular immune phenotyping data in Figure 2 presents a large number of patients with DS versus euploid controls (292 and 96 respectively). Given the relatively large cohort there would seem to be an opportunity to determine whether age or sex alters the immune phenotype shown, for example, TEMRAs, etc. Was the data analyzed in this way?</p>

<p>We welcome this comment, which clearly aligns with our research interests and planned additional analyses of these datasets generated by the Human Trisome Project. We can share with the Reviewer that although sex as a biological variable has minimal impacts on the strong immune dysregulation observed in Down syndrome, there are clear age-dependent effects, with some immune changes occurring early during childhood versus others taking place later in adult life. A manuscript describing a complete analysis of age-dependent effects on the multi-omics datasets in the Human Trisome Project is currently under preparation.</p>

<p>(2) The authors should strongly consider incorporating/discussing the findings from Gansa et al, Journal of Clinical Immunology May 2024 - where they reviewed the immune phenotype of 1299 patients with Down syndrome.</p>

<p>Thanks for this suggestion, we will surely cite and discuss this recent paper in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) It is difficult to differentiate patients Hs2 and Ps1 in Figure 5d.</p>

<p>Thanks for this observation, we will modify the labels for greater clarity in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(4) Given their finding of no correlation between cytokine levels/immune phenotype and autoimmunity, some additional discussion of the relevance of hypercytokinemia in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity would seem relevant (given that this was the basis for the clinical trial). The authors mention that cytokine levels may not be appropriate measures of disease in the patients.</p>

<p>We welcome this opportunity to expand the discussion of the relevance of hypercytokinemia in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity and will do so in the revised manuscript.</p>
