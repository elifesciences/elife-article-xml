<title>Abstract</title><p>Periodic formation of protoneuromasts within the migrating zebrafish Posterior Lateral Line primordium serves as a model for understanding steps that determine the self-organization of organ systems in development. Protoneuromast formation is initiated by Fgf signaling at the trailing zone of the migrating primordium in response to Fgfs produced by Wnt active cells in a leading zone. Progressive restriction of an initially broad Wnt signaling domain to a smaller leading zone allows new Fgf signaling-dependent protoneuromasts to form in the wake of the shrinking Wnt system. We show Sox2 and Sox3 are expressed in nascent and maturing protoneuromasts in a trailing part of the primordium in a pattern that is complementary to Wnt activity in a leading domain, where Sox1a, is expressed. Together, these SoxB1 factors help inhibit Wnt signaling to determine effective maturation of trailing protoneuromasts and the timely deposition of stable neuromasts. Using <italic>dkk1b</italic> and <italic>atoh1b</italic> to monitor initiation and subsequent maturation of protoneuromasts, respectively, we show how Wnt signaling regulates the pace of protoneuromast maturation in the migrating primordium, and how its inhibition by SoxB1 family members ensures maturation and deposition of stable neuromasts. Together, our observations define three steps in the periodic formation of neuromasts: first, polarization of Wnt activity in the primordium; second, pattern forming step that determines periodic formation of protoneuromasts in the context of polarized Wnt activity; and third, inhibition of Wnt signaling, which is essential for stabilizing nascent neuromasts formed in the earlier pattern forming stage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The zebrafish Posterior Lateral Line (PLL) primordium is a cluster of approximately 140 cells that migrates under the skin, along the horizontal myoseptum, from near the ear to the tip of the tail, periodically forming and depositing neuromasts to spearhead formation of the zebrafish Posterior Lateral Line system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chitnis et al., 2012</xref>). The Lateral Line is a sensory system with sensory organs called neuromasts that allow amphibians and fish to detect the pattern of water flow over their body surface. In zebrafish, nascent neuromasts, or protoneuromasts, are formed sequentially within the migrating PLL primordium starting from its trailing end. Each protoneuromast has a central hair cell progenitor, which is surrounded by cells that reorganize to form epithelial rosettes. As new protoneuromasts form progressively closer to the leading end of the primordium, previously formed protoneuromasts mature to form stable epithelial rosettes prior to deposition.</p>
<p>Understanding the sequence of events that coordinate specification of cell fate, shape, cellular organization and collective migration in the microcosm of the lateral line primordium contributes more broadly to understanding self-organization of tissues in a developing embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudiere, 2007</xref>). In this study we have examined the role of SoxB1 family transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gou et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gou et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Okuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhang and Cui, 2014</xref>), Sox1a, Sox2 and Sox3 in the primordium, highlighting their critical role in the initiation of protoneuromast formation and maturation, enabling deposition of stable neuromasts by the migrating primordium.</p>
<p>Interactions between the Wnt, Fgf and Notch signaling systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aman and Piotrowski, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Itoh and Chitnis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lecaudey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</xref>) coordinate periodic formation of protoneuromasts within the migrating primordium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The primordium forms adjacent to the ear and is dominated by Wnt/b-catenin activity, which initially extends throughout the primordium. Initiation of primordium migration toward the tail facilitates polarization of the Wnt activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Neelathi et al., 2018</xref>) such that it becomes highest toward the leading end of the primordium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Wnt signaling determines expression of factors including Wnt10 and Lef1 that locally promote Wnt activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aman and Piotrowski, 2008</xref>). Wnt activity also promotes expression of Fgf3 and Fgf10. However, Wnt active cells producing Fgf ligands cannot respond to them as Wnt activity promotes expression of factors that inhibit Fgf receptors from effectively responding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aman and Piotrowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Matsuda et al., 2013</xref>). Instead, these Fgfs activate Fgf receptors in a more distant, trailing part of the primordium with lower Wnt activity. Activation of Fgf signaling in the trailing domain initiates expression of the diffusible Wnt antagonist, Dkk1b. The combination of the local promotion of Wnt signaling coupled with longer range inhibition of Wnt by Fgf-dependent Dkk1b is thought to determine the self-organization of center-biased Fgf signaling centers that seed formation of a nascent neuromast or protoneuromast (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aman and Piotrowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dalle Nogare and Chitnis, 2020</xref>).</p>

It is also associated with suppression of Wnt signaling in the trailing zone such that the initially broad domain of Wnt activity shrinks, creating conditions for periodic formation of new protoneuromasts in its wake. Sequential formation and maturation of protoneuromasts is associated with changes in the pattern of Fgf signaling; from center-biased in a newly formed protoneuromast, to broader as the central cell becomes a source of Fgf, to finally, donut shaped in the most mature protoneuromast, as Fgf signaling is lost in the central <italic>atoh1a</italic>-expressing cell.</p></caption>

<p>Activation of Fgf signaling initiates the formation of a protoneuromast by coordinating both the specification of a central cell to become a sensory hair cell progenitor and the reorganization of its surrounding cells to form an epithelial rosette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lecaudey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</xref>). Fgf signaling initiates the expression of <italic>atoh1a</italic>, which gives cells in the nascent protoneuromast the potential to become sensory hair cell progenitors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, Fgf signaling and Atoh1a, respectively, also determine the expression of Notch ligands DeltaA and DeltaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</xref>). They activate Notch in their neighbors, which inhibits them from expressing <italic>atoh1a</italic>. As Fgf signaling and <italic>atoh1a</italic> is initiated in a center-biased pattern, lateral inhibition mediated by Notch signaling restricts <italic>atoh1a</italic> to a central cell, which becomes specified as a sensory hair cell progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chitnis et al., 2012</xref>). Activation of Fgf signaling also promotes epithelialization of primordium cells; they become taller and acquire apical basal polarity. Fgf-dependent expression of factors, like <italic>shroom3,</italic> promote apical constriction and the reorganization of epithelialized primordium cells to form epithelial rosettes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ernst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lecaudey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The maturation of protoneuromasts at the trailing end is accompanied by progressive restriction of the initially broad Wnt domain to a smaller leading domain. As the Wnt system shrinks, another Fgf signaling domain is established in its wake, seeding formation of another protoneuromast (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). At the same time, the central Atoh1a-expressing sensory hair cell progenitor becomes a new source of Fgf10. It activates Fgf receptors in surrounding cells, helping to consolidate their reorganization to form epithelial rosettes. The central Atoh1a-expressing sensory hair cell progenitor also expresses DeltaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</xref>), which by activating Notch in neighboring cells, promotes expression of adhesion molecules and factors that promote stability of apical cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kozlovskaja-Gumbriene et al., 2017</xref>). In this manner, by determining expression of both Fgf and Notch ligands, the central Atoh1a-expressing sensory hair cell progenitor plays a critical role in determining maturation of stable epithelial rosettes prior to their deposition by the migrating primordium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>As maturing protoneuromasts in the trailing domain become progressively separated from leading Wnt-active cells that are the initial source of Fgf signals, maintenance of Atoh1a expression must also become independent of the Fgf signals that initiated its expression in newly forming protoneuromasts. This is achieved by Atoh1a determining expression of <italic>atoh1b</italic>, which in turn determines <italic>atoh1a</italic> expression, creating a positive-feedback loop that maintains Atoh1a expression in the maturing sensory hair cell progenitor independent of Fgf signaling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Initiation and subsequent maturation of protoneuromasts within the primordium is expected to be associated with systematic changes in the pattern of Fgf signaling, where center-biased Fgf signaling initiates protoneuromast formation and <italic>atoh1a</italic> expression. However, as the central <italic>atoh1a</italic>-expressing cell becomes a source of Fgf signals, it activates Fgf signaling in its neighbors, and the pattern of Fgf signaling broadens to include neighboring cells. Eventually, as Atoh1a inhibits Fgf receptor expression, Fgf signaling is lost in within the central hair cell progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Matsuda and Chitnis 2010</xref>) and the pattern of Fgf signaling is expected to become donut shaped (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Fgf activity in blue).</p>
<p>This study began with the observation that <italic>sox2</italic> is expressed in a changing pattern consistent with the predicted dynamic pattern of Fgf signaling in the primordium described above. However, in contrast to expectations, it was found that Fgf signaling is not directly responsible for determining sox2 expression; rather, it is the absence of Wnt signaling that facilitates <italic>sox2</italic> expression in the primordium. Further investigation of <italic>sox2</italic> function in the migrating primordium revealed its critical role in inhibiting Wnt signaling and limiting it to a leading zone in a partially redundant manner with Sox1a and Sox3. Furthermore, these SoxB1 transcription factors were shown to be essential for effective maturation of proneuromasts and timely deposition of neuromasts by the migrating primordium.</p>

<title>Differential regulation of sox1a, sox2 and sox3 by Wnt and Fgf signaling in the lateral line primordium</title>
<p>There are three members of SoxB1 family of transcription factors expressed in the migrating primordium: <italic>sox1a</italic>, <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic>. <italic>sox1a</italic> is expressed in a leading zone of the primordium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), where protoneuromasts are absent or just beginning to form. Conversely, <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> are most prominent in a trailing part of the primordium, which is associated with domains where protoneuromasts periodically form and mature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). <italic>sox1a</italic> is expressed in a relatively broad leading zone in a pattern that is like the Wnt-dependent expression of <italic>lef1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting its expression might be regulated by Wnt signaling. <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> expression in the trailing part resembles that of Fgf-dependent <italic>pea3</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C and F), consistent with their association with Fgf-dependent formation of protoneuromasts. <italic>sox2</italic> expression is initiated toward the leading end in a pattern consistent with its dominance at the center of the most recently formed protoneuromasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, white arrows). Expression becomes broader and more intense in a more trailing domain, in association with a progressively maturing protoneuromast (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, blue arrow). Finally, sox2 expression is often absent in the center of the most mature protoneuromast in the trailing domain of a migrating primordium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, black arrow). <italic>sox3</italic> is expressed in a pattern that is like that of <italic>sox2</italic> in the trailing part of the primordium, however, its dynamic changes in expression are not as easy to see as with <italic>sox2</italic> probes. Changes in <italic>sox2</italic> expression, described above, from the leading to the trailing end of the primordium are consistent with expected pattern of Fgf signaling activity in the primordium described earlier (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Overlap of <italic>sox1a</italic> expression with <italic>lef1</italic> and the complementary pattern of <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>lef1</italic> expression is demonstrated with Hybridization Chain Reaction (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As s<italic>ox1a</italic> expression in the leading domain of the primordium is consistent with its expression being determined by Wnt/b-catenin signaling, and <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> expression reflects the predicted pattern of Fgf signaling, we asked if Wnt and Fgf signaling, respectively, regulate their expression. Wnt target genes can be repressed by ΔN-TCF, a dominant repressor form of TCF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>) that lacks its N-terminal domain required to bind its co-activator b-catenin but retains its domain for binding a co-repressor Groucho. Heat shock induced expression of ΔN-TCF results in reduction or loss of both <italic>lef1</italic> and <italic>sox1a</italic> expression in the primordium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, E, H, I), supporting a role for Wnt/b-catenin signaling in determining <italic>sox1a</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Fgf signaling in the primordium is initiated by Wnt/b-catenin signaling-dependent Fgf expression by cells in the leading domain. Therefore, heat shock induced ΔN-TCF expression also inhibits Fgf expression in the primordium, which is reflected by reduced expression of Fgf-dependent <italic>pea3</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, G). Though both <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> are expressed in similar patterns in the primordium, heat shock induced expression of ΔN-TCF had opposite effects on expression of <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic>; <italic>sox2</italic> expression persists and expands into the leading zone, filling the entire primordium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>, K), while <italic>sox3</italic> expression is reduced or eliminated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>, M). The opposite effects of ΔN-TCF on <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> can be interpreted in the context of the inhibitory effects of ΔN-TCF on both Wnt and Fgf signaling. As ΔN-TCF inhibits Wnt/b-catenin, aberrant expansion of <italic>sox2</italic> into the leading domain suggests that Wnt/b-catenin signaling normally inhibits its expression in the leading zone. Furthermore, persistence of <italic>sox2</italic> expression suggests that Fgf signaling is not essential for its expression in the trailing domain, rather it is the absence Wnt/b-catenin signaling in the trailing domain that, at least in part, allows its expression there. On the other hand, loss of both <italic>pea3</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> expression from the trailing domain following heat shock induced ΔN-TCF expression suggests that Fgf signaling is required for <italic>sox3</italic> expression in the trailing domain.</p>
<p>To further examine the role of Fgf signaling in <italic>sox1a</italic>, <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> expression in the primordium, we examined their expression following heat shock-induced expression of a dominant negative Fgf receptor (DNFgfR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Heat shock induced expression of DNFgfR has complementary effects on the pattern of Wnt and Fgf signaling in the primordium; while it results in loss of Fgf-dependent <italic>pea3</italic> from the trailing domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2O</xref>), loss of Fgf-dependent inhibition allows aberrant expansion of Wnt/b-catenin activity into the trailing domain, as reflected by expanded <italic>lef1</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>). Consistent with <italic>sox1a</italic> expression being determined by Wnt signaling, <italic>sox1a</italic> expression also expands to cover the entire length of the primordium following heat shock induction of DNFgfR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2P</xref>). On the other hand, expression of both <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> is reduced or lost in the primordium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Q</xref>, R). However, the preceding analysis suggested their expression is lost for different reasons. While loss of Fgf signaling is likely to account for loss of <italic>sox3</italic> expression, the loss of <italic>sox2</italic> expression is likely to be related to the expansion of Wnt signaling activity into the trailing domain, where it prevents <italic>sox2</italic> expression. To test this interpretation, expression of <italic>sox2</italic> was re-examined following heat shock induced expression of both DNFgfR and ΔN-TCF, which is expected to result in simultaneous loss of both Wnt and Fgf signaling. When double transgenic HS: DNFgfR and HS: ΔN-TCF embryos were examined at 32 hpf following heat shock at 28 hpf, expression of both <italic>lef1</italic> and <italic>pea3</italic> was lost, confirming simultaneous loss of both Wnt and Fgf signaling in the primordium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2S</xref>, T). At the same time, expression of <italic>sox2</italic> recovered and expanded in embryos with heat shock induced expression of both DNFgfR and ΔN-TCF Wnt (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2U</xref>), confirming that <italic>sox2</italic> expression is determined, at least in part, by the absence of Wnt signaling, rather than presence of Fgf signaling. As <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> expression is complementary to <italic>lef1</italic>, we asked if they mutually inhibit each other. Consistent with this, knockdown of <italic>lef1</italic> allowed <italic>sox2</italic> expression to expand into the leading zone, while knockdown of <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> with sox2MO1 (described below) allowed <italic>lef1</italic> to expand into the trailing zone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2V-Y</xref>). In summary, while expression of <italic>sox1a</italic> is determined by Wnt activity, expression of <italic>sox3</italic> is determined by Fgf signaling, and <italic>lef1</italic> and <italic>sox2</italic> mutually inhibit each other’s expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Z</xref>)</p>

<p>Though <italic>sox2</italic> mutants initially recapitulated observations in the sox2MO1 morphants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, D), after maintenance of the mutant for several generations, the severity of the phenotype reduced and was not fully penetrant in homozygous sox2<sup>y589</sup> mutant embryos (compare <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, I, L). This raised the possibility that other SoxB1 family members expressed in the primordium had the potential to partially compensate for loss of <italic>sox2</italic> in the primordium. To examine the role of <italic>sox1a</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> in potentially compensating for loss of <italic>sox2</italic>, a previously generated <italic>sox3</italic> mutant was acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gou et al., 2018a</xref>) and a CRISPR-generated <italic>sox1a<sup>y590</sup></italic>mutant was generated in which a 13 base pair deletion introduces a stop codon in the first exon (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). Comparing the pattern of neuromast deposition in homozygous <italic>sox2</italic> mutants with <italic>sox2, sox1a</italic> double or <italic>sox2</italic>, <italic>sox3</italic> double homozygous mutants showed that simultaneous loss of <italic>sox2</italic> with either <italic>sox1a</italic> or <italic>sox3</italic> results in a more severe phenotype characterized by a greater fraction of embryos showing delayed deposition of the first neuromast (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>, N). It should be noted that as the original sox2<sup>y589</sup> mutant line has been maintained for multiple generations, the homozygous mutant phenotype has become progressively weaker and only a small fraction of homozygous mutant embryos now show delayed deposition of L1, as opposed to roughly half when the y589 line was first created (compare position of L1 in sox2<sup>-/-</sup> in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref> or L). Keeping this in mind, neither homozygous <italic>sox1a</italic>, <italic>sox2</italic>, or <italic>sox3</italic> mutants on their own had a significant fraction of embryos with delayed deposition of L1. On the other hand, simultaneous loss of <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox1a</italic> function resulted in a much more severe delay in deposition of the first neuromast and at approximately 48-52hpf the first obvious neuromast was typically observed at a much more caudal position (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). <italic>sox2/sox3</italic> double mutants, on the other hand, had a phenotype like that seen in <italic>sox2</italic> MO1 morphants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, N).</p>
<p>Though the similarity of <italic>sox2/sox3</italic> double mutants to the phenotype seen in sox2MO1 morphants was initially attributed to potential differences in genetic compensatory mechanisms operating in morphants versus mutants, our analysis of the previously published sox2MO1 morpholino revealed that its sequence allowed it to simultaneously target <italic>sox3</italic>. Comparison of effects of sox2MO1 and <italic>sox3</italic> MO on Sox2 and Sox3 expression with antibody staining confirmed that the sox2MO1 effectively inhibited both Sox2 and Sox3 expression, while the sox3 MO selectively inhibited Sox3 expression without any detectable effect on Sox2 expression (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). An alternate sox2 morpholino (AACCGATTTTCTCGAAAGTCTACCC), shown to be more specific for Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kamachi et al., 2008</xref>), had a less penetrant effect on the pattern of L1 deposition (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>). This confirms that Sox2 and Sox3 partially compensate for each other’s function and that the effects of <italic>sox2</italic> knockdown alone are not fully penetrant. As the specific <italic>sox2</italic> morpholino had mild effects and would have to be co-injected with an additional <italic>sox3</italic> specific morpholino to observe the more penetrant phenotype, this study continued use of the dual effect sox2MO1 to simultaneously knockdown <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> function. As some of the studies were performed before it was realized that sox2MO1 simultaneously reduces <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> function, data that includes co-injection of sox2MO1 and sox3 MO has been included in this study.</p>
<p>Analysis of the pattern of neuromast deposition in embryos with homozygous and heterozygous wild-type and mutant genotypes provided further evidence of potential interactions between these soxB1 family members. For example, while <italic>sox1a<sup>-/-</sup>, sox2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> embryos had no significant delay in deposition of L1, <italic>sox1a<sup>-/-</sup>, sox2<sup>-/+</sup></italic> mutants had many more embryos with a delay (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, while neither <italic>sox2<sup>-/+</sup></italic> or <italic>sox3<sup>-/+</sup></italic> heterozygous mutants embryos showed delays in an otherwise wild-type background, delays were observed in <italic>sox2<sup>-/+</sup></italic>, sox3<sup>-/-</sup> or <italic>sox2<sup>-/-</sup>, sox3<sup>-/+</sup></italic> embryos (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Live imaging of the <italic>sox2MO1</italic>/<italic>sox3</italic> double morphants showed that the morphant primordium migrates slower and L1 deposition was delayed in 10/10 cases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O</xref>, P). Furthermore, in 6/10 cases, initial neuromasts were poorly formed, unstable and fell apart (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O</xref>, P, movies 1-3). In 5/6 of these, an unstable poorly formed rosette was initially deposited but some of its cells reassociated with the primordium to continue their migration. This suggests that in the morphants, a neuromast may have formed and deposited but was either dissolved or its cells reassociated with the migrating primordium, preventing observation at 48-52 hpf when the pattern of deposited neuromasts are typically examined. Hence many neuromasts labelled L1 in morphants may correspond to later deposited neuromasts that were more stable than earlier deposited ones.</p>
<p>Individual protoneuromasts, as well as recently deposited neuromasts, are each marked by a central <italic>atoh1a-</italic>expressing cell. Examination of <italic>atoh1a</italic> showed that delay in deposition of the first neuromast was also related to fewer <italic>atoh1a</italic>-expressing cells within the migrating primordium. At 26hpf, 9/9 control primordia were associated with at least two <italic>atoh1a</italic>-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Q</xref>, R). Of these, 4/9 had two prominent <italic>atoh1a</italic> cells, either both within the migrating primordium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Q</xref>), or with one in the trailing domain and other in a recently deposited neuromast. The remaining 5/9 primordia were associated with four <italic>atoh1a</italic>-expressing cells, either all within the primordium or in the primordium and in a recently deposited neuromast (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3R</xref>). In <italic>sox2MO1/sox3</italic> double morphants on the other hand, 3/13 primordia were associated with just one trailing <italic>atoh1a</italic> expressing cell, two of which were within depositing neuromasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3T</xref>). The remaining 10/13 primordia had no <italic>atoh1a</italic>-expressing cell and no deposited neuromasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3S</xref>). Together these observations show that combinatorial loss of <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> results in both a delay in sequential formation of protoneuromasts within the migrating primordium and an instability of neuromasts that are deposited.</p>

<title>Loss of Sox2 with Sox1a or Sox3 results in expansion of Wnt activity, not a loss of Fgf signaling</title>
<p>As protoneuromast formation is dependent on suppression of Wnt and establishment of stable Fgf signaling centers in the wake of the shrinking Wnt system, the expression of <italic>lef1</italic> and <italic>pea3</italic> was examined to determine if changes in Wnt and Fgf signaling systems, respectively, contribute to the delay in the stable formation and deposition of the first neuromast. Knock down of <italic>sox2</italic> and sox3 with sox2MO1 resulted in expansion of Wnt activity to the trailing domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, B). Loss of either <italic>sox1a</italic>, <italic>sox2</italic> or <italic>sox3</italic> function on their own had little effect on <italic>lef1</italic> expression. However, loss of <italic>sox2</italic> in combination with either <italic>sox1a</italic> or <italic>sox3</italic> led to expansion of <italic>lef1</italic> into the trailing zone.

<p>Knockdown of <italic>sox2</italic> function together with <italic>sox1a</italic> (data not shown) or <italic>sox3</italic>, following morpholino injections resulted in loss of <italic>atoh1b</italic> expression and expansion of <italic>dkk1b</italic> expression to more trailing parts of the primordium (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-F</xref>). Together with previous results, this observation suggested that expansion of Wnt activity into the trailing zone, following knockdown of <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox1a</italic> or <italic>sox3</italic>, was preventing effective initiation of <italic>atoh1b</italic> expression and allowed <italic>dkk1b</italic> expression to persist in the trailing zone. To test this hypothesis, we asked if suppression of Wnt activity, which restores more timely L1 deposition, also allows more effective maturation of trailing protoneuromasts. Knockdown of <italic>sox2</italic> together with <italic>sox3</italic>, coupled with exposure to IWR, increased the fraction of primordia with trailing <italic>atoh1b</italic> cells and less <italic>dkk1b</italic> in the trailing zone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-E</xref>). Furthermore, exposure to IWR in control embryos shrunk the <italic>dkk1b</italic> domain to a smaller leading domain and increased the number of protoneuromasts associated with <italic>atoh1b</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-F</xref>). It also increased the number of transitory protoneuromasts associated with both <italic>atoh1b</italic> and <italic>dkk1b</italic> expression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study has examined the expression and function of three members of the SoxB1 family of transcription factors, Sox1a, Sox2 and Sox3, in the migrating posterior lateral line primordium. The expression of each of these SoxB1 family members is regulated in a distinct manner by Wnt and FGF signaling. We discuss how progressive changes in their expression along the length of the migrating primordium reflects the dynamics of Wnt and FGF signaling in primordium, shedding light on the way interactions between these signaling pathways initiate formation and subsequent maturation of protoneuromasts within the migrating primordium. Functional analysis revealed how these SoxB1 transcription factors operate as part of a robust regulatory network to limit Wnt activity, ensuring progressive shrinking of the Wnt system and the timely formation and maturation of sequentially formed neuromasts prior to their deposition. Finally, we discuss how previous studies describing the establishment of polarized Wnt activity and self-organization of protoneuromast in the context of this gradient, together with this study, which describes the collective role played by Sox1a, Sox2 and Sox3 in determining maturation and deposition of stable neuromasts, helps define more broadly key steps that contribute to self-organization of organ systems during animal development.</p>

<title>Sox2 expression reflects a predicted pattern of FGF and Wnt signaling in protoneuromasts</title>
<p>Fgf signaling is expected to have three distinct patterns in protoneuromasts from their initiation to maturation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dalle Nogare and Chitnis, 2020</xref>). Protoneuromast formation is initiated with center biased FGF signaling, as this sets the stage for initiating center-biased <italic>atoh1a</italic> expression, which, in turn, becomes restricted to a central cell by lateral inhibition mediated by Notch signaling. The pattern of FGF signaling would then be expected to broaden in a second phase, as protoneuromasts mature and the central <italic>atoh1a</italic> expressing cell becomes a source of Fgf10 that activates FGF signaling in neighboring cells. Finally, in a third phase, as the expression of Atoh1a becomes self-sustaining via autoregulation with Atoh1b, the <italic>atoh1a</italic>-expressing central cell stops expressing FGF receptors and Fgf signaling is expected to be lost in this central cell resulting in a donut shaped pattern of FGF activity. These predicted patterns, from center biased, to broader, and finally broader but with a central hole, are observed with <italic>sox2</italic> expression, even though they are determined by the absence of Wnt signaling rather than the presence of FGF signaling. Fgf-dependent <italic>pea3</italic> expression, often used as a proxy for the pattern of Fgf signaling, had previously been shown to be initiated in a center-biased pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chitnis et al., 2012</xref>). However, this transient pattern is often difficult to see with <italic>pea3</italic>, and it is typically only observed in a subset of primordia. Recapitulation of the three predicted patterns of Fgf signaling with <italic>sox2</italic> expression lends support to a framework that describes a predicted progression of changes in the spatial pattern of Wnt and Fgf signaling from initiation of protoneuromast formation to their maturation prior to neuromast deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dalle Nogare and Chitnis, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>SoxB1 family members together form a robust network to limit Wnt activity in the primordium</title>
<p>Loss of function studies with morpholinos and mutants showed that soxB1 transcriptions factors Sox1a, Sox2 and Sox3 work together to attenuate Wnt signaling in the primordium, guaranteeing a progressive reduction in Wnt activity from the leading to trailing end. This ensures effective suppression of Wnt signaling at the trailing end, which this study suggests is required for establishing autoregulation of Atoh1a and stabilization of epithelial rosettes, both of which are required for effective maturation of protoneuromasts prior to their deposition as neuromasts. While SoxB1 family members share a role in attenuating Wnt activity, the distinct mechanisms that determine their expression are likely to contribute to a robust network that ensures effective suppression and regulation of Wnt activity. Though <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> are expressed in a similar pattern in developing protoneuromasts, their expression, dependent on the absence of Wnt, or presence of Fgf activity, respectively, may contribute to limited function of at least one or the other when either of these regulatory mechanisms is selectively compromised. Furthermore, while <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> cooperate to inhibit Wnt activity in a trailing domain, Wnt-dependent expression of <italic>sox1a</italic> in the leading zone is likely to limit the level of activity that can be achieved by mechanisms that locally promote Wnt signaling. These distinct mechanisms that inhibit Wnt signaling in the leading and trailing zones appear to be synergistic, as combined interference with <italic>sox1a</italic> and <italic>sox2</italic> function has a much more severe effect on delaying stable neuromast deposition than inhibiting <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> together.</p>

<title>Exaggerated Wnt activity delays protoneuromast formation and prevents effective maturation</title>
<p>The delay in deposition of the first stable neuromast, associated with expanded Wnt activity reflects two problems: First, it caused a delay in initiation of protoneuromast formation, as effective inhibition of Wnt signaling at the trailing end is essential to initiate Fgf-dependent protoneuromast formation, second, it prevented initiation of changes associated with maturation of protoneuromasts. The delay in initiation was evident from the absence or delay in appearance of protoneuromast-marking <italic>atoh1a</italic> spots in sox2/sox3 morphant primordia at 26hpf. Expanded Wnt activity also prevented initiation of changes associated with maturation of protoneuromasts. Maturing neuromasts are characterized by expression of <italic>atoh1b</italic> and absence of <italic>dkk1b</italic>, whose expression marks newly formed protoneuromasts. Both the failure to initiate <italic>atoh1b</italic> expression and persistence of <italic>dkk1b</italic> appear to be associated with expanded Wnt activity, as inhibition of Wnt activity allows reappearance of <italic>atoh1b</italic> and suppression of <italic>dkk1b</italic> in the trailing protoneuromast. The expansion of <italic>dkk1b</italic> expression with expanded Wnt activity is consistent with its typical expression in nascent protoneuromasts that are proximal to domains of Wnt activity where there is likely to be some overlap between Wnt and Fgf signaling activity. The failure to initiate <italic>atoh1b</italic> expression in <italic>sox2/sox3</italic> morphants suggests that Atoh1a is only able to initiate <italic>atoh1b</italic> expression when the Wnt activity drops below some threshold. This result also suggests that Sox2, along with other SoxB1 family members, like Sox3, have a critical role in suppressing Wnt activity below a threshold to allow initiation and effective maturation of protoneuromasts in the trailing zone.</p>

<title>Three steps to self-organization of pattern and form in development</title>
<p>SoxB1 family members Sox1a, Sox2 and Sox2 are part of gene regulatory network that ensures effective maturation of newly formed protoneuromasts prior to their deposition as neuromasts with an organization and structural stability that sets the stage for their further growth and development. Together with previous studies, this study helps to define three steps that determine the robust and reproducible self-organization of pattern, fate and form in the migrating primordium. First, caudal migration of the primordium initiates polarization of Wnt signaling, which becomes highest at the leading end of the primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Neelathi et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Second, in the context of polarized Wnt activity, local promotion of Wnt activity, coupled with its long-range inhibition by FGF signaling, determines self-organization of a center-biased domain of Fgf signaling at the trailing end of the primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dalle Nogare and Chitnis, 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Fgf signaling initiates center-biased <italic>atoh1a</italic> expression, which gives cells the potential to become Hair Cell progenitors, while lateral inhibition, operating in this context, restricts <italic>atoh1a-</italic>dependent progenitor fate to a central cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chitnis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lecaudey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, in a third step, SoxB1 transcription factors cooperate to inhibit Wnt activity at the trailing end (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). This allows Atoh1a to initiate <italic>atoh1b</italic> expression and stabilize its own expression through autoregulation. Atoh1a in turn drives FGF10 and DeltaD expression, activating Fgf and Notch signaling in surrounding cells, consolidating their reorganization to form a stable epithelial rosette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ernst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kozlovskaja-Gumbriene et al., 2017</xref>) prior to deposition. Furthermore, restricting Wnt activity to a smaller leading domain recreates the conditions for formation of another protoneuromast in the wake of the shrinking Wnt system. We suggest the three steps in the development of the primordium: first, polarization of the tissue; second, the operation of self-organizing mechanisms that determine pattern and form in the context of this polarized tissue; and finally, the stabilization of patterns and forms initiated by self-organizing mechanisms, define more broadly, a framework for understanding robust and reproducible emergence of pattern, fate, form and cell behavior in development.</p>

Sox2/Sox3 and Sox1/Sox2 morphants were generated by injecting (2.5ng sox2 MO1 and 1.0ng sox1 or sox3 MO) into single-cell embryos obtained from the aforementioned transgenic lines. 488nm and 561nm excitation lasers were used for live imaging of the pLLP and images were acquired at 5-minute time intervals over a period of approximately 14-16 hours. The sample stage was manually shifted to prevent the sample from going out of the imaging frame. Acquired images were then “Standard Deviation” projected and stitched using a custom in-house macro in Fiji before being bleach-corrected using the “Simple Ratio” technique with respect to the first timepoint. Images in the main paper were enhanced for clarity by varying their brightness and contrast without affecting their raw pixel values.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study explores the regulation of collective cell migration and tissue patterning in the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium by SoxB1 transcription factors. The authors provide evidence that SoxB1 genes interact with Wnt and Fgf signaling pathways to control neuromast deposition and spacing, a process central to sensory organ development. The work offers mechanistic insight into the self-organization of migrating tissues and adds to the understanding of how transcriptional networks integrate with signaling pathways during morphogenesis. However, the strength of the evidence supporting several key conclusions is <bold>incomplete</bold> due to insufficient validation of mutant and knockdown tools, lack of quantitative analysis, and unclear experimental design details; additional quantification and more rigorous verification of gene knockdown or loss-of-function tools are needed to support the proposed model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Palardy and colleagues examine how transcription factors of the SoxB1 family alter patterning within the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium and subsequent formation of neuromast organs along the body of the developing fish. They describe how expression of soxb genes changes when Wnt and Fgf signaling pathways are altered, and in addition, how outputs of these signalling pathways change when soxb gene expression is disrupted. Together, experiments suggest a model where the expression of SoxB genes counteracts Wnt signaling. Support comes from the combined inhibition of both pathways, partially restoring the pattern of neuromast deposition. Together, the work reveals an additional layer of control over Wnt and Fgf signals that together ensure proper posterior lateral line development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide a clear analysis of changes in RNA expression after systematic manipulation of gene expression and signaling pathways to construct a plausible model of how Sox factors regulate primordium patterning.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is little attempt to capture the variation of expression patterns with each manipulation. Photomicrographs are examples, with little quantification.</p>
<p>While the combined loss of soxb functions shows more severe phenotypes, it is not exactly clear what underlies the apparent redundancy. It would be helpful if the soxb gene family member expression was reported after loss of each. Expression of sox1a is shown in sox2 mutants in Figure 4, but other combinations are not reported. This additional analysis would clarify whether there are alterations in expression that influence apparent redundancy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript seeks to determine the molecular basis of tissue patterning in the collectively migrating cells of the zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium. In particular, the authors examine the cross-regulation of canonical Wnt signaling, Fgf signaling, and the SoxB1 family members Sox1a, Sox2, and Sox3 in the migrating primordium. Using a combination of mutant lines, morphino (MO) knock down, pharmacological inhibition, and dominant-negative inhibition, the authors propose a model in which Sox2 and Sox3 in the trailing region of the primordium restricts Wnt signaling to the leading region, facilitating the formation of rosettes and the deposition of the first formed neuromast downstream of Fgf pathway activity. In contrast, sox1a is expressed in the leading region of the primordium, and the sox1ay590 -/- mutant shows little phenotype on its own. Together, the authors propose a multistep signaling loop that regulates tissue patterning during lateral line collective cell migration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The zebrafish posterior lateral line primordium is a well-established model for the study of collective cell migration that is useful for genetic manipulation and live imaging. The manuscript seeks to understand the complex reciprocal regulation of signaling pathways that regulate tissue patterning of collectively migrating cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The primary tools used in this study are inadequate to support the author's conclusions.</p>
<p>A. The authors state that the phenotype of the sox2y589 homozygous mutant line described in this manuscript changed across generations, but do not specify which generation is used for any given experiment. The sox2y589 mutant line is not properly verified in this manuscript, which could be done by examining ant-Sox2 antibody labeling, Western blot analysis, or complementation to the existing sox2x50 line described in Gou et al., 2018a and Gou et al., 2018b. There are also published sox1a mutant lines Lekk, et al., 2019.</p>
<p>B. The authors acknowledge that the sox2 MO1 used in this manuscript also alters sox3 function, but do not redo the experiments with a specific sox2 MO. In addition, the authors show that the anti-Sox2 and anti-Sox3 antibody labeling is reduced but not absent in sox2 MO1 and sox3 MO-injected embryos, but do not show antibody labeling of the sox2 MO and sox3 MO-double injected embryos to determine if there is an additional knockdown.</p>
<p>C. The authors examine RNA in situ hybridization patterns of sox2 and sox3 following various manipulations, but do not use anti-Sox2 and anti-Sox3 antibody labeling, which would provide more quantifiable information about changes in patterning.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript lacks important experimental details and appropriate quantification of results.</p>
<p>A. It is unclear for most of the experiments described in this manuscript how many individual embryos were examined for each experiment and how robust the results are for each condition. Only Figure 3 includes information about the numbers for each experiment, and in all cases, the experimental manipulations are not fully penetrant, and there is no statistical analysis.</p>
<p>B. It is not clear at what stage most of the RNA in situ hybridizations were performed.</p>
<p>C. The manuscript lacks quantification of many of the experiments, making it difficult to conclude their significance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to understand the molecular underpinnings of the complex process of periodic deposition of the neuromast organs of the embryonic posterior lateral line (PLL) sensory system in zebrafish. It was previously established that Fgf signaling in the trailing zone of the migrating PLL primordium is key to protoneuromast establishment, while Wnt signaling in the leading zone must be downregulated to allow new Fgf signaling-dependent protoneuromasts to form. Here, the authors evaluate the role of three SoxB transcription factors (Sox1a, Sox2, and Sox3) in this complex process, generating two novel CRISPR mutants as part of their study. They interrogate the interplay of the SoxB genes with the Fgf and Wnt signaling pathways during PLL primordium migration, using a combination of genetics, knockdown, and imaging approaches, including live time-lapse studies. They report a key role for the SoxB genes in regulating the pace of protoneuromast maturation as the primordium migrates, thus ensuring appropriate deposition and spacing of the neuromast organs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Strengths of the study are the careful quantitative analysis. based on imaging approaches, of the impact of mutation or knockdown of SoxB genes, coupled with the use of heat shock inducible dominant negative strategies to address how SoxB genes interact with Wnt and Fgf signaling. Functional analyses convincingly uncover a SoxB regulatory network that serves to limit Wnt activity, as directly read out with a live Wnt reporter. The finding that Wnt inhibition (achieved using pharmacological reagents) rescues the SoxB deficiency phenotype provides compelling evidence of the centrality of the Wnt pathway in mediating SoxB function. Use of atoh1 markers to track the stages of development of the neuromasts provides an effective approach to following their maturation, and allows the authors to explore how SoxB/Wnt interplay ultimately translates into the establishment of functional neuromasts. Finally, loss of Sox2 function, together with loss of either Sox1a or Sox3, blocks maturation of the neuromasts, clearly establishing redundancy between these SoxB family genes.</p>
<p>The concepts introduced and explored in this study - of complex gene networks that work within a dynamic cellular environment to enable self-organization and ultimately stabilization of cell fate choices-provide a useful conceptual framework for future studies. This study is therefore of relevance to understanding the morphogenesis of self-organizing tissues more broadly.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A minor weakness is the use of SoxB morpholino (MO) knockdown reagents, which are interspersed with mutant analyses. Although the stable mutants are available, they would be challenging to couple with the reporter transgenes used for some of the experiments, providing a reasonable rationale for the use of MO reagents (although the authors don't overtly provide this rationale). Moreover, reduced penetrance of the Sox2 mutants over multiple generations is noted, but no detailed explanation for this finding is offered.</p>
<p>Given that the expression patterns of Sox1a and Sox3 are not merely different but are largely reciprocal, the mechanistic basis of their very similar double mutant phenotypes with Sox2 remains opaque. Related to this, the authors discuss that Sox1a/Sox2 double knockdown produces a more severe phenotype than Sox2/Sox3 double knockdown, yet this difference is not obviously reflected in the data, some of which is not shown.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the three reviewers for the careful review and thoughtful comments on our manuscript. In addition to providing useful suggestions, they uncovered some embarrassing oversights on our part, related to experimental details including number of embryos, and quantification of variance in the observed changes for some of the experiments, which were inadvertently omitted in the submission. We provide below an initial response to the reviewer’s public reviews and expect to submit a revised manuscript comprehensively addressing all their concerns.</p>
<p>I would like to start by addressing some of their most critical comments related to validation of the tools used to reduce soxB1 gene family function in the embryo.  In the absence of the critical supplementary data that we inadvertently failed to include, the reviewers were left with an understandable, but we feel erroneous impression, that there was insufficient validation of mutant and knockdown tools.</p>
<p>Reviewer #2 says “The sox2y589 mutant line is not properly verified in this manuscript, which could be done by examining ant-Sox2 antibody labeling, Western blot analysis or…”</p>
<p>This validation, which had been performed previously both with antibody staining and with western blot analysis, was inadvertently omitted from the supplementary data submitted with the paper. The western blot data is shown here.</p>

<p>Though in this experiment there was considerable background in the red channel, and it shows the lateral line nerve, loss of nuclear Sox2 expression is evident in the deposited neuromast of an embryo identified as a mutant based on its delayed deposition of the L1 neuromast.</p>
<p>This data and a repeat of the antibody staining showing the primordium with loss of Sox2 will be included in a revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Reviewer #2 comments “the authors show that the anti-Sox2 and antiSox3 antibody labeling is reduced but not absent in sox2 MO1 and sox3 MO-injected embryos, but do not show antibody labeling of the sox2 MO and sox3 MO-double injected embryos to determine if there is an additional knockdown”</p>
<p>This will be included in a revised manuscript.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>This is not exactly true. Having discovered <italic>sox2</italic> MO1 simultaneously reduces <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> function, three new morpholinos were obtained based on another paper (Kamachi et al 2008), which had quantitatively assessed efficacy of three sox2 specific morpholinos (<italic>sox2</italic> MO2, <italic>sox2</italic> MO3, and <italic>sox2</italic> MO4). The effects of these morpholinos on the pattern of L1 deposition was compared to that of <italic>sox2</italic> MO1. This comparison was shown in supplementary Figure 2 and is included below. It shows that the <italic>sox2</italic> specific morpholinos resulted in a poorly penetrant delay in deposition of L1, comparable to that of a <italic>sox2</italic> mutant, which was quantified in supplementary Figure 3B. The observations with these three <italic>sox2</italic> specific morpholinos independently supported the observations made with the <italic>sox2</italic> mutant that reduction of <italic>sox2</italic> on its own results in a delay in deposition of the first neuromast with low penetrance and that to effectively examine the role of these SoxB1 genes in the primordium their function needs to be compromised in a combinatorial manner. A conclusion that was independently supported by observations made by crossing <italic>sox1a</italic>, <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> mutants (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 3). Therefore, even though the initial use of a <italic>sox2</italic> morpholino, which simultaneously knocks down <italic>sox3</italic>, was unintentional, its use turned out to be useful. It allowed us to examine effects of knocking down <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> with a single morpholino. Furthermore, though this project was initiated more than 15 years ago to specifically understand <italic>sox2</italic> function, our focus had shifted to understanding the role of soxB1 family members <italic>sox1a</italic>, <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> functioning together as an interacting system that regulates Wnt activity in the primordium. Considering this broader focus, reflected in the title of the paper, it was not a priority to repeat every experiment previously done with the <italic>sox2</italic>MO1 with the new <italic>sox2</italic> specific morpholinos. Instead, having acknowledged the “limitations” of <italic>sox2</italic>MO1, we used it to better understand effects of combinatorial reduction of SoxB1 function.</p>

<p>It is not exactly clear what underlies the apparent redundancy. It would be helpful if the soxb gene family member expression was reported after loss of each.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by reviewer #1, we had previously looked changes in expression of each of the soxB1 factors following loss of individual soxB1 factors but not included it in the supplementary data with the original submission. Independent of a reproducible and consistent expansion <italic>sox1a</italic> expression into the trailing zone, following loss of sox2 function, which is reported in the paper and quantified here where 10/10 mutant embryos showed the expansion (compare region within bracket in WT and sox2<sup>-/-</sup>), no consistent changes in the expression of other soxB1 family members was observed as part of a mechanism that might account for compensation when function of a particular soxB1 factor is soxB1 factor is lost. The data shown above together with more extensive quantification of changes will be included in a revised version of the manuscript. At this time the only consistent change was the expansion of <italic>sox1a</italic> to the trailing zone when lost. The data trailing zone when <italic>sox2</italic> function is lost. This change reflects dependence of <italic>sox1a</italic> on Wnt activity and the fact that Wnt activity expands into the trailing zone when <italic>sox2</italic> function is lost.</p>

<p>Given that the expression patterns of Sox1a and Sox3 are not merely different but are largely reciprocal, the mechanistic basis of their very similar double mutant phenotypes with Sox2 remains opaque.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The simplest way to think about compensation for gene function in a network is to think of it being determined by expression of a homolog or another gene with a similar function being expressed in a similar or overlapping domain.  However, it is more useful to think of Sox2 function in the primordium as part of a interacting network of SoxB1 factors whose differential regulatory mechanisms create a robust system that simultaneously regulates two key aspects of Wnt activity in the primordium; how high Wnt activity is allowed to get in the leading zone and how effectively it is shut off to facilitate protoneuromast maturation in the trailing zone. These features of Wnt activity influence both when and where nascent protoneuromasts will form in the wake of a progressively shrinking Wnt system and where they undergo effective maturation and stabilization prior to deposition. Changes in individual SoxB1 expression patterns provide some hints about how some SoxB1 factors may compensate when function of one or more of these factors is compromised. However, a deeper understanding of robustness and “compensation” will require a systems level understanding of this gene regulatory network with computational models, which we are currently working on in our group. It remains possible, for example, that how far into the trailing zone the Wnt activity has an influence is regulated at least in part by how high it is allowed to get in the leading zone by sox1a. Conversely, how high Wnt activity gets in the leading zone may be influenced by how effectively it is shut off in the trailing zone by sox2 and sox3, as this influences the size of the Wnt system, which in turn can influence the overall level of Wnt activity. In this manner Sox1a may cooperate with Sox2 and Sox3 to limit both how high Wnt activity is allowed to get in the primordium and to effectively shut it off in the trailing zone.</p>

<p>Related to this, the authors discuss that Sox1a/Sox2 double knockdown produces a more severe phenotype than Sox2/Sox3 double knockdown, yet this difference is not obviously reflected in the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The severity of the sox1a/sox2 double mutant phenotype compared to that of the <italic>sox2/sox3</italic> double mutant is shown in Figure 3 K and N, and quantified in Supplementary Figure 3A. Simultaneous loss of <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox3</italic> results in a small but relatively penetrant delay in where the first stable neuromast is deposited (Figure 2 N). By contrast, loss of <italic>sox2</italic> and <italic>sox1a</italic> together consistently results in a longer delay in deposition of the first stable (Figure 2 K). A new graph, shown below, which will be incorporated in the revised paper, shows that there is a significant difference in the pattern of L1 deposition in sox1a<sup>-/-</sup>, sox2<sup>-/-</sup> and sox2<sup>-/-</sup>, sox3<sup>-/-</sup> double mutants.</p>

<p>It would be good to more clearly state why sox3 is not regulated by Wnt given its expression is inhibited by the delta TCF construct (Figure 2M).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The explanation for why we believe <italic>sox3</italic> expression is determined by Fgf signaling, and not Wnt activity requires integrating what is observed both with induction of the delta TCF construct and the dominant negative Fgf receptor (DN FgfR). Loss of sox3 expression with induced expression of the delta TCF construct could result from loss of Wnt activity or the downstream loss of Fgf activity, which is ultimately dependent on Fgfs secreted by Wnt active cells in the leading domain. Distinguishing between these possibilities is based on inhibition of FGF signaling with the DN FgfR, described in the next paragraph. Heat Shock induced expression of DN FgfR expression results in loss of FGF signaling and the simultaneous expansion of Wnt activity into the trailing zone. As explained in the original text, loss of sox3 expression in this context, rather than its expansion, suggests its expression is determined by Fgf signaling not Wnt activity. We will emphasize that its loss, rather than its expansion, following induction of DN FgfR, indicates its expression is determined by Fgf signaling not Wnt activity.</p>

<p>The manuscript lacks quantification of many of the experiments, making it difficult to conclude their significance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One of the biggest inadvertent omissions of the paper was the inadequate quantification of some of the results. Quantification of results with considerable variation in the outcome, like the pattern of L1 deposition,  was provided following manipulations where various combinations of <italic>sox1a</italic>, <italic>sox2</italic>, and <italic>sox3</italic> function was lost (Figures 3, supplementary Figures 2 and 3) or where <italic>sox2</italic>MO1/<italic>sox3</italic>MO was used with or without IWR (Figure 5 and Figure 6). However, numbers for the experiments in Figures 2 were omitted in the Figure legend, where typically about 10 embryos for each manipulation were photographed, scored, and a representative image was used to make the figure. In these experiments  there was a very consistent result with 100% of the embryos showing changes represented by each panel in Figure 2. The only exception was Figure 2Y where 9/10 embryos showed the described change. Similarly in Figure 4 there was a consistent result and 100% of embryos showed the change shown. Numbers and statistics for these results will be included in a revised manuscript.</p>

<p>The statistical analysis in Figure 5 and Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 should be one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis with a Dunn's multiple comparisons test rather than pair-wise comparisons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The analysis has been re-done following the reviewer’s suggestions. The analysis confirms the primary conclusions of the original submission, and this analysis will be incorporated in a revised manuscript. However, to improve the power of the analysis, experiments with low numbers of embryos will be repeated.</p>
