<abstract>
<p>The latent HIV reservoir is a major barrier to HIV cure. Combining latency reversal agents (LRAs) with differing mechanisms of action such as AZD5582, a non-canonical NF-kB activator, and I-BET151, a bromodomain inhibitor is appealing towards inducing HIV-1 reactivation. However, even this LRA combination needs improvement as it is inefficient at activating proviruses in cells from people living with HIV (PLWH). We performed a CRISPR screen in conjunction with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 and identified a member of the Integrator complex as a target to improve this LRA combination, specifically Integrator complex subunit 12 (INTS12). Integrator functions as a genome-wide attenuator of transcription that acts on elongation through its RNA cleavage and phosphatase modules. Knockout of INTS12 improved latency reactivation at the transcriptional level and is more specific to the HIV-1 provirus than AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment alone. We found that INTS12 is present on chromatin at the promoter of HIV and therefore its effect on HIV may be direct. Additionally, we observed more RNAPII in the gene body of HIV only with the combination of INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151, indicating that INTS12 induces a transcriptional elongation block to viral reactivation. Moreover, knockout of INTS12 increased HIV-1 reactivation in CD4 T cells from virally suppressed PLWH <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and we detected viral RNA in the supernatant from CD4 T cells of all three virally suppressed PLWH tested upon INTS12 knockout suggesting that INTS12 prevents full-length HIV RNA production in primary T cells. Finally, we found that INTS12 more generally limits the efficacy of a variety of LRAs with different mechanisms of action.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite advancements in keeping viral loads below detectable limits, HIV-1 still exists within a latent reservoir <italic>in vivo</italic> and viral replication returns when anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is interrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Davey et al., 1999</xref>). HIV-1 predominately infects memory CD4+ T cells (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ait-Ammar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cohn et al., 2020</xref>)) and while many acutely infected cells, particularly the more differentiated effector memory cells, die off rapidly upon infection due to cytopathic effects, some cells can revert to a resting state where the provirus becomes transcriptionally silent (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duggan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mbonye &amp; Karn, 2024</xref>)). These infected resting memory cells form the HIV reservoir that is largely invisible to the immune system and not sensitive to enhanced antiviral therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Siliciano &amp; Siliciano, 2024</xref>). The reservoir of latently infected cells decays slowly and is maintained by both external stimuli and homeostatic proliferation even after initiation of ART (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cohn et al., 2020</xref>)). Thus, the major barrier to HIV cure is the existence of this ART-insensitive and long-lived latent reservoir that is largely not sensed by the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chun &amp; Fauci, 1999</xref>), reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Duggan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mbonye &amp; Karn, 2024</xref>)).</p>
<p>One strategy being explored to target the latent reservoir,called “shock-and-kill”, uses small molecule compounds called latency reversal agents (LRAs) to transcriptionally activate latent cells, so that immune-mediated mechanisms can then recognize and kill infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Archin et al., 2012</xref>), reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Maina et al., 2021</xref>)). This strategy would be employed in the presence of ART so that newly induced HIV virions could not infect more cells. However, inducing HIV-1 activation from latency is challenging, because the latent reservoir size varies between people and heterogenous HIV integration sites can influence reactivation of infected cells (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ait-Ammar et al., 2019</xref>)). Moreover, activation of latently infected resting T cells has not yet been able to induce HIV-1 replication from more than a fraction of the cells with a replication-competent provirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Siliciano &amp; Siliciano, 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>Transcriptional repression of HIV-1 in its latent state is multifactorial and it is known to be affected by repressive chromatin modifications and blocks to both transcription initiation and transcription elongation. Several classes of LRAs have been identified that can undo one or more blocks to latency reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Stoszko et al., 2019</xref>), reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rodari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Singh et al., 2021</xref>)). For example, AZD5582 is an LRA that targets a transcription initiation block by activating the noncanonical NF-kB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hennessy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pache et al., 2020</xref>) and has been shown to induce HIV transcription in HIV latency cell line models as well as induce viremia in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nixon et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Another class of LRAs are BET inhibitors that undo a block to transcription elongation by targeting various bromodomain containing proteins. I-BET151 is a pan-BET inhibitor that is thought to reverse HIV latency by either blocking host Brd4 from binding to PTEF-b to facilitate PTEF-b availability for HIV Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schroder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yang et al., 2005</xref>) or more generally by increasing the amount of PTEF-b not bound to the 7SK complex (Turner, 2024). Currently, no single LRA has been potent enough to reactivate the majority of the latent proviruses nor specific enough to HIV to not cause toxicity to the host (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Debrabander et al., 2023</xref>)). On the other hand, combinations of LRAs with different mechanisms of action have shown synergy in HIV latency reversal in different model systems including the combination of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Falcinelli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Laird et al., 2015</xref>) reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rodari et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>While the combination of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 is synergistic in activation of HIV in latency cell line models, and can induce robust HIV transcription initiation <italic>ex vivo</italic> in primary CD4+ T cells from virally suppressed PLWH, it failed to induce full-length proviral transcription in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Falcinelli et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, there exist additional blocks to HIV reactivation that even potent LRA combinations currently cannot overcome.</p>
<p>Here we hypothesized that we could use a CRISPR screen to uncover pathways to improve LRA combinations. Previous work from our lab showed that we could use a high throughput CRISPR screening approach, called the Latency HIV-CRISPR screen, to predict gene knockouts that improve the efficacy of a single LRA, AZD5582. Specifically, knockout of ING3, a member of the NuA4 histone acetylation complex, could improve the potency and the specificity of AZD5582, both in J-Lat model systems and in a primary T cell model of latency. Thus, in this study, we used a similar strategy to identify gene knockouts to increase HIV latency reversal with the more powerful AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 drug combination, and uncovered Integrator complex subunit 12, INTS12, as contributing to a block in HIV reactivation, both on its own, but, especially in the presence of the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 drug combination.</p>
<p>INTS12 is a subunit of the Integrator complex that is thought to act as a reader to link the complex to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Welsh &amp; Gardini, 2023</xref>). The Integrator Complex functions as a genome-wide attenuator of mRNA transcription where it can antagonize transcription with both its cleavage and phosphatase modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2023</xref>), and members of Integrator have been shown to modulate transcription at the HIV LTR previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lykke-Andersen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>We found that knocking out INTS12 reactivates HIV on its own and improves reactivation with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment. RNA-seq analysis showed that INTS12 knockout (KO) more specifically reactivates HIV compared to AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment alone and the combination of INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 increases the potency of reactivation. Additionally, we have evidence of an elongation block being overcome with INTS12 KO paired with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 specifically showing an increase in bound elongation-competent RNAPII in the gene body of HIV that is not seen with either KO or LRA treatment alone. We found that INTS12 is bound to the viral promoter and therefore may be acting directly on viral transcription. Importantly, we saw reactivation of HIV in the CD4 T cells of the majority of the virally suppressed people living with HIV (PLWH) tested <italic>ex-vivo</italic>, upon INTS12 KO with or without AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment. Crucially, we also detected viral RNA in the supernatant suggestive of the presence of HIV virions released into the supernatant indicating that full length HIV transcripts are being generated. Furthermore, we used the HIV-CRISPR screen approach to probe the Integrator complex as a whole and predict Integrator members comprising the cleavage module, phosphatase module, and core to all be involved in the control of HIV-1 latency in addition to the reader, INTS12. Lastly, we show that knockout of INTS12 can increase reactivation with diverse classes of LRAs suggesting that INTS12 is a general block to HIV reactivation.</p>

<title>Latency HIV-CRISPR screen identifies gene targets that increase HIV latency reversal with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment</title>
<p>We used a high throughput CRISPR screen previously described by our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hsieh et al., 2023</xref>) to identify gene targets that, when knocked out, would further improve latency reversal agents. The screen involves a lentiviral vector, called HIV-CRISPR, that contains two functional LTRs, a packaging signal, a guide RNA, and Cas9 to knock out a gene of interest (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells that have a latent HIV provirus are transduced with a library of HIV-CRISPR-containing guides and then, after selection for integration of the vector, the cells are treated with the combination of LRAs, AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 to reactivate HIV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). If a gene knockout improves LRA reactivation, we will detect more HIV in the supernatant compared to the DMSO control. We can determine the gene knockout responsible for HIV reactivation because the HIV-CRISPR vector will be packaged along with the reactivated provirus from the cells and become enriched in the supernatant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, see purple or black HIV RNA in virions). We then determine how enriched a guide is by the ratio of guides in the supernatant compared to the total guide representation in the cells and this generates a value called the MAGeCK gene score, where higher values correspond to more enrichment (i.e. HIV reactivation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, all guides to one gene target and replicates are factored into the MAGeCK gene score generation.</p>

    <p><bold>(A)</bold> Basal J-Lat conditions (left panel) followed by screen scenarios (middle to right panels). Screen overview: J-Lat cells containing an internal provirus are transduced with the HIV-CRISPR vector to generate a library of knockout cells for the human epigenetic library. Knockout cells are selected by puromycin and then either treated with LRAs or untreated. The HIV-CRISPR vector is packageable and will accumulate in the supernatant if the internal HIV provirus is reactivated. Sequencing the supernatant and cells allows for measurement of how enriched a guide is. (A, from left to right) Basal conditions show a gene product can block reactivation of HIV at the transcriptional level. Knockout alone shows that upon introducing the HIV-CRISPR some gene knockouts will result in latency reversal in the absence of LRA treatment. LRA combo alone shows the effect of LRA stimulation alone and how this will result in non-targeting guides (black) accumulating in the supernatant. Knockout + LRA combo shows that some gene knockouts will improve reactivation with LRA treatment and result in more virus accumulation. B-C are the results of the screens in J-Lat 5A8 <bold>(B)</bold> and J-Lat 10.6 <bold>(C)</bold>. Each are graphed as a comparison of the LRA combination AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 (Y-axis) treated screens to the untreated (DMSO) screens (X axis) as the -Log2 MAGeCK gene scores for each gene target. Purple and blue genes are genes in common between J-Lat 10.6 and 5A8 that are predicted to improve AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment specifically and purple is the top gene hit in common.

<p>We used a custom human epigenome guide library (HuEpi library) that contains 5,309 sgRNAs total (839 genes with 6 guides/gene) that comprises histone binders/modifiers and other general chromatin-associated proteins, which casts a wide net on general epigenetic factors (further description of this library and the major gene ontology categories targetted has been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hsieh et al., 2023</xref>). We previously validated the HuEpi library as containing guides to multiple genes involved in HIV-1 latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hsieh et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we conducted additional screens in two cell lines, J-Lat 10.6 and J-Lat 5A8, that are clonal Jurkat T-lymphocyte cell lines that contain latent HIV. We chose these cells because they differ in integration site and HIV drug reactivation profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jordan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Spina et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Telwatte et al., 2019</xref>), and wanted to identify commonly enriched genes that were not integration site specific.</p>
<p>The screen results are shown as a comparison of a DMSO-treated screen compared to a screen carried out in the presence of 10nM AZD5582 &amp; 100nM I-BET151 combined (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Candidate knockouts that are predicted to improve the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 combination specifically should fall above the dotted line in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>, as these genes are more highly enriched in the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 screen compared to the DMSO screen. Genes that fall on the line are predicted to be drug-independent hits as they are equally enriched in both screens, and genes falling below the line are thought to be redundant to the function of the LRAs.</p>
<p>With this approach, we identified gene hits that have been validated previously using the same HuEpi library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hsieh et al., 2023</xref>): KAT5, CUL3, ACTL6A, TAF5, DNMT1, DMAP1, VPS72, YEATS4, SRCAP, and ING3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, full screen list and results in supplemental file S1). Knockout of ING3 was previously shown to improve AZD5582 treatment for activation of latent HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hsieh et al., 2023</xref>), and also shows up as a candidate hit in the present screen done the presence of both AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Our top hit, INTS12, here was also seen in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hsieh et al., 2023</xref>), but was not followed up on in that study.</p>
<p>New gene hits of interest that we identified that are predicted to improve the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 combination specifically in both J-Lat lines tested including (shown in blue or purple, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>): INTS12, TRRAP, RNF20, BRD2, TAF3, TAF4, UBE2D3, and UBE2H. Some hits, EZH2 and PPP2CA, were only predicted to improve AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment in one cell line. Because EZH2 has a number of available inhibitors, we validated the screen with the EZH2 inhibitor Tazemetostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Straining &amp; Eighmy, 2022</xref>). That is, the screen predicted that inhibition of EZH2 would increase the potency of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 to activate HIV-1 from latency in J-Lat 5A8 cells. Indeed, we found that Tazemetostat increases reactivation of HIV-1 in the presence of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 to much higher levels than AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 alone or Tzaemetostat alone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement 1). However, we focused the remainder of this study on the most top ranking hit common to both J-Lat models that was enriched in the combination AZD5582 and I-BET151 treatment, Integrator Complex Subunit 12 (INTS12).</p>

<title>Integrator complex subunit 12 knockout specifically reactivates HIV independently and in combination with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment</title>
<p>The Integrator complex is known to play a role in the negative regulation of elongating transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tatomer et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have shown that some Integrator members are recruited to the HIV LTR and regulate HIV transcript length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>), although INTS12 had not been previously implicated in HIV regulation. We validated INTS12 as a screen hit by either knocking out INTS12 with the HIV-CRISPR vector loaded with one guide and then selecting for knockout cells with puromycin (J-Lat 5A8 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, J-Lat 10.6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 1) or by electroporation with a combination of three of guides to INTS12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). We used AAVS1 knockout as a CRISPR control where the guide targets within a safe harbor locus and knockout should have a minimal effect on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2014</xref>). These knockouts were then treated with DMSO, a low dose of AZD5582 (10nM), a low dose of I-BET151 (100nM), or a combination of AZD5582 (10nM) &amp; I-BET151 (100nM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) and the amount of HIV-1 released into the supernatant was measured by a reverse transcriptase activity assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vermeire et al., 2012</xref>). As expected, we find in AAVS1 knockout cells that there is minimal reactivation in the DMSO control, a small amount of HIV induction from AZD5582 or I-BET151 alone, and we observe synergy with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 used in combination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Knocking out INTS12 alone in the absence of added LRAs also shows a modest increase in the amount of virus detected in the supernatant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, DMSO), indicating that INTS12 itself is imposing a block to reactivation that is relieved upon knockout. In the presence of drug treatments, INTS12 knockout improves reactivation of either AZD5582 or I-BET151 alone and we see the most HIV reactivation when INTS12 knockout is treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 in combination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>), as the screen predicted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).

To ensure cell viability did not contribute to this phenotype, we measured cell proliferaion in our AAVS1 KO and INTS12 KO cells overtime and we observed no differences in cell growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>—figure supplement 3).</p>

<p>Furthermore, to ensure that this effect was due to knockout of INTS12 and not an off-target CRISPR effect, we performed INTS12 complementation experiments. We took pooled INTS12 KO cells and AAVS1 KO cells and transduced them with a lentiviral vector containing INTS12 and a puromycin resistance gene, selected for vector transduction, and then measured HIV reactivation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). We found that reactivation of the HIV-1 provirus in the INTS12 KO cells that were complemented with an INTS12 expression vector were now equivalent to the control AAVS1 KO cells with the same INTS12 expression vector (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).

<title>INTS12 knockout increases HIV steady-state RNA levels with specificity for the LTR</title>
<p>To test the effects of INTS12 knockout on both HIV-1 and total host transcription, we performed RNA-seq on total RNA that has been ribosomal RNA depleted. RNA-seq was done on pooled INTS12 knockouts and pooled AAVS1 knockouts (as controls) in J-Lat 10.6 cells in biological triplicates, where knockout out of cells were generated three separate times and treated with either DMSO or AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151. We first looked at how the sum of all transcripts mapping to HIV changed with the different conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We observed that the RNA-seq trend matches what we saw with the virus release assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) where the INTS12 KO alone reactivates HIV, and INTS12 KO further improves reactivation with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151.</p>

<p>Reads were also mapped along the length of the HIV provirus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) using PMAi treated cells in this comparison as a positive control known to induce full length transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Falcinelli et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom row). We observe the same differences quantified in (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) as well as similar pileup trends along the length of the provirus. Because RNAs lacking a polyA tail are degraded rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Biziaev et al., 2024</xref>) it is unclear whether those RNAs were successfully captured in our assay, and it is likely we are only looking at full length RNA detection. Nevertheless, the total RNA-seq results show that INTS12 KO increases HIV proviral activation at the transcriptional level.</p>
<p>We also investigated how INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatments alone and in combination affect transcription in the cell at a global level to assess the specificity to HIV compared to host genes. We first compared our AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment condition to the DMSO treated AAVS1 KO cells and found that 80 genes were upregulated and 306 were downregulated, and that HIV was the most upregulated transcript with the highest fold-change (FC) and was highly expressed as indicated by counts per million (CPM) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, left panel), similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Falcinelli et al., 2022</xref>). Surprisingly, given the more wide-spread reported role of Integrator in transcription, we find that INTS12 KO alone is even more specific to HIV transcripts than AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment, where we find the same level of enrichment of HIV as the previous comparison with a FC of 8, but there are only 70 upregulated genes and only 3 downregulated genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, middle panel). This indicates that INTS12 is more important to HIV transcription than it is to any other transcriptional unit in J-Lat cells.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the transcriptional landscape of the combination of INTS12 KO cells treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 compared to AAVS1 KO cells that were treated with DMSO (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, right panel) showed an even greater enrichment of the HIV transcripts at a FC of ∼28 (Log<sub><italic>2</italic></sub>(Foldchange)=4.8). However, this gain of potency came with some loss of specificity as there was greater dysregulation of the host with 255 upregulated genes and 159 downregulated genes compared to the INTS12 knockout alone or the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment alone.</p>
<p>Among the host genes most prominently affected by INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 are MAFA, MAFB, and ID2 (full list of genes and results in supplemental file S3, tabs 1-4). Nonetheless, INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 was much more specific to HIV-1 than PMAi, which can robustly activate HIV but at the cost of affecting thousands of host transcripts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, we find that INTS12 knockout acts at the transcriptional level in activating HIV from latency and is more specific for the HIV LTR than AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment alone. We also find that INTS12 knockout indeed improves potency of reactivation of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 but at the cost of some specificity.</p>

<title>Chromatin localization reveals INTS12 may act directly on HIV transcription and INTS12 knockout paired with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 overcomes an elongation block to HIV transcription</title>
<p>The effect of INTS12 on HIV-1 transcription could be direct (i.e. the Integrator complex directly affecting the steady-state levels of HIV-1 RNA transcription) or could be indirect by affecting the transcription of other gene products that subsequently act on the HIV-1 LTR. In order to partially distinguish these two hypotheses, we asked if INTS12 is present at the HIV-1 LTR using Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&amp;Tag) for profiling chromatin components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Janssens et al., 2021</xref>) using an antibody to INTS12 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Using this approach, we observed that INTS12 is indeed at the LTR of HIV-1 as the signal over the LTR is greater in the AAVS1 KO cells than in cells with the partial INTS12 knockout (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, left panel, compare top two rows with bottom two rows). We also saw this effect with a different INTS12 antibody (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—figure supplement 1). We found that that INTS12 localization extends past the LTR, matching what has been seen previously, where Integrator members localize to sites of pausing which are past the site of initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>).

<p>Given the Integrator complex’s role in pausing and termination at promoters, we wanted to look at HIV-1 elongation by measuring RNAPII levels as well as the Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation levels of the C-terminal tail of RNAPII with CUT&amp;Tag. We first used an antibody against total RNAPII, RPB3, and generated pileup graphs of reads corresponding to where RPB3 is bound across the HIV-1 provirus and downstream (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, left panel). The peaks in each row correspond to at least 3 to 5 technical replicates averaged together. We quantified all reads of RPB3 in three regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, right panel; exact coordinates in the methods). We see similar levels of RPB3 in region 1 for all four conditions. We defined region 2 as the remainder of the provirus excluding the LTR and the short 5’ region of region 1. We found that there was a dramatic statistically significant increase in RPB3/RNAPII occupancy in the body of the provirus (region 2) only with both INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 together (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). We did not see this increase in RNAPII when we examined the gene downstream of the integrated provirus (region 3). More RNAPII within HIV is suggestive of elongation, but to strengthen this claim we measured Ser2 phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of RNAPII that is found on the elongation competent form of RNAPII. We observed evidence of elongation competent RNAPII for two conditions with LRAs: AAVS1 KO cells treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 and our INTS12 KO cells treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), as we saw a significant increase in reads in region 2 compared to the AAVS1 KO treated with DMSO control. When we tested RNAPII Ser5 phosphorylation, a marker not associated with elongation, we did not observe any statistically significant differences in any region for the same conditions tested in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>—figure supplement 2). Therefore, these data support the hypothesis that the combination of INTS12 with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 specifically overcomes an elongation block that the INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 alone cannot overcome.</p>

CD4 T cells were electroporated with Cas9 complexed with either a non-targeting control guide (NTC), or a cocktail of 3 INTS12 guides and then treated with DMSO (vehicle) or AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment for 24hrs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).

These same samples were treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), and we found that although LRAs alone could activate viral RNA expression (compare samples in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> with 6B), the combination of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 paired with the INTS12 KO shows an even further increase in HIV-1 reactivation that was statistically significant in four out of six donors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). For donor PH543 (upside down triangle), we found that there is an increase from the INTS12 KO itself (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, right panel), and robust activation from AZD5582 and I-BET151 treatment itself (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel), however there was no further increase from INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment. Degree of reactivation was correlated with reservoir size as donors PH504 (star symbol) and PH543 (upside down triangle) have the largest HIV reservoirs (supplemental file S4). This data shows that our screen was able to identify INTS12 as a barrier to HIV-1 reactivation in PLWH, as we find that there is reactivation from INTS12 knockout alone and improvement of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment with the addition of INTS12 knockout in a majority of virally suppressed PLWH tested <italic>ex vivo</italic>.</p>

<p>Because elongation of full-length HIV RNA has been a barrier to reactivation in PLWH previously, we not only wanted to look within the cells at <italic>gag</italic> RNA expression, but we sought to measure viral RNA in the supernatant by qPCR as a proxy for virus production. For this repeat assay, we chose three donors that had available materials (labelled in green in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). We used the same LRA concentrations we used in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, but extended the time of treatment to 72 hrs, and measured viral RNA in the supernatant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, we observed for all three donors that INTS12 KO was able to improve reactivation either on its own or in the presence of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151. Excitingly, donor 543 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, right panel) showed a robust increase from the pairing of INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment when measuring gag RNA in the supernatant. The differences between <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> for donor 543 could be due to timing of the assay, or alternatively, that pairing INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 results in more efficient full-length viral RNA such that we do not see an increase within the cell with the addition of INTS12 KO (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>) as more RNA is in the supernatant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, difference between LRA with or without INTS12 KO). Nevertheless, we can conclude that the majority of these s are responsive to INTS12 KO with or without AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment and that this reactivation leads to full length HIV that can be detected in the supernatant.</p>

<title>Role of additional members of the Integrator complex in HIV latency reversal</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that Integrator members are important for HIV latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>), and some have done so in the context of combination LRA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In our initial screen of epigenetic factors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), only INTS12 was included in the CRISPR guide library of the fifteen-member Integrator complex. In order to more comprehensively interrogate the role of Integrator complex members in HIV latency, we remade a library of guides in the HIV-CRISPR vector where we included all Integrator members (with the exception of INTS15 that was not known at the time of library construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Offley et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Replogle et al., 2022</xref>)). The remainder of this library targets NF-kB related factors (supplemental file S5). We took this new library (herein, Screen #2) and treated J-Lat 10.6 cells with 1nM AZD5582 &amp; 2.5µM I-BET151 for 24hrs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) and found INTS12 is again predicted to improve the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment as it falls above the average NTCs. Importantly, however, all members of the cleavage module: INTS11, INTS9, INTS4; all members of the phosphatase module: INTS5, INTS6, INTS8; and all members of the core: INTS1, INTS2, INTS7 score positively in our screen. Thus, we predict that a large majority of the Integrator complex, consisting of the cleavage module, phosphatase module, core, and INTS12, but not the SOSS complex or the enhancer/arm module, likely play a role in HIV latency reversal in the presence of LRAs.</p>

<p>Given that the Integrator complex acts on the late elongation stage in viral transcription, it is possible that it serves as a more general block to HIV reactivation and therefore, we would expect that INTS12 knockout could improve an even broader subset of LRAs than AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151. We took our AAVS1 KO cells or INTS12 KO cells and reactivated with TNF-α, a canonical NF-kB activator, or anti-CD3/anti-CD28 co-stimulation that activates T cells through the T cell receptor and observed that INTS12 KO is able to increase reactivation with both of these stimuli (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, left panel). Additionally, we tested these same cells with SAHA, an HDAC inhibitor that falls within the chromatin modification LRA class, for 24 hrs and we observe greater reactivation in our 250 nM and 1000 nM conditions in our INTS12 KO cell than AAVS1 KO cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel). Therefore, INTS12 knockout was able to increase reactivation with all LRAs tested, which supports the idea that INTS12 serves as a general block to reactivation for HIV.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We sought to improve HIV reactivation with a synergistic LRA combination AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 using an CRISPR screening approach. The ideal gene target would not only increase potency of this drug combination but maintain specificity to the virus and limit off-target effects. We used an epigenetic regulatory factor focused guide library in combination with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 and identified INTS12. We validated that knockout of INTS12 results in increased latency reversal on its own but more in the presence of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment, as the screen predicted. We observed that INTS12 KO resulted in specific enrichment of HIV and minimal effects on host genes, and that INTS12 KO is more specific to HIV than AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment alone. INTS12 KO paired with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment further increased potency of HIV reactivation, but some specificity was lost compared to AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 alone and INTS12 KO alone.</p>
<p>However, INTS12 KO paired with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 remains more specific to HIV than PMA &amp; Ionomycin combination treatment. With CUT&amp;Tag, we observed that INTS12 is at the HIV promoter which supports that it is acting directly on HIV-1 transcription, and we see an increase in elongation-competent RNAPII in the gene body of HIV only with the combination of INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151, supporting that an elongation block is specifically overcome with this combination. Additionally, we validated INTS12 in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> primary cell model of latency where we see reactivation from INTS12 KO in a majority of donors tested with or without AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment, and that reactivation upon INTS12 KO leads to detection of viral RNA in the supernatant indicating that full length HIV is likely generated. Furthermore, we used the CRISPR-screen approach to predict which members of the Integrator complex could be targeted to improve the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 combination and identified the cleavage module, phosphatase module, and core Integrator members, in addition to INTS12 as playing a role in HIV-1 latency. Lastly, we demonstrated that INTS12 knockout can improve reactivation of a diverse set of stimuli supporting that INTS12 serves as a general block to reactivation of HIV. This study highlights the promise of using the CRISPR-screening approach as a tool to identify blocks to HIV reactivation and improve LRA combinations, such as AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151.</p>

<title>The role of Integrator complex in modulating HIV transcription</title>
<p>The Integrator complex is known to regulate and attenuate transcription at promoters that are bound by pausing factors NELF and DSIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Skaar et al., 2015</xref>). HIV is known to be regulated by these pausing factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ping &amp; Rana, 2001</xref>), and recently it has been shown that members of the Integrator are recruited to the HIV TAR loop and regulate processivity of HIV transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>). The Integrator contains 15 members that fall within different sub modules that perform various functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Welsh &amp; Gardini, 2023</xref>), and of these modules some members of the cleavage, phosphatase, and core have been shown to reverse HIV latency upon knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>). Knockout of INTS3 of the SOSS complex was also not found to reverse latency in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stadelmayer et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, members of the core and phosphatase have been shown to improve an LRA combination of a BET inhibitor with a PKC agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We have recapitulated these previous findings (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>), but we have also predicted that all members of these modules can be targeted to improve the AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment including the cleavage module for which this has not been explored in the context of LRAs.</p>
<p>One study explored the different effects on gene transcription upon targeting the cleavage module vs targeting the phosphatase module of the Integrator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). Selectively targeting the cleavage module of Integrator has been shown to result in a specific induction of lowly expressed genes, since these genes are regulated by pausing factors and Integrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). Given that HIV is regulated by these same factors and poorly expressed during HIV latency, it may not be surprising that targeting this module has shown an increase in HIV transcription. Since the Integrator complex has been shown to modulate genes differently in the presence or absence of stress stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tatomer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yue et al., 2017</xref>)) this may explain why targeting the Integrator complex in the presence of LRAs can improve reactivation. Moreover, Integrator is known to antagonize host PTEF-b function with its phosphatase module and enforce pausing at bound promoters. Therefore, targeting the phosphatase module can lead to more elongation at affected promoters. Given that HIV is sensitive to pausing and elongation, especially in cells from PLWH, and PTEF-b is considered to be one of the major rate-limiting steps to HIV reactivation, it is reasonable that removing a PTEF-b antagonist would help aid in HIV reactivation. Our results are also consistent with the hypothesis that transcription elongation with INTS12 KO cells treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 may be more efficient than the LRAs alone, as the levels of Ser2 phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of RNAPII are also significantly lower near the LTR, but increased distal to the LTR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, compare INTS12 KO treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 to DMSO in region 1 and region 2), which may suggest RNAPII is efficiently leaving the promoter and traveling within the body of the provirus to affect full-length transcription. This full-length transcription is also consistent with increased virus release that we observe both in cell lines and in primary cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>

<title>INTS12 as a target for small molecule drug development</title>
<p>While our data suggests many different members of the Integrator complex could be targeted to activate HIV-1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>),, we believe that INTS12 may be the better option to target over the rest of the complex. We find that INTS12 is located at the HIV-1 promoter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and knockout fairly specifically reactivates HIV compared to host genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, middle panel) which supports that this complex acts directly on HIV-1 transcription rather than indirectly though the modulation of other genes. Therefore, targeting INTS12 may keep other activities of the Integrator complex partially intact. It is possible knocking out INTS12 may alter where those activities are exerted as this member is thought to toggle chromatin localization, or it is possible INTS12 may be performing a separate function entirely from the remainder of the Integrator complex. Other studies have also suggested that INTS12 knockdown does not grossly affect cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kheirallah et al., 2017</xref>), as opposed to other memers of the Integrator complex ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rienzo &amp; Casamassimi, 2016</xref>), although it has been shown that catalytic members have been able to be targeted for short periods of time without signs of catalytic activity dysruption in cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Elrod et al., 2019</xref>). With the caveats that the function of INTS12 in diverse T cell functions or other <italic>in vivo</italic> functions is not yet known and needs to be investigated in humans, we propose that toggling INTS12 with a small molecule drug may be even more successful with short term disruption in the shock-and-kill approach.</p>

<title>Ex vivo Primary Cell system</title>
<p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to report an analysis of an Integrator complex member in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiment in cells from virally suppressed PLWH. We observed that INTS12 knockout reactivates HIV transcription in a majority of donors on its own and especially in the presence of AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This was in people with differing reservoir sizes, cells that have different HIV integration sites, and people on ART treatment for varying lengths of time. We were also able to show that HIV RNA could be detected in the supernatant, which is an aspect critical to consider with regard to the kill side of the shock- and-kill approach and has proven to be one of the more difficult elements of the approach so far with many studies showing reactivation but variable virus production. This result highlights the power in the CRISPR-screening approach and shows that even when cell line models are used, we can use LRA combinations and identify blocks to reactivation that can be used to improve reactivation in more clinically relevant cells from PLWH.</p>

<title>Synergy on multiple mechanisms</title>
<p>AZD5582 and I-BET151 are thought to synergize by acting to undo different blocks to latency reversal. AZD5582 working on the transcription initiation arm where non canonical NF-kB is upregulated and I-BET151 on the transcription elongation arm where it is thought to impact available cellular PTEF-b that can work in conjunction with HIV Tat for HIV transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Jang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Schroder et al., 2012</xref>; Turner, 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). When Integrator is bound to the HIV promoter it can attenuate HIV transcription through its cleavage and phosphatase modules, as evidenced by knockout of members of these modules. As such, Integrator works on the elongation stage of transcription, and in our work, we have evidence that knocking out INTS12 overcomes a block to elongation. We not only see virus in the supernatant upon INTS12 KO in cells from PLWH (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), but we also see that specifically with the combination of INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 there is an increase in elongation-competent RNAPII downstream of the HIV promoter and throughout the HIV provirus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Therefore, our hypothesis is that targeting Integrator may allow for HIV transcription initiation events to not be aborted prematurely and allow for subsequent paused promoters to proceed to elongation from an unopposed PTEF-b. For this reason, removal of Integrator can lead to latency reversal on its own, but this also may explain why Integrator increases latency reversal with each LRA individually as well as improves the combination of INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151.</p>
<p>The Integrator complex itself is a fascinating target that needs to be considered for any cure approach involving transcription. Not only does it govern transcription regulation at the HIV promoter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), but it appears to do so in ways that may be contrary to the ways other genes are affected given its relative specificity for HIV transcripts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, middle panel), and has the ability to influence reactivation with diverse LRAs. While it has been reported that Integrator can function differently in the presence of stress stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tatomer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yue et al., 2017</xref>) we did not observe differential expression of any Integrator members upon AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment in J-Lat cells (supplemental file S3, tabs 1 and 5) though this does not mean that recruitment of the complex does not vary under stimulatory conditions. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, we did not observe significantly different recruitment of INTS12 to the HIV LTR upon AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 treatment but did not look at recruitment of other Integrator members and how their recruitment may be impacted. It is possible the general stoichiometry of the various Integrator members is important for the function of the complex at various promoters, though this has not been explored. Understanding how the Integrator complex and its various modules are affected by different LRA stimuli may be crucial to optimizing the shock-and-kill strategy or even improving the reverse strategies of block-and-lock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lyons et al., 2023</xref>) seeking to silence HIV more effectively at the HIV promoter. While, to our knowledge, small molecule drugs that target INTS12, or any member of the Integrator complex are not yet available, the development of such agents would be predicted to improve the efficacy of existing LRAs to achieve more effective viral reactivation as a step towards reservoir reduction.</p>

<title>LRA treatments</title>
<p>AAVS1 KO and INTS12 KO cells were seeded at a density of 5e5 cells/ml in 96 well plates with 200 ul/well or in flasks. LRA treatments were performed in triplicate. Cells were seeded and then the calculated amount of LRA was added on top with mixing and cells were incubated. All J-Lat experiments used 10 nM AZD5582 &amp; 100 nM I-BET151 for 48 hrs except Screen 2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) used 1nM AZD5582 &amp; 2.5 uM I-BET151 for 24 hrs. Primary cell experiments used 100 nM AZD5582 and 500 nM I-BET151 for 24 hrs for qPCR and then treatment was extended to 72 hrs for viral RNA detection in the supernatant. Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 20hrs and SAHA for a concentration between 1000nM to 100nM for 24 hrs.</p>

<title>RNA-seq run/analysis</title>
<p>Three biological triplicates were generated in J-Lat 10.6 cells for AAVS1 KO and INTS12 KO cells by knocking out three separate sets of cells and then cells were treated with LRAs. We included AAVS1 treated with DMSO, AAVS1 treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151, INTS12 KO treated with DMSO, and INTS12 KO treated with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151. Treated samples were spun down at 1.45e6 cells/tube (I used 2 tubes/sample), supernatant was aspirated, and cells were lysed with 700 µl of QIAzol (Qiagen, 1023537). Samples were spun through a QIAshredder (Qiagen, 79654) and then frozen at -80°C. Cells were processed with a miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, 217004), DNase treated with RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen, 79254), and then reprocessed through the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 74104) with the EtOH wash modified to 700 µL for small RNAs. Combine tubes for each sample. RNA quality was checked by TapeStation (all samples had a RIN of 10), and 10 µL of RNA at 50 ng/µL was sent for RNA-seq to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center Genomics Shared Resources where rRNA was removed to select for the rest of the total RNA with the Illumina Stranded Total RNA Prep, Ligation with Ribo-Zero Plus kit (20040525) followed by indexing with IDT for Illumina RNA UD Indexes Set A Ligation (20040553).

<title>CUT&amp;Tag: Data Analysis</title>
<p>The same custom genome assembly as RNA-seq was used for CUT&amp;Tag. Bowtie2 version 2.4.2 was used for alignments with the following parameters: —very-sensitive-local—soft-clipped-unmapped-tlen—dovetail—no-mixed—no-discordant -q—phred33 -I 10 -X 1000. For each target protein and each condition, 3-5 technical replicates were profiled. We removed duplicate reads from each replicate, and the combined reads for all replicates were pooled and used to generate the coverage-normalized bigwig files shown as genome-browser tracks. The number of unique reads for each replicate were quantified over the intervals indicated by the dotted grey lines in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, and we compared the read counts over the indicated intervals in the AAVS1KO AZD&amp;IBET, INTS12KO DMSO and INTS12KO AZD&amp;IBET conditions to the AAVS1KO DMSO control samples using a two-tailed independent samples t-test.</p>

<p>Gray and colleagues describe the identification of Integrator complex subunit 12 (INTS12) as a contributor to HIV latency in two different cell lines and in cells isolated from the blood of people living with HIV. The authors employed a high-throughput CRISPR screening strategy to knock down genes and assess their relevance in maintaining HIV latency. They had used a similar approach in two previous studies, finding genes required for latency reactivation or genes preventing it and whose knockdown could enhance the latency-reactivating effect of the NFκB activator AZD5582. This work builds on the latter approach by testing the ability of gene knockdowns to complement the latency-reactivating effects of AZD5582 in combination with the BET inhibitor I-BET151. This drug combination was selected because it has been previously shown to display synergistic effects on latency reactivation.</p>
<p>The finding that INTS12 may play a role in HIV latency is novel, and the effect of its knock down in inducing HIV transcription in primary cells, albeit in only a subset of donors, is intriguing.</p>
<p>In this revised version, the authors have included new data and clarifications which help strengthen their conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Transcriptionally silent HIV-1 genomes integrated in the host`s genome represent the main obstacle for an HIV-1 cure. Therefore, agents aimed at promoting HIV transcription, the so-called latency reactivating agents (LRAs) might represent useful tools to render these hidden proviruses visible to the immune system. The authors successfully identified, through multiple techniques, INTS12, a component of the Integrator complex involved in 3' processing of small nuclear RNAs U1 and U2, as a factor promoting HIV-1 latency and hindering elongation of the HIV RNA transcripts. This factor hinders the activity of a previously identified combination of LRAs, one of which, AZD5582, has been validated in the macaque model for HIV persistence during therapy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37783968/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37783968/</ext-link>). The other compound, I-BET151, is known to synergize with AZD5582, and is a inhibitor of BET, factors counteracting elongation of RNA transcripts.</p>
<p>
Therefore, INTS12 maight represent a target for future LRAs-</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Findings were confirmed through multiple screens and multiple techniques. The authors successfully mapped the identified HIV silencing factor at the HIV promoter, Silencing of INTS12 increases the activity of small-molecule HIV latency-reversing agents such as the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat. Knockdown of INTS12 does not induce toxic effects in the cells, thus rendering it a candidate a drug discovery campaign aimed at finding new agents for an HIV/AIDS cure.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A caveat is that the impact of INTS12 in diverse T cell functions or other in vivo functions is not yet known, but the authors acknowledge this in the revised discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Gray and colleagues describe the identification of Integrator complex subunit 12 (INTS12) as a contributor to HIV latency in two different cell lines and in cells isolated from the blood of people living with HIV. The authors employed a high-throughput CRISPR screening strategy to knock down genes and assess their relevance in maintaining HIV latency. They had used a similar approach in two previous studies, finding genes required for latency reactivation or genes preventing it and whose knockdown could enhance the latency-reactivating effect of the NFκB activator AZD5582. This work builds on the latter approach by testing the ability of gene knockdowns to complement the latency-reactivating effects of AZD5582 in combination with the BET inhibitor I-BET151. This drug combination was selected because it has been previously shown to display synergistic effects on latency reactivation.</p>
<p>The finding that INTS12 may play a role in HIV latency is novel, and the effect of its knockdown in inducing HIV transcription in primary cells, albeit in only a subset of donors, is intriguing. However, there are some data and clarifications that would be important to include to complement the information provided in the current version of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added the requested data and clarifications. In particular, we show that knockout of INTS12 has no effect on cell proliferation (new data added in Figure 2—figure supplement 3)), we clarify how the degree of knockout and the complementation were accomplished, we clarify the differences between the RNA-seq and the activation scores, and we have bolstered the claim that INTS12 affected transcription elongation by performing CUT&amp;Tag on Ser2 phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of RNAPII along the length of the provirus (new data added in Figure 5C) Please see detailed responses below.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Identifying an important role for the Integrator complex in repressing HIV transcription and suggesting that by targeting subunits of this complex specifically, INTS12, reversal of latency with and without latency reversal agents can be enhanced.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the paper include the general strategy for screening targets that may activate HIV latency and the rigor of exploring the mechanism of INTS12 repression of HIV transcriptional elongation. I found the mechanism of INTS12 interesting and maybe even the most impactful part of the findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have two minor comments:</p>
<p>There was an opportunity to examine a larger panel of latency reversal agents that reactivate by different mechanisms to determine whether INTS12 and transcriptional elongation are limiting for a broad spectrum of latency reversal agents.</p>
<p>I felt the authors could have extended their discussion of how exquisitely sensitive HIV transcription is to pausing and transcriptional elongation and the insights this provides about general HIV transcriptional regulation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added data on latency reversal agents of different mechanisms of action. We show that INTS12 affects HIV latency reversal from agents that affect the non-canonical NF-kB pathway (AZD5582), the canonical NF-kB pathway (TNF-alpha), activation via the T-cell receptor (CD3/CD28 antibodies), through bromodomain inhibition (I-BET151), and through a histone deacetylase inhibitor (SAHA). This additional data has been added to the manuscript in Figure 7, panels B and C as well as adding text to the discussion.</p>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion to extend the discussion to emphasize how important pausing and elongation are to HIV transcription. Additionally, to further support our claim that INTS12KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 leads to an increase in elongation, that we previously showed with CUT&amp;Tag data showing an increase in total RNAPII seen in within HIV (Figure 5B), we measured RNAPII Ser2 phosphorylation (Figure 5C) and RNAPII Ser5 phosphorylation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2) and added these findings to the manuscript. Upon measuring Ser2 phosphorylation, a marker associated with elongation, we observed evidence of elongation-competent RNAPII in our AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition as well as our INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition, as we saw an increase of Ser2 phosphorylation within HIV. Despite seeing elongation-competent RNAPII in both conditions, we only saw a dramatic increase in total RNAPII for our INTS12 KO and AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition (Figure 5B), which supports that there are more elongation events and that an elongation block is overcome specifically with INTS12 KO paired with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151. This claim is further supported by our data showing an increase in virus in the supernatant only with the INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition in cells from PLWH (Figure 6C). We did not observe any statistically significant differences between RNAPII Ser5 phosphorylation, which might be expected as this mark is not associated with elongation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Transcriptionally silent HIV-1 genomes integrated into the host`s genome represent the main obstacle to an HIV-1 cure. Therefore, agents aimed at promoting HIV transcription, the so-called latency reactivating agents (LRAs) might represent useful tools to render these hidden proviruses visible to the immune system. The authors successfully identified, through multiple techniques, INTS12, a component of the Integrator complex involved in 3' processing of small nuclear RNAs U1 and U2, as a factor promoting HIV-1 latency and hindering elongation of the HIV RNA transcripts. This factor synergizes with a previously identified combination of LRAs, one of which, AZD5582, has been validated in the macaque model for HIV persistence during therapy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37783968/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37783968/</ext-link>). The other compound, I-BET151, is known to synergize with AZD5582, and is a inhibitor of BET, factors counteracting the elongation of RNA transcripts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings were confirmed through multiple screens and multiple techniques. The authors successfully mapped the identified HIV silencing factor at the HIV promoter.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Initial bias:</p>
<p>In the choice of the genes comprised in the library, the authors readdress their previous paper (Hsieh et al.) where it is stated: &quot;To specifically investigate host epigenetic regulators involved in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency, we generated a custom human epigenome specific sgRNA CRISPR library (HuEpi). This library contains sgRNAs targeting epigenome factors such as histones, histone binders (e.g., histone readers and chaperones), histone modifiers (e.g., histone writers and erasers), and general chromatin associated factors (e.g., RNA and DNA modifiers) (Fig 1B and 1C)&quot;.</p>
<p>From these figure panels, it clearly appears that the genes chosen are all belonging to the indicated pathways. While I have nothing to object to on the pertinence to HIV latency of the pathways selected, the authors should spend some words on the criteria followed to select these pathways. Other pathways involving epigenetic modifications and containing genes not represented in the indicated pathways may have been left apart.</p>
<p>(2) Dereplication:</p>
<p>From Figure 1 it appears that INTS12 alone reactivates HIV -1 from latency alone without any drug intervention as shown by the MACGeCk score of DMSO-alone controls. If INTS12 knockdown alone shows antilatency effects, why, then were they unable to identify it in their previous article (Hsieh et al., 2023)? The authors should include some words on the comparison of the results using DMSO alone with those of the previous screen that they conducted.</p>
<p>(3) Translational potential:</p>
<p>In order to propose a protein as a drug target, it is necessary to adhere to the &quot;primum non nocere&quot; principle in medicine. It is therefore fundamental to show the effects of INTS12 knockdown on cell viability/proliferation (and, advisably, T-cell activation). These data are not reported in the manuscript in its current form, and the authors are strongly encouraged to provide them.</p>
<p>Finally, as many readers may not be very familiar with the general principles behind CRISPR Cas9 screening techniques, I suggest addressing them in this excellent review: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479249/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7479249/</ext-link>.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(1) The CRISPR library used was more completely described in a previous publication (Hsieh et al, PLOS Pathogens, 2023). However, we now more explicitly refer the reader to information about the pathways targeted in the library. We also point out how initial hits in the library lead to finding genes outside of the starting library as in the follow-up screen in Figure 7 where each of the members of the INT complex are interrogated even though only INTS12 was the only member in the initial library.</p>
<p>(2) We understand the confusion between the hits in this paper and a previous publication. Indeed, INTS12 was observed in Hsieh et al., PLOS Pathogens, 2023 as a hit in the Venn diagram of Figure 3B of that paper, and in Figure 5A, right panel of that paper. However, it was not followed up on in the previous paper since that paper focused on a hit that was unique to increasing the potency of one particular LRA. We added text to the present manuscript to make it clear that the screens identified many of the same hits. We have also added additional data here on hit validation to underscore the reliability of the CRISPR screen. In one of the cell lines (5A8), EZH2 was a strong hit (Figure 1B). We have now added data that shows that an inhibitor to EZH2 augments the latency reversal of AZD5582/I-BET151 as predicted from the screen. This data has been added to Figure 1, figure supplement 1.</p>
<p>(3) We appreciate the concern that for INTS12 to be a drug target, it should not be essential to cell viability. We now show that knockout of INTS12 has no effect on cell proliferation (new data added in Figure 2—figure supplement 3). In addition, the discussion now adds additional literature references that describe how knockout of INTS12 has relatively minor effects on cell functions in comparison to knockout of other INT members which supports that the proposal that modulation of INTS12 may be more specific than targeting the catalytic modules of Integrator. Nonetheless, we completely agree with the reviewer that many other aspects of how INTS12 affects T cell functions have not been addressed as well as other potential detrimental effect of INTS12 as a drug target in vivo. We now more explicitly describe these caveats in the discussion but feel that the present manuscript is a first step with a long path ahead before the translational potential might be realized.</p>
<p>(4) We now cite the review of CRISPR screens suggested by the reviewer.</p>

<p><bold>Responses to recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors report in the legend of Figure 2 (and similarly in other figures) that there was &quot;a calculated INTS12 knockout score of 76% (for the one guide used) and 69% (for one of three guides used), respectively.&quot; However, it would be helpful to show representative data on the efficiency of INTS12 knockdown in cell lines and primary cells, as well as data on the efficiency of the complementation (Figure 2C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The knockout scores cited are the genetic assays for the efficiency based on sequence files. As the knockouts are done with multiple guides the knockout for each guide is an underestimate of the total knockout. The complementation, however, was done by adding back INTS12 in a lentiviral vector that also contains a drug resistance marker (puromycin). Cells were then selected for puromycin resistance, and therefore, all of them contain the complemented gene. What one would ideally like is a Western blot to quantify the amount of INTS12 remaining in the knockout pools. Unfortunately, despite obtaining multiple different commercial sources of INTS12 antibodies, we were unable to identify one that was suitable for Western blotting (as opposed to two that did work for CUT&amp;Tag). Nonetheless, the functional data in primary T cells from PLWH and in J-Lat cells lines does show the even if the knockout is suboptimal, we find activation after INTS12 knockout (e.g., Figure 6).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Flow cytometry methods are not reported, but was a viability dye included when testing GFP reactivation (Figure S2)? More broadly, showing data on the viability of cells post-knockdown and drug treatments would help, as cell mortality is inherently associated with latency reactivation in J-Lat cells. For the same reason, reporting viability data would be important for primary cells, as the electroporation procedure can lead to significant mortality.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not include viability dyes in the data for GFP activation. However, as described in the public response, we have done growth curves in J-Lat 10.6 cells with and without INTS12 knockout and find no effects on cell proliferation (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). As the reviewer points out, it is not possible to do these experiments in primary cells since the electroporation itself causes a degree of cell death. Nonetheless, we do see effects on HIV activation in these primary cells (Figure 6).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure S2 shows a relatively high baseline expression (approximately 15%) of HIV-GFP, which is not unusual for the J-Lat 10.6 clone. However, Figure 3 appears to show no HIV RNA reads in the control condition of this same cell clone. How do the authors reconcile this discrepancy?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that the discrepancies in the flow cytometry versus RNA-seq assays are due to differences in the sensitivity of the assays, the linear range of the assays especially at the lower end, and the different half-lives of RNA versus protein. We now clarify that Figure 3 does not show “no” HIV RNA at baseline, but rather values of ~30 copies per million read counts. This increases to ~800 copies per million read counts when INTS12 knockout cells are treated with AZD5582/I-BET151. These values have the same fold change predicted in Figure 4, and more closely resemble the trend in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The combination of AZD5582 and I-BET151 consistently reactivates HIV latency (including GFP protein expression), as previously reported and as shown here by the authors. However, in Figure 5B, RPB3/RNAPII occupancy in the DMSO control appears higher than in the AAVS1KO + AZD5582 and I-BET151 samples. This should be discussed, as it could raise concerns about the robustness of RPB3/RNAPII occupancy results as a proxy for provirus elongation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As addressed in the public comments, in order to strengthen our claims about transcriptional elongation control, we measured RNAPII Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation levels. We see evidence of elongation with Ser2 in the condition of concern (AAVS1 KO + AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151) as well as our main condition of interest (INTS12 KO + AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151) and no change in Ser5 for any condition. With both the Ser2 phosphorylation and total RNAPII as well as our virus release and transcription data we believe that we are seeing evidence of increased elongation with INTS12 KO with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151. One potential nuance that may not be gathered from the CUT&amp;Tag data is the turnover rate of the polymerase. Despite the levels of RNAPII appearing lower in the condition of concern (AAVS1 KO + AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151) compared to DMSO it is possible that low levels of elongation are occurring but that in our INTS12 KO + AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 condition there is more rapid elongation and this is why we can observe more RNAPII within HIV. This new data is added in Figure 5C and Figure 5—supplement 2 and its implications are now described in more detail in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors write that &quot;Degree of reactivation was correlated with reservoir size as donors PH504 (star symbol) and PH543 (upside down triangle) have the largest HIV reservoirs (supplemental Figure S2).&quot; I could not find mention of the reservoir size of these donors in the figure provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This confusion was caused by mislabeling of the supplement number, which we fixed, and we added additional labeling to make finding the reservoir size even more clear as this is an important part of the manuscript. This is now found in Supplemental file S4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The MAGeCK gene score is a feature that is essential for the interpretation of the results in Figure 1. The authors do quote the Li et al. paper where this score was described for the first time (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0554-4">https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0554-4</ext-link>), however, they may understand that not all readers may be familiar with this score. Therefore a didactic short description of this score should be done when introducing the results in Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a short description to the paper to address this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 4. The authors write: &quot;Among the host genes most prominently affected by INTS12 knockout with AZD5582 &amp; I-BET151 are MAFA, MAFB, and ID2 (full list of genes in supplemental file S3).&quot; I am a bit confused. In the linked Excel file there is only a list of a few genes. The differentially expressed genes appear to be many more from Figure 4. The full list should be uploaded.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe there was a mistake in our original uploading and naming of the supplements. We have now double-checked numbering on the supplements and added in text clarification of which excel tabs hold the desired information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 6: The authors are right in highlighting that there is a high level of variability in viral RNA in supernatants in the early stages of viral reactivation. It is therefore advisable to repeat measurements at Day 7, at which variability decreases and data are more reliable (please, see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00443-7/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(23)00443-7/fulltext</ext-link>).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While it would have been nice to prolong these measurements, our current assay conditions are not optimal for longer term growth of the cells. We note that the measurements were all done in biological triplicates (independent knockouts) and in different individuals. Because the number of activatable latent proviruses is variable and the number of cells tested is limiting, the variability in the assays is expected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 7: The main genes outside the INTS family should be identified, also.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We include the full list in supplemental file S5 and sort by most enriched.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Methods: A statistical paragraph should be added in the Methods section, detailing the data analysis procedures and the key parameters utilized (for example, which is the MAGeCK gene score threshold that they used to consider knockdown efficacy on HIV latency?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There is no MAGeCK score threshold that we use to determine efficacy on HIV latency. In a previous publication using CRISPR screens for HIV Dependency Factors (Montoya et al, mBio 2023), we showed that there is a relationship between the MAGeCK and the effect of that gene knockout on HIV replication (Figure 5 that paper). However, it is a continuum rather than a strict threshold and we believe that the effects on HIV latency would respond similarly. In the current paper, we have focused on the top hits rather than a comprehensive analysis of all the entire list. In case the reviewer is referring to the average and standard deviation of the non-targeting controls, we have added this to the figure legend and methods.</p>
