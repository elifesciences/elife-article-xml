<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>In all vertebrates studied to date, a rise(s) in intracellular calcium is indispensable for successful fertilization and further embryonic development. Recent studies demonstrated that zinc is ejected to the extracellular milieu, the ‘zinc spark’, and follows the first few calcium rises of fertilization. However, the role of the zinc sparks in fertilization and development, and the supporting influx mechanism(s) are unknown. In this study, we focused on zinc transporters <italic>Zip10/Slc39a10</italic> which was expressed in mouse oocytes through follicular development, and investigated the oocyte-specific deficient mice for <italic>Zip10</italic> (<italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic>: <italic>Zip10<sup>flox/flox</sup> Gdf9<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic>). <italic>Zip10</italic> mRNA or ZIP10 protein was expressed throughout folliculogenesis in the oocyte or plasma membrane, respectively. The number of ovulated oocytes was examined in <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic> mice, and no change from the number of oocytes was observed. <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic> oocytes decreased zinc level in the oocytes, but did not affect maturation and metaphase II spindles formation. Fertilization-induced calcium oscillations were present in <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic> oocytes, but zinc sparks were not observed. Despite other events of egg activation proceeding normally in <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic>oocytes, embryo development into 4-cells and beyond was compromised. We show here for the first time that the zinc transporter ZIP10 contributes to zinc homeostasis in oocytes and embryos, highlighting the role of labile zinc ions in early development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In mammalian fertilization, the sperm factor is released into the ooplasm to activate the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yoon and Fissore, 2007</xref>). It is now believed that phospholipase C zeta (PLCζ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yoon and Fissore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Saunders et al., 2002</xref>) is the sperm factor and it induces in the ooplasm repetitive increases in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, termed ‘calcium oscillations.’ These oscillations play an essential role in triggering the oocyte activation events, such as cortical granule exocytosis, the block of polyspermy, meiotic resumption and exit from MII arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Xu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jones, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ducibella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sugita et al., 2024</xref>). A calcium increase is highly conserved in many species as the trigger of egg activation and is vital for successful fertilization.</p>
<p>In recent years, zinc ions as well as calcium ions, are thought to play important roles during fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allouche-Fitoussi and Breitbart, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kageyama et al., 2022</xref>). Zinc ion is an essential trace element and the second most abundant transition ion in the human body after iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lubna and Ahmad, 2023</xref>). Zinc homeostasis is essential for optimal metabolic function in the reproductive process in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Pascua et al, 2020</xref>), therefore zinc deficiency causes abnormalities such as fetal teratogenicity, long gestation periods, problematic labor, low birth weight and weak offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Favier, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bedwal and Bahuguna, 1994</xref>). Zinc also has important role in the male and female germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allouche-Fitoussi and Breitbart, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kageyama et al., 2022</xref>). Especially in the mouse female germ cells, zinc-deficient condition caused profound defects in oocyte maturation, cumulus cell expansion and ovulation cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Tian and Diaz, 2012</xref>). Several studies have been conducted in mice to understand how zinc regulates oocyte maturation. Zinc was reported to be a critical regulator of meiosis throughout oocyte maturation, including maintaining release from the first and second meiotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kong et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, zinc levels of oocytes were found to increase by 50% as the oocyte progressed through meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernhardt et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2011, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. reported the importance of zinc during mammalian fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Zinc is predominantly stored in vesicles that are symmetrically arranged along the oocyte cortex at the GV stage, and zinc-stored vesicles (cortical granules) are located away from the spindle and form a hemispherical pattern at the MII stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Que et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Que et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Que et al., 2017</xref>). After the penetration of sperm, it has been induced a ‘zinc spark’ that releases billions of labile zinc ions from the cortical granules, and the total zinc content of the oocytes decreases by 10-20% in at the end of fertilization in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, these events immediately follow a series of calcium oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Zinc spark has also been observed in the cattle, non-human primate, human and Xenopus laevis oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Que et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duncan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Seeler et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that this phenomenon is a highly conserved event in vertebrate. More surprisingly, full-term development of mouse embryos has been reported by chelation of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions without Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, suggesting the depletion of zinc ions in oocytes may be sufficient for oocyte activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>). Zinc has also been reported to impact the sperm during fertilization in mice. Zinc accumulation in the zona pellucida increases fibril binding along the glycoprotein matrix and decreases the number of sperm that can reach the fertilized oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Que et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aonuma et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tokuhiro and Dean, 2018</xref>). After the zinc sparks, the released zinc affects the forward motility of sperm to prevent their passage through the zona matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tokuhiro and Dean, 2018</xref>). Zinc spark is associated with the release of ovastacin (<italic>Astl</italic>, the official gene name), which is required for the zona reaction, and functions as a polyspermy block mechanism that is initiated only a few minutes after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tokuhiro and Dean, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The transport of zinc ions into and out of cells is regulated by zinc transporters. In mammals, 14 zinc ion importers, called as ZIP (ZIP1-ZIP14), have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fukada and Kambe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Takagishi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kambe et al., 2015</xref>). Previous study showed that mammalian oocytes regulate zinc uptake through two maternally derived and cortically distributed zinc transporters, ZIP6 and ZIP10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). Further, they reported that targeted disruption using <italic>Zip6</italic>- and <italic>Zip10</italic>-specific morpholino injection or antibody incubation induced alteration of the intracellular labile zinc content, spontaneous resumption of meiosis from the PI arrest and premature arrest at a telophase I-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). It is clear from these reports that ZIP6 and ZIP10 are involved in zinc transport in oocytes, but the function is not elucidated.</p>
<p>In this study, we generated oocyte specific <italic>Zip6</italic> and <italic>Zip10</italic> conditional knockout mice and examined the function of ZIP10 in the oocytes and the importance of zinc homeostasis during fertilization and embryonic development. This study provides clues that elucidate its role in fertilization and embryonic development, which is still largely unknown. In addition, this is the first report confirming the function of the zinc transporter in oocytes, which will contribute to future research.</p>

<title>Zinc transporters, ZIP6, and ZIP10, are expressed in mouse oocytes through follicular development</title>
<p>First, using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunofluorescent staining, we examined the expression of ZIP10 during follicular development. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <italic>Zip10</italic> mRNA was expressed from the primordial oocyte (Arrow). It continued to be expressed in oocytes of primary, secondary, and antral follicles. ZIP10 protein was also expressed in the plasma membrane of primordial oocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>; Arrow). We also confirmed the expression of ZIP10 protein at the plasma membrane of oocytes of primary, secondary, and antral follicles. Although ZIP6 was also expressed in oocytes throughout folliculogenesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>; Arrow), it displayed nuclear localization in oocytes and granulosa cells of primary, secondary, and antral follicles. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> showed zona pellucida and granulosa cells through the follicular development.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The zinc sparks associated with fertilization were first discovered in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Similar observations followed in other mammalian species and amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Que et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duncan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Seeler et al., 2021</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism(s) and biological role of zinc sparks are not elucidated. In this study, we have examined the role of the zinc transporters ZIP6 and ZIP10 using conditionally gene deficient mice, and queries their contribution to the zinc sparks of fertilization.</p>
<p>First, we confirmed the expression of zinc transporter in mouse oocytes. Our results are consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). ZIPs, including ZIP6 and ZIP10, are transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eide, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kambe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lu and Fu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schmitt-Ulms et al., 2009</xref>). In primordial follicles, the ooplasm staining of ZIP10 we anticipate corresponds to ooplasmic vesicular sites. ZIP10 expression shifted to the plasma membrane in primary and antral follicle phase. A similar localization shift of ZIP10 to the oocyte surface was reported during oocyte maturation, which is much later than reported here by. Furthermore, in that study, ZIP10 was detected in the nuclear/nucleolar positions of oocytes of all follicular stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), which we did not observe. On the other hand, ZIP6 was expressed at the nuclear/nucleolar regions and in granulosa cells. This localization of ZIP6 was consistent with that in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). However, our results failed to notice that ZIP6 shifts to the at plasma membrane in antral follicle oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). The results indicate that ZIP6 may be fulfilling a distinct function within the oocytes compared to ZIP10.</p>
<p>To assess the role of these transporters in mice, we generated oocyte-specific <italic>Zip6 or Zip10</italic> knockout mice (Fig. S1; <italic>Zip6<sup>d/d</sup></italic> and <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic>, respectively). Previous reports noted that the disruption of these transporters using specific morpholinos or incubation in function-blocking antibodies induced the change of intracellular labile zinc quota into mice oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). The amount of labile zinc ions in those mouse oocytes was measured using Fluozin-3AM, zinc indicator. The amount of labile zinc ions in <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic> oocytes was significantly lower than in the <italic>Zip10<sup>f/f</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). We failed to observe any effect on zinc levels of in <italic>Zip6<sup>d/d</sup></italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2B</xref>). The results indicate that ZIP10 is mostly responsible for the uptake of zinc ions in mouse oocytes.</p>
<p>Zinc insufficient GV oocytes do not maintain the meiotic arrest at PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kong et al., 2012</xref>). This is suggested to happen by premature activation of the MOS-MAPK pathway in the presence of low zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kong et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, low ooplasmic zinc accelerates meiotic progression that contributes to the extrusion of large polar bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernhardt et al., 2011</xref>). The early mitotic inhibitor 2 (EMI2), a zinc-binding APC/C proteasome inhibitor, is also an essential component of the cytoplasmic factor (CSF) that initiates entry into MII phase. EMI2 is a zinc binding protein, and when zinc is reduced, the activity of the APC/C proteasome is stimulated, increasing the degradation of CCNB1, reduced MPF activity leading to early release of meiosis arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernhardt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bernhardt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shoji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ohe et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies reported that targeted disruption of <italic>Zip10</italic> using morpholino injections and function-inhibiting antibodies during meiotic maturation perturbed meiosis progression and resulted in cell cycle arrest at the telophase I-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these findings we hypothesized that the reduced state of labile zinc ions in <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic> mouse oocytes may resemble the state of zinc-deficient oocytes. We investigated the maturation progression and spindle organization in oocyte matured in vitro from the GV to MII stage. We failed to observe any differences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). We also did not observed abnormalities in oocytes from <italic>Zip6<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Fig. S2A</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). We speculate that the disparate outcomes observed in previous studies may be attributed to the presence of trace amounts of labile zinc ions in media or in the oocytes.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the amount of labile zinc ions in <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic>2PN zygote was higher than in <italic>Zip10<sup>f/f</sup></italic> and despite some differences in fluorescence intensity between <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic> GV, MII and 2PN zygote, the labile zinc concentrations were not significantly different between these groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Therefore, we monitored zinc sparks and calcium oscillations in the <italic>Zip10</italic>-KO oocytes. Several studies reported the important of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in mammalian oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fissore et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Parrington et al., 1998</xref>), which is essential for egg activation because its inhibition precludes Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miyazaki and Ito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miyazaki et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). It has been reported that a putative Zinc-finger motif in a helical linker (LNK) domain near the C-terminus of <italic>IP<sub>3</sub>R1</italic> plays a role in <italic>IP<sub>3</sub>R1</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Paknejad and Hite, 2018</xref>). Recently, Akizawa <italic>et al</italic>., reported that both deficient and excessive zinc ions compromise <italic>IP<sub>3</sub>R1</italic> sensitivity, diminishing and terminating calcium oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akizawa et al., 2023</xref>). Our results showed that a single zinc spark occurs immediately after first calcium rise of oscillations in <italic>Zip10<sup>f/f</sup></italic> oocytes, as reported by Kim <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and similar results are obtained in <italic>Zip6<sup>d/d</sup></italic>and <italic>Zip6<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mouse oocytes (Fig. S3). However, in <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic>oocytes, despite the presence calcium elevations, zinc sparks failed to occur. Similarly, <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic> oocytes activated with ionomycin (artificial oocyte activation) did not show a zinc spark (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In this study, calcium oscillations occurred in oocytes with low zinc state. In addition, there was no difference in the amplitude frequency of calcium ions in oocytes of both groups within the observation time. Akizawa <italic>et al</italic>., produced zinc deficiency state with TPEN, a strong chelator of intracellular labile zinc ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akizawa et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, we did not completely remove intracellular labile zinc ions from mouse oocytes. We speculate that zinc ions existed in <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic>mouse oocytes induce Ca<sup>2+</sup> release without compromising <italic>IP<sub>3</sub>R1</italic> sensitivity. However, this study demonstrated that the accumulation of intracellular zinc ions mediated by ZIP10 is essential for inducing zinc sparks in mouse oocytes.</p>
<p>The total cellular zinc ions content required for meiosis in the oocyte substantially increases (a 50% increase) from the prophase I arrest to the arrest at metaphase of meiosis II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernhardt et al., 2011</xref>). The zinc is stored in undefined cortical granules, and an average of 10<sup>6</sup> zinc atoms are released from these vesicles at the time of fertilization (exocytosis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Que et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Que et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). There are several possibilities that might explain why <italic>Zip10</italic> conditional KO mice have low zinc sparks. The most logical is that these oocytes experience reduced zinc loading of cortical of zinc vesicles, leading to the absence of sparks. Our results suggest that in oocytes, zinc sparks and exocytosis require adequate concentrations of labile zinc ions in the cortical secretory vesicles, which is not accomplished when ZIP10 is not present.</p>
<p>Zinc sparks have been reported to contribute to the rapid and permanent block mechanisms to prevent polyspermy. The former is achieved by zinc in the extracellular milieu decelerating the forward motility of sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tokuhiro and Dean, 2018</xref>). Secondly, the release of labile pools of zinc at the same time that the zinc metalloendopeptidase ovastacin is released with the cortical granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tokuhiro and Dean, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Burkart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Schmitz et al., 2021</xref>), cause ZP2 protein cleavage inducing a complete, although belated block to polyspermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Que et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aonuma et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Tokuhiro and Dean, 2018</xref>). However, the physiological significance of the zinc sparks’ contributions to polyspermy have not been thoroughly tested, and <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic>mice, which are almost devoid of them, offer a great model. Our results showing normal rates of monospermic fertilization in <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup> oocyte</italic> suggest that contributions of Zinc to polyspermy control is negligible (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Our results also show that the ovastacin undergoes normal release in <italic>Zip10<sup>f/f</sup></italic> oocytes after fertilization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>), confirming previous studies of a minor role of the ZP2 to polyspermy. We observed the disappearance of JUNO after fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>) <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup>,</italic> suggesting that gamete fusion took place (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Together, these results support the view that zinc spark is not directly involved in the polyspermy rejection mechanism.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there were no differences in the rates of fertilization (pronucleus formation), but development to the blastocyst stage was significantly reduced in <italic>Zip10-</italic>null embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Most of the embryos were arrested at the 2-cell stage and not developed beyond the 4-cell stage. Zinc insufficiency caused altered chromatin structure in the nuclei of blastomeres that displayed decreased global transcription, causing arrest in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kong et al., 2015</xref>). The abnormal zinc homeostasis, particularly during the one-cell stage, inhibits the activation of the embryonic genome that occurs around the two-cell stage in mice due to reduce the translational capacity through the inhibition of ribosomal RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chanfreau, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Garner et al., 2021</xref>). Our results also show that <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic> blastocysts had significantly lower cell numbers compared to the blastocysts from <italic>Zip10<sup>f/f</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Our results suggest that Zip10<sup>d/d</sup> mice oocytes can be fertilizable, but their developmental potential is decreased. The lack of ZIP10-mediated zinc influx during the folliculogenesis of <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic> may compromise gene expression during these early stages of oocyte development. <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic>mouse oocytes thus may have compromised developmental potential from the outset. Future studies should assess the transcriptomic profile of <italic>Zip10<sup>d/d</sup></italic>mouse oocytes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we elucidated that ZIP10 is required for zinc ion uptake into oocytes and the intracellular zinc ions regulated by ZIP10 was important for zinc sparks and progression of embryonic development. However, the role of ZIP6 remained uncertain. Currently, the many infertility patients exist in the world (the survey of WHO). It is reported that approximately half of the adult females are deficient in zinc in their serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Prasad, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Yokokawa et al., 2020</xref>). Zinc has been reported to play essential roles in many physiological functions including reproductive functions (Suzuki, M., et al, 2021, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">MacDonald RS, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jackson KA, et al, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bernhardt ML, et al, 2012</xref>, Suzuki, T., et al, 2010, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ohe M, et al, 2010</xref>). The findings will help elucidate the role of zinc homeostasis in the fields of fertilization/embryogenesis. Furthermore, the development of zinc-focused assisted reproductive technologies and fertilization/embryogenesis media could contribute to improve the developmental potential of oocytes and embryos in other mammalian species.</p>

<p>The revised manuscript addresses several reviewer concerns, and the study continues to provide useful insights into how ZIP10 regulates zinc homeostasis and zinc sparks during fertilization in mice. The authors have improved the clarity of the figures, shifted emphasis in the abstract more clearly to ZIP10, and added brief discussion of ZIP6/ZIP10 interactions and ZIP10's role in zinc spark-calcium oscillation decoupling. However, some critical issues remain only partially addressed.</p>
<p>(1) Oocyte health confound: The use of Gdf9-Cre deletes ZIP10 during oocyte growth, meaning observed defects could result from earlier disruptions in zinc signaling rather than solely from the absence of zinc sparks at fertilization. The authors acknowledge this and propose transcriptome profiling as a future direction. However, since mRNA levels often do not accurately reflect protein levels and activity in oocytes, transcriptomics may not be particularly informative in this context. Proteomic approaches that directly assess the molecular effects of ZIP10 loss seem more promising. Although current sensitivity limitations make proteomics from small oocyte samples challenging, ongoing improvements in this area may soon allow for more detailed mechanistic insights.</p>
<p>(2) ZIP6 context and focus: The authors clarified the abstract to emphasize ZIP10, enhancing narrative clarity. This revision is appropriate and appreciated.</p>
<p>(3) Follicular development effects: The biological consequences of ZIP6 and ZIP10 knockout during folliculogenesis are still unknown. The authors now say these effects will be studied in the future, but this still leaves a major mechanistic gap unaddressed in the current version.</p>
<p>(4) Zinc spark imaging and probe limitations: The addition of calcium imaging enhances the clarity of Figure 3. However, zinc fluorescence remains inadequate, and the authors depend solely on FluoZin-3AM, a dye known for artifacts and limited ability to detect subcellular labile zinc. The suggestion that C57BL/6J mice may differ from CD1 in vesicle appearance is plausible but does not fully address concerns about probe specificity and resolution. As the authors acknowledge, future studies with more selective probes would increase confidence in both the spatial and quantitative analysis of zinc dynamics.</p>
<p>(5) Mechanistic insight remains limited: The revised discussion now recognizes the lack of detailed mechanistic understanding but does not significantly expand on potential signaling pathways or downstream targets of ZIP10. The descriptive data are useful, but the inability to pinpoint how ZIP10 mediates zinc spark regulation remains a key limitation. Again, proteomic profiling would probably be more informative than transcriptomic analysis for identifying ZIP10-dependent pathways once technical barriers to low-input proteomics are overcome.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors have reasonably revised and clarified key points raised by reviewers, and the manuscript now reads more clearly. However, the main limitation, lack of mechanistic insight and the inability to distinguish between developmental and fertilization-stage roles of ZIP10, remains unresolved. These should be explicitly acknowledged when framing the conclusions.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors investigated the role of the zinc transporter ZIP10 in regulating zinc sparks during fertilization in mice. By utilizing oocyte-specific Zip6 and Zip10 conditional knockout mice, the authors effectively demonstrate the importance of ZIP10 in zinc homeostasis, zinc spark generation, and early embryonic development. The study is overall useful as it identifies ZIP10 as an important component of oocyte processes that support embryo development, thus opening the door for further investigations. While the study provides solid evidence for the requirement of ZIP10 in the regulation of zinc sparks and zinc homeostasis, it falls short of revealing the underlying mechanism of how ZIP10 exerts this important function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This report is the first to clarify the role of the zinc transporters ZIP10 expressed in oocytes, which was previously unknown, and does not focus on the detailed mechanism. As you pointed out, we believe that the mechanism will also be important information in the field of fertilization and embryogenesis research, and we believe that it is necessary to consider this issue in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The zinc transporters the authors are knocking out are expressed in mouse oocytes through follicular development, and the Gdf9-cre driver used means these oocytes were grown in the absence of appropriate Zinc signaling. Thus, it would be difficult to assert that the lack of fertilization associated with zinc sparks is solely responsible for the failure of embryo development. Spindle morphology and other meiotic parameters do not necessarily report oocyte health, so normalcy of these features may not be a strong argument when it comes to metabolic issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As you rightly observe, the results of this study do not entirely exclude the possibility of oocyte health in the absence of adequate zinc homeostasis during oocyte growth. However, evidence has been presented demonstrating that spindle formation does occur in Zip10<sup>d/d</sup> mouse oocytes (Fig.2 C), that fertilization occurs despite the absence of zinc spark (Fig.3 and Fig. 4A), and that some embryos develop to blastocysts (Fig. 4 B). We believe that future studies should evaluate the transcriptome profile of Zip10<sup>d/</sup> mouse oocytes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While comparing ZIP6 and ZIP10 in the abstract provides context, focusing more on ZIP10 would improve reader comprehension, as ZIP10 is the primary focus of the study. Emphasizing the specific role of ZIP10 will help the reader grasp the core findings more clearly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable input. We have revised the summary to focus more on ZIP10 by removing the section in the summary that mentions ZIP6 (P.1-2 Line 34-52).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Zinc transporters ZIP6 and ZIP10 are expressed during follicular development, but the biological significance of the observation is not clearly addressed. The authors should investigate whether the ZIP6 and ZIP10 knockout affects follicular development and discuss the potential implications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable input. As you mentioned, we have not been able to clarify the effects of ZIP6 and ZIP10 knockout on follicle formation. However, this report clarifies the role of ZIP-mediated zinc ions in their inclusion. The effect of ZIP knockout on follicle formation will be discussed in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 3, the zinc fluorescence images are unclear, making it difficult for readers to interpret the data. Including snapshot images of calcium and zinc spikes as part of the main figure would improve clarity. Moreover, adding more comparative statements and a deeper explanation of why Zip10 KO mice exhibit normal calcium oscillations but lack zinc sparks would strengthen the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have also added images of calcium elevation after fertilization to Fig. 3 and Fig. S3. In addition, the figure legends have been changed (P.29 Line 937-939, P.34 Line 1104-1106). As to why Zip10 KO mice show normal calcium oscillations but lack zinc spikes, as mentioned in Discussion (P. 10 Line 299-300), we speculate that zinc ions existed in Zip10d/d mouse oocytes induce Ca2+ release without compromising IP3R1 sensitivity. We also assume that the lack of zinc spark is due to low accumulation of zinc ion levels in the oocytes via ZIP10, as described in Discussion (P.10 Line 300-302).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) While the study identifies the role of ZIP10 in zinc spark generation, it lacks a clear mechanistic insight. The topic itself is interesting, but without providing a more detailed explanation of the underlying mechanisms, the study leaves an important gap. Further discussion on the signaling pathways potentially involved in zinc spark regulation would add depth to the findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2(Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this important study, the authors examine the role of two zinc uptake transporters, Zip6 and Zip10, which are important during the maturation of oocytes, and are critical for both successful fertilization and early embryogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors report that oocytes from Zip10 knockout mice exhibit lower labile zinc content during oocyte maturation, decreased amounts of zinc exocytosis during fertilization, and affect the rate of blastocyst generation in fertilized eggs relative to a control strain. They do not observe these changes in their Zip6 knockout animals. The authors present clear and well-documented results from a broad range of experimental modalities in support of their conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your positive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors' statement that Zip10 is not expressed in the oocyte nuclei (line 252). Furthermore, in that study, ZIP10 was detected in the nuclear/nucleolar positions of oocytes of all follicular stages (Chen et al., 2023), which we did not observe. This is not supported by Figure 1, where some Zip10 signal is apparent in the primordial, primary, and secondary follicle oocytes. This statement should be corrected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. Our results of ISH staining (Fig. 1A) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1B) showed that it was not detected at the nucleus/nucleolus location. In other words, they could not be detected at the mRNA and protein levels. Based on the results of ISH staining and immunofluorescence staining, we conclude that it is expressed in the plasma membrane.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Based on the FluoZin-3AM data, there appears to be less labile zinc in the Zip10d/d oocyte, eggs, and embryos; however, FluoZin-3AM has a number of well-known artifacts and does not accurately capture the localization of labile zinc pools. The patterns do not correspond to the well-documented zinc-containing cortical vesicles. Another zinc probe, such as ZinPyr-4 or ZincBY-1 should be used to visualize the zinc vesicles and confirm that there is less labile zinc in these locations as well.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. Previous studies (Lisle et al., 2013, Reproduction) and our report (Kageyama et al., 2022, Animal Science Journal) have shown that it is possible to examine the presence of labile zinc ions in oocytes and embryos. In addition, mouse oocytes (embryos) reported in previous studies are from CD1 (ICR) mice, whereas our study was conducted using C57BL/6J mice. In our report (Kageyama et al., 2024, Journal of Reproduction and Development), we reported that the appearance of zinc vesicles in the oocytes observed by Fluozin-3AM staining in CD1 and C57BL/6J mice is different, and we believe that this appearance of cortical vesicles in C57BL/6J mice is not a problem. As you say, we have not used other zinc probes and will consider this in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 268 The results indicate that ZIP10 is mostly responsible for the uptake of zinc ions in mouse oocytes. The situation seems a bit more complicated given that the differences in labile zinc content between oocytes from the WT and Zip10d/d animals are small (only 20-30 %) and that the zinc spark is diminished but still apparent at a low level in the Zip10d/d oocytes. Clearly, other factors are involved in zinc uptake at these stages. A variety of studies have suggested that Zip6 and Zip10 work together, perhaps even functioning as a heterodimer in some systems. The double KO would address this more clearly, but if it is not available, it might be more prudent to state that Zip10 plays some role in uptake of zinc in mouse oocytes while the role of Zip6 remains uncertain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude for the comments received. The phenotype of double knockout mice for ZIP6 and ZIP10 will be discussed at a future date. We have also added to the text that the role of ZIP6 remains uncertain (P. 11 Line 353-354).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Zip6d/d oocytes did not have changes in labile zinc, nor did the lack of Zip6 have an impact on the zinc spark. However, Figure S1 does show a small amount of detectable Zip6 in the western blot. It is possible that this small amount could compensate for the complete lack of Zip6. Can ZIP6 be found in immunofluorescence of GV oocytes or MII eggs from the Zip6d/d animals? Additionally, it is possible that Zip6's role is only supplementary to that of Zip10. The authors should discuss this possibility. It would also be interesting to see if the Zip6/Zip10 double knockout displays greater defects compared to the Zip10 knockout when considering previous studies.</p>

<p>Thank you for your input. The mice are deficient in the gene so that ZIP6 is not functional. It is our notion that the results of WB analysis are not indicative of protein structural functionality, even in cases where the ZIP6 antibody detects a small amount of protein. Since the role of ZIP6 was not elucidated in this study, we added a statement to that effect in the text (P. 11 Line 353-354). In addition, studies using ZIP6/Zip10 double knockout mice will be discussed in the future.</p>

<p>(1) In lines 133-136, it seems that the authors would like to aim to emphasize the lack of research on oocytes compared to other tissues and cells. However, the inclusion of unrelated contexts, such as the role of ZIP10 in cancer and skin, appears unnecessary and detracts from the focus on oocyte-specific mechanisms. Removing these unrelated sentences would help maintain clarity and relevance in the introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>*As you indicated, we removed the sentence that is not related to oocytes (P.4 Line 120-125). Further, they reported that targeted disruption using Zip6- and Zip10- specific morpholino injection or antibody incubation induced alteration of the intracellular labile zinc content, spontaneous resumption of meiosis from the PI arrest and premature arrest at a telophase I-like state (Kong et al., 2014). It is clear from these reports that ZIP6 and ZIP10 are involved in zinc transport in oocytes, but the function is not elucidated.”</p>

<p>(2) Ensure that all video files are properly labeled to enhance understanding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Improved video labels for clarity (Movie 1-8, Movie S1-S4)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Correct mislabeling issues, such as the one in line 209.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrected as follows: Zip10<sup>d/d</sup> mouse oocytes can be fertilized but were unlikely to develop to blastocysts (P. 6-7 Line 196-197).</p>

<p>(4) In Figure 4D, the amount of ZIP2 appears to increase relative to actin. Including quantification would make the data more robust. Similarly, in Figure 4F, JUNO levels appear increased in Zip10 KO. Please provide quantification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The WB band images in Fig. 4D were quantified and their graphs were added to lower part of Fig. 4D. Furthermore, the Juno of Immunofluorescent images in Figure 4F were quantified and their graphs were added to Fig. S4. Figure legends and text were corrected and added.P. 30 Line 975-979: Expression level of β-actin serves as a protein loading control and quantified the expression level of ZP2. Molecular mass is indicated at the left. Statistical differences were calculated according to the one-way ANOVA. Different letters represent significant differences (p &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>P. 35 Line: Fig. S4 Comparison of JUNO expression in Zip10<sup>f/f</sup> and Zip10<sup>d/d</sup> mouse MII oocytes. To measure JUNO-immunofluorescence intensity, oocytes images were selected as regions of interest (ROIs) and measured using ImageJ. Statistical differences were calculated according to student’s t-test (p &gt; 0.05; no significant difference).P.7 Line 206-209: As for the expression of JUNO, it had the same expression than between null and control oocytes (Fig. S4) and the temporal dynamics of its disappearance from the cortex after fertilization was similar for both Zip10<sup>f/f</sup> and Zip10<sup>d/d</sup> groups (Fig. 4F).</p>
