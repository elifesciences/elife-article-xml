<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Periodontitis drives irreversible destruction of periodontal tissue and is prone to exacerbating inflammatory disorders. Systemic immunomodulatory management continues to be an attractive approach in periodontal care, particularly within the context of &quot;predictive, preventive, and personalized&quot; periodontics. In the present study, genetic proxies identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for circulating immune cells and periodontitis were incorporated into a comprehensive Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. Univariable MR, multivariable MR, subgroup analysis, reverse MR, and Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) were utilized to investigate the causal relationships. Furthermore, transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and colocalization analysis were deployed to pinpoint the underlying genes. Consequently, the MR study indicated a causal association between circulating neutrophils, natural killer T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and an elevated risk of periodontitis. MR-BMA analysis revealed that neutrophils were the primary contributors to periodontitis. The high-confidence genes <italic>S100A9</italic> and <italic>S100A12</italic>, located on 1q21.3, could potentially serve as immunomodulatory targets for neutrophil-mediated periodontitis. These findings hold promise for early diagnosis, risk assessment, targeted prevention, and personalized treatment of periodontitis. Considering the marginal association observed in our study, further research is required to thoroughly comprehend the biological underpinnings and ascertain the clinical relevance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Periodontitis imposes a considerable social burden on dental practice and general health</title>
<p>Periodontitis is a highly prevalent disease that affects a considerable percentage of the population. According to large-scale epidemiological research, up to half of all adults worldwide suffer periodontal disease, with severe periodontitis threatening 10.5-12.0 % of them (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kassebaum et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). Furthermore, periodontitis is the leading cause of adult tooth loss, necessitating extensive dental procedures such as extractions, dental implants, or prosthetics, which can be costly and time-consuming for both patients and dental practitioners (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Genco and Sanz, 2020</xref></italic></bold>). Recent research demonstrated a relationship between periodontitis and inflammatory comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hajishengallis and Chavakis, 2021</xref></italic></bold>). The high prevalence and harmful implications of periodontitis underline the importance of managing periodontitis to maintain oral and general health (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Peres et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>). Since early-stage prevention is the most significant way to improve health, the identification of additional potential risk factors was required to provide predictive, preventive, and personalized strategies for periodontal care (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ma et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Evidence from epidemiology and pathophysiology demonstrates the impact of circulating immune cells on periodontitis</title>
<p>Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the interactions between microorganisms and host immune response (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Curtis et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). The immune response to periodontitis comprises both innate and adaptive immunity, with multiple cytokines, immune cells, and inflammatory pathways participating in a complex interplay (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dutzan et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). Systemic immunological alternations, such as circulating immune cells, play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of periodontitis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cekici et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). An observational study indicated that patients with periodontitis experience a greater level of circulating leukocytes (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Noz et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>), while another discovered that the distribution of B cells alters in the context of severe periodontitis, with a higher proportion of circulating memory B cells (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Demoersman et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). Furthermore, inflamed periodontal tissue recruits immune cells from circulation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hajishengallis, 2020</xref></italic></bold>). With the progression of periodontitis, there is a significant alteration in the quantity of immune cells present within the periodontal tissue. Specifically, an increase in the count of both monocytes and B cells is observed, whereas a decrease is noted in the count of T cells. (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nair et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Steinmetz et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). The promising concept of &quot;trained immunity&quot; has recently provided a greater understanding of the host immune response in periodontitis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Netea et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>), which can explain the fact that the increased hyper-responsiveness of circulating immune cells from patients with periodontitis as well as its probable mechanism of mediating periodontitis and its comorbidities (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Immunomodulation of systemic immune response serves as a hub for periodontal care</title>
<p>Systemic immunomodulation management has the potential to improve host homeostasis by altering the composition and function of the immune milieu (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yang et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>). Periodontitis can be effectively managed by restricting immune cell activation, implying that immunomodulators have significant promise in constructing comprehensive strategies for periodontal management (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Zidar et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>). For example, resveratrol, quercetin, and N-acetylcysteine were reported to reduce the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils, which aided in the prevention of periodontitis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Orihuela-Campos et al., 2015</xref></italic></bold>). Nonetheless, from a medical and therapeutic perspective, it is critical to determine whether the link between circulating immune cells and periodontitis is merely correlative or driven by causative mechanistic interactions (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lamont and Hajishengallis, 2015</xref></italic></bold>). Understanding the role of systemic immune alternations in periodontitis is critical for developing an effective strategy for early screening of high-risk patients, prompt implementation of definitive prevention, and individualized deployment of targeted treatment, all with the goal of reducing unexpected inflammatory responses, maintaining oral health, and avoiding complications (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Mendelian randomization provides a potent complement to causal inference in terms of genetics</title>
<p>Previous research has substantiated the potential of immunomodulation management in predicting and preventing periodontitis; however, in observational studies, the association is frequently disguised by reverse causality, confounding factors, and disease conditions, which obscured the intrinsic causal inference between them (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hajishengallis and Korostoff, 2017</xref></italic></bold>). Mendelian randomization (MR) investigates the causal relationships between risk factors and diseases by exploiting genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Davies et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>), which is less likely to be affected by underlying bias or disease condition, in that alleles are randomly allocated from parents to offspring (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Julian et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>). Notably, MR with distinct causal relationships may provide fresh evidence from a genomics perspective (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Golubnitschaja et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). We postulate that individuals with a disproportionate immunological network have a higher risk of periodontitis due to unexpected inflammatory reactions.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>The present study, as shown in <bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>, was based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology using the Mendelian Randomization (STROBE-MR) checklist (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Skrivankova et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>). The present research aims to evaluate the causal association between circulating immune cells and the risk of periodontitis, providing insight into opportunity for systemic immunomodulation management in periodontal care. We utilized summary statistics from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to perform both univariable MR (UVMR) and multivariable MR (MVMR) analyses. Furthermore, we replicated the UVMR analysis by excluding potentially pleiotropic SNPs, and subsequently conducted subgroup and reverse MR analyses. Additionally, the Bayesian model averaging (MR-BMA) was employed to pinpoint the predominant characteristics with causal signals. Finally, we conducted a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and colocalization analysis to discern potential genes implicated in biological relationships.</p>

<title>Data source</title>
<p>Summary-level data on 17 circulating immune cells were obtained from the large-scale GWAS conducted by the Blood Cell Consortium (BCC) and the Sardinian cohort (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Orrù et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vuckovic et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). The GWAS data for periodontitis and its subtypes were supplied by the Gene-Lifestyle Interactions in Dental Endpoints collaboration (GLIDE) consortium and the FinnGen cohort (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kurki et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shungin et al., 2019</xref></italic></bold>). To maintain the homogeneity within the target group and minimize overlap, we performed a screening process on the population. Specifically, the population from the Latin American and the UK Biobank cohort was excluded from the periodontitis data set (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Ye et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>). The features of GWAS characteristics and included cohorts were highlighted in <bold><italic><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></italic></bold> and <bold><italic>Supplementary File 1</italic></bold> — Table s1.</p>

<p>Candidates for IVs underwent a thorough set of screening procedures. To equalize the sample disparities among databases, a complicated screening criterion was performed. We initially filtered the <italic>p</italic>-values of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), followed by the selection of independent SNPs using the linkage disequilibrium (LD) approach. The R<sup>2</sup> and F-statistics were introduced to demonstrate the degree of genetic variation explained and their relative impact on the outcomes, and SNPs with F-statistics &lt; 10 would be removed based on the first MR assumption (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Papadimitriou et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). In addition, SNPs that exhibited a direct association with the outcome would also be deleted to support the third MR assumption. Throughout the harmonization processes, palindromic and ambiguous SNPs were eliminated to ensure the reliability and validity of causal inference. In MVMR, we excluded SNPs situated in the major histocompatibility complex area (MHC, 6p21.31) due to its complexity and confounding effects (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burgess and Thompson, 2015</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization</title>
<p>In UVMR, the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method was performed as the primary analysis, and four alternative MR methods, including weighted median, maximum likelihood, MR-Egger, and MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) global test were employed for sensitivity testing to assess the robustness of the IVW estimates. Briefly, the IVW assumes that all genetic variations meet the conditions and integrated estimates from multiple genetic variants by weighting them inversely to variances (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sanderson et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>). The weighted median generates precise estimates when more than half of the SNPs are valid (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gormley et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>). The maximum likelihood offers a normal bivariate distribution to estimate causal effects by maximizing the likelihood function with a linear relationship (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Xue et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>). MR-Egger provides estimates after accounting for possible horizontal pleiotropy discovered by its incorporated intercept test, albeit the estimates were frequently underpowered (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bowden et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). MR-PRESSO detects outliers that cause pleiotropy and generates estimates once these outlier SNPs are eliminated (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Verbanck et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). The observed significant results were considered &quot;robust&quot; if the effect of sensitivity analyses was identical to that of IVW method, yielding a <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>To gauge the individual influence of each variant, MVMR analysis with mutual adjustment was performed, followed by a correction for associated confounders (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burgess and Thompson, 2015</xref></italic></bold>). We have incorporated covariates, including the number of cigarettes smoked, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and body mass index (BMI) into the MVMR analysis, given that these factors could indirectly affect systemic immune responses and inflammation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Liu et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>). The MVMR-IVW method was utilized as the primary test, supplemented by the MVMR-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (MVMR-LASSO) and the MVMR-Egger method (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bowden et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). The MVMR-LASSO regression yields dependable estimations for moderate-to-high degrees of heterogeneity or pleiotropy, and it also assists in alleviating the potential effects of multicollinearity among variables (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Grant and Burgess, 2021</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>The heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy of the results were quantified using Cochran’s Q statistics and the intercept term in MR-Egger regression, respectively. The MR-Radial, a more sensitive method for outliers, would be employed to detect and remove outlier SNPs whenever heterogeneity or pleiotropy was discovered (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bowden et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). The leave-one-out (LOO) analysis and scatter plot were carried out to detect influential SNPs.</p>

<p>As a multivariate framework for high-throughput risk factors based on non-linear regression, the MR-BMA was then employed to explore the leading traits responsible for outcome (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zuber et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). First, we used closed-form Bayes factors and independence priors to calculate the posterior probability (PP) and model-specific causal estimates (MSCE) of each variant. Next, the total PPs for all potential models were added up to determine the marginal probability of inclusion (MIP). The model-averaged causal estimate (MACE), which reflected the average direct effect of each metabolic trait on the outcomes, was also used to compare risk factors and interpret the directions. Finally, the best model was chosen preferably based on the ranking of each model’s MIP and PP values. The Q-statistic and Cook’s distance were used to identify invalid outliers and influential variants within the model. A genetic variant was defined as either an outlier or an influential variant if it possessed a q-value exceeding 10 or if its Cook’s distance surpassed the median of the corresponding F-distribution. The MR-BMA would be repeated once unqualified variations were discovered (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eledum, 2021</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Circulating neutrophils play a significant part in periodontitis and inflammatory comorbidities</title>
<p>Notably, our findings suggested that circulating neutrophils may play a leading causal role in the likelihood of periodontitis, and it remained robust after correcting for potential confounding factors and outliers. Neutrophils are abundant and short-lived myeloid cells that can be rapidly recruited to inflammatory sites, serving as the first line of defense against infections and other host insults. In recent years, a profound understanding of the role of neutrophils in chronic inflammatory diseases has been gained, where they may directly act as effectors of destructive inflammation. However, a scarcity of neutrophils can also trigger destructive tissue inflammation, their pivotal role in maintaining physiological equilibrium (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ley et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). Numerous pieces of clinical evidence have uncovered that neutrophils account for a significant portion of inflammatory tissue damage and that the severity of periodontitis is positively correlated with the overproduction, dysregulation, or hyperactivity of neutrophils (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chapple et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fine et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>). A case-control study indicated that periodontitis patients suffered from a higher level of apoptotic circulatory neutrophils than healthy people (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nicu et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>). An increased neutrophil count could suggest the inflammatory burden of gingivitis and dental plaque in the oral cavity (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Sreenivasan and Prasad, 2022</xref></italic></bold>). Another study discovered that neutrophil depletion ameliorated experimental periodontitis while unrestrained recruitment aggravated it (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dutzan et al., 2018</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses are crucial in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, influencing not only its localized manifestation but also its systemic complications, thereby associating it with a broad spectrum of inflammatory complications (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hajishengallis and Chavakis, 2021</xref></italic></bold>). During periodontitis, neutrophils act as the primary defense against bacteremia, with their primary function being to engulf and eradicate these bacteria, thus inhibiting their dissemination within the body. Following this, neutrophils liberally release pro-inflammatory cytokines in the connective tissue adjacent to the periodontal pocket. It is plausible that these cytokines could permeate into the bloodstream, thereby potentially exacerbating systemic inflammation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">D’Aiuto et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>). In severe periodontitis cases, patients experience low-grade systemic inflammation, as indicated by elevated levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory mediators, compared to their healthy counterparts (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schenkein et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). Preclinical research also indicates that ligature-induced periodontitis (LIP) is accompanied by an elevation in circulating neutrophil counts, resulting in endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brito et al., 2013</xref></italic></bold>). The quantity and functionality of neutrophils both act as critical indicators of inflammation severity. The reduction in neutrophil count and inflammatory mediators, observed after successful periodontitis treatment, suggests a reduction in systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hajishengallis, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The recently developed concept of &quot;trained immunity&quot; has introduced new perspectives in understanding how neutrophils contribute to periodontitis and its comorbidities. &quot;Trained Immunity&quot; primarily denotes the memory-like response of myeloid innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, to pathogens following an initial infection (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Li et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>). Contrary to the memory response of specific immune cells, the memory characteristic of trained immunity primarily manifests as a rapid response and efficient elimination of pathogens, rather than specific recognition (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Netea et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). Trained myeloid cells have the potential to amplify the functionality of neutrophils, thereby fortifying the body’s defense against subsequent infections. Nevertheless, within the framework of chronic inflammation, these cells could potentially intensify tissue damage (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hajishengallis and Chavakis, 2022</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Periodontitis exemplifies a condition that stimulates maladaptive myelopoiesis in the bone marrow, characterized by the production of an excessive number of hyper-inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Li et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>). This leads to an influx of maladaptively trained neutrophils in both the blood circulation and periodontal tissues, that infiltrate not only oral tissues but also non-oral ones, simultaneously triggering an increase in the production of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) and a reduction in their degradation (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">White et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>). This process, as a result, intensifies the collapse of the epithelial barrier, fosters bacteremia, exacerbates periodontitis, and amplifies the severity of inflammatory complications (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burmeister et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>). While our comprehension of the regulatory mechanisms and functions of neutrophils is far from complete, current research has facilitated the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to manage chronic inflammatory disorders mediated by neutrophils, such as the inflammatory response observed in periodontitis.</p>

<title>Several lymphocyte subsets causally associated with the risk of periodontitis</title>
<p>NKT cells, a distinct fraction of T lymphocytes, are linked to the pathophysiology of a variety of inflammatory, osteolytic, and autoimmune diseases (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Godfrey et al., 2000</xref></italic></bold>). Similar to our findings, previous research revealed a greater number of NKT recruited in periodontitis tissues (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Muthukuru, 2012</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yamazaki et al., 2001</xref></italic></bold>). Several studies have demonstrated the tissue-specific function of NKT and highlighted its pathogenic role in periodontitis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aoki-Nonaka et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Melgar-Rodríguez et al., 2021</xref></italic></bold>), which may be attributed to the proinflammatory and immunoregulatory activities mediated by NKT, spanning from cytokine production to immune cell interactions (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Seidel et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>In addition, our study identified a convoluted causal relationship between pDC and periodontitis. Dendritic Cells, as specialized antigen-presenting cells, play a crucial role in the modulation of the host immune response and may be related to bone loss during periodontitis (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">El-Awady et al., 2022</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ginesin et al., 2023</xref></italic></bold>). In response to viral encounters and infection, pDC represents a unique subgroup of DC that releases type I interferon (IFN) (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jego et al., 2003</xref></italic></bold>). However, pDC is only discovered in a tiny percentage of healthy oral tissues, and there remains a dearth of relevant clinical research (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Meghil and Cutler, 2020</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wilensky et al., 2014</xref></italic></bold>). The involvement of pDC in periodontitis deserves further investigation.</p>

<title>Systemic immunomodulation management for immune cells serves as a target for periodontal care</title>
<p>Periodontitis is a damaging inflammatory disease induced and exacerbated by the plaque biofilm and host immune response (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Moutsopoulos and Konkel, 2018</xref></italic></bold>). The systemic immune response comprises both innate and adaptive immunity, with numerous cytokines, immune cells, and inflammatory pathways interacting in a complex crosstalk during periodontitis, hinting that immunomodulation management may be an essential target for periodontal care (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dutzan et al., 2016</xref></italic></bold>; <bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hajishengallis, 2014</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

Modulation of systemic host immune responses is particularly appropriate for predicting the progression and severity of periodontitis in persons whose periodontal condition is only slightly correlated with dental plaque (<bold><italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Divaris et al., 2020</xref></italic></bold>). MR contributes a novel approach to the investigation of systemic immunological alternations in periodontitis.

<p>Our present study highlighted five genes (<italic>USP3</italic>, <italic>AMFR</italic>, <italic>HERC1</italic>, <italic>CC2D2B</italic>, and <italic>RP11-326C3.7</italic>) that may play a pivotal role in the communication between circulating neutrophils, pDC, NKT, and periodontitis, as well as two high confidence genes (<italic>S100A9</italic>, <italic>S100A12</italic>) situated within 1q21.3 as prospective gene targets for regulating circulating neutrophils during periodontitis. Our findings could pave the way for a novel preventive and therapeutic approach to modifying the systemic immunological equilibrium in periodontitis patients by modulating circulating immune cells. These findings may enable the prediction of individuals at risk of periodontitis through screening certain immune imbalances, which might then be employed to specifically prevent periodontitis and related inflammatory comorbidities, particularly in patients with systemic susceptibility factors.</p>

<title>Strengths and limitations in the present study</title>
<p>The present study exhibited several strengths. First, under the premise of three key assumptions, MR is a powerful tool for explaining the relationship between complicated features (such as circulating immune cells) by successfully mitigating the effect of probable confounders and allowing for reasonable causal order. Second, a rigorous quality control process was conducted in accordance with the STROBE-MR checklist in multiple domains, including IVs selection, heterogeneity investigations, and removal of pleiotropic loci. Third, we adopted a series of sensitivity tests and MVMR to rule out the impact of outlier, influential, or pleiotropic SNPs. Fourth, a novel method based on nonlinear Bayesian averaging was applied to explore the causal drivers of disease risk from a set of high-throughput risk factors. Finally, TWAS was used in conjunction with MR to identify achievable regulatory gene targets for periodontal care.</p>
<p>However, some limitations should be addressed when interpreting the results. To begin with, a scarcity of GWAS databases hampered more comprehensive and precise analyses. As a result, we were unable to evaluate the impact of immune cells on distinct subsets of periodontal illnesses (such as gingival recession, and periodontal abscess) or ethnic groups (such as East Asian and African). Second, the primary results from the IVW method were not stable across all alternative analyses, nor were they replicated within subgroups, implying that the findings had limited evidentiary power. Third, the considerable variation in sample size between the two exposure databases contributes to the discrepancies in the number of positive SNPs. Despite our exploration of multiple selection thresholds for IVs, the inconsistency in screening methods and the discrepancy in the included SNPs could potentially introduce bias. Fourth, none of the results satisfied the Bonferroni correction (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05/17 traits = 0.003), which may have inflated the rate of type I errors. Fifth, in spite of our best attempts to minimize potential confounding factors, interferences from unobserved pleiotropies could not be completely ruled out. Fifth, we relied on the whole blood data For FUSION algorithm due to the lack of transcriptome data associated with oral tissues (such as gums, oral mucosa, and alveolar bone) in the GTEx database. This has led to an excessive focus on systemic immunological changes, thereby overlooking the significance of alterations in local periodontal tissue immunity. Such an oversight could potentially compromise the precision and pertinence of our research findings. Sixth, in addition to quantities, function abnormalities (such as dysregulation or hyperactivity) of circulating immune cells may also be related to the susceptibility and severity of periodontitis, however our research failed to address this issue. Seventh, while the majority of immune cells in gingival crevicular fluid are derived from blood, the amount of circulating immune cells is influenced by more intricate factors, which may challenge the current causal inference. Finally, since MR evaluates causal inference from the standpoint of genetic variations, it may not always correspond exactly to fact.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, the present study provides suggestive evidence of the causal associations of genetically predicted circulating neutrophils, Natural Killer T cells, and plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells on the risk of periodontitis, which shed light on the involvement of systemic immunological alterations in periodontitis etiology. Our findings may provide an innovative and evidence-based framework for the prospect of systemic immunomodulation management in periodontal care, which can be valuable for early diagnostics, risk assessment, targeted prevention, and personalized management of periodontitis, especially for patients with systemic susceptibility factors. However, the effect estimation discovered in our study was marginal, prompting caution when transferring to clinical practice. More studies are required to comprehend the biological plausibility and clinical applicability of our findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Ye et al. used Mendelian randomization method to evaluate the causative association between circulating immune cells and periodontitis and finally screened out three risk immune cells related to periodontitis. Overall, this is an important and novel piece of work that has the potential to contribute to our understanding of the causal relationship between circulating immune cells related to periodontitis. However, there are still some concerns that need to be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the constructive feedback from the editor and reviewers, which has been instrumental in enhancing the quality of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The authors used 1e-9 as the threshold to select effective instrumental variables (IVs), which should give the corresponding references. Meanwhile, the authors should test and discuss the potential impact of inconsistent thresholds for exposure (1e-9, 5e-6 were selected by the author respectively) and outcome IVs (5e-8) on the robustness of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments. We have selected two GWAS databases as the data sources for the exposure group: the BCC Consortium with a sample size of 563,946, and the Sardinian cohort of 3,757. The considerable disparity in sample size between them may result in variations in outcomes, primarily showcased in the differences in positive SNP numbers. We, therefore, adopted an unconventional (non 5e-8) yet rigorously controlled screening strategy, an approach that is widely accepted in MR studies (Li et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). We believe that the present thresholds are sufficiently rigorous to guarantee the validity of the subsequent Mendelian randomization analysis.</p>
<p>However, employing two distinct methods in exposure screening is not typical, and we posit that this method can be viewed as an innovative strategy, providing a reference for future research dealing with two databases with significant discrepancies (Huang et al., 2023; Kong et al., 2023). As you perceptively noted, we acknowledge that this strategy may exert a certain influence on the research outcomes, and we have factored this potential limitation into our manuscript. “Third, the considerable variation in sample size between the two exposure databases contributes to the discrepancies in the number of positive SNPs. Despite our exploration of multiple selection thresholds for IVs, the inconsistency in screening methods and the discrepancy in the included SNPs could potentially introduce bias.” (Page 14)</p>
<p>As for the &quot;outcome IVs with 5e-8&quot; you mentioned, we didn't implement this screening threshold in the outcome IVs. Indeed, we applied the same screening criteria as specified at 5e-06 (refer to Stable 2). Is the statement that you're referring to the following: &quot;Additionally, SNPs that displayed a direct association with the outcome would also be excluded to uphold the third MR assumption (P &lt; 5e-8)&quot; (Page 6)? In this context, we adopted a standard criterion in the IVs screening process to remove SNPs directly associated with the outcome.</p>

<p>(2) What is the reference for selecting Smoking, Fasting plasma glucose, and BMI as covariates? They do not seem to be directly related to immune cells as confounding factors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The variables of Smoking, Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), and Body Mass Index (BMI) are commonly used as covariates in multivariable Mendelian randomization studies (Kong et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). The association between Smoking, FPG, and BMI with immune cells may not be immediately apparent. However, these factors have been identified as potential confounders that could impact overall health, which in turn may indirectly modulate systemic immune responses, susceptibility, and inflammation.</p>
<p>(1) . Smoking: It has been well-documented that smoking can cause inflammation and impair immune function, thereby increasing individual's susceptibility to infections and diseases (Shiels et al., 2014). As such, smoking is recognized as a covariate that could potentially influence the outcomes of an investigation into immune cells.</p>
<p>(2) FPG: Elevated FPG levels indicate poor glycemic control, potentially leading to conditions like diabetes (Choi et al., 2018). Consequently, studies have demonstrated that elevated FPG levels can compromise the immune system's ability to combat infections.</p>
<p>(3) BMI: It is a measure of body fat that takes into account a person's weight and height. Both obesities, characterized by a high BMI, and underweights, characterized by a low BMI, have been associated with a range of health issues, inclusive of a compromised immune system (Piñeiro-Salvador et al., 2022). Consequently, BMI is factored in as a covariate in this study.</p>
<p>We have thus incorporated these factors as covariates in our study to mitigate their potential confounding effects. The selection of these covariates is primarily guided by previous research and established knowledge concerning the potential influences on immune function. We appreciate your query and will ensure to clarify this point in our revised manuscript. “We have incorporated covariates, including the number of cigarettes smoked, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, and body mass index (BMI) into the MVMR analysis, given that these factors could indirectly affect systemic immune responses and inflammation (Liu et al., 2023).” (Page 6-7)</p>

<p>(3) It is not entirely clear about the correction of P-value for the total number of independent statistical tests.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our study, we used the Bonferroni correction to adjust the P-values for multiple comparisons. The adjusted P-value is calculated as the original P-value times the total number of independent statistical tests. Specifically, we applied multiple corrections in the following two aspects: First, we corrected the results of the FUSION algorithm in TWAS, with a correction value of P &lt; 6.27 ×10-6 (0.05/7,890 genes) (Page 8). Second, we performed multiple corrections on the initial results of MR (P &lt; 0.05/17 traits = 0.003). However, none of the results met the criteria after the correction, which is one of the limitations detailed in the discussion section of our study (Page 14).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The author used whole blood data to apply FUSION algorithm. Although whole blood is a representative site, the authors should add FUSION testing of periodontally relevant tissues, such as oral mucosa.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful comments and suggestions. We concur that employing periodontally relevant tissues, like oral mucosa, for FUSION testing might yield more precise and pertinent results. However, in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) database, we could not find transcriptome data related to oral tissues, such as gums, oral mucosa, and alveolar bone (Review Table 1). Owing to the limitations of the database, in the context of our study, we primarily relied on whole blood data, given its availability and the extensive precedent documented in the literature for its utilization (Xu et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2022).</p>
<p>We acknowledge that this is a limitation of our study and will certainly consider incorporating periodontally relevant tissues in our future research. In the revised manuscript, we have explicitly stated this limitation and underscored the necessity for additional studies to corroborate our findings with periodontally relevant tissues. Fifth, we relied on the whole blood data For FUSION algorithm due to the lack of transcriptome data associated with oral tissues (such as gums, oral mucosa, and alveolar bone) in the GTEx database. “Fifth, we relied on the whole blood data For FUSION algorithm due to the lack of transcriptome data associated with oral tissues (such as gums, oral mucosa, and alveolar bone) in the GTEx database. This has led to an excessive focus on systemic immunological changes, thereby overlooking the significance of alterations in local periodontal tissue immunity. Such an oversight could potentially compromise the precision and pertinence of our research findings.” (Page 15)</p>

<p>(5) The authors chose gingival hyperplasia as a secondary validation phenotype of periodontitis in this study. However, gingival recession, as another important phenotype associated with periodontitis, should also be tested and discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful feedback highlighting the significance of incorporating gingival recession as a phenotype in periodontitis studies. Our emphasis on gingival hyperplasia in the study was primarily dictated by the initial study design and the data available from FinnGen R9K11. Notwithstanding the lack of gingival recession data in the available databases, we identified chronic gingivitis data in an earlier version of the Finnish database (FinnGen R5K11) as an alternative. We performed a Mendelian Randomization analysis on this dataset, with the results integrated into Supplementary Table 10. Concurrently, Table 1, Supplementary Table 1, Figure 4, and the corresponding descriptions in the manuscript were updated. We trust this adjustment can address the limitations identified in our research. We are confident that this not only augments the comprehensiveness of our study but also fosters a more holistic comprehension of periodontal disease.</p>

<p>(6) This study used GLIDE data as a replicated validation, but the results were inconsistent with FinnGen's dataset.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments and for bringing this issue to our attention. Indeed, it is of utmost importance to ensure the validity and reliability of our findings across various datasets. The observed inconsistency between the GLIDE data and FinnGen's dataset could be attributed to several reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, this discrepancy might originate from the differences in population composition. The former is grounded on a comprehensive meta-analysis of cohorts focusing on periodontitis, whereas the latter utilizes a dataset from a full-phenotype cohort. In the former, the ratio of periodontitis to the control groups is approximately 1:2. In contrast, the ratio in the latter seems to be minuscule. The sample size in the FinnGen data may not suffice to detect the effects observed in the GLIDE dataset, given that larger exposure sizes enhance the ability to detect genuine associations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the heterogeneity of periodontitis can potentially result in variable outcomes. Phenotypic definition methods differ between the two databases. The GLIDE database diagnoses based on the criteria of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/American Academy of Periodontology (CDC/AAP) and Community Periodontal Index (CPI) for physical signs. While the FinnGen database adopts the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 standard for a comprehensive diagnosis. The former database employs a more practical yet broader standard for periodontitis, which might encompass pseudo-periodontitis.</p>
<p>Finally, the observed differences could be attributed to the variations in immune responses at distinct stages of periodontitis. During the initial stages of periodontitis, neutrophils and macrophages primarily mediate the immune response. With the progression of the disease, the involvement of T cells and B cells increases, thereby leading to a more intricate immune response (Darveau, 2010). Besides, the immune system's response to these oral health conditions is not uniform and can be influenced by multiple factors, including the individual's overall health, genetics, and lifestyle, potentially impacting the results (Hung et al., 2023).</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Line 78-80: &quot;As reported, the number of immune cells in periodontal tissue changes as periodontitis progresses, featuring an increase in monocytes, and B cells and a decrease in T cells.&quot; Does the author mean that both monocytes and B cells increase as periodontitis progresses?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for your meticulous reading and perceptive inquiries. We would like to confirm the accuracy of your understanding. In lines 78-80, our intended message was to communicate that with the progression of periodontitis, there is an increase in both monocytes and B cells in the periodontal tissue. This represents a typical immune response to the infection, where these cells play a pivotal role in counteracting periodontal pathogens. To enhance clarity, we have revised these lines in the manuscript as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;With the progression of periodontitis, there is a significant alteration in the quantity of immune cells present within the periodontal tissue. Specifically, an increase in the count of both monocytes and B cells is observed, whereas a decrease is noted in the count of T cells.&quot; (Page 3)</p>

<p>Table 1: FinnGen has a greater sample size and more SNPs than GLIDE; why do authors choose the latter as the primary analysis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our choice to utilize GLIDE as the primary analysis tool, instead of FinnGen, was mainly guided by the specific research question we aimed to address. Despite FinnGen offering a larger sample size and more SNPs, GLIDE offers a more specialized and targeted dataset that suits the unique requirements of our study. In most MR studies, a similar strategy is adopted, wherein a large database of disease GWAS meta is utilized for exploration, followed by validation in full phenotype cohort (such as UKBiobank and FinnGen) (Liu et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023). To summarize, the reasons may primarily include the following:</p>
<p>Firstly, GLIDE offers a concentrated and targeted methodology for examining genetic data pertinent to periodontitis. This dataset is grounded in a comprehensive meta-analysis of cohorts centered on periodontitis, wherein the ratio of periodontitis cases to control groups is approximately 1:2. Conversely, the proportion in FinnGen seems to be negligible, given that it employs a dataset derived from a comprehensive phenotype cohort. Consequently, employing the GLIDE database as a primary investigative tool can generate more abundant genetic information associated with periodontitis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the methodological facets of GLIDE align more accurately with the analytical framework of our study. For instance, the diagnostic criteria methods vary between the two databases. The GLIDE database derives its basis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/American Academy of Periodontology (CDC/AAP) and Community Periodontal Index (CPI) for physical indicators. In contrast, the FinnGen database employs the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 standard for an exhaustive diagnosis. The former adopts a more pragmatic, yet broader, standard for diagnosing periodontitis. The latter continues to use concepts of diseases such as &quot;chronic periodontitis&quot;, which have been replaced by &quot;periodontitis&quot; in the latest disease classification from the &quot;2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions&quot; in the periodontal field (Caton et al., 2018).</p>

<p>Line 224: &quot;The observed significant results remained robust after removing pleiotropic SNPs.&quot; It is not clear what the authors mean by &quot;remain robust&quot;.</p>
<p>Line 229-231: &quot;The causal relationship between neutrophils and periodontitis remained stable with no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy.&quot; It is also not clear what the authors mean by &quot;remain stable&quot;. How does the author get to the conclusion that there is no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy?</p>

<p>Line 224: We apologize for the confusion caused by the term &quot;remain robust&quot;. In the revised manuscript, we clarified this by stating, &quot;The observed significant results are considered 'robust' if the effect of sensitivity analyses was identical to that of Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) method, yielding a P-value less than 0.05.&quot; (Page 6)</p>
<p>Line 229-231: We used the terms &quot;remain stable&quot; and &quot;remain robust&quot; interchangeably to express the same idea. To clarify, we have now unified the expression in the revised manuscript. As for the conclusion of &quot;no evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy&quot;, it is derived from the results of Cochran's Q and Egger's intercept tests (P&lt;0.05). We have added this explanation to the revised manuscript for better clarity.</p>
<p>Figure S5: In the revised manuscript and Table, we have provided a succinct explanation regarding the investigation of outliers or influential changes as follows: &quot; A genetic variant was defined as either an outlier or an influential variant if it possessed a q-value exceeding 10 or if its Cook's distance surpassed the median of the corresponding F-distribution. &quot; (Page 7)</p>
<p>We have made all the necessary changes in the revised manuscript based on your comments. We hope our responses and revisions adequately address your concerns.</p>

<p>We appreciate your valuable feedback and the additional references you provided to enrich our manuscript. Upon receiving your comments, we have meticulously reviewed and incorporated the suggested literature into our revised manuscript. These references have furnished insightful information, which has been assimilated into the revised manuscript (Page 12) to enhance the explanation of the mechanisms of neutrophil-mediated inflammation and the potential association between periodontitis and inflammatory comorbidities.</p>
<p>&quot;The quantity and functionality of neutrophils both act as critical indicators of inflammation severity. The reduction in neutrophil count and inflammatory mediators, observed after successful periodontitis treatment, suggests a reduction in systemic inflammation (Hajishengallis , 2022).&quot; (Page 12)</p>
<p>&quot;Trained myeloid cells have the potential to amplify the functionality of neutrophils, thereby fortifying the body's defense against subsequent infections. Nevertheless, within the framework of chronic inflammation, these cells could potentially intensify tissue damage (Hajishengallis and Chavakis, 2022).&quot; (Page 12)</p>
