<title>Summary</title><p>The epithelial cell sheet maintains its integrity as a barrier while undergoing turnover of constituent cells. To sustain the barrier continuously, it’s essential to preserve the ‘old’ tight junctions (TJs) between cells being excluded from the sheet and their neighbors while simultaneously forming <italic>de novo</italic> TJs between newly adjacent cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of <italic>de novo</italic> TJs remain largely unknown. This study investigates two scenarios: the formation of <italic>de novo</italic> TJs during the removal of apoptotic cells from monolayer epithelial sheets and during the differentiation of the granular layer in stratified epidermis. We revealed that rapid claudin assembly is achieved by actively regulating the dissociation of the EpCAM/TROP2-claudin complex in both situations. Furthermore, we found that the Rho-ROCK pathway initiates the activation of matriptase, which cleaves EpCAM/TROP2, resulting in the supply of polymerizable claudin from the stockpiled EpCAM/TROP2-claudin complex at the plasma membrane to induce rapid <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We made substantial revisions to strengthen our conclusions regarding the Rho/ROCK-mediated activation of matriptase and its role in tight junction (TJ) formation. To directly demonstrate matriptase activation, we performed additional western blotting and immunostaining using the M69 antibody, which specifically detects the active form of matriptase. These experiments revealed a marked increase in matriptase activation upon Rho/ROCK activation and during keratinocyte differentiation. We also quantified TROP2 cleavage and showed that it correlates temporally with matriptase activation. To address concerns that impaired TJ formation might be a secondary effect of disrupted differentiation, we evaluated adherens junction (AJ) maturation using the α18 antibody, which detects tension-sensitive α-catenin. We found that AJ maturation proceeded normally under matriptase inhibition, whereas TJ formation was selectively impaired, indicating a specific requirement for matriptase in TJ assembly. Minor revisions included the addition of orthogonal views, clarification of figure legends, inclusion of quantifications for all relevant western blots, and the addition of missing methodological details such as the GST-Rhotekin assay. We also incorporated data from Hai1-overexpressing cells and clarified the localization of matriptase during differentiation. Finally, we corrected minor textual inaccuracies and improved clarity throughout the manuscript. These revisions collectively reinforce the conclusion that Rho/ROCK signaling activates matriptase to cleave EpCAM and TROP2, thereby liberating Claudins for de novo TJ formation in epithelial cells.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The surfaces of our body and its organs are covered by epithelial cell sheets, which serve to prevent the entry of antigens and pathogens from the outside and the leakage of substances such as water and glucose from the body <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This barrier function is achieved through the close attachment of the plasma membranes of neighboring epithelial cells by intercellular adhesion structures called tight junctions (TJs). The major component of TJs is claudin, a four trans membrane protein of around 25 kDa. Claudin binds in <italic>cis</italic> on the plasma membrane and in <italic>trans</italic> between neighboring cells, forming a membrane structure called TJ strands <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In both simple epithelia, such as the gastrointestinal tract, and stratified epithelia, such as skin, the barrier is continuously maintained by various mechanisms that regulate the homeostasis of the epithelial cell sheet, including the wound healing response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. For example, unnecessary inflammatory responses are suppressed by mechanisms that rapidly eliminate apoptotic cells generated by constant cell turnover or exposure to external stresses in the epithelial cell sheet <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. During the process of apoptotic cell extrusion, the apoptotic cells are physically pushed towards the apical side by an increase in actomyosin contractility of cells adjacent to the apoptotic cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The barrier function of the epithelial sheet is maintained during this process of apical extrusion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In parallel with rapid apoptotic cell elimination, it is necessary to maintain integrity of TJs between apoptotic cells and neighboring cells, while rapidly forming <italic>de novo</italic> TJs between newly adjacent cells that result from apoptotic cell elimination. However, the mechanism for the formation of such rapid <italic>de novo</italic> TJs is largely unknown.</p>
<p>In the epidermis, TJs form only between keratinocytes in the granular layer and act as a barrier separating the inside and outside of the body. Claudin-1 knockout mice die within a day of birth due to abnormal stratum corneum differentiation and disrupted granular layer barrier function, resulting in severe dehydration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In the epidermis, stem cells in the basal layer divide to give rise to new keratinocytes, which differentiate towards the body surface into keratinocytes constituting the spinous layer, granular layer, and stratum corneum, forming a multilayered epithelium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. TJs are only formed in the second layer of the granular layer (SG2), even though claudin is also expressed in cells of the basal and spinous layers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In the turnover of keratinocytes in the SG2 layer, the epidermal barrier is continuously maintained by the simultaneous formation of ‘new’ TJs between newly differentiating SG2 keratinocytes and pre-existing SG2 keratinocytes, before the ‘old’ TJs between SG2 keratinocytes that are differentiating into keratinocytes of the stratum corneum and neighboring SG2 keratinocytes are lost <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. It has recently been reported that an E-cadherin-dependent increase of intercellular tension at adherens junctions (AJs) and inhibition of EGFR activity are required for induction of TJ formation in the SG2 layer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. However, how these E-cadherin-mediated changes regulate TJ formation in the SG2 layer and why TJs are never formed in keratinocytes other than the SG2 layer that express claudin remain open questions.</p>
<p>The formation of <italic>de novo</italic> tight junctions, which is common in these two phenomena, is rapid, suggesting that the formation of functional TJs is not regulated through <italic>de novo</italic> transcription or translation of claudin, but rather by controlling the polymerization state of claudin. In heterogeneous cells, such as L cells and COS-7 cells, forced expression of claudin alone is known to be sufficient to induce TJ formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. On the other hand, in the lateral membranes of simple epithelial cells and keratinocytes, excess claudin is present in an unpolymerized. The molecular mechanisms that strictly regulate restrict the polymerization of claudin at the presumptive TJ region are largely unknown.</p>
<p>Recently, a single transmembrane protein, EpCAM, was identified as an interacting protein of claudin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. EpCAM binds to claudin in the lateral membrane of epithelial cells through the interactions between transmembrane regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. By binding to EpCAM, claudin is stabilized at the plasma membrane, preventing it from being endocytosed and degraded <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Knockout of EpCAM in cultured cells does not affect claudin accumulation at TJs but selectively reduced claudin in the lateral membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Another single transmembrane protein, TROP2, which shows 67% similarity in amino acid sequence to EpCAM, also binds to claudin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In the small intestine, only EpCAM is expressed, while in the epidermis, both EpCAM and TROP2 are expressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In humans, loss-of-function mutations in the EpCAM gene cause a disruption in the barrier function of gastrointestinal epithelial cells, resulting in congenital tufted enteropathy (CTE), characterized by chronic diarrhea and growth delay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. EpCAM knockout mice also show similar phenotypes and die within two weeks after birth <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Similarly, TROP2 is the causative gene for human gelatinous drop-like corneal dystrophy (GDLD), which causes photophobia and vision loss due to amyloid deposition under the corneal epithelium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. This is because the barrier function of the corneal epithelium is impaired due to TROP2 dysfunction, allowing lactoferrin and apolipoproteins in the tear fluid to penetrate and form amyloid deposits. It was also recently shown that the epidermal barrier function is impaired in TROP2 KO mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>EpCAM and TROP2 are cleaved in their extracellular regions by matriptase, a transmembrane serine protease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Cleavage of EpCAM disrupts the EpCAM-claudin complex, releasing making available unpolymerized claudin for TJ formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Higashi et al. proposed the physiological significance of this molecular mechanism, suggesting that when TJs are locally disrupted, serine proteases on the apical side shift their localization to the basolateral side and cleave EpCAM at the basolateral membrane, releasing unpolymerized claudin to repair TJs. In other words, local disruption of TJs allows passive translocation of proteases due to the partial loss of the fence function of TJs, leading to the breakdown of the EpCAM-claudin complex. In this study, we examined in detail the regulation of the EpCAM-claudin complex in the mechanisms to induce <italic>de novo</italic> TJs during the elimination of apoptotic cells and turnover of the SG2 layer of the epidermis.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Rapid <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation occurs during apoptotic cell elimination in a Rho-ROCK pathway-dependent manner</title>
<p>The pioneering work by Rosenblatt and colleagues established that the barrier function of the epithelial cell sheet is preserved even in the face of a mass cell death event triggered by acute UV irradiation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. This observation suggests that the epithelium is capable of removing apoptotic cells while maintaining the continuity of TJs uninterrupted. However, the complex logistics of simultaneously breaking down the TJ between apoptotic and neighbor cells and assembling them anew between formally non-interacting cells is not sufficiently known. We first examined claudin dynamics among relevant cells during apoptotic cell elimination in order to understand how these incongruous processes are carried out. Apoptosis was induced in a confluent monolayer of a representative epithelial cell line EpH4 stably expressing GFP-claudin-3 by pulsed laser irradiation of the nucleus in a targeted cell. Apical extrusion of the apoptotic cell and bicellular accumulation of claudin between newly-formed contacts were typically observed over the course of an hour (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video1">Movie 1</xref>). Throughout, GFP-claudin-3 remained enriched to some degree between the apoptotic and neighbor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, purple arrowheads</xref>).</p>

<p>Additionally, linear accumulation of GFP-claudin-3 could be observed more basally by about 40 min post-irradiation and steadily grew more pronounced over time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, green arrowheads</xref>).</p>
<p>Immunofluorescence staining showed that other TJ proteins, such as ZO-1 and occludin, colocalize with the basally-enriched claudin, indicating the <italic>de novo</italic> formation of functional TJs between the newly neighboring cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, green arrowheads</xref>) before the complete loss of the apoptotic cell-neighbor cell TJs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, purple arrowheads</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that old and new TJs exist concurrently among the cells involved in apoptotic cell removal to ensure that there is no period of TJ absence that could compromise the epithelial barrier.</p>
<p>Previous studies have established that RhoA is activated in the neighbor cells at the interface with the apoptotic cell to enhance the contractility of the actomyosin purse string that extrudes the apoptotic cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. RhoA is also required for the maturation of epithelial cell adhesions through its effect on the underlying circumferential actomyosin and recent reports implicate it in the repair of TJ microinjuries <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We therefore hypothesized that RhoA could play a role in the rapid <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation such as we see during apoptotic cell removal. Observation of active RhoA in neighbor cells using an effector domain biosensor (GFP-AnillinC) showed sustained activation at the apoptotic cell-neighbor cell interface as previously reported (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video2">Movie 2, white arrowheads</xref>). Importantly, RhoA activity persisted at newly formed cell contacts after full expulsion of the apoptotic cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, yellow arrowheads</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, immunostaining revealed phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (ppMLC), a substrate of the RhoA effector ROCK, at such contacts that are clearly located beneath the extruded cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These data collectively point to the presence of an active pool of RhoA at the new TJs.</p>
<p>Apoptotic cells rapidly contract, causing the neighbor cells to extend lamellipodia, which acts to seal the basal surface. Since contact between protrusions from separated cells is necessary to initiate adhesion formation, we wondered if these lamellipodia alone, previously shown to be independent of both the Rho-ROCK pathway and myosin contractility, could instigate claudin enrichment at newly formed contacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. By imaging the plasma membrane (mScarlet-PLCδ PH) together with GFP-claudin-3 under ROCK inhibition, we found that claudin no longer accumulated at bicellular contacts once the old apoptotic cell-neighbor cell TJs broke down, despite the completion of basal closure by neighbor cell lamellipodia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video3">Movie 3</xref>). This observation suggests that <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation is impaired by ROCK inhibition. Accordingly, inducing mass apoptosis in the epithelial monolayer by treatment with the anticancer drug doxorubicin caused a significant increase in the leakage of 70 kDa FITC-Dextran when ROCK was simultaneously inhibited, compared to the control condition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Signaling through Rho-ROCK is clearly required for apical extrusion, since the apoptotic cell typically remained loosely embedded in the cell sheet. However, these results collectively hint that its importance in epithelial barrier homeostasis associated with apoptotic cell removal is not limited to this process: it is also critically important for claudin enrichment and/or engagement at new cell-cell contacts, the failure of which precludes the <italic>de novo</italic> formation of TJs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>De novo</italic> TJ formation in epidermis requires activation of the Rho-ROCK pathway</title>
<p>Given the technical difficulty in independently assessing the contribution of the Rho-ROCK pathway in the two intertwined events arising in cells neighboring an apoptotic cell—increased contractility to effect apical extrusion and <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation to maintain the epithelial barrier—we chose to investigate its involvement in the context of <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation in keratinocyte differentiation. The human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT differentiates into granular-like cells capable of forming TJs when cultured for 24 hours in a medium supplemented with high concentration of calcium ion (9.8 mM) and a JNK inhibitor (Ca + JNK inh medium) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.

<p>Accordingly, in differentiated HaCaT cells, the actin cytoskeleton was re-organized to form the circumferential actin ring associated with apical junctions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, F-actin). The morphological changes observed here align well with those seen in differentiated keratinocytes of the SG2 layer <italic>in vivo</italic>. Of note, western blotting revealed that there was no significant difference in claudin-1 expression level before and after differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, in the mouse ear epidermis, claudin-1 was present across the entire plasma membrane in the spinous layers before differentiation into the SG2 layer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Altogether, these observations suggest the existence of a regulatory mechanism that specifically instigates <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation in keratinocytes of the SG2 layer, independent of transcriptional and/or translational control.</p>
<p>We then hypothesized the involvement of the Rho-ROCK pathway in <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation associated with keratinocyte differentiation, similar to its role in <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation during apoptotic cell elimination in monolayer epithelial cells. First, we investigated whether RhoA is activated during keratinocyte differentiation. We detected a significant increase in RhoA activation upon differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). In differentiated HaCaT cells, phosphorylated MLCs were prominently observed at cell-cell contacts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Similarly, in the mouse epidermis, ppMLC was notably enhanced only at apical junctions of keratinocytes in the SG2 layer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). These findings indicate an augmented Rho-ROCK pathway in keratinocytes of the granular layer during differentiation, consistent with a previous report that junctional tension is necessary for TJ formation in the granular layer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We next examined whether activation of the Rho-ROCK pathway during differentiation is necessary for the formation of <italic>de novo</italic> TJs upon keratinocyte differentiation. When ROCK activity was inhibited by treatment with Y27632, claudin remained uniformly distributed across the entire plasma membrane, indicating impairment of TJ formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). In contrast, E-cadherin signals at apical junctions was not affected by ROCK inhibition in differentiated HaCaT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). As we saw in monolayer layer epithelia, these results suggest that Rho-ROCK signaling specifically regulates <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation in differentiating keratinocytes of the stratified epithelia by enabling claudin enrichment at intercellular adhesions, i.e. shifting claudin from an unpolymerized state in the basolateral membrane to a polymerized state in TJ strands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>

<title>Activation of ROCK alone can induce TJ formation in undifferentiated keratinocytes</title>
<p>Then how does the Rho-ROCK pathway regulate the polymerization state of claudin? Since HaCaT cells already abundantly express claudins prior to differentiation, we wondered if activation of RhoA or ROCK alone could induce <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation in the absence of differentiation factors.</p>
<p>Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of RhoA (Q61L, RhoA CA) led to the accumulation of claudin-3 at cell-cell contacts but only when both cells expressed RhoA CA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). By contrast, claudin-3 enrichment was not observed in cells expressing the other main Rho family GTPases, Rac1 and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2A</xref>). Importantly, additional TJ components, such as ZO-1 and the transmembrane protein occludin, were recruited to claudin-enriched cell-cell contacts and actin reorganization was also observed, indicating that these structures were highly TJ-like (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Moreover, activation of endogenous RhoA by treatment with the bacterial toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor (Rho activator; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>), overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of ROCK (ROCKdelC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2B</xref>) and treatment with the ROCK activator Narciclasine also induced strong accumulation of claudin-3 in undifferentiated HaCaT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4G</xref>) to further support the proposition that signaling through RhoA-ROCK enables claudin polymerization.

<p>We previously showed that polymerized claudin is preferentially partitioned into detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) enriched in cholesterol and very long-chain fatty acid-containing sphingomyelin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Since both Rho activator and Narciclasine treatments can efficiently enrich claudin at cell-cell contacts, we next evaluated the polymerization state of claudin in treated cells biochemically. Rho activator and Narciclasine treatments markedly increased the amount of claudin-1 partitioned into the DRM fraction compared to the control condition. In contrast, in undifferentiated HaCaT cells, most of claudin-1 was solubilized by detergents, reflecting that claudin is present in an unpolymerized state in undifferentiated HaCaT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4H and I</xref>). These findings altogether indicate that activation of the Rho-ROCK pathway induces the transition of claudin from an unpolymerized state to a polymerized state.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Matriptase activation by Rho-ROCK produces a pool of polymerizable claudin via TROP2 cleavage</title>
<p>Having established that signaling through Rho-ROCK triggers claudin polymerization, we next asked what the mechanism is. The single transmembrane proteins EpCAM and TROP2 bind to claudin and are abundantly expressed in epithelial cells and keratinocytes. They are thought to protect unpolymerized claudin from degradation to maintain a stable reserve apart from the TJ strand <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This prompted us to consider whether they could play a greater role, not only in protecting unpolymerized claudin from degradation but also in inhibiting unregulated claudin polymerization by interfering with the interaction between claudins. Matriptase, a transmembrane serine protease, cleaves the extracellular region of EpCAM and TROP2 to sever their interaction with claudin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. It was recently reported that, of the two, TROP2 plays a greater role in the epidermis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Therefore, we reasoned that Rho-ROCK signaling releases TROP2-bound claudin by activating matriptase.</p>
<p>Matriptase is normally present at the plasma membrane in an inactive state but it is activated by autocleavage in response to external signals. After cleavage of the substrate, the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor family proteins Hai1 and Hai2 immediately bind to matriptase to block its activity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The extracellular region of the matriptase-Hai complex is then cleaved and released from the cell (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, illustration</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. To assess the activation state of Matriptase, we employed two mouse monoclonal antibodies: M24, which detects total Matriptase protein levels, and M69, which specifically recognizes the activated form of matriptase. These antibodies have been widely used in previous studies on matriptase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. One such study showed that matriptase is activated by simply placing cells in an acidic medium at pH 6.0 for 20 minutes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Addition of acid medium to undifferentiated HaCaT cells decreased the total amount of matriptase and increased the amount of cleaved TROP2 compared to the control, indicating that matriptase is activated and cleaves TROP2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This was accompanied by claudin accumulation at cell-cell contacts and an increase in insoluble, i.e. polymerized, claudin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5C</xref>-<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). In an intriguing contrast to the results of Rho-ROCK activation by pharmacological means (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>) where we saw development of junction-associated F-actin and AJ maturation simultaneous with claudin polymerization, neither was observed here (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). This observation suggests that bypassing Rho-ROCK and activating matriptase directly is sufficient to induce claudin strand assembly. However, treatment with Rho-ROCK activators increased matriptase activity and enhanced TROP2 cleavage, indicating that matriptase is a bona fide effector of Rho-ROCK signaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, inhibition of matriptase activity with Camostat treatment suppressed claudin accumulation at cell-cell contacts induced by Rho-ROCK activation, which further support the notion that activation of matriptase occurs downstream of Rho-ROCK pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that activation of matriptase by Rho-ROCK signaling liberates claudin from sequestration by TROP2 and acts as the rate limiting process in <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation; indeed, TROP2 was uniformly present throughout the plasma membrane in undifferentiated cells but it was specifically excluded from the region where claudin was polymerized between cells expressing Rho CA cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>).</p>
<p>It was previously reported that the amount of claudin-1 protein is significantly reduced TROP2-depleted keratinocytes, which we confirmed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.

Moreover, claudin-1 was most prominently found at the Golgi apparatus of TROP2 KO cells, where it was distributed throughout the plasma membrane in undifferentiated wild-type cells, only appearing intermittently there as strongly enriched dots (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). These punctate claudin-1 accumulations contained ZO-1 and occludin, indicating that claudin-1 is incorporated in a quasi-TJ state (Figure S3). In other words, claudin-1 cannot stably exist in an unpolymerized state at the plasma membrane in the absence of TROP2. As to be expected by the lack of available surface claudin, neither Rho-ROCK activation nor matriptase activation by acid medium treatment could induce claudin polymerization in TROP2 KO cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6F</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>).</p>

In wild-type keratinocytes, claudin and TROP2 form a complex in the Golgi apparatus and are subsequently transported to the plasma membrane. In contrast, in cells lacking TROP2, claudin, which cannot form a complex with TROP2, accumulates in the Golgi apparatus, leading to a significant decrease in the amount of claudin at the plasma membrane. In wild-type cells, TROP2 is cleaved by matriptase activated via the Rho-ROCK pathway. This cleavage results in the breakdown of the TROP2-claudin complex, allowing released claudins to form <italic>de novo</italic> TJs.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="612007v2_fig6.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Taken together, these findings indicate that the regulation of claudin by TROP2 is not limited to stabilizing unpolymerized claudin at the plasma membrane: it begins at the Golgi apparatus where—acting as a chaperone—it mediates proper sorting and trafficking (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>).</p>
<p>The results so far strongly suggest that the Rho-ROCK pathway enables claudin polymerization, the initial step of <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation, by activating matriptase, which frees the claudin pool sequestered by TROP2 at the lateral membrane; this is independent of its long-established effect on junctional maturation through actomyosin. We next performed a series of experiments to verify this hypothesis. First, we found that matriptase was rapidly activated in HaCaT cells introduced into the Ca+ JNKinh medium to induce differentiation; degradation of TROP2 was observed in parallel (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>).</p>

<p>Immunostaining with the M24 antibody that detects total protein revealed that matriptase is constitutively distributed along the lateral membrane, below TJs, regardless of HaCaT cell differentiation state (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). By contrast, staining with the M69 antibody, which specifically recognizes the activated form, revealed no signal in undifferentiated cells but following differentiation, activated matriptase could be widely detected at the lateral membrane (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). These observations indicate that while the subcellular localization of matriptase remains unchanged during differentiation, it undergoes activation at the lateral membrane in differentiated granular-layer-like cells.</p>
<p>We then examined HaCaT differentiation in the presence of the matriptase inhibitor Camostat. Consistent with the result of our experiment with Rho CA overexpression, claudin failed to accumulate at cell-cell junctions in Camostat-treated cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>). A previous study demonstrated that increase in intercellular tension at AJs is indispensable for the formation of TJs in the SG2 layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. To assess AJ tension, we stained with the α-18 monoclonal antibody, sensitive to the tension-dependent conformational change of α-catenin, a core AJ component. In control cells, differentiation into granular-layer-like cells led to a marked increase in α-18 signal at cell–cell adhesions. Importantly, when HaCaT cells were treated with Camostat to inhibit matriptase before induction, we observed an equivalent increase in α-18 signal at AJs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). However, we did not detect claudin enrichment at cell-cell contacts under these conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7F</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>). These results suggest that matriptase inhibition specifically disrupts TJ formation during granular-layer differentiation without impeding AJ maturation.</p>
<p>Similarly, in HaCaT cells overexpressing Hai1, an endogenous inhibitor of matriptase, TJ formation was severely suppressed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7G</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7H</xref>). Lastly, we sought to extend our findings to the granular layer differentiation of the epidermis. As in undifferentiated HaCaT cells, TROP2 was distributed throughout the plasma membrane of the spinous layer but was progressively lost within the granular layer—particularly at the SG2 layer—as TJs appeared and matured (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>). These results suggest that ROCK-dependent activation of matriptase and cleavage of TROP2 by matriptase are crucial steps in the formation of <italic>de novo</italic> TJs associated with granule cell differentiation in the epidermis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>).</p>

<title>Rho-ROCK liberates EpCAM-sequestered claudin through matriptase to enable rapid <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation during apoptotic cell elimination</title>
<p>We next investigated whether the same molecular mechanism of <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation in stratified epithelium plays a role in the homeostasis of the epithelial barrier in monolayer epithelial cells.</p>
<p>It has been established that EpCAM, rather than TROP2, regulates claudin in simple epithelium <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Therefore, we established EpCAM KO EpH4 cells. In EpCAM KO cells, the amount of claudin-1 was significantly reduced, consistent with previous studies and TROP2 depletion in HaCaT cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Immunofluorescence with the standard Triton X-100 membrane permeabilization revealed a sharp, linear localization of claudin-4 at apical junctions in EpCAM KO cells that was indistinguishable from wild-type cells, giving the appearance that TJs are formed normally under steady state condition (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). However, when the detergent was changed to digitonin, significant claudin-7 staining was observed in the lateral membranes in wild-type cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). By contrast, the lateral pool of claudin-7 was severely reduced in EpCAM KO cells; as in HaCaT cells depleted of TROP2, claudin was seen to accumulate at the Golgi apparatus instead (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8D</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8E</xref>). These results indicate that claudin transport is similarly regulated in simple epithelium and stratified epithelium by EpCAM and TROP2, respectively.</p>

<p>We then wondered whether cleavage of EpCAM by forcibly activating matriptase through treatment with acid medium would also induce <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation here. When wild-type EpH4 cells cultured on permeable supports were treated with the acid medium on the basolateral side, claudin enrichment could be observed throughout the lateral membrane in contrast to EpCAM KO cells that showed no such ectopic TJ expansion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8F</xref>). These findings suggest that, similar to stratified epithelium, cleavage of EpCAM by matriptase supplies polymerizable claudins for <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation in monolayer epithelium.</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated whether ROCK-dependent activation of matriptase and cleavage of EpCAM by matriptase is important for rapid <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation during apoptotic cell elimination. A previous study showed that EpCAM cleavage mediates TJ repair at small leakages induced by acute tension elevation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Apical extrusion of the apoptotic cell induced by pulsed laser irradiation proceeded without fail in EpCAM KO cells as in wild-type cells but the formation of <italic>de novo</italic> TJs between newly adjacent cells was never observed (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video4">Movie 4</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation after apoptosis induction was likewise suppressed in EpH4 cells treated with Camostat or overexpressing Hai1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8H, 8I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video5">Movies 5, 6</xref>). These findings support the notion that <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation occurring in parallel with apical extrusion of apoptotic cells requires the degradation of EpCAM by matriptase.</p>
<p>The rapid restoration of TJ continuity upon the elimination of apoptotic cells is crucial for epithelial barrier homeostasis. Even when apoptosis was induced by treatment with 4 μM doxorubicin, leakage of 70 kDa FITC-Dextran was not detected in control EpH4 cells, indicating the preservation of epithelial barrier integrity. In clear contrast, significant leakage of 70 kDa FITC-Dextran was detected in EpCAM KO cells and epithelial cells in which matriptase function was inhibited (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8J</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that Rho activation triggers matriptase-mediated EpCAM cleavage, which quickly introduces a supply of polymerizable claudin to enable the preservation of barrier integrity in damaged epithelial cell sheets.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this paper, we demonstrate that the rapid formation of <italic>de novo</italic> TJs observed during the elimination of apoptotic cells in simple epithelium and the differentiation of granular cells in stratified epithelium begins with the activation of the Rho-ROCK pathway and follows a common series of reactions: (1) activation of matriptase, (2) destruction of the EpCAM/TROP2-claudin complex via cleavage of EpCAM/TROP2 by activated matriptase, and (3) liberated supply of polymerizable claudin (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

In both types of epithelia, EpCAM or TROP2 is necessary for the intracellular transport of claudin from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Claudin, when in complex with EpCAM or TROP2, cannot spontaneously polymerize into TJs at the plasma membrane. However, upon activation of the Rho-ROCK pathway, which activates matriptase, EpCAM or TROP2 is cleaved by matriptase. This cleavage breaks down the EpCAM/TROP-2-claudin complex, enabling claudin to polymerize into TJs. Consequently, rapid TJ formation occurs without <italic>de novo</italic> transcription or translation.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The contribution of the Rho-ROCK pathway to the maintenance of epithelial barrier homeostasis has been explicated in various experimental contexts. It is known to increase the contractile force of cells adjacent to apoptotic cells to enable efficient apoptotic cell elimination <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, and recent research using Xenopus embryos showed that local activation of Rho (referred to as Rho Flare) upregulates the contractility of TJ-associated actomyosin at the site of TJ rupture, minimizing TJ disruption and thus barrier breach <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Here, we utilized monolayer and stratified epithelial cells, which enabled us to distinguish a novel role of signaling through Rho-ROCK, distinct from its effect on the cytoskeleton: to release the stockpiled claudin—complexed with EpCAM/TROP2—from the lateral membrane to promote rapid <italic>de novo</italic> TJ assembly. Several previous studies support our proposal. For one, overexpression of constitutively activated RhoA induces ectopic TJs at the lateral membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. For a more physiologically relevant example, hyperosmotic stress induces rapid expansion of TJs at the lateral membrane <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Considering that Rho-ROCK pathway is known to be hyper-activated by the hyperosmotic stress <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, the mechanism of supplying polymerizable claudin via the Rho-ROCK pathway is likely to contribute to the adaptive expansion of TJs to hyperosmotic stress in epithelial cells.</p>
<p>While our results make clear that the cascade of reactions leading to claudin release is triggered by Rho-ROCK-dependent activation of matriptase, the precise mechanism of this step is unclear. A previous study showed that matriptase binds the actin cross-linking protein filamin, the depletion of which severely impairs its activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is conceivable that actin reorganization associated with Rho-ROCK activation allows filamin to engage matriptase and activate it. Alternatively, Rho-ROCK may alter signaling pathways that regulate matriptase activity. Matriptase is intrinsically inhibited by Hai1; Hai1 is cleaved by the membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteases MMP14 and MMP7, which can stably activate matriptase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Notably, MMP14 is targeted to invadopodia in invasive cancer cells via RhoA-dependent exocytosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. The Rho-ROCK pathway may similarly facilitate the delivery of MMP14 and/or MMP7 to the plasma membrane to activate matriptase through Hai1 cleavage. Still another possibility involves the type II transmembrane serine protease Tmprss2, the loss of which results in a significant decrease in matriptase expression and disruption of the TJ barrier but the relationship between Rho-ROCK and Tmprss2 is unknown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Clearly, further studies are needed to elucidate how the Rho-ROCK pathway activates matriptase.</p>
<p>Our analysis focused on matriptase as the protease that cleaves EpCAM/TROP2, but other proteases that process EpCAM/TROP2 have been reported. Recently, Higashi et al. showed that membrane-anchored serine proteinases (MASPs) cleave EpCAM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>; MASPs are present at the apical surface in polarized epithelial cells. Rupture of TJs results in a partial loss of the TJ fence function, leading to a change in the localization of MASPs from the apical membrane to the lateral membrane. This allows MASPs to cleave the EpCAM-claudin complex at the lateral membrane. By contrast, we found that matriptase is always present in the lateral membrane and actively regulates <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation under the control of Rho-ROCK signaling. Whether these two pathways work independently or in parallel, or whether each of these pathway functions only in specific tissues or contexts, needs to be investigated in the future. Additionally, EpCAM is reportedly cleaved by A disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) 10 and ADAM17 but it is unknown whether this contributes to <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. In the present study, overexpression of Hai1, which specifically inhibits matriptase activity, inhibited the formation of <italic>de novo</italic> TJs in both apoptotic cell elimination and granular layer differentiation, suggesting that the primary means of freeing sequestered claudin from EpCAM/TROP2 in these contexts is through matriptase.</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that Rho-ROCK-dependent matriptase activation enables <italic>de novo</italic> TJ formation in the SG2 layer of the epidermis. Prior studies have shown that applying the ROCK activator Narciclasine to mice with psoriatic dermatitis reduces inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Topical application of oleoyl-l-α-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a potent Rho activator, was reported to increase the skin barrier in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. However, the molecular basis for the activation of Rho-ROCK pathways to improve the epidermal barrier was not elucidated. Our findings provide a rationale for the validity of these treatments.</p>
<p>Finally, we revealed that EpCAM/TROP2, besides its role in maintaining a stable pool of unpolymerized claudin at the plasma membrane, functions as a chaperone to facilitate intracellular transport of claudin from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanism of claudin transport to the plasma membrane remains largely unknown. In the future, it will be necessary to further investigate how the interaction of EpCAM/TROP2 and claudin at the trans-Golgi networks helps the intracellular transport of claudin.</p>

<p>Cells were cultured in 30 mm dish or 6-well plate and lysed in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer without 2-Mercaptoethanol and were not boiled. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk/0.1% Tween 20/TBS(TBST) for 1 h at RT. Indicated proteins were probed by sequential incubation with the primary antibody and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody prepared in 5% BSA/TBST for 1 h at RT each. After each antibody reaction, nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times with TBST for 10 minutes. Signals were detected by mixing A (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.5], 0.4 mM p-coumaric acid, 5 mM luminol) and B (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.5], 0.04% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Chemiluminescence was captured using the LAS-3000 Imaging system (Fujifilm).</p>

<title>Cell surface protein biotinylation</title>
<p>Cell surface protein biptonylation was performed according to a previously reported protocol <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The biotinylation of surface proteins was performed using EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (21217; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Biotinylated proteins were isolated using High-Capacity Streptavidin Agarose Resin (20361; Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

<title>Paracellular tracer flux measurement</title>
<p>10<sup>5</sup> EpH4 cells were seeded on a 12-mm-diameter cell culture insert (83.3931.040; SARSTEDT) and cultured with daily medium changes. After 6 days, cells were basally treated with 4 μM Doxorubicin Hydrochloride for 9 h, and 70kDa FITC-dextran (46945; Sigma Aldrich) was added to the medium in the apical compartment at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Medium was collected from the basal compartment after 1 h, and the FITC signal was measured with a fluorometer.</p>

<title>Active RhoA pulldown assay</title>
<p>RhoA activation was assessed using GST-tagged rhotekin RBD domain (GST-RBD), which binds to the GTP-bound form of RhoA. Undifferentiated or differentiated HaCaT cells were lysed using lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X, 1 mM DTT, 100 μM APMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and after centrifugation, the supernatant was aliquoted as input and the remainder incubated with GST-RBD bound to glutathione Sepharose beads at 4°C for 2 h. After washing with lysis buffer, pulldown samples were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Immunoblotting was performed using an anti-RhoA mAb, and the band intensities of RhoA in both input and pulldown samples were quantified using Fiji/ImageJ. RhoA activity was calculated by dividing the intensity of activated RhoA (pulldown) by the intensity of input, with undifferentiated cells set to 1.00.</p>

<title>Details of the image analysis for quantification of junctional enrichment.</title>
<p>Workflow for quantification of junctional enrichment of indicated molecules. Maximum intensity projections of E-cadherin immunostaining were processed to binarize and reduce noise by applying the Gaussian filter. After segmentation using cellpose2, junction areas were extracted by edge extraction and dilation of segmentation images, and junction intensities were obtained by overlaying the junction area. Junctional enrichment of the indicated molecule (claudin-3 in this example) was quantified as the signal intensity of the indicated molecule divided by the junction area.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Cho and colleagues investigates de novo tight junction formation during the differentiation of immortalized human HaCaT keratinocytes to granular-like cells, as well as during epithelial remodeling that occurs upon the apoptotic of individual cells in confluent monolayers of the representative epithelial cell line EpH4. The authors demonstrate the involvement of Rho-ROCK with well-conducted experiments and convincing images. Moreover, they unravel the underlying molecular mechanism, with Rho-ROCK activity activating the transmembrane serine protease Matriptase, which in turn leads to the cleavage of EpCAM and TROP2, respectively, releasing Claudins from EpCAM/TROP2/Claudin complexes at the cell membrane to become available for polymerization and de novo tight junction formation. These functional studies in two different cell culture systems are complemented by localization studies of the according proteins in the stratified mouse epidermis in vivo.</p>
<p>In total, these are new and very intriguing and interesting findings that add important new insights into the molecular mechanisms of tight junction formation, identifying Matriptase as the &quot;missing link&quot; in the cascade of formerly described regulators. The involvement of TROP2/EpCAM/Claudin has been reported recently (Szabo et al., Biol. Open 2022; Bugge lab), and Matriptase had been formerly described to be required for tight junction formation as well, again from the Bugge lab. Yet, the functional correlation / epistasis between them, and their relation to Rho signaling, had not been known thus far.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Convincing functional studies in two different cell culture systems, complemented by supporting protein localization studies in vivo. The manuscript is clearly written and most data are convincingly demonstrated, with beautiful images and movies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The previously described weaknesses have been fully wiped out during the revisions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript the authors investigate how epithelia maintain intercellular barrier function despite and during cellular rearrangements upon e.g. apoptotic extrusion in simple epithelia or regenerative turnover in stratified epithelia like this epidermis. A fundamental question in epithelial biology. Previous literature has shown that Rho mediated local regulation of actomyosin is essential not only for cellular rearrangement itself but also directly controls tight junction barrier function. The molecular mechanics however remained unclear. Here the authors use extensive fluorescence imaging of fixed and live cells together with genetic and drug mediated interference to show that Rho activation is required and sufficient to form de novo tight junctional strands at intercellular contacts in epidermal keratinocytes (HaCat) and mammary epithelial cells. After having confirmed previous literature they then show that Rho activation activates the transmembrane protease matriptase which cleaves EpCAM and TROP2, two claudin binding transmembrane proteins, to release claudins and enable claudin strand formation and therefore tight junction barrier function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The presented mechanism is shown to be relevant for epithelial barriers being conserved in simple and stratifying epithelial cells and mainly differs due to tissue specific expression of EpCAM and TROP2. The authors present carefull state of the art imaging and logical experiments that convincingly support the statements and conclusion. The manuscript is well written and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whereas the in vitro evidence of the presented mechanism is strongly supported by the data, the in vivo confirmation is mostly based on the predicted distribution of TROP2. Whereas the causality of Rho mediated matriptase activation has been nicely demonstrated it remains unclear how Rho activates matriptase.</p>

Moreover, they unravel the underlying molecular mechanism, with Rho-ROCK activity activating the transmembrane serine protease Matriptase, which in turn leads to the cleavage of EpCAM and TROP2, respectively, releasing Claudins from EpCAM/TROP2/Claudin complexes at the cell membrane to become available for polymerization and de novo tight junction formation. These functional studies in the two different cell culture systems are complemented by localization studies of the according proteins in the stratified mouse epidermis in vivo.</p>
<p>In total, these are new and very intriguing and interesting findings that add important new insights into the molecular mechanisms of tight junction formation, identifying Matriptase as the &quot;missing link&quot; in the cascade of formerly described regulators. The involvement of TROP2/EpCAM/Claudin has been reported recently (Szabo et al., Biol. Open 2022; Bugge lab), and Matriptase had been formerly described to be required for in tight junction formation as well, again from the Bugge lab. Yet, the functional correlation/epistasis between them, and their relation to Rho signaling, had not been known thus far.</p>
<p>However, experiments addressing the role of Matriptase require a little more work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Convincing functional studies in two different cell culture systems, complemented by supporting protein localization studies in vivo. The manuscript is clearly written and most data are convincingly demonstrated, with beautiful images and movies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The central finding that Rho signaling leads to increased Matriptase activity needs to be more rigorously demonstrated (e.g. western blot specifically detecting the activated version or distinguishing between the full-length/inactive and processed/active version).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First, we thank the reviewer for their fair evaluation of our manuscript and for providing constructive feedback. Regarding the detection of matriptase activation—which Reviewer 1 identified as a weakness—we fully agree that direct validation is crucial. Therefore, in this revision we have carried out additional experiments using the M69 antibody, which specifically recognizes the activated form of matriptase. Details of these new experiments are provided in our point-by-point responses below.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate how epithelia maintain intercellular barrier function despite and during cellular rearrangements upon e.g. apoptotic extrusion in simple epithelia or regenerative turnover in stratified epithelia like this epidermis. A fundamental question in epithelial biology. Previous literature has shown that Rho-mediated local regulation of actomyosin is essential not only for cellular rearrangement itself but also for directly controlling tight junction barrier function. The molecular mechanics however remained unclear. Here the authors use extensive fluorescent imaging of fixed and live cells together with genetic and drug-mediated interference to show that Rho activation is required and sufficient to form novo tight junctional strands at intercellular contacts in epidermal keratinocytes (HaCat) and mammary epithelial cells. After having confirmed previous literature they then show that Rho activation activates the transmembrane protease Matriptase which cleaves EpCAM and TROP2, two claudin-binding transmembrane proteins, to release claudins and enable claudin strand formation and therefore tight junction barrier function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The presented mechanism is shown to be relevant for epithelial barriers being conserved in simple and stratifying epithelial cells and mainly differs due to tissue-specific expression of EpCAM and TROP2. The authors present careful state-of-the-art imaging and logical experiments that convincingly support the statements and conclusion. The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whereas the in vitro evidence of the presented mechanism is strongly supported by the data, the in vivo confirmation is mostly based on the predicted distribution of TROP2. Whereas the causality of Rho-mediated Matriptase activation has been nicely demonstrated it remains unclear how Rho activates Matriptase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback on our manuscript. As Reviewer 2 points out, the precise mechanism by which the Rho/ROCK pathway activates matriptase remains unclear. We have discussed the possible molecular mechanisms in the Discussion section. Elucidating the detailed mechanism of matriptase activation will be the focus of our future work.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Comment 1-1 - Matriptase activation by Rho: The authors show activation of Matriptase in western blots by the simple reduction of (full-length?) protein level in Figures 5 and 7. Most publications however show activated Matriptase either by antibodies detecting specifically the active form (including the publication referenced in this manuscript), or the appearance of the activated form next to the inactive form (based on different molecular weights). Therefore, it is not completely clear whether the treatment with Rho activators (Figure 5) results in an overall decrease of Matriptase, or really in an increase in the activated form. Therefore, the authors should show the actual increase of the active form. As a control, the impact of camostat treatment and overexpression of Hai1 on the active form of Matriptase could be included. It also should be indicated in the figure legend how long cells had been treated with the drugs before being subjected to lysis. Moreover, the western blots need to be quantified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed a more rigorous analysis using the M69 antibody, which specifically recognizes the activated form of matriptase and has been widely used in previous studies（e.g. Benaud et al., 2001; Hung et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2009）. We likewise confirmed a significant increase in M69 signals by both western blotting and immunostaining from samples in which matriptase was activated by acid medium treatment (Figure 5A). Crucially, we also observed matriptase activation with the M69 antibody both in Rho/ROCK activator-treated cells (Figure 5A) and in differentiated granular-layer-like cells (Figures 7A and 7D). These findings strongly support the conclusion that matriptase is activated downstream of the Rho/ROCK pathway.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1-2 - Based on their results, the authors conclude that Matriptase cleaves TROP2 in the SG2 layer of the epidermis, which is a little contradictory to former studies, which have shown Matriptase to be most prominently expressed and active in the basal layer and only little in the spinous layer (e.g Chen et al., Matriptase regulates proliferation and early, but not terminal, differentiation of human keratinocytes. J Invest Dermatol.2013). In this light, one could also argue that inhibiting Matriptase &quot;simply&quot; reduces epidermal differentiation. Can other differentiation markers be tested to rule that the effects on tight junctions are secondary consequences of interferences with earlier / more global steps of keratinocyte differentiation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer noted, previous studies have demonstrated that matriptase is essential for keratinocyte differentiation, and that it cleaves substrates beyond EpCAM and TROP2—any of which could potentially influence the differentiation process. To test this possibility, we chose to monitor maturation of adherens junction (AJ) as an indicator of keratinocyte differentiation into granular-layer cells. Prior work has shown that during differentiation into granular-layer cells, AJs develop and experience increased intercellular mechanical tension, and that this rise in mechanical tension at AJs is critical for subsequent TJ formation (Rübsam et al., 2017). To assess AJ tension, we stained with the α-18 monoclonal antibody, which specifically recognizes the tension-dependent conformational change of α-catenin, a core AJ component. In control cells, differentiation into granular-layer like cells led to a marked increase in α-18 signal at cell–cell adhesion sites. Importantly, when HaCaT cells were treated with Camostat to inhibit matriptase and then induced to differentiate, we observed an equivalent increase in α-18 signal at AJs (Figure 7F). However, we did not detect claudin enrichment at cell-cell contacts under these conditions (Figures 7F and 7H). These results suggest that matriptase inhibition does not impair AJ maturation during granular-layer differentiation, but does profoundly disrupt TJ formation. While we cannot rule out the possibility that matriptase acts more broadly from these results, we judged that a comprehensive substrate survey lies outside the scope of the present manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment 1-3 - In addition, as in Figure 5, full-length levels of Matriptase in Figure 7A need to be complemented by the active version to demonstrate more convincingly that TROP2 processing coincides with (and is most likely caused by) increased Matriptase activation. In the quantification in 7B, levels actually go up again after 2 and 4 hours. How is that explained, and what would this mean with respect to tight junction formation seen at 24 h of differentiation? The TROP2 cleavage shown in Figure 7A should be quantified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment is related to Comment 1-1. Using the M69 antibody, which specifically recognizes the activated matriptase, we directly demonstrated that matriptase activation occurs during the differentiation of granular layer-like cells (Figures 7A and 7D). Furthermore, we performed quantitative analysis of TROP2 cleavage and found that, compared with undifferentiated cells, differentiation into granular-layer like cells was accompanied by an increase in the cleaved TROP2 fragments (Figures 7A and 7B).</p>

<p>Comment 1-11 - Line 377: The authors say they found Matriptase always present in lateral membranes. I did not find evidence for this in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that in polarized epithelial cells, matriptase is localized to the basolateral membrane below TJs (Buzza et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2009). We also found that matriptase consistently localizes to the basolateral membrane but more crucially that it becomes activated there during differentiation into granular layer cells. We added these new data as Figures 7C-7E in the revised manuscript. These findings suggest that matriptase activation occurs without a change in its subcellular localization.</p>
