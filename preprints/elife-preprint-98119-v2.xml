<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Sensory cells in the retina and inner ear rely on specialized ribbon synapses for neurotransmission. Disruption of these synapses is linked to visual and auditory dysfunction, but it is unclear how these unique synapses form. Ribbon synapses are defined by a presynaptic density called a ribbon. Using live imaging in zebrafish hair cells, we find that numerous small ribbon precursors are present throughout the cell early in development. As development progresses, fewer large ribbons remain, and localize at the presynaptic active zone (AZ). Using tracking analyses, we show that ribbon precursors exhibit directed motion along an organized microtubule network to reach the presynaptic AZ. In addition, we show that ribbon precursors can fuse together on microtubules. Using pharmacology, we find that microtubule disruption interferes with ribbon motion, fusion, and normal synapse formation. Overall, this work demonstrates a dynamic series of events that underlies the formation of a critical synapse required for sensory function.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The inner ear and retina contain sensory cells with specialized ribbon synapses that faithfully transmit the timing, duration, and intensity of sensory stimuli to the brain. These synapses are critical for hearing, balance, and vision, and their disruption is linked to auditory, vestibular, and visual disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Frederick and Zenisek, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kujawa and Liberman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wan et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The hallmark feature of these synapses is the presynaptic ribbon, a dense body made up primarily of the protein Ribeye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). Ribbons are found at the presynaptic active zone (AZ) and act as scaffolds to ready synaptic vesicles for release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Schmitz, 2009</xref>). Work in fixed tissues has led to the hypothesis that small ribbon precursors migrate to the AZ and fuse to form larger, mature ribbons. However, direct evidence for these dynamic processes during ribbon formation has not yet been demonstrated.</p>
<p>Neurotransmission at mature ribbon synapses is triggered in response to graded membrane depolarizations dictated by the duration and intensity of sensory stimuli. Membrane depolarization opens voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca<sub>V</sub>1) beneath ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chang et al., 2006</xref>) (see schematic in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Calcium influx triggers synaptic vesicle fusion and the release of glutamate onto postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Obholzer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Ruel et al., 2008</xref>). Studies have shown Ribeye, the core component of the ribbon, is essential for the formation and function of ribbon synapses in both mouse and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jean et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lv et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Maxeiner et al., 2016</xref>). Other key components include the classic neuronal scaffolding proteins Bassoon and a novel variant of Piccolo, Piccolino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gundelfinger et al., 2016</xref>). In mice, the loss of Bassoon disrupts ribbons anchoring and synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dick et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Frank et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Khimich et al., 2005</xref>). In rats, the loss of Piccolino also impacts ribbon morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Michanski et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Regus-Leidig et al., 2014</xref>). Currently how these key molecular players fit within the dynamics underlying ribbon formation is unclear.</p>

<p>In neurons, precursor vesicles containing Piccolo and Bassoon are transported along microtubules to the developing presynaptic AZ. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahmari et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gundelfinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Shapira et al., 2003</xref>). This transport requires molecular motors, along with adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bury and Sabo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fejtova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Maas et al., 2012</xref>). In neurons, kinesins are the molecular motors that transport cargo in the anterograde direction–towards the presynaptic AZ–while cytoplasmic dynein mediates retrograde transport, back to the cell soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sweeney and Holzbaur, 2018</xref>). Although the kinesin responsible for Piccolo-Bassoon vesicle transport is not known, recent work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggests that the kinesin KIF1A may transport AZ components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Oliver et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Pack-Chung et al., 2007</xref>). Work in developing photoreceptors and mouse auditory inner hair cells (IHCs), has shown that ribbon precursors contain not only Ribeye, but also Bassoon, and Piccolino (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Regus-Leidig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). Whether ribbon precursors are actively transported along microtubules during synapse formation is not known.</p>
<p>The formation of ribbon synapses has been extensively studied using light and electron microscopy in fixed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Regus-Leidig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Schmitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sheets et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sobkowicz et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">1982</xref>). In mouse auditory IHCs, this process occurs over an extended time period (E18-P14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sobkowicz et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">1982</xref>), while in zebrafish hair cells, ribbon synapses mature in just 12-18 hrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sheets et al., 2011</xref>). Early development in both mouse IHCs and zebrafish hair cells features many small ribbon precursors throughout the cell, likely formed via Ribeye self-aggregation in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Magupalli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). As development progresses, ribbons enlarge, localize to the presynaptic AZ, and associate with the innervating afferent terminals. Finally, the number of ribbons associated with postsynaptic machinery is refined to obtain the proper number of complete synapses. Recent work in mice has shown that ribbon precursors associate with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>), and it has been proposed that ribbon precursors may migrate along microtubules to reach the presynaptic AZ, although the <italic>in vivo</italic> dynamics of this process remain unclear.</p>
<p>To study ribbon formation, we examined hair cells and developing ribbons in the zebrafish lateral line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), a sensory system that allows aquatic vertebrates to sense local water movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Freeman, 1928</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Suli et al., 2012</xref>). The lateral line consists of clusters of hair cells called neuromasts that are arranged in lines along the surface of the fish. In the posterior lateral line (pLL), which forms an array of neuromasts along the zebrafish trunk, hair cells emerge at 2 days post fertilization (dpf) (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B,D</xref>), and the lateral-line system reaches functional maturity by 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Suli et al., 2012</xref>). At these larval ages zebrafish are transparent, which enables <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of ribbon formation over extended periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dow et al., 2015</xref>). Further, transgenic lines expressing fluorescently tagged proteins allow high-resolution visualization of subcellular dynamics, including ribbon formation.</p>
<p>During our study, we worked in close collaboration with another group investigating the late stages of ribbon formation in mouse auditory IHCs (postnatally). This work is published in a companion paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Voorn et al., 2024</xref>). Together our studies demonstrate that ribbon transport along microtubule networks is essential for proper ribbon formation in mice and zebrafish. Our zebrafish work leverages transgenic lines that label: developing ribbons, microtubule networks, and the growing plus ends of microtubules. We use these lines, along with high-resolution imaging to visualize the dynamics of ribbon formation. Using live imaging, we show that early in development, many small ribbon precursors are distributed throughout the cell. By later stages, fewer large ribbons remain and localize to the base of the cell. We show that microtubule networks in lateral-line hair cells are dynamic and grow plus ends towards the presynaptic AZ, the preferred direction for most kinesin motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sweeney and Holzbaur, 2018</xref>). Tracking analyses reveal the directed motion of ribbon precursors towards the presynaptic AZ, with ribbon precursors moving along and fusing on microtubules. Further, an intact microtubule network is critical for ribbon transport, fusion, and synapse formation. Overall, this foundational work provides insight into ribbon formation and the processes needed to reform ribbon synapses for the treatment of auditory and vestibular synaptopathies.</p>

<title>Time course of ribbon formation in living zebrafish lateral-line hair cells</title>
<p>Fixed preparations in zebrafish and mice have outlined a conserved process that underlies ribbon or presynapse development in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sheets et al., 2011</xref>). To examine the time course underlying ribbon formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we studied hair cells in the zebrafish pLL. These hair cells form 3-4 ribbon synapses in just 12-18 hrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kindt et al., 2012</xref>). To image hair cells, ribbon precursors, and ribbons <italic>in vivo</italic> we used a double transgenic line. One transgenic line labels microtubules and serves as a marker of hair cells (<italic>myo6b:YFP-tubulin</italic>). The other transgenic line reliably labels ribbons and smaller ribbon precursors (<italic>myo6b:riba-TagRFP</italic>) in hair cells (see example: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Although this latter transgene expresses Riba-TagRFP under a non-endogenous promoter, neither the tag nor the promoter ultimately impacts cell numbers, synapse counts, or ribbon size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-1">Figure 1-S1A-E</xref>).</p>
<p>For our initial analyses, we assessed the overall time course of ribbon formation in hair cells in the posterior lateral line (pLL) when larvae were 2 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). At 2 dpf each pLL neuromast contains 4-8 developing hair cells at different developmental stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,D,F-I</xref>). We staged hair cells based on the development of the apical, mechanosensory hair bundle. The hair bundle is composed of actin-based stereocilia and a tubulin-based kinocilium. We used the height of the kinocilium (see schematic in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), the tallest part of the hair bundle, to estimate the developmental stage of hair cells as described previously (stage: hair bundle height; early: &lt; 1.5 µm, intermediate: 1.5-10 μm, late: 10-18 μm, mature: &gt; 18 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhang and Kindt, 2022</xref>)). Qualitatively, we observed that at early and intermediate stages, small Riba-TagRFP puncta were present throughout the cell body (see examples: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,F-G</xref>). By late stages, or in newly matured hair cells, larger Riba-TagRFP puncta were restricted to the base of the cell (see example: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H-I</xref>). We quantified the total number of Riba-TagRFP puncta based on developmental stage and found that the total number of puncta was high at early and intermediate stages but significantly decreased when hair cells were mature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-1">Figure 1-S2A</xref>, n = 7 neuromasts and 67 hair cells).</p>
<p>When taking these live images, we had no postsynaptic marker and were unable to differentiate between precursors and smaller ribbons associated with a postsynaptic density. Therefore, we classified all apical Riba-TagRFP puncta above the nucleus as precursors, and all ribbons located beneath the nucleus at the cell base as more mature ribbons. Using this classification, we quantified the total number of Riba-TagRFP puncta at each developmental stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-1">Figure 1-S2B-C</xref>, n = 7 neuromasts and 67 hair cells). We found that apical Riba-TagRFP precursors were only present at early and intermediate stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-1">Figure 1-S2B</xref>, and see yellow arrows in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-G</xref>). In contrast, hair cells at late or mature stages contained more mature ribbons located at the cell base, below the nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E,H-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-1">Figure 1-S2C</xref>). Overall, our live images examining Riba-TagRFP puncta show a similar, developmental process as observed in fixed preparations–the number of ribbons and precursors decrease and become basally localized to the presynaptic AZ as the hair cell develops.</p>

<title>Microtubules grow plus ends toward the presynaptic active zone in hair cells</title>
<p>An important question in ribbon formation is how ribbons and precursors migrate to the presynaptic AZ. Work on mouse IHCs using electron microscopy (EM) and super-resolution microscopy found that developing ribbons and precursors often associate with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to what was observed in mice using EM, in living, pLL hair cells we observed ribbon precursors associated with microtubules (see yellow arrows in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-G</xref>). Based on these association studies, a microtubule network may function to transport ribbon precursors during development. To understand if ribbons could be transported along microtubules, we first examined the composition and polarity of the microtubule network in pLL hair cells.</p>
<p>We first examined the composition, or posttranslational modifications present in the microtubule network in pLL hair cells using immunohistochemistry. Using this approach, we labeled either acetylated-(modification found in mechanically stabilized microtubules) or tyrosinated-(modification found in destabilized microtubules) α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>). We performed our staining in a transgenic line that labels all microtubules (<italic>myo6b:YFP-tubulin</italic>). We found that in pLL hair cells, the microtubule network extends along the apical-basal axis of the cell and is highly acetylated; acetylated microtubules are more concentrated at the cell apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-2">Figure 2-S1A-C</xref>). Outside of the kinocilium, we did not observe tyrosinated microtubules in pLL hair cells. Instead, tyrosinated microtubules were observed in the zebrafish skin, pLL nerve terminals, and the supporting cells that surround hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-2">Figure 2-S1D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, our immunostaining results indicate that in pLL hair cells, a considerable portion of the microtubule network is highly acetylated. Acetylation may provide a population of mechanically stable microtubules that could be used to transport ribbon precursors.</p>
<p>Although microtubule modifications are informative, these labels do not provide definitive information regarding microtubule growth or polarity. Knowing microtubule polarity is important, as many cargos are transported based on polarity. For example, most kinesin motor proteins transport cargo toward the more dynamic plus end of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sweeney and Holzbaur, 2018</xref>). Therefore, to explore microtubule polarity in pLL hair cells, we created a transgenic line that expresses the plus-end marker of microtubules, EB3 (end-binding protein 3), fused with GFP (see example: <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>myo6b:EB3-GFP</italic>). Previous work in other cell types has shown that EB3-GFP can be used to visualize the plus end of growing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kawano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>We used this transgenic line, along with confocal microscopy to visualize microtubule growth in pLL hair cells (z-stacks every 7 s for 20-30 min). By imaging EB3-GFP dynamics, we observed comet-like tracks that allowed us to visualize the plus end of growing microtubules (see <xref rid="video1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S1</xref>). In hair cells, microtubule organizing centers are located beneath a single microtubule-based kinocilium, the primary cilium in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lepelletier et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with studies in motile cilia, we observed foci of EB3-GFP at the tips of kinocilia that emanate away from the apex of the cell body (Schrøder et al., 2011) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-2">Figure 2-S2A-C</xref>). This result suggests that similar to other cilia, the plus ends of kinocilia are towards their tips, away from the cell body. In addition, we observed EB3-GFP tracks within the soma of hair cells and found that the majority of tracks were directed away from the cell apex and towards the base of the cell (see EB3-GFP images taken from <xref rid="video1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S1</xref>, with tracks rendered into a pseudocolor image based on time, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>). To quantify the direction of EB3-GFP tracks we used Imaris to perform 2D analyses to detect and create vectors of EB3-GFP tracks (see arrows; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,E,F</xref>). We aligned these vectors along the 2D apical-basal axis of each cell. Here vector movement towards the apex was represented as 180°, and movement to the base was represented at 0° (see schematic, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). The movement of EB3-GFP vectors was quantified as the angle between 0 and 180°. From this analysis, we found that 78 % of EB3-GFP vectors were directed towards the base in pLL hair cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, 2014/2597 tracks &lt; 90°, n = 7 neuromasts and 33 hair cells).</p>
<p>Overall, our immunostaining revealed that the soma of hair cells contains a population of microtubules stabilized by acetylation. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of EB3-GFP revealed that within this population there is extensive microtubule dynamics, and the plus ends of microtubules are primarily directed towards the cell base, and the presynaptic AZ.</p>

<title>Ribbon precursors associate with and show directed motion along microtubules</title>
<p>Our analysis of microtubule dynamics using EB3-GFP indicates that the plus ends of microtubules point toward the cell base (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that these tracks of microtubules could be used by kinesin motor proteins to transport precursors from the cell apex to the base during development. To test this hypothesis, we used either Airyscan or Airyscan 2 confocal imaging to capture timelapses of ribbon and precursor movement for longer durations (Airyscan: ∼3 µm z-stacks (15-20 slices) every 50-100 s for 30-70 min) or for shorter total durations with a faster capture rate (Airyscan 2: ∼2-3.5 µm z-stacks (12-20 slices) every 3-20 s for 5-40 min). We focused our analysis on developing pLL hair cells at early and intermediate stages when ribbon precursors are abundant throughout the cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,F-G</xref>). For this work we used Riba-TagRFP to mark ribbons and precursors, and YFP-tubulin to label microtubules and provide cellular context.</p>
<p>From our timelapses, we observed that similar to our initial live analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-G</xref>), ribbon precursors associate with microtubules and are not found free-floating and untethered in the cell (<xref rid="video2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S2</xref>, <xref rid="video3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). We observed that precursors exhibited 3 main movement behaviors related to microtubule association. First, we observed that the majority of precursors associated with microtubules remained stationary or confined (see examples: <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> top two panels, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,E</xref> asterisks, <xref rid="video4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S4</xref>). Second, we also observed rapid movement of precursors–during this movement, precursors appeared to be in close association with microtubules (see examples: <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> bottom 4 panels, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D,E</xref> yellow arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-3">Figure 3-S1A,B</xref>, <xref rid="video4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S4</xref>, S5, S6). This movement along microtubules occurred bidirectionally, towards the cell apex and towards the base (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, middle panels (arrows to base), bottom panels (arrows to apex), <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-3">Figure 3-S1A</xref> and <xref rid="video4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S4</xref>, <xref rid="video5" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> (to base), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-3">Figure 3-S1B</xref> and <xref rid="video6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S6</xref> (to apex)). Third, during the timelapses, we often observed that precursors switched associations between neighboring microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-3">Figure 3-S1C-D</xref>, <xref rid="video7" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S7</xref>, 2.8 switching events per neuromast, n = 10 neuromasts).</p>

<p>To quantify ribbon and precursor movement, we used Imaris to obtain x,y,z coordinates for each ribbon during our timelapses (longer 30-70 min acquisitions) (see examples: <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>, <xref rid="video2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie S2</xref>, <xref rid="video3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). This analysis yielded tracks or trajectories for all precursors and ribbons. We then performed a mean-squared displacement (MSD) analysis on ribbon tracks to classify the type of motion we observed. In this analysis, the exponent (α) of MSD vs time is obtained by curve fitting. A value of α &gt; 1 indicates directional motion with velocity, α = 1 indicates Brownian motion, and α &lt; 1 is representative of confined motion or subdiffusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F,G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sikora et al., 2017</xref>). This method allows us to determine what type of motion each track is exhibiting. Our results show that in developing hair cells, ribbon tracks exhibit directional as well as confined motion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>, example MSD tracks with α &gt; 1 (red tracks, top panel) and α &lt; 1 (black tracks, bottom panel) from 2 neuromasts). Upon quantification, 20.2 % of ribbon tracks show α &gt; 1, indicative of directional motion, but the majority of ribbon tracks (79.8 %) show α &lt; 1, indicating confinement on microtubules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, n = 10 neuromasts, 40 hair cells, and 203 tracks).</p>
<p>To provide a more comprehensive analysis of precursor movement, we also examined displacement distance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). Here, as an additional measure of directed motion, we calculated the percent of tracks with a cumulative displacement &gt; 1 µm. We found 35.6 % of tracks had a displacement &gt; 1 µm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>; n = 10 neuromasts, 40 hair cells, and 203 tracks). Of the tracks with displacement &gt; 1 µm, the majority of ribbon tracks (45.8 %) moved to the cell base, but we also found a subset of ribbon tracks (20.8 %) that moved apically (33.4 % moved in an undetermined direction) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). This apical movement is consistent with a subpopulation of microtubules showing plus-end mediated growth apically (22.8 % of EB3-GFP tracks). In addition, we examined the location of precursors within the cell that exhibited displacements &gt; 1 µm. We found that 38.9 % of these tracks were located above the nucleus, while 61.1 % were located below the nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>). Overall, our timelapse imaging demonstrated that ribbons and precursors displayed 3 main types of movement on microtubules: confinement, movement along microtubules, and switching between microtubules. Further, our tracking analyses indicate that while the majority of precursors are confined on microtubules, a subpopulation of ribbons and precursors exhibit directional motion.</p>

<title>Long-term manipulation of microtubules impacts ribbon formation</title>
<p>Our timelapse imaging revealed that precursors and ribbons can move along directionally microtubules. To assess the importance of the microtubule network in synapse formation we used pharmacology to destabilize or stabilize the microtubule network in pLL hair cells using nocodazole or taxol respectively. We incubated larvae at 2 dpf for 16 hrs (56-72 hours post fertilization (hpf)), a time window that encompasses a large portion of synapse formation in developing hair cells. After these pharmacological treatments, we fixed and immunostained larvae to label acetylated-α-tubulin, to monitor changes to the microtubule network. In addition, we co-labeled with Ribeyeb to label ribbons and precursors and pan-Maguk to label postsynapses.</p>
<p>After a 16-hr treatment with 250 nM nocodazole, we observed a decrease in acetylated-α-tubulin label (qualitative examples: <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-4">Figure 4-S1A-B</xref>). Quantification revealed significantly less mean acetylated-α-tubulin label in hair cells after nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-4">Figure 4-S1D</xref>). Less acetylated-α-tubulin label indicates that our nocodazole treatment successfully destabilized microtubules. We also examined the number of hair cells per neuromast and observed that after nocodazole treatment, there were significantly fewer hair cells compared to controls. This indicates that either nocodazole is slightly toxic or interferes with cell division. Both situations have been observed previously during nocodazole treatments in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gupta, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zieve et al., 1980</xref>). We next examined the Ribeyeb label in hair cells to assess precursors and ribbons. We found that after nocodazole treatment, the total number of Ribeyeb puncta (apical and basal) per hair cell was significantly higher compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). We also observed that the average of individual Ribeyeb puncta (from 2D max-projected images) was significantly reduced compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Further, the relative frequency of individual Ribeyeb puncta with smaller areas was higher in nocodazole-treated hair cells compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). We also examined the number of complete synapses (Ribeyeb-Maguk paired puncta) per hair cell after nocodazole treatment. We found that there were significantly fewer complete synapses per hair cell after a 16-hr nocodazole treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Our long-term nocodazole treatment indicates that microtubule destabilization led to an increase in ribbons and precursors while reducing the number of synapses per cell.</p>

<p>We performed a similar analysis on hair cells after a 16-hr treatment with 25 µM taxol. After treatment we observed more acetylated-α-tubulin label, indicating that our taxol treatment successfully stabilized microtubules (qualitative examples: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-4">Figure 4-S1A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-4">Figure 4-S2A,C</xref>). Quantification revealed an overall increase in mean acetylated-α-tubulin label in hair cells after taxol treatment, but this increase did not reach significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-4">Figure 4-S1E</xref>). Unlike nocodazole treatment, taxol did not significantly impact the number of hair cells, the average area of Ribeyeb puncta, or the number of ribbons and precursors (apical and basal) per hair cell compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-4">Figure 4-S2E,G-I</xref>). Interestingly, we observed slightly more complete synapses per hair cell after a 16-hr taxol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-4">Figure 4-S2F</xref>). Overall, our long-term taxol treatment indicated that microtubule stabilization did not dramatically impact synapse formation in pLL hair cells.</p>
<p>Together, this pharmacology study revealed that long-term destabilization and stabilization of microtubules during development can impact ribbon formation in pLL hair cells. Microtubule destabilization had the most dramatic effect leading to more ribbons and precursors, and the formation of fewer complete synapses.</p>

<title><italic>Kif1aa</italic> mutants have fewer synapses and more ribbon precursors</title>
<p>For cargo (such as ribbons and precursors) to be transported along microtubules, molecular motor proteins are required. Kinesin motor proteins transport cargo along microtubules towards the growing, plus end. Our work demonstrated that in hair cells of the pLL, the plus end of microtubules grow from the apex to the base of the cell (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has revealed that <italic>kif1aa</italic>, a zebrafish orthologue of mammalian Kif1a, a plus-end directed kinesin motor protein, is highly expressed in pLL hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lush et al., 2019</xref>). In zebrafish, there are 2 orthologues of mammalian <italic>Kif1a</italic>, <italic>kif1aa</italic> and <italic>kif1ab</italic>. ScRNA-seq in zebrafish has demonstrated widespread co-expression of <italic>kif1ab</italic> and <italic>kif1aa</italic> mRNA in the nervous system. Additionally, both scRNA-seq and fluorescent in situ hybridization have revealed that pLL hair cells exclusively express <italic>kif1aa</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">David et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lush et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sur et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether Kif1aa could be the kinesin motor that transports ribbons and precursors to the cell base during development.</p>
<p>To test for the role of Kif1aa in pLL hair cells, we created a CRISPR-Cas9 mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Varshney et al., 2016</xref>). Our <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutant has a stop codon in the motor domain and is predicted to be a null mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-5">Figure 5-S1A-B</xref>). Recent work in our lab using this mutant has shown that Kif1aa is responsible for enriching glutamate-filled vesicles at the base of hair cells. In addition, this work demonstrated that loss of Kif1aa results in functional defects in mature hair cells including a reduction in evoked post-synaptic calcium responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">David et al., 2024</xref>). We hypothesized that Kif1aa may also be playing an earlier role in ribbon formation.</p>
<p>For our initial analysis of <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants, we co-labeled hair cells at 3 dpf with Ribeyeb to label ribbons and precursors and pan-Maguk to label postsynapses (see examples: <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-D</xref>). This is a similar endpoint used to examine synapse formation after our long-term nocodazole and taxol treatments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-4">Figure 4-S2</xref>). We found that at 3 dpf <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants had a similar number of hair cells per neuromast (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Despite a similar number of hair cells, we found that there were significantly fewer complete synapses per hair cell in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition, we found that there were significantly more ribbons and precursors (apical and basal) in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G-I</xref>). As described in the previous section, we also observed fewer complete synapses, and more ribbons and precursors after a 16-hr nocodazole treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-G</xref>). Together, this suggests that both intact microtubules and Kif1aa are required for normal synapse formation in pLL hair cells.</p>

<p>Compared to controls, 500 nM nocodazole destabilized microtubules (presence of depolymerized YFP-tubulin in the cytosol, see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-4">Figure 4-S1F-G</xref>) and 25 µM taxol dramatically stabilized microtubules (indicated by long, rigid microtubules, see arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-4">Figure 4-S1F,H</xref>) in pLL hair cells. We did still observe a subset of apical microtubules after nocodazole treatment, indicating that this population is particularly stable (see asterisks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-4">Figure 4-S1F-H</xref>).</p>
<p>After verifying our <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological pharmacology treatments, we acquired Airyscan confocal images of developing hair cells at 2 dpf that express YFP-tubulin and Riba-TagRFP. Then after a 3-4 hr treatment in either 500 nM nocodazole or 25 µM taxol, we reimaged the same hair cells. Consistent with our previous results (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-4">Figure 4-S1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-4">S2</xref>) nocodazole and taxol treatments destabilized or stabilized microtubules respectively (qualitative examples: <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-F</xref>). In each developing cell, we quantified the total number of Riba-TagRFP puncta (apical and basal) before and after each treatment. In our control samples, we observed on average no change in the number of Riba-TagRFP puncta per cell (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that nocodazole treatment led to a significant increase in the total number of Riba-TagRFP puncta after 3-4 hrs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). This result is similar to our overnight nocodazole experiments in fixed samples, where we also observed an increase in the number of ribbons and precursors per hair cell. In contrast to our 3-4 hr nocodazole treatment, similar to controls, taxol treatment did not alter the total number of Riba-TagRFP puncta over 3-4 hrs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Overall, our overnight and 3-4 hr pharmacology experiments demonstrate that microtubule destabilization has a more significant impact on ribbon numbers compared to microtubule stabilization.</p>

<p>Next, we used a similar approach to examine the number of Riba-TagRFP puncta in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants over a 3-4 hr time window. For this analysis, we examined puncta in <italic>kif1aa</italic> F0 crispants. These mutants are derived from the injection of 2 <italic>kif1aa</italic> guide RNAs (gRNAs) and Cas9 protein. This approach has shown to be an extremely effective way to assay gene function in any genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hoshijima et al., 2019</xref>). Using this approach, we were able to robustly disrupt the <italic>kif1aa</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-6">Figure 6-S1</xref>). We found that compared to uninjected controls, in <italic>kif1aa</italic> F0 crispants there was no change in the total number of Riba-TagRFP puncta per cell over 3-4 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-6">Figure 6-S2A-F</xref>). This result is slightly different than our analysis of <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants at 3 dpf where we observed significantly more ribbons and precursors per cell compared to controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Overall, live imaging over a 3-4 hr time window indicates that a loss of microtubule stability, but not loss of Kif1aa, results in an increase in Riba-TagRFP puncta within developing pLL hair cells.</p>

<title>Ribbons and precursors require microtubules, but not Kif1aa for directed motion</title>
<p>Our tracking analyses revealed that ribbons and precursors show directed motion on microtubules. Based on these results, we asked what happens to this movement if we disrupt microtubules or the kinesin motor Kif1aa. To test whether microtubules are required for directional ribbon and precursor motion, we used the drugs nocodazole and taxol to alter microtubule dynamics. We treated the fish with these drugs for 30 min and recorded timelapses of ribbon and precursor motion. This short treatment allowed us to observe ribbon motion relatively soon after microtubule disruption and minimize any cytotoxic effects of the compounds. Then we performed MSD and track displacement analyses on ribbon movement to determine if directional motion was impaired (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-B</xref>).</p>

<p>Using this approach we found that after destabilizing microtubules by treatment with 500 nM nocodazole for 30 min, the proportion of tracks with α &gt; 1 was significantly reduced compared to controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). In addition, we also found that the proportion of longer tracks with a cumulative displacement &gt; 1 µm was also reduced after nocodazole treatment compared to controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). This analysis indicates that an intact microtubule network is needed for proper directional ribbon motion and longer displacements. In contrast, after stabilizing microtubules by treatment with 25 µM taxol, we observed no effect on the proportion of tracks with displacement &gt; 1 µm or the proportion of tracks with α &gt; 1, compared to controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D,G</xref>). Interestingly, when we examined the distribution of α values, we observed that taxol treatment shifted the overall distribution towards higher α values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-7">Figure 7-S1A</xref>). In addition, when we plotted only tracks with directional motion (α &gt; 1), we found significantly higher α values in hair cells treated with taxol compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-7">Figure 7-S1B</xref>). This indicates that in taxol-treated hair cells, where the microtubule network is stabilized, ribbons with directional motion have higher velocities.</p>
<p>Next, we used a similar approach to examine the tracks of ribbon and precursor motion in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants. For this analysis, we tracked ribbons and precursors in <italic>kif1aa</italic> F0 crispants. We observed that the proportion of tracks with displacement &gt; 1 µm was not significantly different between <italic>kif1aa</italic> F0 crispants and controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). Similarly, the proportion of tracks with α &gt; 1, was also not significantly different from the controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Overall, these tracking analyses show that in developing pLL hair cells, the kinesin motor Kif1aa is not essential for the directional motion of ribbons and precursors. In contrast, an unperturbed microtubule network is essential for directed motion.</p>

<title>Ribbon precursors fuse on microtubules</title>
<p>Our analyses demonstrate that the movement of ribbon precursors along microtubules is important for synapse formation. But in addition to movement, during development it has been proposed that these small precursors come together or fuse to form larger, more mature ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). This is consistent with our work, where we see a reduction in ribbon and precursor numbers alongside development (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Further, we see an increase in ribbon and precursor number when microtubules are destabilized (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), indicating an intact microtubule network may also be important for ribbon fusion.</p>
<p>Consistent with this idea, in our timelapses, we observed that ribbons and precursors undergo fusion on microtubules. These fusion events occurred between smaller precursors at the cell apex as well as between larger precursors near the cell base (see examples: <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-8">Figure 8-S1A-B</xref>, <xref rid="video9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movies S9-S11</xref>). We classified an event as a fusion once the ribbons could not be resolved separately and stayed together for the length of the remaining timelapse (or at least 5 min). Although we could not accurately measure the areas of precursors before and after fusion, we did observe that the relative area resulting from the fusion of two smaller precursors was greater than that of either precursor alone. This increase in area suggests that precursor fusion may serve as a mechanism for generating larger ribbons (see examples: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-8">Figure 8-S1A-B</xref>). Fusion events usually involved ribbon precursors on two separate microtubule filaments coming together during fusion, but fusion events could also occur on the same filament. Although the fusion events were infrequent, within our time windows (30-70 min), we quantified them and counted an average of 1.7 fusions and a maximum of 5 fusions events per neuromast in developing pLL hair cells (n = 27 control neuromasts). Based on the close association with microtubules during these events, we tested whether an intact microtubule network was required for fusion events. We found that after treatment with 500 nM nocodazole for 30 min, there were fewer fusions events (mean 0.4, maximum 2 fusions per neuromast, n = 10 neuromasts). In contrast, the frequency of fusion events remained unchanged upon treatment with 25 µM taxol for 30 min.</p>

<p>In our tracking analysis, we observed that Kif1aa was not required for the directional motion of ribbon and precursors in developing hair cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E,H</xref>). However, our immunohistological analyses indicated that there were more precursors and fewer complete synapses in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants. Therefore, we examined whether Kif1aa was important for fusion events. For this analysis, we quantified fusion events in <italic>kif1aa</italic> F0 crispants. We observed that similar to nocodazole treatment, there were significantly fewer fusion events in <italic>kif1aa</italic> F0 crispants (mean 0.6, maximum 2 fusions per neuromast, n = 9 neuromasts). This reduction in fusion events may ultimately account for the excess of precursors and fewer complete synapses observed in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Together our results indicate that during development, ribbon precursors can fuse when associated with microtubules, and an unperturbed microtubule network, along with Kif1aa is needed for these fusion events.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work in zebrafish applied high-resolution imaging approaches to investigate how ribbons are assembled and mobilized in developing hair cells. Our study demonstrates that hair cells have microtubule networks that are polarized with growing plus ends pointed to the cell base. Live imaging highlights that during development, ribbons and precursors show directed motion and fusion along microtubules and that an intact microtubule network is important for synapse formation.</p>

<title>Comparison of ribbon synapse formation in zebrafish and mice</title>
<p>Compared to pLL hair cells (12-18 hrs), synapse formation and refinement occur over a relatively long time window in mouse IHCs (E18-P14). In mice, much of the initial synaptogenesis occurs embryonically, while synapse refinement and pruning occur later, during the first postnatal week. Due to the rapid time course of synapse development in zebrafish, our experiments likely encompass ribbon precursor movement during synaptogenesis and synapse refinement. The companion paper on mouse IHCs focused primarily on ribbon mobility during the dramatic pruning of synapses that occurs during early postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Voorn et al., 2024</xref>). Unfortunately, it was not possible to study earlier events in mouse IHCs, as equivalent experiments were not possible embryonically. Live imaging at postnatal stages in mice indicates that during synapse pruning in IHCs, ribbons may detach from the membrane, undergo local trafficking, and fuse to nearby presynaptic AZs. Together our studies in zebrafish and mouse hair cells illuminate several common features that characterize ribbon and microtubule dynamics during synapse formation.</p>
<p>First, immunostaining in both zebrafish and mice revealed an extensive network of microtubules within hair cells. In both species, the majority of microtubules were stabilized by tubulin acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-2">Figure 2-S1</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of EB3-GFP in zebrafish hair cells revealed that microtubules are very dynamic, and the plus ends of microtubules grow towards the cell base, towards the presynaptic AZ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). This data is consistent with data in mouse IHCs demonstrated via immunostaining that the minus end marker of microtubules, CAMSAP2, localizes to the IHC apex (Vorn et. al.). Overall, both studies demonstrate that microtubule networks in developing hair cells are polarized with the plus ends pointed to the cell base.</p>
<p>Second, live imaging in zebrafish and mouse hair cells revealed that ribbons associate with and move along microtubules. Tracking and quantification of ribbon movement via MSD analysis revealed that in both zebrafish and mouse hair cells, the majority of ribbons show motion indicative of confinement (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, α &lt; 1). In addition, a subset of ribbon tracks shows evidence of directed motion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, α &gt; 1, or displacements &gt; 1 µm). In both species, after using nocodazole to destabilize microtubules, there was a dramatic reduction in instances of directed motion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In addition to ribbon movement, ribbon fusion was observed in the hair cells of mice and zebrafish (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Interestingly, in mice many fusion events were balanced out by divisions, or ribbons undergoing separation. In contrast, ribbon divisions were not prevalent in zebrafish hair cells. A lack of ribbon divisions could be due to the rapid speed of development in zebrafish hair cells, where divisions are too transient in nature to be confirmed. Alternatively, divisions may occur primarily late in synapse development and these events were overall less abundant in our zebrafish datasets. Importantly, in both mouse and zebrafish hair cells, ribbon fusion was diminished after microtubule destabilization. Together these results in mice and zebrafish demonstrate that an intact microtubule network is required for the directed motion and fusion of ribbons during development.</p>
<p>Third, we sought to explore the kinesin motor responsible for ribbon movement in hair cells using zebrafish and mouse models. Based on scRNAseq data and previous immunostaining evidence we focused on Kif1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lush et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). In both mouse <italic>Kif1a</italic> and zebrafish <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants, a common observation was an overall reduction in ribbon size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that a conserved mechanism where both intact microtubules and Kif1aa are required for normal ribbon formation. Despite these results, future work in zebrafish and mice is needed to explore additional kinesin motors that can drive ribbon movement during synapse formation.</p>

<title>Fusion on microtubules as a mechanism for ribbon enlargement and maturation</title>
<p>Numerous studies have documented small ribbon precursors in developing photoreceptors and hair cells; later in development there are fewer, large ribbons present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Regus-Leidig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Schmitz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sheets et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sobkowicz et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">1982</xref>). This has led to the hypothesis that ribbon precursor fusion is a mechanism to form larger, more mature ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). Our live imaging experiments show that ribbon fusion is indeed a feature of ribbon formation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-8">Figure 8-S1</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that fusion often occurs between precursors on adjacent microtubules. Fusion events can occur both apically and basally within hair cells. More apical fusion events are likely a way to increase ribbon size early in development. More basal fusion events could represent the synapse reduction and refinement that occurs later in synapse development. Whether these later, basal fusion events occur after postsynaptic elements are present is unclear and awaits additional studies. Importantly we found that the number of fusion events decreased when microtubule networks were disrupted or when Kif1aa was absent (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). Together these results confirm the hypothesis that ribbons fuse during development. In addition, our work demonstrates that microtubules and Kif1aa are necessary for fusion and may help facilitate this process.</p>
<p>Ribbons are aggregates of proteins that share many features with biomolecular condensates that form through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Biomolecular condensates are nano-to micro-meter scale compartments that function to concentrate proteins and nucleic acids. Some examples of biomolecular condensates include tight junctions, postsynaptic densities, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, and stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wiegand and Hyman, 2020</xref>). These condensates are highly mobile and dynamic and constituent molecules diffuse readily and exchange with the surrounding environment. Biomolecular condensates often undergo fusion to form larger ones, and then shrink into a spherical shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wiegand and Hyman, 2020</xref>). FRAP analyses of Ribeye-GFP labeled ribbons in hair cells have confirmed that tagged Ribeye has a fast recovery phase within ribbons, verifying that Ribeye is highly mobile and dynamic within ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Graydon et al., 2017</xref>). Further, these FRAP studies revealed that Ribeye molecules can exchange with the surrounding environment. Our present studies confirmed that ribbon precursors undergo fusion to form larger spherical ribbons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A,B</xref>). Together these studies point towards the idea that precursors and ribbons are indeed biomolecular condensates. Ribeye also contains sequences predicted to be intrinsically disordered, a feature of molecules that can mediate condensate formation. Interestingly, several biomolecular condensates such as RNP transport granules are known to be transported along the microtubules (Knowles at al., 1996), similar to our observations of ribbon precursor transport.</p>
<p>In our current study, we also found that microtubules are needed for fusion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). In other cellular contexts, the energy released by dynamic microtubules via growth and shrinkage can be used for force generation in a wide range of processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vleugel et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, work on stress granule condensates found a connection between dynamic microtubules and stress granule formation. This work demonstrated that microtubule growth and shrinkage promoted the fusion of small cytoplasmic granules into larger ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chernov et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, this study also demonstrated that stress granules slide along microtubules and that this movement may act in conjunction with pushing or pulling to promote fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chernov et al., 2009</xref>). Ribbons and microtubules may also interact during development to promote fusion. Disrupting microtubules could interfere with this process, preventing ribbon maturation. Consistent with this, short-term (3-4 hr) and long-term (overnight) nocodazole increased ribbon and precursor numbers (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6AG</xref>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting reduced fusion. Long-term treatment (overnight) resulted in a shift toward smaller ribbons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H-I</xref>), and ultimately fewer complete synapses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>We also observed that fusion was disrupted in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants, despite finding that directed transport of precursors and ribbons remained unchanged in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>,<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). A recent study on RNP condensates examined kinesin motors and adaptors in the context of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cochard et al., 2023</xref>). This work found that the precise combination of motor proteins or adaptors can impact where condensates form. Some combinations enabled the formation and transport of condensates along microtubules. However, other combinations restricted condensate formation to microtubule terminals where motor proteins are predicted to form a scaffold. Our work indicates that while more than one kinesin motor protein is capable of transporting ribbon precursors, it is predominantly Kif1aa that mediates fusion along microtubules. This could explain why precursor fusion, but not transport is impacted in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>,<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). This scenario could also account for the increased number of precursors and the reduced number of complete synapses observed in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Kinesin motors and adaptors for ribbon transport on microtubules</title>
<p>Our immunohistochemistry analyses show clear synaptic defects in <italic>kif1aa</italic> mutants after the bulk of synapse formation has occurred (fewer synapses, more precursors, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Despite these defects, we were unable to demonstrate that loss of Kif1aa impacts the movement of precursors along microtubules (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). These results suggest that another kinesin motor may function to transport precursors and ribbons. Pulldown assays have shown an interaction of Kif3a with Ribeye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Uthaiah and Hudspeth, 2010</xref>). While <italic>kif1aa</italic> mRNA is the most abundant kinesin motor protein transcript detected in pLL hair cells, <italic>kif3a</italic> mRNA is also present. <italic>Kif3a</italic> mRNA is present at lower levels and is expressed more broadly in pLL hair cells, supporting cells, and afferent neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sur et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, both Kif1aa and Kif3a may be competent to transport developing ribbons. Future work exploring the role of Kif3a separately or in combination with Kif1aa will illuminate the role these motors play in synapse assembly in hair cells. In addition, it will be useful to visualize these kinesins by fluorescently tagging them in live hair cells to observe whether they associate with ribbons.</p>
<p>Regardless of the anterograde kinesin motor(s) that transports precursors to the cell base, we also observed that precursors can also move in the retrograde direction, towards the cell apex (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> bottom panels, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-3">Figure 3-S1B</xref>). In fact, out of the tracks with directional motion, we found that 20.8 % of precursors moved apically. This could be due to the fact that a subpopulation of microtubules shows plus-end mediated growth apically (22.8 %).</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible that retrograde motors may also transport ribbon precursors. For example, this could be accomplished using minus-end directed motors, such as cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain, or kinesins in the kinesin-14 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Sweeney and Holzbaur, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>). In the future, it will be important to explore the role of these additional motor proteins in the context of ribbon and precursor mobility.</p>
<p>Our findings indicate that ribbons and precursors show directed motion indicative of motor-mediated transport (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). While a subset of ribbons moves directionally with α values &gt; 1, canonical motor-driven transport in other systems, such as axonal transport, can achieve even higher α values approaching 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bellotti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Corradi et al., 2020</xref>). We suggest that relatively lower α values arise from the highly dynamic nature of microtubules in hair cells. In axons, microtubules form stable, linear tracks that allow kinesins to transport cargo with high velocity. In contrast, the microtubule network in hair cells is highly dynamic, particularly near the cell base. Within a single time frame (50-100 s), we observe continuous movement and branching of these networks. This dynamic behavior adds complexity to ribbon motion, leading to frequent stalling, filament switching, and reversals in direction. As a result, ribbon transport appears less directional than the movement of traditional motor cargoes along stable axonal filaments, resulting in lower α values compared to canonical motor-mediated transport. Notably, treatment with taxol, which stabilizes microtubules, increased α values to levels closer to those observed in canonical motor-driven transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-7">Figure 7-S1</xref>). This finding supports the idea that the relatively lower α values in hair cells are a consequence of a more dynamic microtubule network. Overall, this dynamic network gives rise to a slower, non-canonical mode of transport.</p>
<p>Another important component of motor-mediated transport is adaptor proteins that selectively link cargo to specific motor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>). In neurons, cargos leave the Golgi apparatus and are packed into specialized transport vesicles, along with adaptor scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Farías et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sampo et al., 2003</xref>). Work in neurons has shown that the Kif1a motor transports Rab3-positive synaptic vesicle precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Okada et al., 1995</xref>). This transport is thought to rely on DENN (differentially expressed in normal and neoplastic cells)/MADD (MAP kinase activating death domain) which links synaptic vesicle precursors to Kif1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hummel and Hoogenraad, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Niwa et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, like mature ribbons, ribbon precursors are decorated with synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, is it possible that these synaptic vesicles may contain adaptor proteins that couple the ribbon to a kinesin motor to enable transport. In the future, it will be important to identify this adaptor protein and to understand what other molecules are co-transported with Ribeye during ribbon formation.</p>

<title>Ribbon formation in the absence of microtubules</title>
<p>Our work indicates that over short time scales (30-70 min), microtubule destabilization via nocodazole treatment reduces the number of ribbons and precursors that show directed motion indicative of active transport (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, prolonged nocodazole treatment throughout development (16 hrs) leads to the formation of fewer synapses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). But in both treatment paradigms, some ribbons still show directed motion, and some synapses continue to form despite microtubule disruption. If tracks of microtubules are required for developing precursor and ribbon mobility during development, what underlies this residual movement and synapse formation?</p>
<p>One possibility is that not all microtubules are disrupted after nocodazole treatment. While high doses of nocodazole (∼40 µM) eliminate all microtubules, they are also cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Laisne et al., 2021</xref>). The doses used in our experiments (100-500 nM) were not cytotoxic, although higher doses did result in the death of hair cells. At these lower doses, microtubules— especially the more apical, stable population (see examples: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-2">Figure 2-S1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1-4">Figure 4-S1F-G</xref>)— were not entirely disrupted. Residual ribbon mobility during nocodazole treatment could occur along these remaining microtubules. Alternatively, other cytoskeletal components, such as actin or intermediate filaments may contribute to ribbon mobility. Work in mouse IHCs has shown that actin filaments help regulate and organize synaptic vesicles at mature ribbon synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Guillet et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, in mice, the actin-based motor protein Myosin6 has been implicated in ribbon-synapse formation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Roux et al., 2009</xref>). A third possibility is that ribbons and precursors move through the cytoplasm via diffusion and are captured at the AZ via an adapter protein. Although we primarily observed ribbons and precursors attached to microtubules, when these filaments are destabilized using nocodazole, movement could still occur via diffusion. Once near the base of the cell, presynaptic molecules such as Bassoon, could act to anchor ribbons at the AZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jing et al., 2013</xref>). Any of these scenarios—residual microtubule-based transport, alternative cytoskeletal component, or diffusion followed by capture—could explain how ribbons continue to move and how synapses still form in the absence of intact microtubules. In all likelihood, a combination of these processes is required to ensure that ribbon synapses form properly. Additional pharmacological and imaging experiments are needed to delineate the relative contributions of these processes.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is the potential off-target effects of nocodazole. Even at non-cytotoxic doses, nocodazole toxicity may impact ribbons and synapses independently of its effects on microtubules. While this is less of a concern in the short- and medium-term experiments (30 min to 4 hr), long-term treatments (16 hrs) could introduce confounding effects. Additionally, nocodazole treatment is not hair cell-specific and could disrupt microtubule organization within afferent terminals as well. Thus, the reduction in ribbon-synapse formation following prolonged nocodazole treatment may result from microtubule disruption in hair cells, afferent terminals, or a combination of the two.</p>

<title>Does spontaneous activity shape ribbon transport or fusion?</title>
<p>In previous work, we demonstrated that spontaneous calcium activity impacts ribbon formation in pLL hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sheets et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Spontaneous activity is well documented in developing sensory systems [reviewed in: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Leighton and Lohmann, 2016</xref>)]. In the inner ear of mammals, spontaneous activity in sensory hair cells is thought to act during development to establish neuronal connections within the inner ear, and downstream in the brain to shape tonotopic maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ceriani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tritsch et al., 2007</xref>). In our previous work in pLL hair cells, we found that spontaneous rises in presynaptic calcium loads calcium into synaptic mitochondria. Calcium loading into the mitochondria regulates the amount of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NAD(H) in the developing hair cell. Blocking either presynaptic or mitochondria calcium during development results in higher levels of NAD<sup>+</sup>, the formation of larger ribbons, fewer synapses, and the retention of small ribbon precursors in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Sheets et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). What aspect of ribbon formation is impacted by spontaneous activity remains unclear.</p>
<p>Work in yeast has shown that calcium is important for microtubule stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adamíková et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Façanha et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, work in dendritic spines has shown that synaptic calcium responses promote microtubule entry into active spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Merriam et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, it is possible that spontaneous calcium activity may act to stabilize microtubules or facilitate movement to the presynaptic AZ to facilitate ribbon transport. In addition to altering the microtubule network, spontaneous activity could also impact ribbon fusion. Protein condensate formation and fusion are influenced by many aspects of the cellular environment, including temperature, pH, osmolarity, and ion concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Elevated calcium can promote the fusion of chromogranin proteins that undergo LLPS in the Golgi lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gerdes et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Yoo, 1995</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that elevated calcium during a spontaneous calcium event could promote ribbon or precursor fusion. In addition to the cellular environment, posttranslational modifications to the proteins within the condensate can impact formation and LLPS. Such modifications include: phosphorylation, acetylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination, methylation, and ADP-ribosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). These modifications can alter protein-protein interactions by changing the charge, structure, or hydrophobicity. Our previous work indicated that NAD<sup>+</sup> or NAD(H) via a NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH binding domain on Ribeye impacts ribbon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that in addition to calcium, NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH levels in the cell could modify Ribeye to facilitate condensate formation or fusion. In the future, it will be important to use the live imaging approaches outlined here to understand how spontaneous presynaptic- and mitochondrial-calcium influx impact the movement and fusion of ribbon precursors.</p>
<p>Overall, our live imaging studies demonstrate that microtubule networks are critical for ribbon and precursor mobility, and fusion in developing zebrafish hair cells. However, ribbon synapses contain many molecules, and synapse formation requires many successive steps. In the future it will be important to develop approaches to endogenously tag and label other presynaptic (Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, Bassoon, Piccolino) and postsynaptic proteins (PSD95, GluR2/3/4) that make up ribbon synapses. For this future work, zebrafish is an ideal model system for creating these new genetic tools and for live imaging. By imaging ribbons, along with these other tagged synaptic components, we will gain a more comprehensive picture of synapse formation. Understanding how ribbon synapses form is essential to determining how to reform synapses when they are disrupted in auditory and visual disorders.</p>

<p>To destabilize or stabilize microtubules, larval zebrafish at 2 dpf were incubated in either nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich, SML1665) or Paclitaxel (taxol) (Sigma-Aldrich, 5082270001). Both drugs were maintained in DMSO. For experiments these drugs were diluted in media for a final concentration of 0.1 % DMSO, 250-500 nM nocodazole, and 25 µM taxol. For controls, larvae were incubated in media containing 0.1 % DMSO. For long-term incubation (16 hr), wild-type larvae were incubated in E3 media containing 250 nM nocodazole or 25 µM taxol at 54 hpf for 16 hrs (overnight).

Transgenic larvae were pinned to a Sylgard-filled petri dish in E3 media containing 0.03 % tricaine and imaged on a Nikon A1R upright confocal microscope using a 60x 1 NA water objective lens. Denoised images were acquired using NIS Elements AR 5.20.02 with an 0.425 µm z-interval, at, 16x averaging, and 0.05 µm/pixel. Z-stacks of whole neuromasts including the kinocilium were acquired in a top-down configuration using 488 and 561 nm lasers. The 488 nm laser along with a transmitted PMT (T-PMT) detector was used to capture the kinocilial heights.</p>
<p>For the quantification of ribbon numbers at different developmental stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), a custom-written Fiji macro “Live ribbon counter” was used to batch-process the z-stacks. The red channel (Riba-TagRFP) of each z-stack was thresholded (threshold value = 97). Watershed was applied to the thresholded stack to separate ribbons near each other. The resulting mask from the thresholding and watershedding was applied to the original red channel. The number of ribbons was then counted using ‘3D Objects Counter’ plugin (Threshold = 1, min size = 0, max size = 183500). The counted objects were merged with the green channel (YFP-tubulin). Each z-stack was visually inspected to determine the localization of the ribbons. Ribbons below the nucleus were classified as ‘basal’ and the rest as ‘apical’. The number of apical and basal ribbons was counted in each hair cell.</p>
<p>To classify the developmental stage of each hair cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), the height of the kinocilium was used.

The timelapses were visually checked to make sure the spot detection was accurate. For the tracking step, the ‘Autoregressive motion’ algorithm was used, with a maximum linking distance of 1 µm and a maximum gap size of 3 frames.

<title>Confocal imaging and <bold>in vivo</bold> analysis of ribbon numbers after short-term pharmacological treatments in zebrafish</title>
<p>For counting ribbons after 3-4 hr drug treatment, transgenic zebrafish expressing <italic>myo6b:riba-TagRFP</italic> and <italic>myo6b:YFP-tubulin</italic> at 2 dpf were examined. Transgenic larvae were mounted in 1 % low melt agarose in E3 media containing 0.03 % tricaine and one of the following: 500 nM nocodazole, 25 µM taxol or 0.1 % DMSO (control). Samples were imaged on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 (Zen 2.3 SP1) confocal microscope with Airyscan, along with a 63x NA 1.4 oil objective lens. Z-stacks encompassing the entire neuromast were acquired every 0.18 µm with an 0.04 µm x-y pixel size and Airyscan autoprocessed in 3D.</p>
<p>To quantification of ribbon numbers before and after 3-4 hr nocodazole and taxol treatment or in <italic>kif1aa</italic> F0 crispants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2-6">Figure 6-S2</xref>), the custom-written Fiji macro “Live ribbon counter” described above was used to batch-processed the z-stacks. The red channel (Riba-TagRFP) of each z-stack was thresholded (threshold value = 28) and segmented (watershed). The resulting mask was applied to the original red channel. The number of ribbons was then counted using ‘3D Objects Counter’ (threshold = 1, min size = 0, max size = 183500).</p>
<p>The counted objects were merged with the green channel (YFP-tubulin). Each z-stack was visually inspected to make sure the objects counted were within hair cells. The number of ribbons per neuromast was determined and divided by the number of hair cells. The difference in ribbon numbers pre- and post-drug treatment was plotted.</p>

<title>Confocal imaging and <bold><italic>in vivo</italic></bold> tracking of ribbons</title>
<p>To visualize ribbon precursor movement, timelapses of double transgenic <italic>myo6b:riba-TagRFP</italic> and <italic>myo6b:YFP-tubulin</italic> larvae at 2 dpf were imaged. For pharmacological treatments, transgenic larvae were mounted in 1 % low melt agarose in E3 media containing 0.03 % tricaine and one of the following: 500 nM nocodazole, 25 µM taxol or 0.1 % DMSO (control) in a glass-bottom dish. Double transgenic <italic>kif1aa</italic> crispants and uninjected controls were mounted in 1 % low melt agarose in E3 media containing 0.03 % tricaine in a glass-bottom dish. Larvae were imaged on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 or an upright LSM 980 confocal microscope with Airyscan using a 63x 1.4 NA oil objective lens. Airyscan z-stacks of partial cell volumes (∼3 µm, 15-20 z-slices using 0.18 µm z-interval and an 0.04 µm x-y pixel size) were taken on the LSM 780 every 50-100 s for 30-70 min. Faster LSM 980 Airyscan z-stacks of partial cell volumes (∼2-3.5 µm, 12-20 z-slices using 0.17 µm z interval and an 0.04 µm x-y pixel size) were taken every 3-20 s for 5-40 min. Airyscan timelapses were autoprocessed in 3D. In addition, we acquired a subset of LSM 780 Airyscan z-stacks every 5-8 min for 30-100 min to capture fusion events more clearly for <xref rid="video9" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movies S9-S11</xref>.</p>
<p>Timelapses were registered using the FIJI plugin “Correct 3D drift”. Drift-corrected timelapses were then tracked in 3D in Imaris using spot detection with estimated xy diameters of 0.427 µm (with background subtraction). The spots were filtered based on ‘Quality’, with thresholds between 3-8, chosen after visual inspection of the detected spots. For tracking, the ‘Autoregressive motion’ algorithm was used with a maximum linking distance of 1.13 µm and a maximum gap size of 1 frame. Tracks with number of spots &lt; 5 were not included. Using the track displacement length filter in Imaris, the number of tracks with track displacement length &gt; 1 µm were counted and divided by the total number of tracks to get the fractions plotted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. Vectors generated in Imaris were used to manually determine the location and direction of tracks with track displacement length &gt; 1 µm. For the mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis, the xyzt coordinates were exported in ‘csv’ format for all tracks in a timelapse. The MSD analysis was done using the prewritten MATLAB class MSDanalyzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tarantino et al., 2014</xref>). MSDanalyzer calculates the mean squared displacement for each track, curve-fits the MSD vs time, and provides the value of the exponent (a). The first 25 % of the MSD vs time graph was used for curve-fitting. Tracks with the number of spots &lt; 10 were removed to ensure the accuracy of the MSD analysis. Fusion events between ribbons and precursors were scored manually in these timelapses.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All data shown are mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). All experiments were compiled from data acquired on at least two independent days from different clutches. All replicates were biological–distinct animals and cells. Wild-type animals were selected at random for drug treatments. Datasets were excluded if there was excessive x-y-or z drift. In all datasets dot plots represent the ‘n’. N represents either the number of neuromasts, hair cells, synapses, or puncta as stated in the legends. For all zebrafish experiments, a minimum of 3 animals and 6 neuromasts were examined. Sample sizes were selected to avoid Type 2 error. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 10 software (GraphPad). A D’Agostino-Pearson normality test was used to test for normal distributions. To test for statistical significance between two samples, either unpaired t-tests (normally distributed data) or Wilcoxon or Mann-Whitney tests (non-normally distributed data) were used. For multiple comparisons, a one-way ANOVA was used. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<p>Timelapse movie of a pLL neuromast at 2 dpf. A partial cell volume was captured at 50 s intervals for 18 min with a Zeiss LSM 780 with Airyscan. Microtubules are marked with YFP-tubulin (green), ribbons and precursors are marked with Riba-TagRFP (magenta). Maximum-intensity projections of the original z-stacks are shown, played at 5 frames per second. On the left side is a timelapse of the hair cell showing a ribbon precursor moving along a microtubule toward the cell apex. On the right is a higher magnification view of this precursor, with the tracks of the ribbon precursor during the timelapse. The circle indicates a spot identified using TrackMate, along with the track of the moving ribbon shown in yellow. This example is the same as <xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-S1B</xref>. Scale bar = 2 µm.</p>

<caption><title>Precursor switching between microtubules.</title>
<p>Timelapse movie of a pLL neuromast at 2 dpf. A partial cell volume was captured at ∼100 s intervals for 40 min with a Zeiss LSM 980 with Airyscan. Microtubules are marked with YFP-tubulin (green), ribbons and precursors are marked with Riba-TagRFP (magenta). Maximum-intensity projections of the original z-stacks are shown, played at 5 frames per second. On the left side is a timelapse of the hair cell showing a ribbon precursor moving along a microtubule toward the hair cell apex; the precursor then moves to another microtubule. On the right is a higher magnification view of the ribbon precursor during the timelapse. The precursor movement is quite fast and at this interval can be observed twice in a single z-stack during movement between microtubules at timepoints 2,4, and 15. This example is the same as Figure 3-S1C. Scale bar = 2 µm.</p>

<caption><title>Microtubule dynamics in hair cells change upon treatment with nocodazole and taxol.</title>
<p>Timelapse movies of pLL neuromasts at 2 dpf captured after treatment with 0.1 % DMSO (control, left side), 25 µM taxol (Taxol, middle), or 250 nM nocodazole (Noc, right side) for 30 min. Microtubules are marked with YFP-tubulin (gray) and ribbons are marked with Riba-TagRFP (magenta). The timelapses of partial cell volumes were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 780 with Airyscan every 50-80 s for 30 min. Maximum-intensity projections of the original z-stacks are shown, played at 5 frames per second. The taxol-treated neuromast has more stabilized microtubules and very little cytoplasmic tubulin (depolymerized tubulin), indicating that the microtubules are more stable than the control. In the nocodazole-treated neuromast, there are fewer microtubules and more diffuse cytoplasmic tubulin compared to the control. Scale bar = 2 µm.</p>

<caption><title>Ribbon precursors attached to microtubules undergo fusion.</title>
<p>Timelapse movie of a pLL neuromast at 2 dpf. A partial cell volume was captured at 4.8 min intervals for 100 min with a Zeiss LSM 780 with Airyscan. Microtubules are marked with YFP-tubulin (green) and ribbons are marked with Riba-TagRFP (magenta). Maximum-intensity projections of the original z-stacks are shown, played at 5 frames per second. Two ribbon precursors associate with microtubules and fuse near the hair cell base. This example is the same as <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A-B</xref>. Scale bar = 2 µm.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study provides new insights into the maturation of ribbon synapses in zebrafish neuromast hair cells. Live-cell imaging and pharmacological and genetic manipulations together provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that the formation of this synaptic organelle is a dynamic process involving the fusion of presynaptic elements and microtubule transport, though the evidence that ribbon precursors move in a directed motion toward the active zone is less persuasive.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors set out to resolve a long-standing mystery in the field of sensory biology - how large, presynaptic bodies called &quot;ribbon synapses&quot; migrate to the basolateral end of hair cells. The ribbon synapse is found in sensory hair cells and photoreceptors, and is a critical structural feature of a readily releasable pool of glutamate that excites postsynaptic afferent neurons. For decades, we have known these structures exist, but the mechanisms that control how ribbon synapses coalesce at the bottom of hair cells is not well understood. The authors addressed this question by leveraging the highly-tractable zebrafish lateral line neuromast, which exhibits a small number of visible hair cells, easily observed in time-lapse imaging. The approach combined genetics, pharmacological manipulations, high-resolution imaging and careful quantifications. The manuscript commences with a developmental time course of ribbon synapse development, characterizing both immature and mature ribbon bodies (defined by position in the hair cell, apical vs. basal). Next, the authors show convincing (and frankly mesmerizing) imaging data of plus end-directed microtubule trafficking toward the basal end of the hair cells, and data highlighting the directed motion of ribbon bodies. The authors then use a series of pharmacological and genetic manipulations showing the role of microtubule stability and one particular kinesin (Kif1aa) in the transport and fusion of ribbon bodies, which is presumably all prerequisite for hair cell synaptic transmission. The data suggest that microtubules and their stability is necessary for normal numbers of mature ribbons, and that Kif1aa is likely required for fusion events associated with ribbon maturation. Overall, the data provide a new and interesting story on ribbon synapse dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript offers comprehensive Introduction and Discussion sections that will inform generalists and specialists.</p>
<p>
(2) The use of Airyscan imaging in living samples to view and measure microtubule and ribbon dynamics in vivo represents a strength. With the rigorous quantification and thoughtful analyses, the authors generate datasets often only gotten in cultured cells or more diminutive animal models (e.g., C. elegans).</p>
<p>
(3) The number of biological replicates and the statistical analyses are strong. The combination of pharmacology and genetic manipulations also represents strong rigor.</p>
<p>
(4) One of the most important strengths is that the manuscript and data spur on other questions - namely, do (or how do) ribbon bodies attach to Kinesin proteins? Also, and as noted in the Discussion, do hair cell activity and subsequent intracellular calcium rises facilitate ribbon transport/fusion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript uses live imaging to study the role of microtubules in the movement of ribeye aggregates in neuromast hair cells in zebrafish. The main findings are that</p>
<p>(1) Ribeye aggregates, assumed to be ribbon precursors, move in a directed motion toward the active zone;</p>
<p>
(2) Disruption of microtubules and kif1aa increases the number of ribeye aggregates and decreases the number of mature synapses.</p>
<p>The evidence for point 2 is compelling, while the evidence for point 1 is less convincing. In particular, the directed motion conclusion is dependent upon fitting of mean squared displacement that can be prone to error and variance to do stochasticity, which is not accounted for in the analysis. Only a small subset of the aggregates meet this criteria and one wonders whether the focus on this subset misses the bigger picture of what is happening with the majority of spots.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The effects of Kif1aa removal and nocodozole on ribbon precursor number and size is convincing and novel.</p>
<p>
(2) The live imaging of Ribeye aggregate dynamics provides interesting insight into ribbon formation. The movies showing fusion of ribeye spots are convincing and the demonstrated effects of nocodozole and kif1aa removal on the frequency of these events is novel.</p>
<p>
(3) The effect of nocodozole and kif1aa removal on precursor fusion is novel and interesting.</p>
<p>
(4) The quality of the data is extremely high and the results are interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) To image ribeye aggregates, the investigators overexpressed Ribeye-a TAGRFP under control of a MyoVI promoter. While it is understandable why they chose to do the experiments this way, expression is not under the same transcriptional regulation as the native protein and some caution is warranted in drawing some conclusions. For example, the reduction in the number of puncta with maturity may partially reflect regulation of the MyoVI promoter with hair cell maturity. Similarly, it is unknown whether overexpression has the potential to saturate binding sites (for example to motors), which could influence mobility. In the revised manuscript, the authors provide evidence to suggest that overexpression is not at unreasonably high levels, which is reasonable. However, I think it remains important to think of these caveats while reading the paper--especially keeping in mind that expression timing is undoubtedly influenced by the transcriptional control of the exogenous promoter .</p>
<p>
(2) The examples of punctae colocalizing with microtubules look clear (fig 1 F-G), but the presentation is anecdotal. It would be better and more informative, if quantified.</p>
<p>
(3) It appears that any directed transport may be rare. Simply having an alpha &gt;1 is not sufficient to declare movement to be directed (motor driven transport typically has an alpha approaching 2). Due to randomness of a random walk and errors in fits in imperfect data will yield some spread in movement driven by Brownian motion. Many of the tracks in figure 3H look as thought they might be reasonably fit by a straight line (i.e. alpha = 1).</p>
<p>
(4) The &quot;directed motion&quot; shown here does not really resemble motor driven transport observed in other systems (axonal transport, for example) even in the subset that have been picked out as examples here. While the role for microtubules and kif1aa in synapse maturation is strong, it seems likely that this role may be something non-canonical (which would be interesting). In the revision, the authors do an excellent job of considering the issues brought up in point 3 and 4. While perhaps no longer a weakness, I am leaving the critiques here for context for the readers to consider. The added taxol results may not completely settle the issue, but are interesting and provide important information.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Hussain and collaborators aims at deciphering the microtubule-dependent ribbon formation in zebrafish hair cells. By using confocal imaging, pharmacology tools, and zebrafish mutants, the group of Katie Kindt convincingly demonstrated that ribbon, the organelle that concentrates glutamate-filled vesicles at the hair cell synapse, originates from the fusion of precursors that move along the microtubule network. This study goes hand in hand with a complementary paper (Voorn et al.) showing similar results in mouse hair cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study clearly tracked the dynamics of the microtubules, and those of the microtubule-associated ribbons and demonstrated fusion ribbon events. In addition, the authors have identified the critical role of kinesin Kif1aa in the fusion events. The results are compelling and the images and movies are magnificent.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The lack of functional data regarding the role of Kif1aa. Although it is difficult to probe and interpret the behavior of zebrafish after nocodazole treatment, I wonder whether deletion of kif1aa in hair cells may result in a functional deficit that could be easily tested in zebrafish?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have examined functional deficits in kif1aa mutants in another paper that was recently accepted: David et al. 2024. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39373584/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39373584/</ext-link></p>
<p>In David et al., we found that in addition to a subtle role in ribbon fusion during development, Kif1aa plays a major role in enriching glutamate-filled synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic active zone of mature hair cells. In kif1aa mutants, synaptic vesicles are no longer enriched at the hair cell base, and there is a reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles associated with presynaptic ribbons. Further, we demonstrated that kif1aa mutants also have functional defects including reductions in spontaneous vesicle release (from hair cells) and evoked postsynaptic calcium responses. Behaviorally, kif1aa mutants exhibit impaired rheotaxis, indicating defects in the lateral-line system and an inability to accurately detect water flow. Because our current paper focuses on microtubule-associated ribbon movement and dynamics early in hair-cell development, we have only discussed the effects of Kif1aa directly related to ribbon dynamics during this time window. In our revision, we have referenced this recent work. Currently it is challenging to disentangle how the subtle defects in ribbon formation in kif1aa mutants contribute to the defects we observe in ribbon-synapse function.</p>
<p>Added to results:</p>
<p>“Recent work in our lab using this mutant has shown that Kif1aa is responsible for enriching glutamate-filled vesicles at the base of hair cells. In addition this work demonstrated that loss of Kif1aa results in functional defects in mature hair cells including a reduction in evoked post-synaptic calcium responses (David et al., 2024). We hypothesized that Kif1aa may also be playing an earlier role in ribbon formation.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The synaptogenesis in the auditory sensory cell remains still elusive. Here, this study indicates that the formation of the synaptic organelle is a dynamic process involving the fusion of presynaptic elements. This study will undoubtedly boost a new line of research aimed at identifying the specific molecular determinants that target ribbon precursors to the synapse and govern the fusion process.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>These are important strengths and as stated we are currently investigating what other kinesins and adaptors and adaptor’s transport ribbons. We have ongoing work examining how hair-cell activity impacts ribbon fusion and transport!</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Neither the data or the Discussion address a direct or indirect link between Kinesins and ribbon bodies. Showing Kif1aa protein in proximity to the ribbon bodies would add strength.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a great point. Previous immunohistochemistry work in mice demonstrated that ribbons and Kif1a colocalize in mouse hair cells (Michanski et al, 2019). Unfortunately, the antibody used in study work did not work in zebrafish. To further investigate this interaction, we also attempted to create a transgenic line expressing a fluorescently tagged Kif1aa to directly visualize its association with ribbons in vivo. At present, we were unable to detect transient expression of Kif1aa-GFP or establish a transgenic line using this approach. While we will continue to work towards understanding whether Kif1aa and ribbons colocalize in live hair cells, currently this goal is beyond the scope of this paper. In our revision we discuss this caveat.</p>
<p>Added to discussion:</p>
<p>“In addition, it will be useful to visualize these kinesins by fluorescently tagging them in live hair cells to observe whether they associate with ribbons.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Neither the data or Discussion address the functional consequences of loss of Kif1aa or ribbon transport. Presumably, both manipulations would reduce afferent excitation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Excellent point. Please see the response above to Reviewer #1 public response weaknesses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is unknown whether the drug treatments or genetic manipulations are specific to hair cells, so we can't know for certain whether any phenotypic defects are secondary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is correct and a caveat of our Kif1aa and drug experiments. In our recently published work, we confirmed that Kif1aa is expressed in hair cells and neurons, while kif1ab is present just is neurons. Therefore, it is likely that the ribbon formation defects in kif1aa mutants are restricted to hair cells. We added this expression information to our results:</p>
<p>“ScRNA-seq in zebrafish has demonstrated widespread co-expression of kif1ab and kif1aa mRNA in the nervous system. Additionally, both scRNA-seq and fluorescent in situ hybridization have revealed that pLL hair cells exclusively express kif1aa mRNA (David et al., 2024; Lush et al., 2019; Sur et al., 2023).”</p>
<p>Non-hair cell effects are a real concern in our pharmacology experiments. To mitigate this in our pharmacological experiments, we have performed drug treatments at 3 different timescales: long-term (overnight), short-term (4 hr) and fast (30 min) treatments. The fast experiments were done after 30 min nocodazole drug treatment, and after this treatment we observed reduced directional motion and fusions. This fast drug treatment should not incur any long-term changes or developmental defects as hair-cell development occurs over 12-16 hrs. However, we acknowledge that drug treatments could have secondary phenotypic effects or effects that are not hair-cell specific. In our revision, we discuss these issues.</p>
<p>Added to discussion:</p>
<p>“Another important consideration is the potential off-target effects of nocodazole. Even at non-cytotoxic doses, nocodazole toxicity may impact ribbons and synapses independently of its effects on microtubules. While this is less of a concern in the short- and medium-term experiments (30-70 min and 4 hr), long-term treatments (16 hrs) could introduce confounding effects. Additionally, nocodazole treatment is not hair cell-specific and could disrupt microtubule organization within afferent terminals as well. Thus, the reduction in ribbon-synapse formation following prolonged nocodazole treatment may result from microtubule disruption in hair cells, afferent terminals, or a combination of the two.”</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript uses live imaging to study the role of microtubules in the movement of ribeye aggregates in neuromast hair cells in zebrafish. The main findings are that</p>

<p>The evidence for point 2 is compelling, while the evidence for point 1 is less convincing. In particular, the directed motion conclusion is dependent upon fitting of mean squared displacement that can be prone to error and variance to do stochasticity, which is not accounted for in the analysis. Only a small subset of the aggregates meet this criteria and one wonders whether the focus on this subset misses the bigger picture of what is happening with the majority of spots.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>

<p>(3) The effect of nocodozole and kif1aa removal on precursor fusion is novel and interesting.</p>
<p>(4) The quality of the data is extremely high and the results are interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) To image ribeye aggregates, the investigators overexpressed Ribeye-a TAGRFP under the control of a MyoVI promoter. While it is understandable why they chose to do the experiments this way, expression is not under the same transcriptional regulation as the native protein, and some caution is warranted in drawing some conclusions. For example, the reduction in the number of puncta with maturity may partially reflect the regulation of the MyoVI promoter with hair cell maturity. Similarly, it is unknown whether overexpression has the potential to saturate binding sites (for example motors), which could influence mobility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that overexpression of transgenes under using a non-endogenous promoter in transgenic lines is an important consideration. Ideally, we would do these experiments with endogenously expressed fluorescent proteins under a native promoter. However, this was not technically possible for us. The decrease in precursors is likely not due to regulation by the myo6a promoter. Although the myo6a promoter comes on early in hair cell development, the promoter only gets stronger as the hair cells mature. This would lead to a continued increase rather than a decrease in puncta numbers with development.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Protein tags such as tagRFP always have the caveat of impacting protein function. This is in partly why we complemented our live imaging with analyses in fixed tissue without transgenes (kif1aa mutants and nocodazole/taxol treatments).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our revision, we did perform an immunolabel on <italic>myo6b:riba-tagRFP</italic> transgenic fish and found that Riba-tagRFP expression did not impact ribbon synapse numbers or ribbon size. This analysis argues that the transgene is expressed at a level that does not impact ribbon synapses. This data is summarized in Figure 1-S1.</p>
<p>Added to the results:</p>
<p>“Although this latter transgene expresses Riba-TagRFP under a non-endogenous promoter, neither the tag nor the promoter ultimately impacts cell numbers, synapse counts, or ribbon size (Figure 1-S1A-E).”</p>
<p>Added to methods:</p>
<p>“<italic>Tg(myo6b:ctbp2a-TagRFP)<sup>idc11Tg</sup></italic> reliably labels mature ribbons, similar to a pan-CTBP immunolabel at 5 dpf (Figure 1-S1B). This transgenic line does not alter the number of hair cells or complete synapses per hair cell (Figure 1-S1A-D). In addition, <italic>myo6b:ctbp2a-TagRFP</italic> does not alter the size of ribbons (Figure 1-S1E).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The examples of punctae colocalizing with microtubules look clear (Figures 1 F-G), but the presentation is anecdotal. It would be better and more informative, if quantified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did attempt a co-localization analysis between microtubules and ribbons but did not move forward with it due to several issues:</p>
<p>(1) Hair cells have an extremely crowded environment, especially since the nucleus occupies the majority of the cell. All proteins are pushed together in the small space surrounding the nucleus and ultimately, we found that co-localization analyses were not meaningful because the distances were too small.</p>
<p>(2) We also attempted to segment microtubules in these images and quantify how many ribbons were associated with microtubules, but 3D microtubule segmentation was not accurate in hair cells due to highly varying filament intensities, filament dynamics and the presence of diffuse cytoplasmic tubulin signal.</p>
<p>Because of these challenges we concluded the best evidence of ribbon-microtubule association is through visualization of ribbons and their association with microtubules over time (in our timelapses). We see that ribbons localize to microtubules in all our timelapses, including the examples shown (Movies S2-S10). The only instance of ribbon dissociation it when ribbons switch from one filament to another. We did not observe free-floating ribbons in our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It appears that any directed transport may be rare. Simply having an alpha &gt;1 is not sufficient to declare movement to be directed (motor-driven transport typically has an alpha approaching 2). Due to the randomness of a random walk and errors in fits in imperfect data will yield some spread in movement driven by Brownian motion. Many of the tracks in Figure 3H look as though they might be reasonably fit by a straight line (i.e. alpha = 1).</p>
<p>(4) The &quot;directed motion&quot; shown here does not really resemble motor-driven transport observed in other systems (axonal transport, for example) even in the subset that has been picked out as examples here.

</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, it is true, that directed transport of ribbon precursors is relatively rare. Only a small subset of the ribbon precursors moves directionally (α &gt; 1, 20 %) or have a displacement distance &gt; 1 µm (36 %) during the time windows we are imaging. The majority of the ribbons are stationary. To emphasize this result we have added bar graphs to Figure 3I,K to illustrate this result and state the numbers behind this result more clearly.</p>
<p>“Upon quantification, 20.2 % of ribbon tracks show α &gt; 1, indicative of directional motion, but the majority of ribbon tracks (79.8 %) show α &lt; 1, indicating confinement on microtubules (Figure 3I, n = 10 neuromasts, 40 hair cells, and 203 tracks).</p>
<p>To provide a more comprehensive analysis of precursor movement, we also examined displacement distance (Figure 3J). Here, as an additional measure of directed motion, we calculated the percent of tracks with a cumulative displacement &gt; 1 µm. We found 35.6 % of tracks had a displacement &gt; 1 µm (Figure 3K; n = 10 neuromasts, 40 hair cells, and 203 tracks).”</p>
<p>We cannot say for certain what is happening with the stationary ribbons, but our hypothesis is that these ribbons eventually exhibit directed motion sufficient to reach the active zone. This idea is supported by the fact that we see ribbons that are stationary begin movement, and ribbons that are moving come to a stop during the acquisition of our timelapses (Movies S4 and S5). It is possible that ribbons that are stationary may not have enough motors attached, or there may be a ‘seeding’ phase where Ribeye aggregates are condensing on the ribbon.</p>
<p>We also reexamined our MSD a values as the a values we observed in hair cells were lower than those seen canonical motor-driven transport (where a approaches 2). One reason for this difference may arise from the dynamic microtubule network in developing hair cells, which could affect directional ribbon movement. In our revision we plotted the distribution of a values which confirmed that in control hair cells, the majority of the a values we see are typically less than 2 (Figure 7-S1A). Interestingly we also compared the distribution a values between control and taxol-treated hair cells, where the microtubule network is more stable, and found that the distribution shifted towards higher a values (Figure 7-S1A). We also plotted only ‘directional’ tracks (with a &gt; 1) and observed significantly higher a values in taxol-treated hair cells (Figure 7-S1B). This is an interesting result which indicates that although the proportion of directional tracks (with a &gt; 1) is not significantly different between control and taxol-treated hair cells (which could be limited by the number of motor/adapter proteins), the ribbons that move directionally do so with greater velocities when the microtubules are more stable. This supports our idea that the stability of the microtubule network could be why ribbon movement does not resemble canonical motor transport. This analysis is presented as a new figure (Figure 7-S1A-B) and is referred to in the text in the results and the discussion.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>“Interestingly, when we examined the distribution of α values, we observed that taxol treatment shifted the overall distribution towards higher α a values (Figure 7-S1A). In addition, when we plotted only tracks with directional motion (α &gt; 1), we found significantly higher α values in hair cells treated with taxol compared to controls (Figure 7-S1B). This indicates that in taxol-treated hair cells, where the microtubule network is stabilized, ribbons with directional motion have higher velocities.”</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>“Our findings indicate that ribbons and precursors show directed motion indicative of motor-mediated transport (Figure 3 and 7). While a subset of ribbons moves directionally with α values &gt; 1, canonical motor-driven transport in other systems, such as axonal transport, can achieve even higher α values approaching 2 (Bellotti et al., 2021; Corradi et al., 2020). We suggest that relatively lower α values arise from the highly dynamic nature of microtubules in hair cells. In axons, microtubules form stable, linear tracks that allow kinesins to transport cargo with high velocity. In contrast, the microtubule network in hair cells is highly dynamic, particularly near the cell base. Within a single time frame (50-100 s), we observe continuous movement and branching of these networks. This dynamic behavior adds complexity to ribbon motion, leading to frequent stalling, filament switching, and reversals in direction. As a result, ribbon transport appears less directional than the movement of traditional motor cargoes along stable axonal filaments, resulting in lower α values compared to canonical motor-mediated transport. Notably, treatment with taxol, which stabilizes microtubules, increased α values to levels closer to those observed in canonical motor-driven transport (Figure 7-S1). This finding supports the idea that the relatively lower α values in hair cells are a consequence of a more dynamic microtubule network. Overall, this dynamic network gives rise to a slower, non-canonical mode of transport.”</p>

<p>(5) The effect of acute treatment with nocodozole on microtubules in movie 7 and Figure 6 is not obvious to me and it is clear that whatever effect it has on microtubules is incomplete.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When using nocodazole, we worked to optimize the concentration of the drug to minimize cytotoxicity, while still being effective. While the more stable filaments at the cell apex remain largely intact after nocodazole treatment, there are almost no filaments at the hair cell base, which is different from the wild-type hair cells. In addition, nocodazole-treated hair cells have more cytoplasmic YFP-tubulin signal compared to wild type. We have clarified this in our results. To better illustrate the effect of nocodazole and taxol we have also added additional side-view images of hair cells expressing YFP-tubulin (Figure 4-S1F-G), that highlight cytoplasmic YFP-tubulin and long, stabilized microtubules after 3-4 hr treatment with nocodazole and taxol respectively. In these images we also point out microtubules at the apical region of hair cells that are very stable and do not completely destabilize with nocodazole treatment at concentrations that are tolerable to hair cells.</p>
<p>“We verified the effectiveness of our in vivo pharmacological treatments using either 500 nM nocodazole or 25 µM taxol by imaging microtubule dynamics in pLL hair cells (myo6b:YFP-tubulin). After a 30-min pharmacological treatment, we used Airyscan confocal microscopy to acquire timelapses of YFP-tubulin (3 µm z-stacks, every 50-100 s for 30-70 min, Movie S8). Compared to controls, 500 nM nocodazole destabilized microtubules (presence of depolymerized YFP-tubulin in the cytosol, see arrows in Figure 4-S1F-G) and 25 µM taxol dramatically stabilized microtubules (indicated by long, rigid microtubules, see arrowheads in Figure 4-S1F,H) in pLL hair cells. We did still observe a subset of apical microtubules after nocodazole treatment, indicating that this population is particularly stable (see asterisks in Figure 4-S1F-H).”</p>
<p>To further address concerns about verifying the efficacy of nocodazole and taxol treatment on microtubules, we added a quantification of our immunostaining data comparing the mean acetylated-a-tubulin intensities between control, nocodazole and taxol-treated hair cells. Our results show that nocodazole treatment reduces the mean acetylated-a-tubulin intensity in hair cells. This is included as a new figure (Figure 4-S1D-E) and this result is referred to in the text. To better illustrate the effect of nocodazole and taxol we have also added additional side-view images of hair cells after overnight treatment with nocodazole and taxol (Figure 4-S1A-C).</p>
<p>“After a 16-hr treatment with 250 nM nocodazole we observed a decrease in acetylated-a-tubulin label (qualitative examples: Figure 4A,C, Figure 4-S1A-B). Quantification revealed significantly less mean acetylated-a-tubulin label in hair cells after nocodazole treatment (Figure 4-S1D). Less acetylated-a-tubulin label indicates that our nocodazole treatment successfully destabilized microtubules.”</p>
<p>“Qualitatively more acetylated-a-tubulin label was observed after treatment, indicating that our taxol treatment successfully stabilized microtubules (qualitative examples: Figure 4-S1A,C). Quantification revealed an overall increase in mean acetylated-a-tubulin label in hair cells after taxol treatment, but this increase did not reach significance (Figure 4-S1E).”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding quantification of microtubule disruption using nocodazole and taxol. We did attempt to create profiles of the acetylated tubulin or YFP-tubulin label along horizontal planes at the apex and base, but the amount variability among cells and the angle of the cell in the images made this type of display and quantification challenging. In our revision we as stated above in our response to Reviewer #1’s public comment, we have added representative side-view images to show the disruptions to microtubules more clearly after short and long-term drug experiments (Figure 4-S1A-C, F-H). In addition, we quantified the reduction in acetylated tubulin label after overnight treatment with nocodazole and found the signal was significantly reduced (Figure 3-S1D-E). Unfortunately, we were unable to do a similar quantification due to the variability in YFP-tubulin intensity due to variations in mounting. The following text has been added to the results:</p>
<p>“Quantification revealed significantly less mean acetylated-a-tubulin label in hair cells after nocodazole treatment (Figure 4-S1D).”</p>
<p>“Quantification revealed an overall increase in mean acetylated-a-tubulin label in hair cells after taxol treatment, but this increase did not reach significance (Figure 4-S1A,C,E).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) It is a bit difficult to understand that the long-term (overnight) microtubule destabilization leads to a reduction in the number of synapses (Figure 4F) whereas short-term (30 min) microtubule destabilization leads to the opposite phenotype with an increased number of ribbons (Figure 6G). Are these ribbons still synaptic in short-term experiments? What is the size of the ribbons in the short-term experiments? Alternatively, could the reduction in synapse number upon long-term application of nocodazole be a side-effect of the toxicity within the hair cell?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Agreed-this is a bit confusing. In our revision, we have changed our analyses, so the comparisons are more similar between the short- and long-term experiments–we examined the number of ribbons and precursor per cells (apical and basal) in both experiments (Changed the panel in Figure 4G, Figure 4-S2G and Figure 5G). In our live experiments we cannot be sure that ribbons are synaptic as we do not have a postsynaptic co-label. Also, we are unable to reliably quantify ribbon and precursor size in our live images due to variability in mounting. We have changed the text to clarify as follows:</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>“In each developing cell, we quantified the total number of Riba-TagRFP puncta (apical and basal) before and after each treatment. In our control samples we observed on average no change in the number of Riba-TagRFP puncta per cell (Figure 6G). Interestingly, we observed that nocodazole treatment led to a significant increase in the total number of Riba-TagRFP puncta after 3-4 hrs (Figure 6G). This result is similar to our overnight nocodazole experiments in fixed samples, where we also observed an increase in the number of ribbons and precursors per hair cell. In contrast to our 3-4 hr nocodazole treatment, similar to controls, taxol treatment did not alter the total number of Riba-TagRFP puncta over 3-4 hrs (Figure 6G). Overall, our overnight and 3-4 hr pharmacology experiments demonstrate that microtubule destabilization has a more significant impact on ribbon numbers compared to microtubule stabilization.”</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>“Ribbons and microtubules may interact during development to promote fusion, to form larger ribbons. Disrupting microtubules could interfere with this process, preventing ribbon maturation. Consistent with this, short-term (3-4 hr) and long-term (overnight) nocodazole increased ribbon and precursor numbers (Figure 6AG; Figure 4G), suggesting reduced fusion. Long-term treatment (overnight) resulted in a shift toward smaller ribbons (Figure 4H-I), and ultimately fewer complete synapses (Figure 4F).”</p>
<p>Nocodazole toxicity: in response to Reviewer # 2’s public comment we have added the following text in our discussion:</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>“Another important consideration is the potential off-target effects of nocodazole. Even at non-cytotoxic doses, nocodazole toxicity may impact ribbons and synapses independently of its effects on microtubules. While this is less of a concern in the short- and medium-term experiments (30 min to 4 hr), long-term treatments (16 hrs) could introduce confounding effects. Additionally, nocodazole treatment is not hair cell-specific and could disrupt microtubule organization within afferent terminals as well. Thus, the reduction in ribbon-synapse formation following prolonged nocodazole treatment may result from microtubule disruption in hair cells, afferent terminals, or a combination of the two.”</p>

<p>(8) Does ribbon motion depend on size or location?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is challenging to reliability quantify the actual area of precursors in our live samples, as there is variability in mounting and precursors are quite small. But we did examine the location of ribbon precursors (using tracks &gt; 1 µm as these tracks can easily be linked to cell location in Imaris) with motion in the cell. We found evidence of ribbons with tracks &gt; 1 µm throughout the cell, both above and below the nucleus. This is now plotted in Figure 3M. We have also added the following test to the results:</p>
<p>“In addition, we examined the location of precursors within the cell that exhibited displacements &gt; 1 µm. We found that 38.9 % of these tracks were located above the nucleus, while 61.1 % were located below the nucleus (Figure 3M).”</p>
<p>Although this is not an area or size measurement, this result suggests that both smaller precursors that are more apical, and larger precursors/ribbons that are more basal all show motion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The fusion event needs to be analyzed in further detail: when one ribbon precursor fuses with another one, is there an increase in size or intensity (this should follow the law of mass conservation)? This is important to support the abstract sentence &quot;ribbon precursors can fuse together on microtubules to form larger ribbons&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned above it is challenging accurately estimate the absolute size or intensity of ribbon precursors in our live preparation. But we did examine whether there is a relative increase in area after ribbon fuse. We have plotted the change in area (within the same samples) for the two fusion events in shown in Figure 8-S1A-B. In these examples, the area of the puncta after fusion is larger than either of the two precursors that fuse. Although the areas are not additive, these plots do provide some evidence that fusion does act to form larger ribbons. To accompany these plots, we have added the following text to the results:</p>
<p>“Although we could not accurately measure the areas of precursors before and after fusion, we observed that the relative area resulting from the fusion of two smaller precursors was greater than that of either precursor alone. This increase in area suggests that precursor fusion may serve as a mechanism for generating larger ribbons (see examples: Figure 8-S1A-B).”</p>
<p>Because we were unable to provide more accurate evidence of precursor fusion resulting in larger ribbons, we have removed this statement from our abstract and lessened our claims elsewhere in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>We have done best to clarify what is meant by area of Ribeye puncta in the results and the methods:</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>“We also observed that the average of individual Ribeyeb puncta (from 2D max-projected images) was significantly reduced compared to controls (Figure 4H).

<p>Methods:</p>
<p>“To quantify the area of each ribbon and precursor, images were processed in a FIJI ‘IJMacro_AIRYSCAN_simple3dSeg_ribbons only.ijm’ as previously described (Wong et al., 2019). Here each Airyscan z-stack was max-projected. A threshold was applied to each image, followed by segmentation to delineate individual Ribeyeb/CTBP puncta. The watershed function was used to separate adjacent puncta. A list of 2D objects of individual ROIs (minimum size filter of 0.002 μm2) was created to measure the 2D areas of each Ribeyeb/CTBP puncta.”</p>

<p>One problem with the MSD analysis is that it is dependent upon fits of individual tracks that lead to inaccuracies in assigning diffusive, restricted, and directed motion. The authors might be able to get around these problems by looking at the ensemble averages of all the tracks and seeing how they change with the various treatments. Even if the effect is on a subset of ribeye spots, it would be reassuring to see significant effects that did not rely upon fitting.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are hesitant to average the MSD tracks as not all tracks have the same number of time steps (ribbon moving in and out of the z-stack during the timelapse). This makes it challenging for us to look at the ensembles of all averages accurately, especially for the duration of the timelapse. This is the main reason why added another analysis, displacements &gt; 1µm as another readout of directional motion, a measure that does not rely upon fitting.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The abstract states that directed movement is toward the synapse. The only real evidence for this is a statement in the results: &quot;Of the tracks that showed directional motion, while the majority move to the cell base, we found that 21.2 % of ribbon tracks moved apically.&quot; A clearer demonstration of this would be to do the analysis of Figure 2G for the ribeye aggregates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If was not possible to do the same analysis to ribbon tracks that we did for the EB3-GFP analysis in Figure 2. In Figure 2 we did a 2D tracking analysis and measured the relative angles in 2D. In contrast, the ribbon tracking was done in 3D in Imaris not possible to get angles in the same way. Further the MSD analysis was outside of Imaris, making it extremely difficult to link ribbon trajectories to the 3D cellular landscape in Imaris. Instead, we examined the direction of the 3D vectors in Imaris with tracks &gt; 1µm and determined the direction of the motion (apical, basal or undetermined). For clarity, this data is now included as a bar graph in Figure 3L. In our results, we have clarified the results of this analysis:</p>
<p>“To provide a more comprehensive analysis of precursor movement, we also examined displacement distance (Figure 3J). Here, as an additional measure of directed motion, we calculated the percent of tracks with a cumulative displacement &gt; 1 µm. We found 35.6 % of tracks had a displacement &gt; 1 µm (Figure 3K; n = 10 neuromasts, 40 hair cells and 203 tracks). Of the tracks with displacement &gt; 1 µm, the majority of ribbon tracks (45.8 %) moved to the cell base, but we also found a subset of ribbon tracks (20.8 %) that moved apically (33.4 % moved in an undetermined direction) (Figure 3L).”</p>
