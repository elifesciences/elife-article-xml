<title>Abstract</title><p>Migraine headache is hypothesized to involve the activation and sensitization of trigeminal sensory afferents that innervate the cranial meninges. To better understand migraine pathophysiology and improve clinical translation, we used two-photon calcium imaging via a closed cranial window in awake mice to investigate changes in the responses of meningeal afferents using a preclinical model of migraine involving cortical spreading depolarization (CSD). A single CSD episode caused a seconds-long wave of calcium activation that propagated across afferents and along the length of individual afferents. Surprisingly, unlike previous studies in anesthetized animals with exposed meninges, only a very small afferent population was persistently activated in our awake mouse preparation, questioning the relevance of this neuronal response to the onset of migraine pain. In contrast, we identified a larger subset of meningeal afferents that developed augmented responses to acute three-dimensional meningeal deformations that occur in response to locomotion bouts. We observed increased responsiveness in a subset of afferents that were already somewhat sensitive to meningeal deformation before CSD. Furthermore, another subset of previously insensitive afferents also became sensitive to meningeal deformation following CSD. Our data provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying migraine, including the emergence of enhanced meningeal afferent calcium responses to movement-related meningeal deformations as a potential neural substrate underlying the worsening of migraine headache during physical activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A large body of evidence supports the notion that migraine headache involves the trigeminal meningeal sensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ashina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Levy and Moskowitz, 2023</xref>). Persistent discharge of meningeal afferents is thought to mediate the ongoing headache, while their augmented mechanosensitivity has been suggested to underlie migraine headache exacerbation during normally innocuous physical activities that cause transient intracranial hypertension, such as coughing and other types of straining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blau and Dexter, 1981</xref>). Current understanding of migraine-related responses of meningeal afferents is largely based on animal models. For example, triggering an episode of cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), a self-propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarizations thought to mediate migraine aura, causes persistent activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Zhao and Levy, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the preclinical evidence implicating enhanced responsiveness of meningeal afferents as a driver of migraine headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Olesen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Levy and Moskowitz, 2023</xref>), these studies have almost all used acute invasive experiments involving electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized animals with surgically exposed and mildly inflamed meninges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Levy et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, studies documenting the mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents were based on findings of increased responsiveness to artificial compressive forces applied to the dura of a depressurized brain. Hence, there is a significant gap in our understanding of whether and how meningeal afferents respond to migraine-related events under more naturalistic conditions in behaving animals with an intact and pressurized intracranial space.</p>
<p>To better understand migraine pathophysiology and improve clinical translation, we leveraged a newly developed approach for two-photon calcium imaging of meningeal afferent responses within the closed intracranial space of an awake-behaving mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>) in the CSD model of migraine. We imaged changes in afferent ongoing activity as well as afferent responses to three-dimensional meningeal deformation associated with locomotion following the triggering of a single CSD episode. Our data provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying migraine pathophysiology, including acute calcium signaling in meningeal afferent fibers as a potentially critical nociceptive factor contributing to migraine pain and the emergence of enhanced meningeal afferent calcium responses to movement-related meningeal deformations as the neural substrate underlying the worsening of migraine headache during physical activity.</p>

<title>Propagating calcium activity across afferent fibers during CSD</title>
<p>To investigate meningeal afferent responses to CSD, we performed two-photon calcium imaging of GCaMP6s-expressing trigeminal afferent fibers innervating the meninges above the visual cortex (<italic>n</italic> = 325 fibers from 9 fields of view [FOV] from 7 mice, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). We triggered a single CSD episode in the frontal cortex with a cortical pinprick. In every experiment, we detected a slow, CSD-like wave of calcium activity in numerous meningeal afferent fibers within one minute following the pinprick <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and Supplementary Movie S1)</bold> as well as in background regions (likely reflecting signal from small, out-of-focus afferent branches). These calcium waves proceeded from the pinprick site in an anterior-to-posterior direction across the FOV <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>)</bold>. We also observed progressive activation of portions of individual afferent fibers aligned to the waveâs movement direction. To characterize this phenomenon, we focused on sets of regions of interest (ROIs) belonging to the same long afferent fiber oriented along the direction of the calcium wave <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Supplementary Movie 1)</bold>. Compared to baseline afferent calcium signals observed during periods of locomotion, during which all ROIs belonging to an afferent were activated near-simultaneously, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>), the sequential recruitment of ROIs along a fiber during the CSD-like wave was much slower <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-G</xref>)</bold>. The proportion of afferents activated during this period exceeded the proportion activated during locomotion bouts <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>)</bold>. The magnitude of activation was also larger <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<title>A minority of afferents exhibit prolonged activation or suppression after CSD</title>
<p>In anesthetized rats with exposed meninges, CSD drives sustained increases in ongoing activity lasting tens of minutes in â¼50% of meningeal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Zhao and Levy, 2015</xref>). To directly assess CSD-related changes in afferent ongoing activity in awake mice with intact meninges, we focused on afferent responses during epochs of immobility between locomotion bouts. We observed low levels of ongoing activity at baseline before CSD (fluorescent events occurring 6.9Â±0.3% of the time), consistent with our previous study in naÃ¯ve mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>). Surprisingly, most afferents (â¼70%) did not display any change in ongoing activity following CSD. However, we identified sustained increases in ongoing activity in â¼10% of the afferents. Surprisingly, we also observed a larger afferent population (â¼20%) whose activity was suppressed <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>)</bold>. Afferents with sustained activation showed increases in ongoing activity that emerged at a â¼25 min delay on average <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>)</bold>. In contrast, afferents with sustained suppression showed decreases in ongoing activity beginning shortly after the passage of the acute calcium wave <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>)</bold>. The durations of the afferent activation or suppression were similar, lasting â¼25 min on average <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<title>CSD augments afferent responsiveness associated with meningeal deformations</title>
<p>Locomotion drives acute meningeal deformations that can lead to the activation of mechanosensitive meningeal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>). We wondered whether, following CSD, afferent responses to a given level of mechanical deformation would be enhanced (i.e., sensitization). If so, this could explain the exacerbation of migraine headache during physical activity. CSD suppresses cortical activity leading to decreased motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Houben et al., 2017</xref>). CSD also leads to neuronal swelling, vascular changes, and reduced extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ayata and Lauritzen, 2015</xref>), which could affect meningeal deformations during locomotion and the associated afferent response. Hence, we first analyzed the effect of CSD on wheel running activity and the associated meningeal deformations. Mice spent less time locomoting after CSD than during the baseline period <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>)</bold>, and locomotion bout analysis revealed an overall reduction in bout rate following CSD <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>)</bold>. Remarkably, despite the overall reduction in locomotion following CSD, we observed similar bout characteristics at baseline and post-CSD, including bout duration <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>)</bold> and peak velocity <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>)</bold>. Given that CSD had minimal effect on locomotion bout characteristics, we next examined its effect on meningeal deformations. Surprisingly, CSD did not affect bout-related meningeal deformations: we observed similar scaling, shearing, and z-shift values <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F-H</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>Having shown that CSD does not affect meningeal deformations during locomotion, we next compared afferent responses during locomotion bouts before and after CSD. Initial observations of afferent activation during locomotion indicated enhanced responsiveness following CSD <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>)</bold>. To systematically investigate this augmented afferent response, we used general linear models (GLM; see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>) and Methods) to assess whether meningeal afferent activity becomes sensitized to the state of locomotion and/or to various aspects of meningeal deformation following CSD. We modeled each afferentâs activity based on variables that describe (i) the binary state of locomotion, (ii) mouse velocity, and (iii) aspects of meningeal deformation, including scaling, shearing, and Z-shift. This model fit is shown for an example afferent in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Example of meningeal afferent sensitization following CSD. Locomotion and its related Z-shift (bottom traces) are comparable before (left) and after (right) CSD, but afferent fibers exhibit greater responses after CSD (heatmaps, top panels). <bold>(B)</bold> Example GLM fit of afferent activity before CSD. A raw calcium activity trace recorded pre-CSD (gray traces, z-scored; Ï: 1 standard deviation) is plotted along with the model fit (purple).

A maximal coefficient at zero delay indicates the alignment of activity with Z-shifts. Note the greater afferent activation per unit Z-shift after CSD relative to baseline, indicative of an augmented or sensitized response. <bold>(D)</bold> Pie chart indicating the numbers and distribution of all afferents that were well-fit by deformation and/or locomotion signals either before and/or after CSD. Afferents categorized as sensitized if they (i) had significant GLM fits both pre- and post-CSD, as well as higher coefficients for a given deformation and/or locomotion predictor post-CSD (purple) or (ii) were well-fit only post-CSD (magenta). Two small subsets of afferents categorized as desensitized had worse GLM fits post-CSD (mustard) or were no longer well-fit post-CSD (orange). The incidence of afferent sensitization exceeded that of desensitization (P &lt; 0.001, Ï<sup>2</sup> test). <bold>(E, F)</bold> Comparisons of pre- and post-CSD GLM coefficients for each of the deformation and locomotion predictors. Data are shown for sensitized afferents with well-fit models pre- and post-CSD (corresponding to the purple population in D) and for afferents with well-fit models only post-CSD (i.e., silent pre-CSD, corresponding to the magenta population in D). Mouse velocity coefficients were close to 0 in all cases and are not shown. In the two sensitized afferent populations, only coefficients related to deformation predictors increased post-CSD (** p&lt; 0.01, *** p&lt; 0.001, **** p&lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon sign rank test with correction for multiple analyses). <bold>(G, H)</bold> The response bias of sensitized afferents to meningeal deformation was further observed when comparing these GLMs to restricted GLMs that included only the group of deformation predictors or the group of locomotion predictors. The deviance explained by the deformation response component (estimated as the difference between the full GLM and the GLM lacking deformation variables) was significantly greater than for the locomotion response component in sensitized afferents that were well-fit pre- and post-CSD and for those that were well-fit only post-CSD (*** <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and **** <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon test for G and H respectively). Bars depict mean; error bars indicate SEM. <bold>(I)</bold> Among the sensitized afferents with enhanced sensitivity to deformation variables, we observed a similar sensitization to scale, shear, and Z-shift variables. Bars depict mean; error bars indicate SEM. <bold>(J)</bold> There was no difference in the incidence of sensitized afferents among afferents that showed prolonged activation, prolonged suppression, or no change in ongoing activity post-CSD (<italic>P</italic> = 0.9, Ï<sup>2</sup> test; cf. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p></caption>

<p>We first focused on afferents whose activity could be predicted by the same variables both at baseline and following CSD (i.e., afferents that exhibited sensitivities to locomotion and/or deformation signals both before and after CSD, <italic>n</italic> = 67/325 afferents, 9 FOV). Higher GLM coefficients for a given variable post-CSD indicate greater afferent response during an equal expression level of that variable. Thus, we defined an afferent as sensitized by CSD if its GLM coefficients post-CSD were larger than at baseline (i.e., stronger activation of afferents per unit deformation or locomotion; for example, see <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></bold>). Using these criteria, we identified elevated locomotion and/or deformation-related activity (i.e., sensitization) post-CSD in â¼51% of afferents (n = 34; <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). In contrast, only 12% of afferents (n = 8) showed reduced locomotion- and deformation-related activity (i.e., desensitization) post-CSD. Sensitivity was unchanged in the remaining 37% of afferents (n = 25).</p>
<p>Meningeal afferent sensitization following CSD may reflect increased sensitivity to mechanical deformation and/or to other physiological processes that occur in response to locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>). Because locomotion and meningeal deformations are partially correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>), we next estimated their relative contributions to the augmented afferent responsiveness post-CSD by comparing, for each sensitized afferent, the GLM coefficients generated for baseline epochs and for post-CSD epochs. Surprisingly, we found that only the deformation coefficients were increased post-CSD <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>)</bold>, suggesting that meningeal afferent sensitization following CSD reflects primarily an increased sensitivity to mechanical deformation.</p>
<p>We next considered the possibility that sensitization is also manifested in the unmasking of responsiveness to locomotion and/or meningeal deformation in previously silent (i.e., insensitive) meningeal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Levy and Moskowitz, 2023</xref>). Indeed, among the 245 afferents that were not well-fit before CSD, we detected a substantial population that developed a sensitivity to locomotion and deformation variables following CSD (<italic>n</italic> = 53, â¼22%; i.e., whose activity could be well-predicted by locomotion and deformation variables following CSD). By contrast, far fewer neurons (n = 13) lost their sensitivity to these variables after CSD (i.e., afferents that were well fit before but not after CSD). Overall, the above finding show that four times more afferents displayed increased sensitivity than decreased sensitivity following CSD (87 vs. 21 afferents). This sensitized afferent population also displayed post-CSD increases in GLM coefficients related to deformation but not to locomotion <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>To further quantify the importance of the locomotion and deformation variables to the afferent sensitization, we estimated their relative contributions to the overall ability of the models to predict the afferent activity pre- vs. post-CSD. To this end, we calculated the difference in model fit using the full model with all variables or models lacking either the set of deformation variables or locomotion variables. We found that the impact of deformation variables on the model fit was greater post-CSD than pre-CSD, while the impact of locomotion variables was similar pre- and post-CSD. This was true for afferents with models that were well fit both at baseline and following CSD <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>; purple subset in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>)</bold> and for those with models that were well fit only post-CSD <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></bold>; magenta subset in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>)</bold>. Further analysis revealed that scale, shear, and Z-shift deformations were, on average, equally important in predicting the activity patterns of sensitized afferents <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>)</bold>. Taken together, these data suggest that the afferent sensitization following CSD primarily involves increased afferent responsiveness to a mix of meningeal deformation variables rather than to locomotion-associated processes.</p>
<p>Previous studies in anesthetized rats suggested that the mechanisms underlying meningeal afferent mechanical sensitization are independent of those responsible for increased ongoing discharge in several migraine models, including CSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Levy and Strassman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhao and Levy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Here, using the CSD model in awake mice, we also found no association between sensitization and sustained changes in ongoing activity, as similar proportions of sensitized and non-sensitized afferents were activated, suppressed, or did not display any change in their ongoing activity following CSD <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Prior studies suggested that CSD drives meningeal nociception that can lead to the headache phase in migraine with aura. These studies, which mostly involved invasive experiments in anesthetized rats with surgically exposed meninges, showed prolonged activation and mechanical sensitization of meningeal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carneiro-Nascimento and Levy, 2022</xref>). To better understand migraine pathophysiology and improve clinical translation, we used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize, for the first time, CSD-related changes in the responsiveness of individual meningeal sensory afferents at the level of their peripheral nerve fibers in the closed cranium of a behaving mouse. We show that a single CSD drives a wave of calcium activity across most afferents while producing a more prolonged change in ongoing activity in only a small subset. We then combined afferent calcium imaging with behavioral tracking of locomotion and estimates of local meningeal deformations. This approach revealed that CSD causes prolonged augmentation of afferent responsiveness to meningeal deformations associated with locomotion in previously sensitive afferents and emergent mechanical responses in previously silent afferents. These data support the notion that enhanced responsiveness of meningeal afferents to local meningeal deformation is the neural substrate for headache pain associated with physical activity following migraine onset.</p>
<p>The current study represents the first characterization of a CSD-associated calcium wave across meningeal afferent fibers and along the length of individual fibers. A rise in intracellular calcium detected by the GCaMP sensor normally indicates an action potential-evoked calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the seconds-long wave of calcium elevation along individual afferent fibers is incongruent with the generation of action potentials. It may instead be related to subthreshold depolarizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Li et al., 2022</xref>) and the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Awatramani et al., 2005</xref>). Our data thus support the notion that meningeal afferents can generate spatially localized and subthreshold yet powerful calcium transients during CSD. In turn, increased intracellular calcium could drive the release of sensory neuropeptides, such as CGRP, that can promote a local neurogenic inflammatory response linked to migraine pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akerman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Amrutkar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Levy and Moskowitz, 2023</xref>). The mechanism underlying the CSD-related afferent calcium wave could involve local depolarizing effects of diffusible excitatory molecules, such as potassium ions, whose cortical levels show a wave of elevation coincident with the propagation of the CSD wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Suryavanshi et al., 2022</xref>). Since we also observed instantaneous elevation in calcium activity across subregions of individual afferent fibers oriented perpendicular to the calcium wave, we cannot exclude the possibility that some afferents also signal via action potentials during the passing of the CSD wave.</p>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats previously demonstrated prolonged elevations in spiking in â¼50% of the somata of meningeal nociceptive afferents following CSD. In most recordings, increased activity emerged after a â¼10 min delay and lasted almost an hour following CSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Zhao and Levy, 2015</xref>). In the awake mouse, the propensity and duration of these prolonged afferent responses were much smaller, bringing into question the relevance of this response to migraine pain. Surprisingly, a separate afferent population exhibited depression of afferent activity that began immediately after the acute response and also lasted for about 25 min. While species differences and the effects of anesthesia in the rat studies might play a role, meningeal irritation due to the acute craniotomy used in previous electrophysiological recording studies could be major contributing factor. Craniotomy may lead to increased meningeal permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Roth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>), which could facilitate the transfer of algesic signals from the cortex. This process is likely less prevalent when using the chronic cranial window approach we employed in the current study, which has been shown to exhibit minimal inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goldey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>). An acute craniotomy also leads to a meningeal inflammatory response via the activation of local immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Levy et al., 2007</xref>) and could prime meningeal afferents to develop prolonged activation following CSD. Such a priming mechanism, if occurs in susceptible individuals that suffer from migraines, could facilitate an increase in the activity of meningeal afferents and drive the headache during a migraine attack.</p>
<p>A major finding of this study is the post-CSD development of augmented meningeal afferent responsiveness meningeal deformations associated with locomotion bouts in awake mice with closed and pressurized meninges. Importantly, we previously found that the activity of most meningeal afferents around the time of locomotion is driven by mixed sensitivities to locomotion and to locomotion-related meningeal deformation signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the amplification of afferent responsiveness following CSD relates primarily to enhanced neural gain in response to meningeal deformation rather than to other physiological processes associated with locomotion (e.g., vasodilation, intracranial pressure elevations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gao and Drew, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Meningeal afferents responding to physiological meningeal deformations may constitute a population of low-threshold mechanoreceptor (LTMR) afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">von Buchholtz et al., 2020</xref>) whose activation under normal conditions is unlikely to produce headache. Our finding that CSD can augment the mechanical sensitivity of these afferents suggests that they may also possess nociceptive properties. This view is supported by the identification of a subpopulation of cutaneous A-LTMR trigeminal afferents that also responds to noxious mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">von Buchholtz et al., 2021</xref>). Our data further suggest that about half of all afferents deemed to be sensitized following CSD are likely higher-threshold mechanosensitive afferents, as they were not driven by meningeal deformations or locomotion at baseline. Accordingly, local inflammation, which occurs following CSD, has been shown to recruit âsilentâ meningeal nociceptive afferents to become functional mechanonociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Strassman and Levy, 2006</xref>). Overall, we propose that the sensitization of silent nociceptors, as well as of afferents with responsiveness to acute meningeal deformations at baseline, could produce a state of intracranial mechanical allodynia that underlies the exacerbation of migraine headaches during physical exertion and associated meningeal deformations.</p>

<p>All experimental procedures complied with the ARRIVE and were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Mice were group housed with standard mouse chow and water provided <italic>ad libitum</italic> before viral injection (see below).

<title>Surgical procedures and CSD induction</title>
<p>All surgical procedures were performed in anesthetized mice (isoflurane in O<sub>2</sub>; 3.5% for induction, 1.5% for maintenance). Animals were given Meloxicam SR (4 mg/kg s.c.) for post-surgical analgesia. For monitoring calcium activity in meningeal afferents, 2.0 Î¼l of AAV2/5.CAG.GCaMP6s.WPRE.SV40 (titer: 1Ã10<sup>13</sup>; Addgene) was injected into the left trigeminal ganglion (TG) using the following stereotaxic coordinates: 1.5 mm lateral and 0.3-0.8 mm anterior to Bregma and 7.0-7.2 mm ventral to the dura at a lateral-to-medial tilt with an angle of 22.5Â° relative to the dorsal-ventral axis. We previously verified this approach by examining GCaMP6s expression in TG somata and meningeal afferent fibers 8 weeks after injection using immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>). Mice used for <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon imaging were instrumented with a titanium headpost and a 3 mm cranial window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goldey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>) covering the posterior cortex (window centered roughly 1.5 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior to Bregma over the left hemisphere) 6-8 weeks after AAV injection. For CSD induction, a burr hole was drilled 1.5 mm anterior to the edge of the window until the brainâs surface was barely visible. The burr hole was then plugged using silicone gel, and the mouse was allowed to recover. To trigger a single CSD episode, the silicone plug on the burr hole was removed, and a glass micropipette (50 Î¼m diameter) was briefly inserted â¼1 mm deep into the cortex for 2 seconds, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Zhao and Levy, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Wheel training</title>
<p>After at least one week of recovery following cranial window implantation, mice were head-fixed on a 3D-printed running wheel for gradual habituation (10 minutes to 1 hour over 3-4 days). The running wheel was mounted on a cantilever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ramesh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>) to minimize downward forces on the bone and meninges produced while the mouse was pushing upwards against the headpost. Moreover, the strong cement used to bind all skull plates and headpost together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Goldey et al., 2014</xref>) further mitigated any movement-induced strain on the skull that might affect the underlying meninges. Mice displaying signs of stress were immediately removed from head fixation, and additional habituation days were added until mice tolerated head fixation without visible signs of stress. Mice received a high-calorie liquid meal replacement (Ensure) via a syringe as part of the habituation process.</p>

<title>Two-photon imaging</title>
<p>Calcium imaging was performed as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>) while mice were head-fixed on the running wheel. We used a Nikon 16X, 0.8 NA water immersion objective on a resonant-scanning two-photon microscope (Neurolabware) and a MaiTai DeepSee laser, set to 920 nm with 25-40 mW power for GCaMP6s visualization. Digital zoom was set at 2.4X (626Ã423 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> FOVs). In 7 experiments, we imaged a 60 mm volume (3D) using an electrically tunable lens (Optotune) at 1.03/s to capture afferents throughout the meninges. In two experiments, only single-plane (2D) data were collected at the cranial dura level at 15.5 Hz. In every experiment, we conducted two imaging runs (30 min each) to collect baseline data, followed by four more 30 min runs post-CSD induction. In a subset of experiments in which the FOV included a visible large pial artery (<italic>n</italic> = 4), we verified the induction of a CSD by visualizing its vascular signature, including a brief vasoconstriction followed by dilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Rosic et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Image processing and calcium signal extraction</title>
<p>All image processing and analyses were performed in MATLAB 2020a using custom software. Imaging movies were subjected to several preprocessing steps, including corrections for the lensing effect, rigid registration, z-interpolation, and affine registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>). Registered 2D movies were analyzed using a PCA/ICA package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mukamel et al., 2009</xref>) to extract masks of pixels with correlated activity. Users screened each prospective region of interest (ROI) for quality of morphology and fluorescence signal. ROIs with &lt; 50 pixels were rejected. For each ROI included in subsequent analyses, we generated a dilated mask extending 8-21 pixels from the outer edge of the ROI, excluding any pixels that belonged to another ROI. This âneuropilâ mask was used for the subtraction of background signals. In volumetric imaging, we generated a mean projection over all planes containing afferents for each volume. Then we ran the resulting 2D movie through the PCA/ICA procedure, yielding an initial set of 2D masks that represented putative 3D ROIs. An initial fluorescence trace extracted from each 2D mask was calculated by averaging fluorescence across all pixels in the mask. To identify which voxels in the original volumetric dataset contributed most strongly to each fluorescence trace, we calculated the Pearson correlation of this trace with the fluorescence timecourse of each voxel, resulting in a 3D volume of correlation values. These 3D correlation volumes were then screened manually for quality of morphology and signal. The surviving volumes were thresholded at the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of correlation across all voxels to form putative 3D ROI masks.</p>

Next, we calculated F<sup>i</sup> = F<sup>i</sup><sub>ROI</sub> â F<sup>i</sup><sub>np</sub> + &lt;F<sup>i</sup><sub>np</sub>&gt;, where brackets denote the mean across the entire recording.

We then calculated the normalized, baseline-subtracted time series ÎF/F<sub>0</sub> = (F<sup>i</sup> <sub>â</sub> F<sup>i</sup><sub>0</sub>)/ F<sup>i</sup><sub>0</sub>. This signal was standardized akin to a Z-score operation by subtracting the median value and dividing by the standard deviation (calculated during quiet wakefulness, an epoch with low levels of evoked activity). Fluorescence events were defined as periods where the signal consistently exceeded a value of 1 for at least one second and where peak fractional change in fluorescence (ÎF/F<sub>0</sub>) was at least 5%.</p>

<title>Identifying calcium activity in afferent fibers</title>
<p>To analyze calcium activity related to an afferent fiber, sets of ROIs putatively belonging to the same axon were initially identified using a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Liang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, we calculated the pairwise fluorescence event correlation between ROIs during quiet wakefulness, thresholding at 0.7 correlation. We then calculated the cosine dissimilarity between the full set of correlation coefficients for each pair of ROIs, which in turn was used to calculate the linkage between each pair. Finally, hierarchical clustering was performed using a cutoff value of 2. This procedure generated sets of ROIs that were mutually highly correlated. We then visually inspected each cluster and manually identified the subsets of ROIs that unambiguously covered the same specific afferent fiber without any branching. We used the mean activity of these ROI subsets to analyze each afferentâs calcium activity.</p>

<title>CSD-associated calcium wave characterization</title>
<p>To detect the CSD-associated meningeal calcium wave (see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1B</xref>), we first calculated the mean fluorescence signal over all voxels in the FOV, F<sub>FOV</sub>(t), and its time derivative dF<sub>FOV</sub>/dt, in the first 5 minutes after cortical pinprick. To identify the timing of the CSD, we first defined an initial period, t<sub>inital</sub>, between the derivativeâs maximum and minimum. We then calculated baseline fluorescence, F<sub>pre</sub>, as the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile value of F<sub>FOV</sub> in the 30 sec before the initial period and a normalized fluorescence signal, ÎF/F<sub>pre</sub> = (F<sub>FOV</sub> â F<sub>pre</sub>)/F<sub>pre</sub>. Next, we defined a threshold value as 0.1*max(ÎF(t<sub>initial</sub>)/F<sub>pre</sub>). The waveâs final onset and offset times were defined as the points around the peak where ÎF<sub>FOV</sub>/F<sub>pre</sub> crossed the threshold value.</p>
<p>To measure the propagation of the calcium wave throughout the meninges, we estimated the waveâs onset time at different X and Y positions within the FOV. Briefly, we gathered all the data from the peri-CSD wave from â6 to 14 s relative to the calcium wave onset time determined above. All voxels belonging to or neighboring (within 8 pixels) ROIs were excluded to focus on the overall wavelike advancement in the background âneuropilâ fluorescence signal (which integrates background fluorescence across depths and thus reflects a smooth estimate of mean activity in a given region). The resulting series of images was then divided into 40Ã40 pixel spatial bins, and mean fluorescence signals F<sub>np</sub><sup>bin</sup>(t) were calculated. The time of estimated onset of the CSD-associated wave at a given bin was estimated by fitting F<sub>np</sub><sup>bin</sup>(t) to a logistic function, A/(1+exp(-(t-t<sub>onset</sub>)/Ï)) + K. Fits with R<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.5, or Ï &gt; 2 s, or Ï &lt; 0 s, were excluded. The waveâs speed was estimated by linear regression of onset times as a function of distance. The direction of the wave was determined by estimating the contour of the wavefront at the median bin onset time, fitting this contour to a line, and then calculating the vector orthogonal to that line.</p>
<p>To specifically examine the propagation of the fluorescence signals along long (&gt;200 mm) individual afferent fibers, we determined the timing of CSD-associated wave onset by fitting each ROIâs peri-wave fluorescence signals to a sigmoidal function and then estimating the speed of propagation by linear regression of onset times as a function of distance. For comparison, this procedure was repeated using the peri-locomotion bout signals. Since locomotion-associated activation occurred essentially simultaneously (i.e., Ît = 0 s), even for distant ROIs, we report these results in terms of the pace (the inverse of speed) to avoid dividing by zero.</p>

<title>Assessment of CSD-evoked changes in afferent ongoing activity</title>
<p>To determine changes in ongoing afferent activity, we focused on the periods of immobility between locomotion bouts (stillness).

We estimated levels of ongoing activity rate from the normalized Z-score timecourses as the fraction of time the afferents exhibited fluorescent events (defined as above) during each one-minute interval. We defined afferents with post-CSD increases or suppression of activity if changes in ongoing activity lasted &gt;10 consecutive min and began within 30 min post the CSD wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>General linear models</title>
<p>To classify afferent responses, we fit Gaussian general linear models (GLM) for locomotion, deformation, and fluorescence using the glmnet package in Matlab. To allow for the possibility of a delay between the predictor and response, we expanded the set of predictors to include variables at varying delays relative to calcium activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Driscoll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Ramesh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blaeser et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, for each variable, we generated a set of temporally shifted versions spanning a time window from â6 s to +6 s. These sets of arrays of temporal shifts for each variable were joined to form an array of temporally shifted predictor signals. The GLM was fit on 75% of the data for each cell with elastic net regularization (Î±= 0.01). We then used the GLM coefficients to measure the deviance explained on the remaining 25% of the data. The relative explanatory value of locomotion or deformation variables was calculated by refitting the GLM after excluding the family of predictors (locomotion state and velocity for evaluating the effect of locomotion and scale, shear, and Z-shift for examining the effect of deformation) and calculating the difference in deviance explained by the full model versus the model lacking a given family of predictor variables. All GLM models underwent 10-fold cross-validation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Herein, Blaeser et al. explored the impact of migraine-related cortical spreading depression (CSD) on the calcium dynamics of meningeal afferents that are considered the putative source of migraine-related pain. Critically previous studies have identified widespread activation of these meningeal afferents following CSD; however, most studies of this kind have been performed in anesthetized rodents. By conducting a series of technically challenging calcium imaging experiments in conscious head fixed mice they find in contrast that a much smaller proportion of meningeal afferents are persistently activated following CSD. Instead, they identify that post-CSD responses are differentially altered across a wide array of afferents, including increased and decreased responses to mechanical meningeal deformations and activation of previously non-responsive afferents following CSD. Given that migraine is characterized by worsening head pain in response to movement, the findings offer a potential mechanism that may explain this clinical phenomenon.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Using head fixed conscious mice overcomes the limitations of anesthetized preps and the potential impact of anaesthesia on meningeal afferent function which facilitated novel results when compared to previous anesthetized studies. Further, the authors used a closed cranial window preparation to maximize normal physiological states during recording, although the introduction of a needle prick to induce CSD will have generated a small opening in the cranial preparation, rendering it not fully closed as suggested.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Although this is a well conducted technically challenging study that has added valuable knowledge on the response of meningeal afferents the study would have benefited from the inclusion of more female mice. Migraine is a female dominant condition and an attempt to compare potential sex-differences in afferent responses would undoubtedly have improved the outcome.</p>
<p>The authors imply that the current method shows clear differences when compared to older anaesthetized studies; however, many of these were conducted in rats and relied on recording from the trigeminal ganglion. Inclusion of a subgroup of anesthetized mice in the current preparation may have helped to answer these outstanding questions, being is this species dependent or as a result of the different technical approaches.</p>
<p>The authors discuss meningeal deformations as a result of locomotion; however, despite referring to their previous work (Blaeser et al., 2022), the exact method of how these deformations were measured could be clearer. It is challenging to imaging that simple locomotion would induce such deformations and the one reference in the introduction refers to straining, such as cough that may induce intracranial hypertension, which is likely a more powerful stimulus than locomotion.</p>

<p>This is an interesting study examining the question of whether CSD sensitizes meningeal afferent sensory neurons leading to spontaneous activity or whether CSD sensitizes these neurons to mechanical stimulation related to locomotion. Using two-photon in vivo calcium imaging based on viral expression of GCaMP6 in the TG, awake mice on a running wheel were imaged following CSD induction by cortical pinprick. The CSD wave evoked a rise in intracellular calcium in many sensory neurons during the propagation of the wave but several patterns of afferent activity developed after the CSD. The minority of recorded neurons (10%) showed spontaneous activity while slightly larger numbers (20%) showed depression of activity, the latter pattern developed earlier than the former. The vast majority of neurons (70%) were unaffected by the CSD. CSD decreased the time spent running and the numbers of bouts per minute but each bout was unaffected by CSD. There also was no influence of CSD on the parameters referred to as meningeal deformation including scale, shear, and Z-shift. Using GLM, the authors then determine that there there is an increase in locomotion/deformation-related afferent activity in 51% of neurons, a decrease in 12% of neurons, and no change in 37%. GLM coefficients were increased for deformation related activity but not locomotion related activity after CSD. There also was an increase in afferents responsive to locomotion/deformation following CSD that were previously silent. This study shows that unlike prior reports, CSD does not lead to spontaneous activity in the majority of sensory neurons but that it increases sensitivity to mechanical deformation of the meninges. This has important implications for headache disorders like migraine where CSD is thought to contribute to the pathology in unclear ways with this new study suggesting that it may lead to increased mechanical sensitivity characteristic of migraine attacks.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Blaeser et al. set out to explore the link between CSD and headache pain. How does an electrochemical wave in the brain parenchyma, which lacks nociceptors, result in pain and allodynia in the V1-3 distribution? Prior work had established that CSD increased the firing rate of trigeminal neurons, measured electrophysiologically at the level of the peripheral ganglion. Here, Blaeser et al. focus on the fine afferent processes of the trigeminal neurons, resolving Ca2+ activity of individual fibers within the meninges. To accomplish these experiments, the authors injected AAV encoding the Ca2+ sensitive fluorophore GCamp6s into the trigeminal ganglion, and 8 weeks later imaged fluorescence signals from the afferent terminals within the meninges through a closed cranial window. They captured activity patterns at rest, with locomotion, and in response to CSD. They found that mechanical forces due to meningeal deformations during locomotion (shearing, scaling, and Z-shifts) drove non-spreading Ca2+ signals throughout the imaging field, whereas CSD caused propagating Ca2+ signals in the trigeminal afferent fibers, moving at the expected speed of CSD (3.8 mm/min). Following CSD, there were variable changes in basal GCamp6s signals: these signals decreased in the majority of fibers, signals increased (after a 25 min delay) in other fibers, and signals remained unchanged in the remainder of fibers. Bouts of locomotion were less frequent following CSD, but when they did occur, they elicited more robust GCamp6s signals than pre-CSD. These findings advance the field, suggesting that headache pain following CSD can be explained on the basis of peripheral cranial nerve activity, without invoking central sensitization at the brain stem/thalamic level. This insight could open new pathways for targeting the parenchymal-meningeal interface to develop novel abortive or preventive migraine treatments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript is well-written. The studies are broadly relevant to neuroscientists and physiologists, as well as neurologists, pain clinicians, and patients with migraine with aura and acephalgic migraine. The studies are well-conceived and appear to be technically well-executed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Lack of anatomic confirmation that the dura were intact in these studies: it is notoriously challenging to create a cranial window in mouse skull without disrupting or even removing the dura. It was unclear which meningeal layers were captured in the imaging plane. Did the visualized trigeminal afferents terminate in the dura, subarachnoid space, or pia (as suggested by Supplemental Fig 1, capturing a pial artery in the imaging plane)? Were z-stacks obtained, to maintain the imaging plane, or to follow visualized afferents when they migrated out of the imaging plane during meningeal deformations?</p>
<p>2. Findings here, from mice with chronic closed cranial windows, failed to fully replicate prior findings from rats with acute open cranial windows. While the species, differing levels of inflammation and intracranial pressure in these two preparations may contribute, as the authors suggested, the modality of measuring neuronal activity could also contribute to the discrepancy. In the present study, conclusions are based entirely on fluorescence signals from GCamp6s, whereas prior rat studies relied upon multiunit recordings/local field potentials from tungsten electrodes inserted in the trigeminal ganglion. As a family, GCamp6 fluorophores are strongly pH dependent, with decreased signal at acidic pH values (at matched Ca2+ concentration). CSD induces an impressive acidosis transient, at least in the brain parenchyma, so one wonders whether the suppression of activity reported in the wake of CSD (Figure 2) in fact reflects decreased sensitivity of the GCamp6 reporter, rather than decreased activity in the fibers. If intracellular pH in trigeminal afferent fibers acidifies in the wake of CSD, GCamp6s fluorescence may underestimate the actual neuronal activity.</p>
