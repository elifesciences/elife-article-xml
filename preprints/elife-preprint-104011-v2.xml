<title>Abstract</title><p>Diacylglycerols (DAGs) are used for metabolic purposes and are tightly regulated secondary lipid messengers in eukaryotes. DAG subspecies with different fatty-acyl chains are proposed to be involved in the activation of distinct PKC isoforms, resulting in diverse physiological outcomes. However, the molecular players and the regulatory origin for fine-tuning the PKC pathway are unknown. Here, we show that Dip2, a conserved DAG regulator across Fungi and Animalia, has emerged as a modulator of PKC signalling in yeast. Dip2 maintains the level of a specific DAG subpopulation, required for the activation of PKC-mediated cell wall integrity pathway. Interestingly, the canonical DAG-metabolism pathways, being promiscuous, are decoupled from PKC signalling. We demonstrate that these DAG subspecies are sourced from a phosphatidylinositol pool generated by the acyl-chain remodelling pathway. Furthermore, we provide insights into the intimate coevolutionary relationship between the regulator (Dip2) and the effector (PKC) of DAG-based signalling. Hence, our study underscores the establishment of Dip2-PKC axis about 1.2 billion years ago in Opisthokonta, which marks the rooting of the first specific DAG-based signalling module of eukaryotes.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>The revised manuscript sheds light on the subcellular localizations of Dip2 and Plc1 to understand the spatial dynamics of selective diacylglycerol metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using live-cell microscopy techniques, we have traced the localization of Dip2 under conditions of bulk DAG accumulation by analyzing its distribution in the deletion strains of lro1, dga1, and pah1. Despite elevated levels of bulk DAGs, Dip2 consistently localized to mitochondria, indicating that its spatial organization is unaffected by the bulk DAG accumulation, reinforcing its specificity toward selective DAGs.
We also probed Plc1 for its subcellular location and found that it partially resides in both mitochondria and vacuoles. This furthered our understanding with respect to production of selective DAGs at a subcellular level. These observations suggest a model in which Plc1 generates selective DAGs at specific subcellular sites, mitochondria and vacuoles, that are subsequently metabolized by Dip2.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a conserved lipid molecule with well-established roles in membrane lipid biogenesis and storage lipid production in all life forms. DAGs are synthesized via <italic>de novo</italic> pathways of lipid metabolism utilising fatty acid precursors, while it can also be generated as a by-product of multiple salvage pathways in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Carrasco &amp; Merida, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Eichmann &amp; Lass, 2015</xref>). DAGs are unique as they lack headgroups unlike the other abundant lipid classes. They exhibit diversity due to variations in acyl-chain length and unsaturation. These acyl-chain variations are proposed to be the basis for the multifaceted physiological roles of DAGs in metabolic and signal transduction pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marignani et al, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Milne et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schuhmacher et al, 2020</xref>). The signalling function is executed by various âDAG effectorâ proteins such as DAG-dependent protein kinases, Chimaerin, Munc13, RasGRP etc. involved in cell-cycle progression, neurotransmitter release, actin cytoskeleton organization and malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Colon-Gonzalez &amp; Kazanietz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Yang &amp; Kazanietz, 2003</xref>). Studies conducted â¼four decades ago have indicated the role of acyl-chain compositions of DAGs in Protein Kinase C (PKC) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kishimoto et al, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marignani et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mori et al, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Kamiya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Masayoshi et al., 1987</xref>). However, the cellular pathways for such specific acyl-chain-based regulation of signalling events have not been identified till date.</p>
<p>PKC, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is a classic example of a eukaryotic DAG-based signalling molecule. Mammalian PKC isoforms play a key role in a myriad of biological processes like cell differentiation, cell migration, mitochondrial functioning, cell polarity, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Newton, 2018</xref>) and its dysregulation is associated with various pathological conditions such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimerâs, heart disease, obesity and age-related metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Etcheberrigaray et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Marrocco et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nishizuka, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Schmitz-Peiffer &amp; Biden, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Fungi, on the other hand, harbour a single PKC gene (<italic>PKC1</italic>) that is implicated in regulating the cell wall biosynthesis pathway, rationalizing its essentiality under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Levin, 2005</xref>). Genetic or pharmacological impairment of Pkc1 in pathogenic fungi like <italic>Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans etc.,</italic> confers hypersensitivity to various antifungal drugs and drastically attenuates its proliferation and virulence in murine model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Heinisch &amp; Rodicio, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">LaFayette et al, 2010</xref>) suggesting a crucial role of Pkc1 in pathogenicity of diverse fungal groups. The array of pathologies and disrupted cellular processes owing to hampered Pkc1 signalling warrants the necessity of stringent regulation of Pkc1 activity.</p>
<p>Although DAG-based activation of PKC is well established in metazoans, the role of specific acyl-chain compositions in fungi is still a mystery. Additionally, the molecular players regulating these signalling DAGs remain underexplored. Recently, we have identified and functionally characterized a conserved protein family, Disco-Interacting Protein 2 (Dip2) (earlier annotated as Cmr2 in yeast; SGD ID: S000005619), harbouring two tandem fatty acyl-AMP ligase-like domains (FLD1 and FLD2) along with a DMAP-binding domain 1 (DBD1) at the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal et al, 2022</xref>). We showed that Dip2 regulates specific DAG subspecies in terms of its acyl chain length and unsaturation across fungi and animals. Dip2 from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> has been shown to be involved in converting C36:0 (18:0/18:0) and C36:1 (18:0/18:1) DAGs to triacylglycerols (TAGs) with corresponding chain lengths. These DAG subspecies constitute only â¼0.5 % of the total lipid pool but are important for maintaining the organellar and thereby cellular homeostasis. However, the necessity to introduce such strict regulation of specific DAG subspecies in Opisthokonta remains elusive.</p>
<p>Here, we show that Dip2 has emerged as a modulator of Pkc1 signalling in the model yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> by regulating the chain-length specific DAGs. By combining genetic and lipidomic approaches, we have demonstrated that the absence of Dip2, which leads to the accumulation of C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs, results in hyperactivation of Pkc1. This in turn elevates the downstream signalling of cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway leading to cell wall stress resistance. On the contrary, the bulk DAG pool, which is generally acted upon by canonical DAG metabolizing enzymes, fails to activate Pkc1. The DAG binding domain of Pkc1 displays a remarkable specificity to certain DAG subspecies <italic>in vitro,</italic> reflecting the <italic>in vivo</italic> specificity. To understand this metabolic segregation of DAG pool, we have tracked the source of the Dip2-metabolised DAG subspecies involved in Pkc1 activation. Interestingly, it was found to be channelled majorly through the phosphatidylinositol (PI) pool enriched with C18:0 fatty acyl chain generated by acyl-chain remodelling process. Furthermore, an extensive phylogenetic correlation analysis has revealed that Dip2 and PKC co-emerged and coevolved during early Opisthokonta evolution to establish the selective DAG-based PKC signalling axis.</p>

<title>Dip2 is involved in the regulation of Pkc1-mediated cell wall integrity pathway</title>
<p>Initial phenotypic screening revealed that Dip2 is necessary for the survival of yeast in various stress conditions like ER stress, osmotic stress etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal et al., 2022</xref>). However, <italic>Dip2</italic> knockout yeast (hereafter referred to as <italic>Îdip2</italic>) outperforms the wildtype (<italic>WT</italic>) strain under cell wall stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal et al., 2022</xref>). This suggested a possible link between Dip2 and the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway of yeast, which is governed by Pkc1 and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade. Given the requirement of DAGs for Pkc1 activation and the role of Dip2 in regulating DAG subspecies, we hypothesized that Dip2 maintains optimal levels of DAG subspecies necessary for activation of CWI pathway (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To test this, we compared the fitness of <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Îdip2</italic> yeast in the presence of cell wall stress-inducing agents like Congo red (CR) and Calcofluor white (CFW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Roncero &amp; Duran, 1985</xref>), using serial dilution assay in synthetic complete (SC) media (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) as well as in rich media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Fig. 1âfig. supplement 1</xref>). The two biological replicates<italic>, Îdip2</italic>_Colony1 and <italic>Îdip2</italic>_Colony2 showed increased resistance to cell wall stress, and the phenotype was restored through genetic complementation with Dip2 under its native promoter. Additionally, we employed colony forming unit (CFU) assay for <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Îdip2</italic> under cell wall stress. Counting the CFU also showed a similar and significant difference in the growth of <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>Îdip2</italic> colonies in the presence of CR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These observations suggest the regulatory role of Dip2 in CWI pathway of yeast. Since cell wall stress is associated with Pkc1-mediated activation of CWI pathway, we sought to test the status of Pkc1 signalling and its probable link to Dip2-regulated DAG subspecies. First, we probed the phosphorylation levels of a downstream MAPK effector of Pkc1 pathway, i.e., Slt2 (Suppressor of the LyTic phenotype) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Levin, 2005</xref>) to quantitatively assess the extent of Pkc1 activation. In agreement to the CWI phenotype, a â¼3-fold increase in phosphorylation of Slt2 (pSlt2) was observed in <italic>Îdip2</italic> as compared to <italic>WT</italic>, where <italic>WT</italic> treated with CFW is used as a positive control for pSlt2 increase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we sought to understand if the hyperactivation of Pkc1 in <italic>Îdip2</italic> is DAG dependent and involves the catalytic activity of Dip2, i.e., conversion of selective DAGs to TAGs. To answer this, we generated two catalytic mutants of Dip2 (Dip2<sup>D523A</sup> and Dip2<sup>L687A</sup>), that abolish its adenylation activity and have been shown to be unable to decrease the selective DAG levels on complementing <italic>Îdip2</italic>, as reported in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The mutants were cloned under its native promoter in pYSS01 plasmid and expressed in <italic>Îdip2</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Fig. 1âfig. supplement 2A</xref>). The mutants could not diminish the cell wall stress resistance in <italic>Îdip2</italic>, unlike wildtype Dip2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Additionally, complementation with the catalytically inactive Dip2 could not bring back the pSlt2 level in <italic>Îdip2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Fig. 1âfig. supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting a direct correlation between the enzymatic activity of Dip2 and Pkc1 hyperactivation. Hence, the catalytic activity of Dip2 <italic>i.e.</italic>, the regulation of DAG subspecies level is essential in maintaining the active pool of Pkc1 for optimal CWI signalling.</p>
<p>Additionally, to confirm that the cell wall stress resistance observed in <italic>Îdip2</italic> is Pkc1 mediated, we inhibited Pkc1âs activity using cercosporamide, a selective Pkc1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sussman et al, 2004</xref>) and observed decrease in the resistance to cell wall stress (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). The increase in pSlt2 level in <italic>Îdip2</italic> was also brought back to <italic>WT</italic> level upon treatment with cercosporamide (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). This implies that the hyperactivation of Pkc1 in <italic>Îdip2</italic> causes the cell wall stress resistance.</p>
<p>These observations intrigued us to ask how Dip2 spatially regulates Pkc1 as both reside at different subcellular locations inside the cell. Since Pkc1 is a bud site and plasma membrane localizing protein (Andrews P. and Stark M., 2000), we wondered whether Dip2 translocates to plasma membrane under cell wall stress. To examine this, we used <italic>WT</italic> strain with endogenous Dip2 tagged with GFP and subjected it to cell wall stress. As Dip2 predominantly localizes to the mitochondria, we co-stained cells with Mitotracker Red and found that there is no change in the spatial organization of Dip2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Fig. 1âfig. supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that Dip2 and Pkc1 could be cross talking through other ways that are yet to be explored.</p>

<title>Dip2-regulated DAG subspecies activate Pkc1 signalling via selective interaction</title>
<p>Since Dip2 is known to regulate the levels of C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs in yeast, we asked whether these specific DAG subspecies play any role in activation of Pkc1 signalling. Firstly, we examined how the system responds to cell wall stress in terms of the DAG levels. While tracking the Pkc1 signalling at temporal scale, we observed profound activation of Pkc1 pathway after 20-30 minutes of CFW treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Fig. 2âfig. supplement 1A</xref>). Hence, we performed the lipidomic analysis of <italic>WT</italic> yeast pulse-treated with CFW for 30 minutes. Interestingly, the CFW treatment resulted in several fold increase in selective DAGs which normally constitute only 4-5% of the total DAG pool. We observed a â¼8-fold increase in C36:0 DAGs and â¼6-fold increase in C36:1 DAG subspecies levels compared to the untreated <italic>WT</italic> sample, while the other DAG species levels remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Thus, the data clearly indicates that Pkc1 activation in yeast might require C36:0 and C36:1 DAG subspecies. We have also measured TAG subspecies levels in the presence of cell wall stress by CFW and observed that there is no depletion in the cognate TAG species suggesting that selective DAG accumulation upon CW stress is not due to TAG lipolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Fig. 2âfig. supplement 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Due to the seemingly high selectivity of DAGs for Pkc1 signalling activation <italic>in vivo</italic>, we sought to answer whether this specificity for C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs is engraved in the DAG binding domain of Pkc1. Therefore, to unravel the specificity of Pkc1 to interact with DAG across subspecies level, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> lipid binding assay. For this, we purified the DAG-binding domain of yeast Pkc1, namely conserved region domain 1 (C1domain), expressed under the galactose-inducible promoter in yeast, with GFP at its C-terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Fig. 2âfig. supplement 2A</xref>). Then, we performed liposome sedimentation assay where we prepared liposomes containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) with DAGs of different acyl chain compositions (DAGs were restricted to commercially available ones that are also abundantly present in yeast. C36:1 DAG is commercially unavailable). After incubating different liposomes with the protein, we separated both lipid-bound and unbound fractions and probed with western blot (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2 B</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed binding only in the fraction containing C36:0 liposomes, while there was no binding seen in any other DAG-containing liposome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Furthermore, we also observed a concentration-dependent increase in the binding of C1 domain with C36:0 DAGs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D and 2 F</xref>), confirming their direct physical interaction. On the other hand, no effect on binding was seen even at the higher concentrations of the other DAG species containing liposomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E-F</xref>). This points to a clear specificity of the C1 domain of yeast Pkc1 for the selective DAG subspecies acted upon by Dip2. A negative control for GFP was also used to rule out any possibility of non-specific binding with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Fig. 2âfig. supplement 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We further asked whether a similar kind of selectivity of Pkc1 C1 domain for Dip2-regulated DAGs exists in higher eukaryotes as well. We cloned the C1 domain of one of the novel Pkc1s of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (PKC98E) and rat (PKCÎ´), as yeast Pkc1 knockout phenotype has been shown to be rescued by mammalian novel PKCs (PKCÎ´) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Saiz-Baggetto et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting functional homology between the two. After expressing and purifying the C1 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Fig. 2âfig. supplement 3A</xref>), we performed the liposome sedimentation assay and observed that PKC98E C1 domain binds the DAGs which were observed to be majorly accumulated in Î<italic>Dmdip</italic>2 i.e., C32:0 and C34:1 DAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, C36:0, which was not changed significantly on deleting <italic>DIP2</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, is also found to bind the C1 domain of PKC 98E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Fig. 2âfig. supplement 3B</xref>). This could possibly be due to the difference in the <italic>in vivo</italic> and the <italic>in vitro</italic> DAG specificity of Dip2 and Pkc, respectively. Since the lipidomic profile of the <italic>Drosophila DIP2</italic> deleted strain depicts the DAG changes from its whole-body tissue, it fails to provide an accurate picture of tissue-specific DAG specificity of Dip2, which would correspond to PKC.</p>
<p>Similarly, for rat PKCÎ´ C1 domain, the liposome binding assay resulted in its binding with all the three DAGs tested (C32:0, C34:1, C36:0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Fig. 2âfig. supplement 3C</xref>) which also corroborates our previous finding, where we observed the accumulation of multiple DAGs on knocking-out <italic>DIP2A</italic> from mouse embryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Though this indicates a lack of DAG-specificity in Dip2 and PKC of higher eukaryotes, the presence of multiple paralogs of Dip2 and PKC isoforms complicate the identification of clear DAG selectivity. However, the correlation between the lipidomics data from Dip2A knockout mouse embryonic cells and the liposome sedimentation assay for PKCÎ´ further strengthens our hypothesis that Dip2-regulated DAG species are involved in activation of PKCs across life forms.</p>

<title>The canonical DAG metabolism axis is not involved in Pkc1 signalling</title>
<p>Since selective DAG-metabolism by Dip2 is associated with Pkc1 signalling, we asked whether manipulating the levels of bulk DAGs inside cell, mainly produced through canonical DAG metabolism can regulate Pkc1 signalling. DAG, being a central intermediary molecule in lipid metabolism, is acted upon by several conserved enzymes for phospholipid biosynthesis or storage lipid (TAGs) production. Majority of the enzymes participating in these processes are known to act on the bulk pool of DAGs, while the specificity for acyl-chain length remains to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rockenfeller et al, 2018</xref>). Therefore, we probed two main TAG-forming enzymes, DAG acyltransferase (Dga1) and DAG transacylase (Lro1) along with the key membrane biogenesis enzyme, DAG kinase (Dgk1) for studying the effect of bulk DAG pool on Pkc1 activation and CWI pathway. Our lipidomic analysis of these gene knockouts confirmed that both Dga1 and Lro1 act on almost all the major DAG species and their absence led to â¼2-10-fold accumulation of DAGs, consisting of varying chain lengths (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A and 3 B</xref>). <italic>Îdgk1</italic>, on the other hand, did not affect the steady-state DAG levels in yeast (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), which is in agreement with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Adeyo et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, none of the mutants of these bulk DAG-acting enzymes showed cell wall stress resistance in the presence of CFW (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>) or CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Fig. 3âfig. supplement 1</xref>). Quantifying the pSlt2 level in these knockouts also resulted in no change, when compared to total Slt2 levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p>

<p>To understand how Dip2 responds to the accumulation of bulk DAGs inside the cells, we probed the localization of Dip2 in the absence of <italic>LRO1</italic> and <italic>DGA1</italic>. Upon co-staining the cells with Mitotracker Red, we found that Dip2 remains in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Fig. 3âfig. supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the bulk DAG accumulation does not affect Dip2 subcellular localization. This might also be due to the spatial segregation of the bulk DAG pool in the endoplasmic reticulum from the selective DAG pool, which is likely to be present in mitochondria or mitochondria-vacuole contact sites.</p>
<p>In addition, we also generated double deletion mutant of <italic>DGA1</italic> and <italic>LRO1</italic> and quantified the DAG levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). Spot assay for the double knockout shows that they are sensitive to cell wall stress in the presence of CFW (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>) and in the presence of CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Fig. 3âfig. supplement 2B</xref>). However, there was â¼1.6-fold increase in pSlt2 level compared to <italic>WT</italic>, which is half of what we observe in <italic>Îdip2</italic> (3-fold) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 H</xref>). Thus, despite having a â¼2 to â¼3.5-fold accumulation of total DAG pool in the absence of canonical enzymes, Pkc1 mediated CWI signalling remained unaffected. These observations establish that there is a functional dichotomy in the cellular DAG pools: a metabolically active DAG pool that only participates in lipid biogenesis activities and signalling DAG pool that activates Pkc1 signalling cascade. Therefore, it can be proposed that the Dip2-mediated selective DAG axis has been evolved to utilize a DAG subpopulation as a secondary messenger to facilitate the regulation of PKC activation.</p>

<title>Dip2-regulated DAG subspecies for Pkc1 activation originate from phosphatidylinositol and its acyl-chain remodelling by Psi1</title>
<p>Since canonical DAG metabolism pathway is decoupled from Pkc1 signalling, we sought to identify the source of Dip2-regulated DAG subspecies involved in Pkc1 activation.

<p>To confirm the same, we also generated double knockout of <italic>DIP2</italic> and the major PA to DAG producing enzyme genes in the cell, i.e., <italic>PAH1</italic> and checked for DAG accumulation. We found that unlike what we observed in propranolol-treated <italic>Îdip2</italic> which showed no change in DAG level, double knockout of <italic>PAH1</italic> and <italic>DIP2</italic> showed â¼1.5-to-2-fold increase in all the bulk DAGs (C32:1, C32:2, C34:1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Fig. 4âfig. supplement 2A</xref>). However, we also observed a significant decrease of â¼42% in C36:0 and â¼81% in C36:1 DAGs. We also probed the effect of <italic>PAH1</italic> deletion on CW stress pathway and Pkc1 activation. We found that <italic>Îpah1</italic> and <italic>Îpah1Îdip2</italic>, both are defective in growth and sensitive to CW stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Fig. 4âfig. supplement 2B</xref>). This phenotype does not correlate with pSlt2 level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Fig. 4âfig. supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that the CW stress sensitivity is not linked to Pkc1 activation and may indicate a pleotropic defect due to alteration in lipid metabolism. However, given the reduction in the level of selective DAGs in <italic>Îpah1Îdip2</italic>, we cannot rule out the possibility that Pah1 could also be contributing to the selective DAG accumulation in <italic>Îdip2</italic>. Given this observation, we also asked whether the absence of Pah1 could affect subcellular localisation of Dip2. Therefore, we used microscopy to trace Dip2 in <italic>Îpah1</italic> and found no change in its localization suggesting that Pah1 deletion has no impact on Dip2 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Fig. 4âfig. supplement 2D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>We also deleted <italic>PLC1 in Îdip2</italic> and observed a â¼75% reduction in C36:0, C36:1 DAGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), with no change in other DAG species, suggesting that Plc1-dependent hydrolysis of C36:0 and C36:1 PIP2 pools serves as the predominant source of Dip2-metabolised selective DAGs. Whether the same source of DAGs is responsible for Pkc1 activation was investigated by checking <italic>pSlt2</italic> levels. <italic>Îplc1Îdip2</italic> and U73122-treated <italic>Îdip2</italic> showed depleted levels of <italic>pSlt2</italic>, when compared to <italic>Îdip2</italic>, while Slt2 phosphorylation remained unaffected in <italic>Îplc1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 D</xref>). This suggested that the DAGs regulated by Dip2 are sourced via hydrolysis of corresponding PIP2 and are further involved in activating Pkc1 pathway. However, a further depletion of pSlt2 level in <italic>Îplc1Îdip2</italic>, compared to <italic>Îplc1</italic> was surprising as deletion of <italic>DIP2</italic> should not alter the level of pSlt2 level. This might have resulted from a rewiring of pathways upon deleting both the genes, which possibly led to a pleiotropic effect. These observations were also strengthened by the live-cell imaging of Plc1 that showed that Plc1 partially localizes to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Fig. 4âfig. supplement 3A-B</xref>) and vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Fig. 4âfig. supplement 3C-D</xref>), similar to Dip2 suggesting that it might be producing the selective DAGs locally for Dip2 to act upon.</p>
<p>Next, we asked how exactly the specific PIP2 pool is maintained inside the cell to source these DAGs. Strikingly, a previous study has reported that the absence of an acyltransferase, phosphatidylinositol stearoyl incorporating 1 (Psi1), leads to severe depletion of C36:0 and C36:1 PIP2 species. Psi1 remodels the neo-synthesized phosphatidylinositol by adding stearic acid (C18:0) at the <italic>sn-1</italic> position of its glycerol backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Le Guedard et al, 2009</xref>), thus enriching the PI and eventually PIP2 pool with specific acyl chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Doignon et al, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence, we checked the DAG levels in <italic>Îdip2</italic> upon deleting <italic>PSI1</italic> (<italic>Îpsi1Îdip2</italic>) and observed a significant decrease in the accumulated DAGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). It is worth noting here that <italic>PSI1</italic> deletion in <italic>Îdip2</italic> background did not lead to complete depletion of accumulated DAGs in <italic>Îdip2</italic>, but a considerable quantity of DAGs, i.e., â¼36% of C36:0 and 40% of C36:1, respectively are channelled from Psi1. In the single deletion of <italic>PSI1</italic>, unexpectedly, we observed increase in almost all the DAGs quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Fig. 4âfig. supplement 4</xref>), which could be because of a compensation effect the system might have adapted due to decrease in C36:0, C36:1 phosphoinositide and respective DAGs, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Doignon et al., 2016</xref>). To test its role in Pkc1 activation, we measured pSlt2 levels in <italic>Îpsi1Îdip2</italic> and found that pSlt2 levels restored back to <italic>WT</italic> levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). In fact, deletion of <italic>PSI1</italic> itself decreases the pSlt2 level in <italic>WT</italic> by â¼35%, which phenocopies <italic>Îpsi1Îdip2,</italic> thereby strengthening the contribution of Psi1 to Pkc1 activation.</p>
<p>Together, these observations emphasize that the acyl chain remodelling of PI by Psi1 for specifically enriching C36:0 and C36:1 ensures channelling of these chain length compositions towards respective PIP2. The corresponding PIP2 species are then hydrolysed to selective DAGs by Plc1, which is responsible for Pkc1 activation. Dip2, which acts on these DAGs, regulates Pkc1 signalling and keeps a check by converting these DAGs to TAGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>). In addition, these observations also reiterate that the bulk DAG pool cannot activate Pkc1 signalling cascade. Therefore, the Psi1-Plc1-Dip2 axis serves not only as a source of DAGs but also acts as a critical checkpoint for the Pkc1 signalling cascade.</p>

<p>Fungal Pkc1 (hereafter referred to as prototypical PKC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schmitz &amp; Heinisch, 2003</xref>) harbours all the typical regulatory domains present in higher eukaryotes, which includes HR1 (homology region 1) domain, C2 domain (conserved domain 2), C1 domain (conserved domain 1) along with the protein kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schmitz &amp; Heinisch, 2003</xref>). The phylogenetic distribution suggest that the prototypical PKC had probably undergone multiple gene duplication, domain shuffling and gene loss events during early metazoan evolution resulting in a repertoire of PKC isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Fig. 5âfig. supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we observed the presence of primitive PKC, consisting of only C1 and protein kinase domains in Microsporidia, the sister group of Fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bass et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">James et al, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, only two <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> species of protists out of â¼50 genomes (available in KEGG database) harbour PKC in its primitive form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Goldberg et al, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Keenan et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wang et al, 1996</xref>). Thus, the early DAG effectors with C1 domain had evolved in one of the two major eukaryotic branches, known as Unikonta (comprising protist, microsporidia, fungi and metazoa). To our surprise, the other eukaryotic branch, Bikonta, comprising of plants, algae and SAR (<bold>S</bold>tramenopiles, <bold>A</bold>lveolates, and <bold>R</bold>hizaria) organisms, is completely devoid of the DAG effectors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Overall, our analysis suggests that PKC is the first DAG effector to be recruited in eukaryotes and evolved exclusively in opisthokonts.</p>
<p>The emergence of a prototypical Pkc with DAG-binding C1 domain in early opisthokonts suggests potential requirement of DAG regulators for optimal signalling process. Previously, we have reported that FAAL-like domains from bacteria gave rise to two tandem FAAL-like domain containing protein, Dip2 across fungi and metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Patil et al, 2021</xref>). Interestingly, the phylogenetic profile analysis of PKC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Fig. 5âfig. supplement 1B</xref>) and Dip2 showed that both are distributed across Fungi and Animalia, but are totally absent from Archaea, Bacteria, Plantae and Algae, suggesting that both the proteins show evolutionary co-emergence and co-occurrence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). It is important to note here that Dip2 is absent in a major phylum of fungi called Basidiomycota, suggesting a possible gene-loss event in this phylogenetic branch. Although Basidiomycota harbours C1 domain containing Pkc1, whether the Pkc1 is regulated by an unknown functional orthologue of Dip2, or a distinct Pkc1 signalling has been evolved in this branch of fungi, is yet to be understood. Taken together, our analysis underscores the fact that the emergence of a fully functional PKC signalling pathway can be marked by the presence of Dip2 from fungi onwards.</p>
<p>To investigate the evolutionary history of Psi1-Plc1 axis, we examined the phylogenetic distribution pattern and found that Psi1 was evolved in early eukaryotes and is conserved in both Unikonta and Bikonta. On the other hand, Plc1, consisting of multiple domains such as PH domain, EF hand domain, PI-PLC domain and C2 domain, emerged in protists and is distributed across Unikonta, while absent in Bikonta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Fig. 5âfig. supplement 1C</xref>). This evolutionary history parallels that of the relevant DAG effector, PKC.</p>
<p>We then sought to quantitatively assess the phenomenon of co-evolution between Dip2 and PKC. To investigate this, we furthered our bioinformatic analysis using molecular phylogenies of Dip2 and PKC from the representative fungi across fungal divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ocana-Pallares et al, 2022</xref>). Correlation between the phylogenetic distances (patristic distance) of Dip2 and PKC were calculated using multiple methods like Bayesian method, neighbour joining, minimum-evolution, and maximum likelihood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fourment &amp; Gibbs, 2006</xref>). The result showed significantly high association in the pairwise patristic distances of Dip2 and PKC, compared to other control gene pairs like Pgk1 and Gapdh (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C-D</xref>), suggesting their possible co-evolution across fungal phylogenetic branches.</p>
<p>To calculate the interspecies correlation of genetic divergence rate, we adopted the approach described for mirrortree algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Edgar et al, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ochoa &amp; Pazos, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pazos &amp; Valencia, 2001</xref>). In this case, genetic distances (distance matrix-based) were used to estimate the evolutionary association between Dip2 and PKC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>), which scored more than a correlation coefficient of 0.8, an empirical cut-off value suggested by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pazos &amp; Valencia, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We further reconfirmed the above observation using a larger set of all available fungal genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Fig. 5âfig. supplement 2A</xref>). This observation is further substantiated by a lesser correlation obtained on comparing Dip2 or PKC with a highly conserved gene like <italic>GAPDH</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Furthermore, the correlation between <italic>DIP2</italic> or <italic>GAPDH</italic> and a diverse set of conserved genes with related and unrelated functions were found to be below the cut-off value of correlation coefficient (&lt;0.8) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">fig. supplement 2B</xref>). We also confirmed that the correlation between Dip2-PKC pair is significantly different from this random control set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Fig. 5âfig. supplement 2C-D</xref>). Therefore, a significant interspecies correlation between Dip2 and PKC suggested that both the genes had experienced a similar evolutionary pressure, probably due to their participation in the same physiological axis. Overall, the evolutionary analysis suggests that Dip2 and PKC are phylogenetically correlated and have coevolved together for successful establishment of selective DAG-based PKC signalling in Opisthokonta.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The discovery of Dip2 as a conserved and selective DAG regulator presented a cellular scenario, where there are two âfunctionalâ pools of DAG in cell, <italic>viz</italic>., the bulk âmetabolicâ pools of DAG and the minor pools of âsignallingâ DAG. The former is involved in membrane biogenesis and storage lipid biosynthesis, while the later is Dip2-regulated selective DAG pool, responsible for activating Pkc1 signalling. Here, we provide evidence for the emergence of Dip2 and the functional diversification of DAG pool, responsible for activation of Pkc1 signalling cascades in yeast. As DAG metabolizing enzymes are generally promiscuous, their recruitment for selectively activating and fine-tuning the Pkc1 signalling events is a distant possibility. The rooting of a lipid-based signalling in eukaryotes during early Opisthokonta evolution possibly necessitated a more precise regulatory mechanism, making a species-specific regulator such as Dip2 inevitable for DAG-based PKC signalling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>A graphical representation depicting the emergence of Dip2-PKC axis and the evolution of selective DAG-based PKC signalling in Opisthokonta.</title><p>Dip2 is recruited parallel to PKC in the tree of life at the root of Opisthokonta evolution â¼1.2 billion years ago. This Dip2-PKC axis remains conserved across Fungi and Metazoan. Two distinct DAG pools are sourced from <italic>de novo</italic> or salvage pathways and acyl chain remodelling of PIs, leading to metabolic and signalling DAG pool, respectively. Remodelled phosphoinositides (PI, PIP, PIP2) by Psi1 are enriched with 18:0 acyl chains and channelled to corresponding PIP2, which forms respective DAG species (C36:0, C36:1) upon hydrolysis by Plc1. These selective DAG subspecies act as secondary messenger for PKC signalling and therefore regulate the CWI pathway in yeast. Dip2 maintains the levels of these selective DAGs by facilitating their conversion to TAGs, thereby creating a diversification of DAG function into metabolic and signalling pathways.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>The metazoan PKC isoforms such as conventional and novel PKCs are well characterized to be regulated by signalling molecules such as DAGs, calcium, phosphatidylserine etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rosse et al, 2010</xref>). Different combinations of regulatory domains in PKC isoforms result in highly diversified and mutually exclusive functions in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Reyland, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the single prototypical PKC of yeast with all the regulatory domains is involved in a myriad of physiological processes, for example, cell wall organization, progression of cell cycle, lipid metabolism, cell polarity, p-body assembly, septin organization etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al, 2017</xref>). Initially, Pkc1 activation was shown to be unaffected by DAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Antonsson et al, 1994</xref>), while a few recent reports have suggested the involvement of DAGs in activating Pkc1 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dey et al., 2017</xref>). We believe the discrepancy among the existing reports has been cleared as we have observed a selective DAG-mediated Pkc1 and CWI pathway activation in yeast. The earlier observed mutations in the putative DAG-binding C1 domain of yeast Pkc1 which results in decreased fitness in cell wall stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jacoby et al, 1997</xref>), corroborates our findings on the crucial role of DAG in activation of Pkc1-based CWI pathway. Similarly, a differential role of other domains like HR1 has been proposed in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Schmitz et al, 2002</xref>). Whether the selective DAG-based Pkc1 activation also requires HR1 domain to bind Rho1, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Recent reports have shown that exogenous addition of DAGs with varied acyl chains have differential effect on the translocation of mammalian PKC isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schuhmacher et al., 2020</xref>). While this indicates the role of distinct acyl chain-containing DAGs in differentially activating PKC isoforms, it does not represent a physiological scenario where a cell employs this. Here, we have shown selective increase in C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs which results in activation of Pkc1 upon subjecting the yeast cells to cell wall stress. Additionally, the DAG binding domain of Pkc1 shows binding exclusively with C36:0 DAG and not with other DAGs <italic>in vitro</italic>. Hence, we have identified the specific DAG subspecies for regulating Pkc1, thereby, bridging the gap in the understanding of selective DAG-driven PKC activation, that was speculated thirty years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Marignani et al., 1996</xref>). Nonetheless, the rationale for selecting the two DAG subspecies out of numerous possible combinations of acyl chains for activating Pkc1 remains an enigma and needs to be probed. It also opens up possibilities for specific roles of selective species of lipids that perhaps explains why there is a preservation of diversity in lipidome during evolution of different life forms.</p>
<p>The canonical DAG metabolizing enzymes, despite acting on C36:0, C36:1 DAGs to a certain level, are excluded from their regulatory role in Pkc1 signalling. Although the double deletion of <italic>LRO1</italic> and <italic>DGA1</italic> elevates Pkc1 activation to an extent, this increase is insufficient to confer resistance to cell wall stress. Whether it is the distinct source of Dip2 regulated DAGs from the PI pool or the spatial segregation of the two pools inside the cell, which make it exclusive to Pkc1 pathway regulation needs to be probed. Furthermore, how Pkc1, which is a bud-site (plasma membrane) protein in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Denis &amp; Cyert, 2005</xref>), is regulated by a selective DAG regulator Dip2 residing at mitochondria-vacuole contact site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal et al., 2022</xref>) requires further investigation. Characterizing the spatiotemporal nature of specific DAG accumulation that drives these processes would provide clues to the partitioning of Pkc1 activity and is currently underway.</p>
<p>Although, PKC is a well-studied signalling proteins and DAG-PKC signalling has been a textbook model for several decades, the evolutionary and regulatory origin of this pathway remained unknown. Our current work provides compelling evidence that suggests that PKC was the first DAG effector protein to be evolved and conserved in opisthokonts, while completely absent in the other eukaryotic supergroup Bikonta which comprises plant, algae and SAR organisms. The evolution of such distinct lipid-based signalling in early eukaryotic ancestors is probably a decisive factor for further branching into two subgroups-Unikonta (mainly Opisthokonta) and Bikonta. Thus, the work also suggests that the emergence of Dip2 around 1.2 billion years ago in Opisthokonta was a unique metabolic innovation to establish a precisely regulated PKC signalling pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>The role of Dip2 in fungal virulence has been highlighted in several studies as its deletion in various plant and animal pathogenic fungi like <italic>Magnaporthe oryzae</italic> (causing rice blast), <italic>Cochliobolus heterostrophus</italic> (causing southern corn blight) and <italic>Coccidioides posadasii</italic> (causing valley fever) renders them avirulent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lu et al, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Narra et al, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Wang et al, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>As PKC signalling has also been shown to be crucial for pathogenicity of fungi, the identification of Dip2 as a unique regulator of PKC would open avenues for therapeutic and pharmacological interventions. Similarly, the phenotypes for PKC hyperactivation and deletion of Dip2 observed independently in animals suggest a link between Dip2 and regulation of PKC isoforms. For instance, the abnormalities observed in upregulation of different PKC isoforms such as axonal bifurcation and outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nitta et al, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Zhang et al, 2019</xref>), altered dendritic spine morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Calabrese &amp; Halpain, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ma et al, 2019</xref>) etc. phenocopy the defects reported in Dip2 knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nitta et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, both Dip2A and PKC have been implicated independently in autistic behaviour in model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Philippi et al, 2005</xref>). Similarly, loss of Dip2C, a candidate breast cancer gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Li et al, 2017</xref>), leading to increased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Larsson et al, 2017</xref>), also resembles PKCÎµ overexpression, which not only induces EMT but is also a biomarker for aggressive breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jain &amp; Basu, 2014</xref>). These observations provide a rationale to test the possibility that multiple paralogs of Dip2 might be regulating various PKC isoforms by acting on specific pool of DAGs in higher eukaryotes.</p>

Membranes were blocked using 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 detergent (TBST) and then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (Anti-Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) Cell Signalling Technology #9101) to measure pSlt2 and p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) Antibody Cell Signalling Technology #9102) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sariki et al., 2019</xref>) to measure total Slt2 at 1:5000 dilution or TPI1 at 1:10000 dilution (gift from Dr. Palani Murganâs lab, CSIR-CCMB) followed by washing and incubation with secondary antibody (Anti-rabbit IgG Cell Signalling Technologies #7074 (1:10000). After final wash with TBST, bands were visualised using SuperSignalâ¢ West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase (HRP) substrate using BioRad Imaging System. Images were analysed using ImageJ software. For cell wall stress, cells were incubated with CR or CFW for 30 min before harvesting. For cercosporamide treatment, cells were incubated for 30 min at a concentration of 5Âµg/mL followed by harvesting and sample preparation.</p>

<p>Yeast cells were grown overnight in SC media and were diluted in 20 mL media (x6 replicates, total 120 mL media for single strain) to 0.2 OD<sub>600</sub> nm, cultured and harvested at â¼2-2.5 OD<sub>600</sub> nm. Inhibitor treated samples were cultured the same way, except that U73122 (0.5mM and 1mM) (Sigma), propranolol (1mM) (Sigma), aureobasidin A (0.025 Âµg/mL) (Takara) were added while inoculating for the secondary culture at 0.2 OD. For cell wall stress, cells were subjected to CFW (50Âµg/mL), 30 min before harvesting. Lipid isolation was performed following modified-Folch method as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abhyankar et al, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kelkar et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kumar et al, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pathak et al, 2018</xref>). Briefly, Cell pellets were washed with PBS and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were resuspended in 500 Âµl of chilled PBS and were lysed using sonicator at 60% amplitude for 1 sec ON/ 3 sec OFF for 10 cycles with a probe sonicator on ice bed. 10 Âµl of lysate from each sample was collected for protein estimation required for data normalization during lipid analysis. 250 Âµl of PBS was added, followed by addition of CHCl<sub>3</sub> and methanol mix with respective internal standards to achieve the ratio of 2:1:1 (CHCl<sub>3</sub>: Methanol: PBS). Mixture was vortexed thoroughly (2 cycles of 30 s) and was phase separated by centrifugation at 3000 RPM at RT. Bottom phase was collected in fresh glass vials followed by addition of 100 Î¼l of formic acid (â¼10%, vol/vol of lysate volume) to the remaining top phase. After vortexing again, the same way, same volume of CHCl<sub>3</sub>, as mentioned in previous step, was added for re-extraction by phase separation. Bottom phase was pooled with the already separated lipid in the first round. The total lipids extracted were dried under stream of nitrogen at room temperature. Protein estimation was performed using Bradford assay reagent (Sigma).</p>

<title>Lipidome analysis by mass spectrometry</title>
<p>The lipidomic experiment and analysis of the isolated lipid species were performed according to previously described protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abhyankar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kelkar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mondal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pathak et al., 2018</xref>). Semi-quantitative analysis of lipids was performed using two mass spectrometers: An Agilent 6545 LC-QTOF (quadrupole-time-of-flight) and a Sciex X500R QTOF employing high-resolution auto MS-MS methods and multiple reaction monitoring high resolution (MRM-HR) scanning respectively. An Electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used in both mass spectrometers. The dried lipid extracts were re-solubilized in 200 Î¼L of 2:1 CHCl3: MeOH and 10 Î¼L was injected into the mass spectrometers.</p>
<p>The liquid chromatography separation protocol was the same for both instruments. A Luna C5 column (Phenomenex, 5 Î¼m, 50 Ã 4.6 mm) coupled to a C5 guard column (Phenomenex, 4 Ã 3 mm) was used for LC separation. The solvents used were buffer A: 95:5 H2O: MeOH + 0.1% Formic acid + 10mM ammonium formate and buffer B: 60:35:5 iPrOH: MeOH: H2O + 0.1% Formic acid + 10mM ammonium formate. Methods were 30 minutes long, starting with 0.3 mL/min 100% buffer A for 4 minutes, 0.5 mL/min linear gradient to 100% buffer B over 14 minutes, 0.5 mL/min 100% buffer B for 7 minutes, and equilibration with 0.5 mL/min 100% buffer A for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The following settings were used for the ESI-MS positive mode analysis on the Agilent 6545 LC-QTOF: drying gas and sheath gas temperature: 320 Â°C, drying gas and sheath gas flow rate: 10L/min, fragmentor voltage: 150V, capillary voltage: 4000V, nebulizer (ion source gas) pressure: 45 psi and nozzle voltage: 1000V. For analysis, a lipid library of DAGs and TAGs was employed in the form of a Personal Compound Database Library (PCDL), and the peaks were validated based on relative retention times and fragments obtained.</p>
<p>For the Sciex X500R QTOF, the following settings were used for the ESI-MS positive mode analysis: source gas temperature: 400Â°C, spray voltage: 4500V, source gas 1 pressure: 40 psi, source gas 2 pressure: 50 psi. Peaks were quantified using Sciex OS, where the masses of DAGs and TAGs were curated from the lipid maps structural database (LMSD).</p>
<p>All lipid species were quantified by normalizing areas under the curve to the protein concentration of the lysate taken at the beginning.</p>

<p>Endogenous GFP-tagged strains were grown in SC media at 30Â°C and were harvested between 1.5-2 OD<sub>600</sub> nm (log phase). MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen Inc) was added to a final concentration of 50 nM in 1 mL of liquid cell culture and was incubated further for 30 min with shaking. Cells were then washed 5 times with PBS and was resuspended in 20Âµl of PBS. 3Âµl of these cells were immobilized under agar bed on glass slides and visualized under a Zeiss Apotome.2, inverted widefield fluorescence microscope equipped with a HAL 100 illuminator, Plan Apochromat Ã100 oil objective (NA 1.4), and a AxioCam CCD camera. Images were captured in DIC (Nomarski optics), mCherry (for MitoTracker Red) and FITC fluorescence mode. All images were processed using ImageJ2 software.</p>

<p>A defined list of organisms was made in order to account for the diversity in the fungal kingdom (Ascomycota, Mucoromycota, Zoopagomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Holomycota) for all the proteins used for coevolution analysis. For the distribution of PKC across tree of life, sequences were collected from the representative organisms from protists to metazoans, consisting of novel, conventional and atypical PKCs. The domain organization of the collected sequences was verified in Conserved Domains Database (CDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lu et al, 2020</xref>) to filter partial sequences. Multiple sequence alignment was then performed using MAFFT, imposing E-INS-i model for multidomain proteins.

<title>Coevolution Analysis</title>
<p>Interspecies correlation serves as a good indicator to predict functional relationship between proteins. Other than <italic>Dip2</italic> and <italic>PKC1</italic>, a set of conserved housekeeping genes (<italic>GAPDH, PGK1, ACT1, HSP60, CYTC, TPI1, CDC42, RPL5</italic>) and known lipid metabolizing enzymes (<italic>Dga1, Dgk1, Lro1, Tgl3, Faa1, Lcb1, Erg4</italic>) were taken as control proteins. The obtained alignment was checked in JalView and arranged alphabetically to maintain homogeneity in comparison. This output alignment file was used to calculate pairwise genetic distances in MEGA X using bootstrap (1000 repetitions), employing the JTT model (Jones-Taylor Thornton model) and uniform mutation rates that represent the number of substitutions per site between two homologous proteins.</p>
<p>The obtained genetic distances were exported as a distance matrix and Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated using the following equation-
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="618531v2_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
The correlation coefficients were converted to normally distributed metric using Fisherâs <italic>r</italic> to <italic>z</italic> transformation,
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="618531v2_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where,</p>
<p><italic>r</italic> = Pearson correlation coefficient</p>
<p><italic>r</italic>â² = Fisher-transformed correlation coefficient</p>
<p>These transformed coefficients (râ²) were further compared to generate z score/z test statistic using the given equation,
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="618531v2_ueqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where,</p>
<p>râ²<sub>1</sub> is the first Fisher-transformed correlation coefficient</p>
<p>râ²<sub>2</sub> is the second Fisher-transformed correlation coefficient</p>
<p>N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> denote the number of common organisms in the first and second correlation respectively. z-scores were calculated for all pairs where râ²<sub>1,</sub> representing Dip2-PKC correlation coefficient and râ²<sub>2</sub> representing correlation coefficient for Dip2 with other protein controls, giving negative values for higher correlations and positive for lower ones. p-values were calculated from the obtained z-scores.</p>
<p>Patristic distance is the sum of the lengths of the branches that link two terminal nodes in a tree, denoting the divergence between the two nodes. Using the same collected sequences, phylogenetic trees were constructed by standard methods-Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood (using JTT model), Neighbor Joining (NJ) and Minimum Evolution. Patristic distances were calculated for each phylogenetic model using PATRISTIC software and correlation coefficients were generated from the obtained distance matrices. Similar phylogenetic patterns were observed where the homogeneity in correlation coefficient is maintained. Basically, a higher correlation score represents a stronger relationship between the rate at which the two proteins have evolved along the multiple branches of their phylogenetic trees.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study dissects distinct pools of diacylglycerol (DAG), continuing a line of research on the central concept that there is a major lipid metabolism DAG pool in cells, but also a smaller signaling DAG pool. It tests the hypothesis that the second pool is regulated by Dip2, which influences Pkc1 signaling. The group shows that stressed yeast increase specific DAG species C36:0 and 36:1, and propose this promotes Pkc1 activation via Pck1 binding 36:0. The study also examines how perturbing the lipid metabolism DAG pool via various deletions such as lro1, dga1, and pah1 deletion impacts DAG and stress signaling.

<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The revision addresses several of the concerns raised previously. Most importantly, it softens several conclusions that more clearly delineates limitations of the study. The study has yet to address how Dip2 and Pkc1 crosstalk, but new text addresses this limitation. There is also more analysis of Dip2 localization in other conditions where cell DAG pools are elevated (ie a LRO1 and DGA1 double KO, as well as PAH1 KO). Loss of these proteins elevates ER DAG, but Dip2 remains mitochondrially associated. This may imply DAG specificity, or that changes to DAG pools globally does not impact Dip2 import into mitochondria.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use yeast genetics, lipidomic and biochemical approaches to demonstrate the DAG isoforms (36:0 and 36:1) can specifically activate PKC. Further, these DAG isoforms originate from PI and PI(4,5)P2. The authors propose that the Psi1-Plc1-Dip2 functions to maintain a normal level of specific DAG species to modulate PKC signalling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Data from yeast genetics are clear and strong. The concept is potentially interesting and novel.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: More evidence is needed to support the central hypothesis. The authors may consider the following:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 2: the authors should show/examine C36:1 DAG. Also, some structural evidence would be highly useful here. What is the structural basis for the assertion that the PKC C1 domain can only be activated by C36:0/1 DAG but not other DAGs? This is a critical conclusion of this work and clear evidence is needed.</p>
<p>(2) Does Dip2 colocalize with Plc1 or Pkc1? Does Dip2 reach the plasma membrane upon Plc activation?</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study dissects distinct pools of diacylglycerol (DAG), continuing a line of research on the central concept that there is a major lipid metabolism DAG pool in cells, but also a smaller signaling DAG pool. It tests the hypothesis that the second pool is regulated by Dip2, which influences Pkc1 signaling. The group shows that stressed yeast increase specific DAG species C36:0 and 36:1, and propose this promotes Pkc1 activation via Pck1 binding 36:0. The study also examines how perturbing the lipid metabolism DAG pool via various deletions such as lro1, dga1, and pah1 deletion impacts DAG and stress signaling. Overall this is an interesting study that adds new data to how different DAG pools influence cellular signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study nicely combined lipidomic profiling with stress signaling biochemistry and yeast growth assays.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for finding this study of interest and appreciating our multi-pronged approach to prove our hypothesis that a distinct pool of DAGs regulated by Dip2 activate PKC signalling.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One suggestion to improve the study is to examine the spatial organization of Dip2 within cells, and how this impacts its ability to modulate DAG pools. Dip2 has previously been proposed to function at mitochondria-vacuole contacts (Mondal 2022). Examining how Dip2 localization is impacted when different DAG pools are manipulated such as by deletion Pah1 (also suggested to work at yeast contact sites such as the nucleus-vacuole junction), or with Lro1 or Dga1 deletion would broaden the scope of the study.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to trace the localization of Dip2 in the absence of various DAG-acting enzymes. To address this, we generated Dip2-GFP knock-in (KI) in <italic>Îpah1, Îlro1</italic> and <italic>Îdga1</italic> strains, confirming successful integration by western blotting using an anti-GFP antibody. We then performed microscopy to examine the localization of Dip2. Since Dip2 is a mitochondria-vacuole contact site protein that predominantly localizes to mitochondria (approximately 60% puncta of Dip2 localize to mitochondria) (Mondal et al. 2022), we co-stained the cells with MitoTracker red to visualize mitochondria.</p>
<p>Consistent with our previous findings, Dip2 colocalizes with the MitoTracker red in <italic>WT</italic> (Figure 3-figure supplement 2 A). As suggested by the reviewer, we deleted <italic>PAH1</italic>, which converts phosphatidic acid to DAGs and is also known to work at the nucleus-vacuole junction. On examining whether absence of PAH1 influences the localization of Dip2, we found that there is no change in Dip2âs spatial organization. This could also be due to no observable change in the DAG species on deleting PAH1, as noted in our lipidomic studies (Figure 4. figure supplement 2A). These observations suggest that in a homeostatic condition, Pah1 does not affect the DAG pool acted upon by Dip2 and therefore has no influence on Dip2âs subcellular localization. This data has been incorporated in the revised manuscript (line no. 286-289) and Figure 4-figure supplement 2D-E.</p>
<p>Similarly, we probed for the localization of Dip2 in <italic>LRO1</italic> and <italic>DGA1</italic> knock out strains. These enzymes are responsible for converting bulk DAGs to TAGs. We have previously shown that Dip2 is selective for only C36:0 and C36:1 and does not act on the bulk DAGs (Mondal et al. 2022). Both Lro1 and Dga1 are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident proteins and the bulk DAG accumulation in their knockouts is shown to be in the ER (Li et al. 2020), not influencing the mitochondrial DAG pool. On tracing Dip2âs localization in these knockouts, we found that Dip2 remains in the mitochondria (Figure 3-figure supplement 2, Figure 4. figure supplement 2D,E). These results suggest that Dip2 localization is not influenced by bulk DAG accumulation, reinforcing its specificity toward selective DAGs, which are likely to be present at mitochondria and mitochondria-vacuole contact sites. We have added this data in the revised manuscript (line no. 240-246) with Figure 3. figure supplement 2.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the positive comments on our work and finding the study novel and interesting.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More evidence is needed to support the central hypothesis. The authors may consider the following:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 2: the authors should show/examine C36:1 DAG. Also, some structural evidence would be highly useful here. What is the structural basis for the assertion that the PKC C1 domain can only be activated by C36:0/1 DAG but not other DAGs? This is a critical conclusion of this work and clear evidence is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. We were unable to include C36:1 DAG in our <italic>in vitro</italic> DAG binding assays because it is not commercially available. We have now explicitly mentioned it in the revised manuscript (Line no. 186).</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that PKC activated by C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs is a critical conclusion of our work. While we understand that there is no obvious structural explanation as to how the DAG binding C1 domain of PKC attains the acyl chain specificity for DAGs, our conclusion that yeast Pkc1 is selective for C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs, is supported by a combination of robust <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data:</p>
<p>(1) <italic>In Vitro</italic> Evidence: The liposome binding assays demonstrate that the Pkc1 C1 domain binds only to the selective DAG and does not interact with bulk DAGs.</p>
<p>(2) <italic>In Vivo</italic> Evidence: Lipidomic analyses of wild-type cells subjected to cell wall stress reveal increased levels of C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs, while levels of bulk DAGs remain unaffected.</p>
<p>These findings collectively indicate that Pkc1 neither binds nor is activated by bulk DAGs, reinforcing its specificity for C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs.</p>
<p>Moreover, the structural basis of this selectivity would require either a specific DAG-bound C1 domain structure of Pkc1, which is difficult owing to the flexibility of the longer acyl chains present in C36:0 and C36:1 DAGs. In addition, capturing the full-length Pkc1 structure that might provide deeper insights has been challenging for several other groups. Also, we hypothesize that the DAG selectivity by Pkc1 is more of a membrane phenomenon wherein these DAGs might create a specific microdomain or form a particular curvature that is sensed by Pkc1. Investigating this would require extensive structural and biophysical studies, that are beyond the scope of the current work but are planned for future research.</p>

<p>(2) Does Dip2 colocalize with Plc1 or Pkc1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As shown in our previous study (Mondal et al. 2022) and in the above section (Figure 3. figure supplement 2(A-B)), Dip2 predominantly localizes to the mitochondria. Pkc1, on the other hand, is known to be found in the cytosol, plasma membrane and bud site (Andrews and Stark 2000). We also checked the localization of Pkc1, co-stained with mitotracker-red and observed no significant overlap between the two, confirming that Pkc1 does not colocalize with Dip2 (Author response image 1).</p>

<p>Moreover, as suggested by the reviewer, we also checked the localization of Plc1 and found that Plc1 is present in cytosol and shows a partial colocalization with the mitochondria (Figure 4-figure supplement 3A-B). As some puncta of Dip2 also colocalize with the vacuoles, we checked whether Plc1 also follows such localization pattern. We costained Plc1-GFP with FM4-64, a vacuolar membrane dye and observed that Plc1 partially localizes to vacuoles as well (Figure 4-figure supplement 3C-D). This is also observed in a previous study where Plc1 was found in a subcellular fractionation of isolated yeast vacuoles and total cell lysate (Jun, Fratti, and Wickner 2004). We also checked similar to Dip2, whether Plc1 also localizes to the Mitochondria-vacuole contact site by using tri-colour imaging with FM4-64 for vacuole, DAPI for mitochondria and GFP tagged Plc1. We were not able to trace Dip2 and Plc1 simultaneously as we could not generate a strain endogenously tagged with two different colours even after several attempts. However, from our observations, we can conclude that Plc1 partially localizes to mitochondria and vacuole and might be locally producing the selective DAGs to be acted upon by Dip2. We have incorporated this data in the revised manuscript (line no. 301-304) with Figure 4-figure supplement 3.</p>
<p>For probing the localization of Dip2 upon Plc1 activation, we used cell wall stress- a condition inducing Plc1 activation for selective DAG production (this study). Under this condition, we probed the localization of Dip2 by fluorescent microscopy and found that Dip2 does not move to the plasma membrane but remains localized to mitochondria (Figure. 1. figure supplement 3). This result has been added in the revised manuscript (line no. 153-160) with Figure. 1-figure supplement 3.</p>
<p>This raises intriguing questions regarding the spatial regulation of Pkc1 by Dip2. Since Dip2âs localization remains unaffected, whether the selective DAGs, presumably at the mitochondria, move to the plasma membrane for Pkc1 activation or the Pkc1 translocates to the mitochondria needs further exploration. Addressing these possibilities will require a combination of genetic approaches, organellar lipidomics, and advanced microscopy, which we aim to explore in future studies.</p>
