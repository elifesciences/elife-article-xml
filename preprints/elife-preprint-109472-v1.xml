<abstract><p>Metastasis is one of the primary causes of cancer-related death in TNBC patients. During metastasis, stromal infiltration requires the cancer cells to form invadopodia, a membrane-protrusion with proteolytic activity. Cues from growth factors via the cognate RTKs promote invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasion. This study demonstrated the role of the HGF-MET axis in invadopodia formation and associated protease trafficking. MET interacts with MT1-MMP and is co-transported to the cell surface. Further, the RTK is found to reside at invadopodia, and its recruitment increases upon HGF stimulation due to enhanced recycling mediated by RAB4 and RAB14. The study further highlights the role of RCP in MET recycling by bringing RAB14 and MET together onto endosomal subdomains. KIF16B, a molecular motor, gets recruited to MET-containing endosomes via RAB14 and promotes the endosomal tubulation, which could be crucial for MET recycling.</p>
<p>Collectively, the study provides new insights into the mechanism of tubulovesicular recycling of MET and its implications in cancer cell invasion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Triple-negative breast cancer is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer and is characterized by the lack of expression of three key receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which are generally targeted in conventional breast cancer therapies. The absence of these hormonal receptors in TNBCs imposes challenges in the treatment. Metastasis is one of the leading causes of TNBC patient morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Metastasis requires the tumor cells to cross the tissue barrier, migrate to a distant organ through circulation and colonize to form a secondary tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). To cross the tissue boundary, cancer cells navigate through the collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) meshwork, employing either amoeboid movement or protease-dependent migration. The space within the collagen network, nuclear deformability, and positioning are the key deciding factors for the cancer cells to migrate in a protease-dependent or independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Invadopodia, an actin-rich membrane protrusion decorated with proteases, is a tool for ECM and basement membrane degradation during cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>The biogenesis of Invadopodia can be accomplished in four stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The initiation involves the formation of an invadopodia precursor comprised of actin and its modulators, which further gets anchored to the plasma membrane through TKS5. Next, the actin polymerizes to form a membrane protrusion, to which proteases like MT1-MMP, MMP2, and MMP9 are delivered in a regulated fashion for invadopodia maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The role of invadopodia in TNBCs is indispensable. Studies suggest that the invasive cells in the leading front form invadopodia to create micro-tracks for the follower cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Growth factors and their receptors, including EGF-EGFR and HGF-MET, can modulate the invadopodia-associated molecules, thereby promoting invadopodia-associated cancer invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>).</p>
<p>Amplification of EGFR and MET in TNBC is associated with poor prognosis and, therefore, targeted for TNBC treatment. However, often patients develop resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies due to overexpression of MET; yet, the mechanistic understanding of MET-dependent cancer invasion is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). At the cell surface, the RTKs bind to their respective ligands, leading to receptor dimerization and activation. Subsequently, they internalize rapidly and continue to signal from endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Signaling cues from RTKs are essential for invadopodia formation and ECM remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). TPRMET, an oncogenic variant of MET, forms invadopodia structures in fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Similarly, EGFR overexpression promoted invadopodia formation in melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). SNARE-dependent delivery of EGFR to invadopodia promotes invadopodia-associated tumor invasion, highlighting the potential role of RTK trafficking in cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). EGFR induces Cortactin phosphorylation through SRC and ARG, which triggers the formation of invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). However, MET-directed Cortactin phosphorylation in invadopodia is SRC or ARG-independent, indicating the differential function of MET in invadopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Though MET is known to be involved in invadopodia-associated cancer invasion, the detailed mechanisms are yet to be explored.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the role of HGF and its cognate receptor, MET, in invadopodia-associated cancer cell invasion in TNBC cell lines. Our study revealed that activated MET resides at invadopodia and its invadopodia-recruitment is enhanced upon HGF stimulation. Our findings emphasize the importance of the growth factor-mediated cell-surface transport of MET in invadopodia formation and MT1-MMP recruitment through physical interaction with the protease that leads to enhanced TNBC invasion upon HGF stimulation. We further delineated the involvement of the cellular recycling repertoire in the growth factor-stimulated recycling of MET.</p>

<title>HGF-induced MET activity promotes TNBC breast cancer invasion through invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation</title>
<p>The upregulation of EGFR and MET promotes breast cancer invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). To understand the correlation between gene alteration in these RTKs and the outcome of invasive breast cancer, we analyzed 14155 samples in 27 breast cancer datasets using cBioportal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cbioportal.org/">https://www.cbioportal.org/</ext-link>). MET was found to be altered in 2% of the breast cancer samples (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Next, the correlation between gene alteration of EGFR or MET and patient survival was inspected and found to be negatively correlated with the survival of the patients (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>).</p>
<p>MET, upon activation by HGF, triggers the activation of the RTK that induces cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We examined the MET expression in TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and the non-TNBC invasive breast cancer cell line MCF10A DCIS by immunoblotting. We observed comparable MET expression in all 3 cell lines (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). Next, to inspect the effect of HGF on the invasive properties of breast cancer cell lines, we employed a spheroid invasion assay that closely resembles the physiological environment. Spheroids were formed using MDA-MB-231 or BT-549 cells and embedded in collagen I with or without HGF or in complete media. The spheroids were allowed to invade for 48 hours. The ratio of core area to invaded area was calculated, revealing that HGF-treated cells invaded more into collagen compared to untreated conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref>, <xref rid="video1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 1</xref>).</p>

<p>To invade the stroma, tumor cells degrade the underlying basement membrane. To understand the effect of HGF on ECM remodelling, we carried out a fluorescent-labelled gelatin degradation assay. We seeded cells on Alexa568-labeled gelatin-coated coverslips in the presence or absence of HGF and allowed them to degrade gelatin for a minimum of three hours. The loss of fluorescence due to gelatin degradation, represented as the degradation index, was calculated as detailed in the methods section. Our results showed that HGF treatment significantly increased gelatin degradation activity in MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MCF10A DCIS cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, S1E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>The ECM degradation activity of cancer cells is attributed to invadopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the ability of HGF to induce invadopodia formation. Cells were seeded on gelatin in the presence or absence of HGF for 6h, fixed, and immunostained for known invadopodia markers, i.e., TKS5, Cortactin, or Actin. Puncta positive for two invadopodia markers were considered as invadopodia. When stimulated with HGF, increased numbers of invadopodia were observed in MDA-MB-231, BT-549 and MCF10A DCIS cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, S1E, G</xref>). Additionally, the other most abundant RTK in TNBC cells, EGFR, when activated by EGF, resulted in a significant increase in invadopodia number in MDA-MB-231 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1H</xref>) cells, corroborating previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, to study whether MET activation is essential for invadopodia formation, we inhibited the kinase activity of MET using the drug PHA665752. Immunoblot analysis revealed that HGF stimulation increased MET pTyr1234-1235 (pY-MET), which was abolished by the drug (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1J</xref>). Interestingly, the drug treatment also led to degradation of MET (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1J</xref>). MDA-MB-231 cells were analyzed for their ability to form invadopodia in the presence of 5 µM of the drug or vehicle, with or without HGF. Inhibition of MET kinase activity using PHA665752 abolished the HGF-induced invadopodia formation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether MET is important for HGF-governed invadopodia formation, MET was silenced using different clones of shRNA against MET, and the level of silencing was evaluated (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1I</xref>). MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with control SHC002 or MET shRNA C#3. After 36h, cells were seeded on labelled gelatin for 6h, fixed, and immunostained with phalloidin and an antibody against MET. Invadopodia formation was abrogated in the MET-depleted cells compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>, S1I).</p>
<p>Taken together, HGF activates RTK MET and promotes TNBC invasion by enhancing invadopodia formation and associated activity.</p>

<title>Enhanced MET recruitment to Invadopodia upon HGF stimulation</title>
<p>Since MET activity was found to be important for invadopodia formation, we first asked if MET is localized at invadopodia. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded on a gelatin-coated surface for 6 hours. Then, the cells were fixed and immunostained for MET and Cortactin. A notable population of Cortactin puncta was found to be localized with MET (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Next, the colocalization of MET to GFP-TKS5 was examined using TIRF microscopy (TIRFM). Approximately 30% of the TKS5 population showed staining for MET (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, D</xref>). Confocal imaging of BT-549 cells immunostained for TKS5 and MET revealed that MET-TKS5 colocalization follows the same trend as MDA-MB-231 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). Next, we asked whether MET is in its active form at invadopodia. Cherry-TKS5 expressing cells were seeded on gelatin, fixed, and immunostained for phosphorylated pY-MET. TIRF imaging revealed that 27% of TKS5 puncta are positive for pY-MET, similar to that of MET localization to TKS5-positive invadopodia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C, D</xref>).</p>

Invadopodia with TKS5 intensity less than 4 showed no correlation with MET intensity (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.03 for linear regression); however, Invadopodia with TKS5 intensity more than 4 showed a negative correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3 for linear regression) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Further, we analyzed the frequency distribution of the MET to TKS5 fluorescence intensity ratio across invadopodia. It revealed that most invadopodia structures exhibited lower MET/TKS5 ratios (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref>). This observation prompted us to investigate the apparent absence of MET from mature invadopodia. To address this, the localization of MET at the invadopodia-mediated degradation spots was examined in the MDA-MB-231 cells plated on fluorescence-labelled gelatin. As implied above, the degradation spots did not show strong colocalization with MET (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>As we have observed that HGF stimulates invadopodia formation via MET and the RTK is physically localized at the invadopodia site, we asked if HGF influences MET localization to the invadopodia. Cells were seeded on gelatin with or without HGF, fixed, and immunostained for MET and invadopodia markers. Intriguingly, upon treatment with HGF, we observed an increased MET-containing TKS5-positive invadopodia structure in both MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G, S2C, D</xref>). This observation led us to hypothesize that HGF may induce the surface delivery of MET to invadopodia.</p>
<p>Previously, it was reported that HGF stimulation leads to endocytosis of MET, followed by lysosomal degradation of the RTK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). First, we analyzed the effect of HGF on receptor endocytosis and degradation of MET. To study the HGF-mediated receptor endocytosis, the colocalization of MET with RAB5 was quantified with or without HGF. The percent colocalization of MET with RAB5 was found to be increased from 12% to 43% in the presence of HGF stimulation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>). Next, cells were incubated with HGF for different time points, and the total MET levels were quantified using immunoblotting. After 3h of HGF stimulation, ∼50% of MET was found to be degraded (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2F</xref>). To validate our hypothesis that HGF can induce surface delivery of MET, GFP-MET-expressing cells were imaged with TIRFM with or without HGF, and MET tracks were quantified as explained in the method. In the presence of HGF, an increased number of MET tracks were found near the plasma membrane compared to the untreated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, <xref rid="video2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 2</xref>). This suggests that HGF indeed increases the trafficking of MET to the cell surface. We also observed a similar effect of EGF on EGFR localization at invadopodia (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2G, H</xref>), consistent with an earlier study in MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>).</p>
<p>These observations convey that MET resides in the invadopodia structures and HGF treatment leads to enhanced surface delivery of MET and its recruitment to invadopodia.</p>

<title>HGF-mediated surface delivery of MET promotes invadopodia-associated ECM degradation and breast cancer cell invasion</title>
<p>As HGF promotes MET recycling and breast cancer invasion, we investigated whether MET recycling drives invadopodia-associated TNBC invasion. To address this, we employed the degradation-defective M1250T mutant and the endocytosis-defective LL/AA MET mutant as a negative control. An oncogenic mutation in MET at M1268T (M1250 in the MET constructs used in this study) is naturally found in papillary renal carcinoma, has a degradation defect leading to continuous endocytosis and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The dileucine motif of MET is required for endocytosis of the receptor, which is mutated to AA in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). First, we have characterized the mutants for endocytosis and degradation. We looked into the degradation kinetics of the mutants by immunoblotting. Unlike the wild-type (WT) MET, the M1250T MET mutant did not undergo degradation upon HGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Since the M1250T mutant has a slower degradation rate, we asked whether the M1250T mutant is in its activated form. V5 tagged-MET WT or the mutant was overexpressed and pulled down using Ni-NTA beads through the His-tag present in the coding region. The pulled-down samples were analysed by immunoblotting using the pY-MET antibody. M1250T MET was highly phosphorylated at the active site compared to the WT MET (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). The observation was further confirmed by immunofluorescence. The normalized CTCF value of pY-MET in M120T MET expressing cells was found to be higher compared to WT MET (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2I</xref>). Next, the effect of HGF on the endocytosis of WT or the mutant MET was investigated. Cells were transfected with WT V5-MET or the mutant constructs, and their percentage of localization with EEA1, an early endosomal marker, was quantified in the presence or absence of HGF. HGF stimulation leads to an increased MET population localizing with EEA1 in WT MET expressing cells, whereas M1250T mutant cells showed an increased colocalization with EEA1 irrespective of the HGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, D’). The endocytosis-defective LL/AA mutant did not show any increase in the EEA1 colocalization in response to HGF.</p>

<p>To understand the effect of intracellular trafficking of MET on breast cancer invasion, cells expressing the WT or mutant forms of MET were analyzed for their ECM degradation ability. WT or the mutant V5-MET expressing BT-549 cells were seeded on Alexa568-labeled gelatin-coated coverslip with or without HGF, fixed, and immunostained with anti-V5 antibody. Confocal image analysis showed that WT MET-expressing cells have enhanced ECM degradation ability when stimulated with HGF; however, neither mutant responded to HGF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, E’). The mutant M1250T MET showed comparable gelatin degradation as the WT MET stimulated with HGF, whereas the LL/AA had decreased invasion ability. We repeated the experiment in MDA-MB-231 cells and observed similar trends for the mutants (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2J</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the ECM degradation ability of M1250T was higher, we asked whether it was because of increased invadopodia formation. M1250T MET-expressing cells showed increased invadopodia formation compared to WT MET-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>, S2K, K’). However, cells expressing the LL/AA mutant did not show a significant difference compared to WT MET (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2K, K’</xref>). Also, the number of invadopodia positive for M1250T MET was higher compared to WT MET-positive invadopodia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>)</p>
<p>To further investigate the effect of the M1250T MET mutant on breast cancer invasion, we employed a spheroid invasion assay. We generated a doxycycline-inducible GFP-MET WT and M1250T cell line in BT-549. Spheroids were formed for WT and M1250T MET expressing cells and embedded in collagen for 24 hours to allow invasion. The M1250T GFP-MET expressing cell line invaded more into the collagen compared to the WT MET expressing spheroid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), supporting our observations from gelatin degradation.</p>
<p>These observations demonstrated that MET recycling ensures a steady delivery of the RTK to the invadopodia structures, thereby promoting breast cancer invasion.</p>

<title>HGF promotes RAB4 &amp; RAB14-mediated MET delivery to the plasma membrane</title>
<p>RAB GTPases are molecular switches, localized to distinct endosomal compartments, and orchestrate various endocytic, trans, and exocytic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). To investigate the RABs involved in MET recycling, we first inspected the colocalization of MET with endosomal markers that work in the recycling pathways, like RAB4, RAB22, RAB14 and RAB11. Cells were transfected with the different RAB constructs and incubated in the presence or in the absence of HGF before fixing and immunostaining for MET. The object-based percentage of colocalization was calculated using Motiontracking, for which vesicles for each molecule were identified, and the objects were considered to be colocalized if the overlap of their respective area was more than 35%. While the localization of MET with RAB4 and RAB14 was found to be increased in the HGF-stimulated cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>), the colocalization with RAB22 and RAB11 remained unchanged, suggesting them to be associated with an HGF-independent trafficking pathway (S3A, B).</p>
<p>Next, to identify the RABs that are involved in the HGF-dependent MET surface delivery, live cell TIRF imaging was performed in RAB4, RAB14, and RAB22-depleted cells. As the role of RAB4 in MET recycling has been established before, it was included as a positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). The RABs were silenced using SMARTpool siRNA, and knockdown efficiency was quantified (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>). GFP-MET was overexpressed in the control and the RABs-depleted cells and imaged using a TIRF microscope in the presence of HGF. The total number of MET vesicles, including MET tracks at the surface, was found to be reduced when RAB4 or RAB14 was deleted compared to the control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>, <xref rid="video3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 3</xref>).</p>
<p>When the recycling is impaired, a significant population of the RTKs is subjected to degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Next, to study the fate of MET in the RABs-depleted cells, we performed immunoblotting to quantify the total population of cellular MET. Cells depleted of the RABs mentioned above were treated with HGF. Cells were lysed and subjected to immunoblotting. The RAB4 and RAB14-depleted cells were observed to have a decreased total MET level compared to the control (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the retromer is known to drive the recycling of various cargoes to the plasma membrane, we checked the role of retromer depletion on MET recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The co-localization of MET with VPS35, a retromer subunit, was comparable with or without HGF (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E</xref>). Further to analyze whether retromer is essential for MET trafficking, MDA-MB-231 cells were depleted for the VPS26A retromer subunit, and the MET localization to Actin at fan-shaped membrane protrusions in response to HGF stimulation was quantified. The membrane pool of MET localizing with actin-rich structures was unchanged in the retromer-depleted condition (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3F</xref>). The total MET in the retromer-silenced cells also remained unaffected (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3G</xref>).</p>
<p>As HGF stimulation leads to increased recruitment of MET to invadopodia, we asked whether RAB4 &amp; RAB14-mediated MET recycling plays a role in invadopodia formation and MET colocalization at the invadopodia. Cells depleted with RAB4 or RAB14 were analyzed for their ability to form invadopodia and the MET localization to the structure. As expected, Invadopodia numbers were reduced in RAB4 and RAB14-depleted cells. Further, MET localization to invadopodia was also found to be reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). In line with previous findings, the number of lamellipodia-forming cells was also drastically reduced in the RAB4 and RAB14-silenced cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>

<p>We examined the colocalization of RAB14 with EEA1, and 60% of the RAB14 was found to be colocalized with EEA1 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3I</xref>). However, a small population of MET-containing RAB14 vesicles (∼10%) was not EEA1 positive and present away from the nucleus. Next, we analyze the distribution of MET to RAB4 and RAB14 vesicles using super-resolution microscopy. The GFP-RAB4 and Cherry-RAB14 expressing cells were stimulated with HGF, then fixed and immunostained for MET. The peripheral vesicles containing MET were positive for RAB4 or RAB14, with RAB14-positive MET endosomes showing minimal or no RAB4 presence, whereas the RAB4-positive MET endosomes are devoid of RAB14 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3J</xref>).</p>
<p>A study from Wang et.al. suggests that RAB14 vesicles can also be budded out from the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). We analyzed the localization with a Golgi marker to understand the biogenesis of these RAB14-MET vesicles. Cherry-RAB14 expressing cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-MET and anti-Golgin97 antibody. A small fraction (4%) of RAB14-positive MET puncta localized with the Golgi (Fig. SK).</p>
<p>When we analyzed the effect of HGF on RAB14 vesicular characteristics. GFP-RAB14 expressing cells were treated with or without HGF, fixed, and imaged with a confocal microscope. The integral intensity and area of RAB14 vesicles were quantified. The area of GFP-RAB14 vesicles was found to be increased in the HGF-treated cells, whereas the integral intensity was unaffected (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3H</xref>). This indicates that the effect of HGF on the trafficking pathway is not mediated solely by RAB14, but also that additional players are involved in the RAB14-mediated trafficking.</p>
<p>The above results suggest that a fraction of the MET recycles back to the surface via the RAB4 or RAB14-mediated recycling pathway, which is crucial for the recruitment of MET to invadopodia.</p>

<title>RCP-RAB14-KIF16B axis regulates MET trafficking</title>
<p>The mechanism behind HGF-mediated MET recycling through RAB4 has been demonstrated earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). So, we set out to study the RAB14-dependent trafficking of MET. RAB coupling protein (RCP) is known to be an interacting partner of RAB14, and a study in the H1299 cell line reported it to interact with MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). To explore the alterations of RCP in breast cancer, we analyzed 32 publicly available breast cancer datasets consisting of a total of 15404 patients in cBioportal and found that RCP is amplified in these datasets (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). Furthermore, the probability of survival was lower for patients with increased expression of RCP (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>).</p>
<p>First, we analyzed the colocalization of MET and GFP-RCP with EEA1. Cells transfected with GFP-RCP were treated with HGF and then fixed, followed by immunostaining for MET and EEA1. In colocalization analysis, we found that 37 % of MET-positive RCP vesicles colocalize with EEA1 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>). To study whether RCP has any role in the RAB14-mediated MET recycling, we examined its subcellular localization on RAB14-MET vesicles in the presence or absence of HGF. Due to the unavailability of a validated antibody for immunocytochemistry for RAB14 and RCP, overexpression constructs were used. The anti-RCP antibody used for immunoblotting was not applicable for immunofluorescence. GFP-RCP and Cherry-RAB14 co-expressing cells were fixed and immunostained for MET. Images were captured using a confocal microscope, and the colocalization of MET-RAB14 with RCP was analyzed. In agreement with Gundry et.al, we observed an increased localization of RCP with RAB14 (35% to 51%) in the presence of HGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Further, the colocalization of RCP with MET (32% to 48%) and MET-RAB14 (22% to 37%) was found to be increased upon HGF stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p>

<p>Gundry et al. demonstrated that HGF stimulation induces phosphorylation of RCP at Ser435, which enhances its complex formation with RAB14. We analyzed the distribution of MET and RAB14 in the presence or absence of HGF stimulation with the RCP S435A mutant. An increased colocalization of RCP S435A with MET (38% to 58%) and MET-RAB14 (28% to 48%) vesicles was observed upon HGF stimulation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D</xref>). However, the colocalization of RCP S435A with RAB14 did not increase with HGF treatment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed that MET and RCP are enriched at the vesicular buds on RAB14 vesicles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, S4F), which are critical for cargo sorting and recycling. Live cell imaging of GFP-RAB14 revealed that these buds elongate and undergo fission to form tubulovesicular structures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, <xref rid="video4" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 4</xref>). Live-cell confocal imaging of cells expressing GFP-RCP and Cherry-RAB14 revealed the presence of RCP in the RAB14 tubules (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>, <xref rid="video5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 5</xref>). Further, fixed cell confocal imaging highlighted that MET is present in these tubular elongations emanating from endosomes along with RCP and RAB14 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Further, the MET-containing GFP-RCP vesicles were positive for WASH staining, which promotes actin polymerization at endosomes (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether RAB14 plays a role in RCP recruitment to MET-endosomes, we overexpressed GFP-RCP in RAB14-depleted cells, then fixed and immunostained them with the anti-MET antibody. Confocal imaging revealed that the percentage of colocalization of MET with RCP was unaltered in the RAB14-silenced cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E</xref>). Next, we examined the role of RCP in RAB14 and MET endosomal association. RCP was depleted with siRNA and validated with qRT-PCR and immunoblotting (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4H, H’</xref>). The cells were transfected with Cherry-RAB14, treated with HGF, and fixed. Further, the cells were immunostained with antibodies against MET and EEA1. Images were captured with a confocal microscope, and colocalization was quantified. A 15% decrease in colocalization of MET to RAB14 endosomes that was present with EEA1 was observed in the RCP-silenced cells compared to the control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Further, upon RCP depletion, the colocalization of MET to RAB14 was found to be reduced by 10%, but was statistically non-significant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The pool of MET or RAB14 vesicles that do not colocalize with EEA1 as observed in (Fig S3I) was unperturbed upon RCP silencing (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4I</xref>).</p>
<p>Molecular motors are one of the effectors of RAB GTPase, which cause membrane tubulation, thereby promoting protein sorting and trafficking. KIF16B is one of the motor proteins known to work with RAB14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Hence, we analysed the colocalization of MET-containing RAB14 vesicles with KIF16B. Cells expressing YFP-KIF16B and Cherry-RAB14 were fixed and immunostained for MET. Confocal imaging revealed that KIF16B also resides in the endosomal tubules along with RAB14 and MET (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Next, we analyzed the colocalization of RAB14-MET endosomes with KIF16B in the presence or absence of HGF. YFP-KIF16B and Cherry-RAB14 co-expressing cells were fixed and immunostained for MET. Images were captured using a confocal microscope, and percentage colocalization was quantified using Motiontracking. An increased colocalization of MET (21% to 43%) and MET-RAB14 (17% to 29%) vesicles with KIF16B was observed in the presence of HGF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). However, RAB14 colocalization to KIF16B remained unaltered upon HGF treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Since KIF16B is an effector of RAB14, upon silencing of the GTPase, the colocalization of KIF16B with MET was found to be reduced, as expected (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4J</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>).</p>
<p>KIF16B is known to promote tubulation in the early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). So, to investigate the potential role of KIF16B in RAB14 endosomal tubulations, we overexpressed WT or the dominant negative form of the motor with an Ala substitution at the S109 position of KIF16B. BT-549 cells co-expressing Cherry-RAB14 with WT KIF16B or the S109A mutant were subjected to live cell imaging. In 40% of the WT KIF16B expressing cells, RAB14 tubules were observed, whereas it was only 15% in the case of the S109A mutant expressing cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>, <xref rid="video6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 6</xref>). This result suggests a potential role for KIF16B in endosomal tubule formation.</p>
<p>Together, these observations suggest that RCP facilitates the MET colocalization to RAB14 on EEA1 endosomes. Further, RCP, MET, and RAB14 localize to endosomal tubules, which are involved in cargo recycling. Furthermore, the colocalization data suggest that HGF fosters the association of KIF16B to MET-RAB14 vesicles and the motor promotes the RAB14 tubulation, promoting MET trafficking.</p>

<title>HGF-MET facilitates ECM degradation by recycling MT1-MMP to the surface</title>
<p>MT1-MMP is one of the invadopodia-associated surface proteases with a wide range of substrate specificity for diverse ECM components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Perturbed MT1-MMP recycling impedes ECM degradation and cancer invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). HGF is known to increase the expression and activity of invadopodia-associated metalloproteases MMP2 &amp;MMP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). We asked if HGF-stimulated invadopodia activity is mediated by MT1-MMP. We began by studying the expression of MT1-MMP in HGF-treated conditions. 3h of HGF stimulation did not alter the expression or degradation of MT1-MMP (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A, A’</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether HGF treatment leads to enhanced recycling of the protease. We performed an antibody uptake assay, where cells were incubated with MT1-MMP antibody at 4℃, followed by internalization at 37℃. Antibodies available at the surface were removed, and further cells were incubated with HGF to allow recycling at 37℃. The percent of recycling was calculated as described in the methods. Antibody uptake assay revealed that HGF stimulation induced 30% recycling of antibody-bound MT1-MMP, whereas, in the untreated condition, the recycling of MT1-MMP was 10% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>).</p>

<p>To support our observation from the antibody uptake assay, we employed TIRFM-based imaging to capture MT1-MMP exocytosis in real time. We overexpressed a pH-sensitive GFP, pHluorin-tagged MT1-MMP in MDA-MB-231, and quantified the number of exocytic events using TIRFM. We could see an increased surface delivery of pHluorin MT1-MMP when stimulated with HGF (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, <xref rid="video7a" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 7A, B</xref>).</p>
<p>The observation was further validated using surface biotinylation. For biotinylation, untreated or HGF-treated cells were incubated with uncleavable biotin, EZ-linked Sulfo-NHS biotin at 4℃. The cells were lysed, and the biotinylated pool was captured with streptavidin beads. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the HGF-treated cells have a higher surface MT1-MMP pool than the untreated cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). CIMPR has been taken as control, whose surface level did not alter with HGF treatment (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B’</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether HGF also promotes the endocytosis of MT1-MMP. To address this, an antibody uptake assay was performed in the presence or absence of HGF. Cells grown on coverslips were incubated with MT1-MMP antibody at 4℃ for 1h. The cells are allowed to internalize the antibody in the presence or absence of HGF. Cells were fixed, imaged with a confocal microscope, and the integral intensity of the internalized MT1-MMP antibody was quantified. HGF stimulation did not show any effect on the endocytosis of MT1-MMP (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D</xref>).</p>
<p>MT1-MMP is recruited to Invadopodia for efficient ECM remodelling. Since we saw an increased MT1-MMP recycling to the surface, we investigated the MT1-MMP recruitment to invadopodia in the presence or absence of HGF. MDA-MB-231 was seeded on gelatin with or without HGF. After 6h, cells were fixed and immunostained for invadopodia markers. TIRF imaging revealed that, indeed, HGF treatment leads to more MT1-MMP-containing invadopodia compared to the untreated condition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Further, to understand whether the receptor MET is also involved in the MT1-MMP recruitment to invadopodia, MET was silenced using siRNA, and the MT1-MMP population at invadopodia was quantified. Upon depletion of MET, the number of MT1-MMP-containing invadopodia was reduced (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5E</xref>). However, MET depletion did not alter MT1-MMP expression (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, to gain insight into the possible role of MET in MT1-MMP recruitment to invadopodia, we examined the localization of MT1-MMP with MET. The percentage of colocalization was increased from 12% to 45% when the cells were stimulated with HGF (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5F</xref>). Super-resolution microscopy revealed that in GFP-MT1-MMP expressing cells, MET localizes to the same endosomal microdomain as MT1-MMP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). Interestingly, a protein-protein interaction prediction database PSOPIA anticipated the interaction between MT1-MMP and MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). To establish the physical interaction between MET and MT1-MMP, we employed a GFP nanobody pulldown approach. Lysates of GFP or GFP-MT1-MMP expressing cells were incubated with GST bead-bound GFP binding protein. The interaction was analyzed by immunoblotting. An increased binding of MET to GFP-MT1-MMP compared to GFP was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). The interaction was supported by performing GFP nanobody pulldown in HeLa and MCF10A DCIS (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5G</xref>). Next, to validate the interaction, we performed a reverse pull-down. We overexpressed GFP or GFP-MT1-MMP with V5-MET. V5-MET was trapped using Ni-NTA beads. Immunoblotting of the pulldown sample revealed that V5-MET exclusively interacts with GFP-MT1-MMP (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5H</xref>).</p>
<p>MT1-MMP is known to cleave and shed the ectodomain of LDL receptor, apo-A1, ApoE, p-selectin, MMP2, MMP13, and αV integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). As MT1-MMP and MET interact, we asked whether MT1-MMP can also activate MET by shedding its pro-domain. We quantified the mature MET population of 140 kDa in MT1-MMP-silenced cells by immunoblotting. The total matured MET population remains unchanged in the protease-depleted cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5L</xref>). Further, to comprehend the relevance of the interaction between the RTK and MT1-MMP, we hypothesize that their physical association plays a crucial role in their simultaneous enrichment at invadopodia, potentially via co-trafficking. To test this hypothesis, cells were transfected with GFP-MET and Cherry-MT1-MMP and imaged under a TIRF microscope. In live-cell TIRFM, GFP-MET and Cherry-MT1-MMP were found to be co-transported at the cell surface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, <xref rid="video8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 8</xref>). These data suggest that HGF promotes MT1-MMP surface delivery and the receptor MET via physical interaction with MT1-MMP, ensuring a directed delivery to invadopodia.</p>
<p>A recent study by Ferrari et.al. suggests that MT1-MMP is not only required for invadopodia maturation but also can affect invadopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). To explore the role of MT1-MMP on invadopodia formation, we analyzed the number of invadopodia formed in the MT1-MMP knocked-out cells. Interestingly, the invadopodia formation was drastically reduced in the MT1-MMP-deleted cells compared to the control, highlighting the significance of MT1-MMP in invadopodia formation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5J, J’</xref>). Next, the protease was overexpressed, and the number of invadopodia formed was quantified. The overexpression of MT1-MMP WT or a catalytically inactive mutant E240A MT1-MMP increases the invadopodia number; however, no significant change was observed between the E240A MT1-MMP and WT MT1-MMP (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5K, K’</xref>). Since MET can also induce invadopodia formation, we asked whether MT1-MMP can modulate the invadopodia formation ability of MET as a result of their physical interaction. The co-expression of MET WT or M1250T with WT MT1-MMP leads to a 1.8-fold increase in the difference observed in the number of invadopodia formed between the WT and M1250T MET compared to the 1.35-fold increase in overexpression of MET WT and M1250T alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). However, E240A MT1-MMP could enhance invadopodia formation up to 1.5-fold in M120T MET expressing cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). This highlights the potential influence of MT1-MMP on their invadopodia formation. When we analyzed the MT1-MMP recruitment to invadopodia in the presence of the M1250T mutant, we observed an increased colocalization of MT1-MMP to invadopodia compared to the WT MET (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5I</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, to understand whether the increased invadopodia number in the M1250T MET and MT1-MMP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>) was due to the higher affinity of the MET mutant for MT1-MMP, we employed a pulldown approach. Cell lysates from V5/H-MET WT or M1250T and GFP or GFP-MT1-MMP were incubated with Ni-NTA beads. The pulldown samples were analyzed by immunoblotting. We did not observe a preferential binding of MT1-MMP to M1250T (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5M</xref>), nor was the MT1-MMP expression altered in the mutant expressing cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5N</xref>), inferring the increased invadopodia formation of M1250T MET in the presence of MT1-MMP is not because of physical interaction.</p>
<p>Taken together, our observations suggest that the HGF-MET axis directs MT1-MMP to invadopodia. The physical association between MT1-MMP and RTK MET ensures their co-trafficking to the surface, thereby promoting invadopodia formation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study elucidates the correlation between MET intracellular trafficking and invadopodia-driven breast cancer invasion. This study highlights that HGF stimulation promotes MET and MT1-MMP recycling to invadopodia. MET and MT1-MMP physically interact, which we hypothesize to be crucial for their co-trafficking to the cell surface. RAB4 and RAB14 mediate the MET delivery to invadopodia, perturbation of which affects cancer cell invasion. RCP and MET localize to RAB14 endosomal tubules, the formation of which is promoted by KIF16B for efficient MET trafficking.</p>

<title>Invadopodia recruitment of RTKs and its modulation by growth factor stimulation</title>
<p>TKS5 is one of the crucial molecules of invadopodia that act as a scaffold to stabilize and recruit the initial precursor complex to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). During invadopodium formation, TKS5 intensity gradually increases and stabilizes until the structure is disassembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). The current study reveals that MET localizes to around 20% of TKS5-positive invadopodia; however, mature structures are devoid of MET, indicating the temporal association of MET with invadopodia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, F</xref>). The intensity plot of TKS5 versus MET per invadopodium reveals that invadopodia with higher TKS5 intensity showed an inverse correlation of TKS5 with MET fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). These observations suggest that MET recruitment and its activity may precede invadopodia maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Further live cell imaging would confirm the time-dependent recruitment of MET to invadopodia.</p>
<p>The EGF-EGFR axis is known to be involved in the invadopodia formation by activating several molecules associated with invadopodia biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). SNARE-mediated delivery of EGFR to invadopodia facilitates EGFR phosphorylation, demonstrating the importance of EGFR trafficking in invadopodia activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Consistent with these studies, we observed that EGF stimulation led to increased recruitment of EGFR to invadopodia, similar to the effect of HGF on MET (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, S2H), presumably due to increased surface delivery. This observation suggests that the growth factor-mediated recruitment of RTKs to invadopodia may be a generalized mechanism applicable to RTKs that are known to promote invadopodia-associated activity.</p>

<title>Regulation of MET trafficking and its implications on cellular behaviour</title>
<p>The RTK signaling begins with growth factor binding to its respective receptor, leading to internalization and subsequent lysosomal degradation. Following receptor internalization, signaling from peripheral endosomes is one of the ways of spatiotemporal regulation of the RTK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). In our study, we have highlighted that HGF can trigger the recycling of MET, in addition to promoting its lysosomal degradation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>, S2F). This HGF-dependent surface delivery of MET leads to its enhanced recruitment to invadopodia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>After HGF binding, MET rapidly undergoes endocytosis and enters RAB4-positive endosomes in HeLa cells, from where it gets recycled via GGA3 and CLIP170, further driving cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Kermorgant et al. further demonstrated that PKCƐ and PKCα facilitate different MET trafficking pathways, promoting cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>).</p>
<p>We have investigated the effect of MET trafficking on cancer cell invasion by employing a mutant M1250T MET with a degradation defect, triggering enhanced endocytosis and recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The mutant showed increased invadopodia formation and invasion ability compared to WT MET (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-G</xref>, S2J, K, K’). Further, the mutant MET-expressing cells have increased MT1-MMP-associated invadopodia, suggesting enhanced protease delivery in the presence of the mutant compared to WT MET (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5I</xref>). This confirms the significance of RTK trafficking in invadopodia-associated cancer cell invasion.</p>

<title>RAB14 and its Potential regulators of MET recycling</title>
<p>Our observations underlined the crucial role of RAB4 and RAB14-mediated MET recycling in invadopodia-associated function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-F</xref>). The MET was localized to RAB4 and RAB14 together at the perinuclear compartments; however, the peripheral MET-containing endosomes were distinct for RAB4 and RAB14, suggesting discrete recycling pathways (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3J</xref>).</p>
<p>RAB14 is associated with the recycling of GLUT4, FGFR, MT1-MMP, or E-Cadherin between EE, the Golgi, or the plasma membrane and, in turn, regulates cell migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). RAB-dependent recycling of cargoes relies on Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for their activation. FAM116 is the only GEF known to activate RAB14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Confocal imaging indicated that HGF stimulation leads to an increase in the area of RAB14-positive vesicles without altering the fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3H</xref>). This suggests the membrane remodelling of RAB14 vesicles is likely due to vesicle fusion or endosomal membrane remodelling, keeping the GTPase recruitment unaffected. This implies that HGF does not significantly impact the GEF activity for RAB14.</p>
<p>RCP is an interacting partner of RAB14; HGF enhances the RCP–RAB14 interaction by promoting phosphorylation of RCP at S435 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Our results showed an increased localization of RAB14 to RCP endosomes in the presence of HGF; however, the phosphorylation-defective mutant of RCP S435 opposed this trend as reported earlier by Gundry et.al. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, S4D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). The RCP S435A mutant shows increased colocalization with MET with HGF stimulation, highlighting that HGF-dependent RCP phosphorylation is important for its interaction with RAB14 but not for MET. Further, silencing of RCP affected the colocalization of MET with RAB14 at the EEA1-positive compartment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). However, the peripheral MET-positive RAB14 endosomes, devoid of EEA1, as observed in <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3I</xref>, were not affected by RCP depletion (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4I</xref>). The recycling vesicles are usually present near the periphery, so we hypothesize that these vesicles are derived from a distinct RAB14 recycling pathway that is RCP-independent. Similarly, the MET localization to EEA1 was unaffected, conveying that the MET endocytosis is RCP-independent; however, the MET colocalization to RAB14 at the sorting endosome requires RCP. Since RCP directly interacts with MET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), we speculate that RCP bridges RAB14 and MET through its direct interaction with both molecules, thereby promoting cargo recycling.</p>
<p>RAB14 endosomes are reported to harbour endosomal buds (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>, S4F), which serve as a hub for actin remodelling and are critical for selective cargo sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Confocal live-cell imaging of GFP-RAB14 revealed that the buds elongate to form tubules, to which MET was found to be colocalizing with RCP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, E</xref>, <xref rid="video5" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 5</xref>). RCP and MET also colocalize with WASH (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4G</xref>), signifying the active actin remodelling at these endosomes, which also promotes and stabilizes endosomal tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). From this, we hypothesize that RCP assists in RAB14-mediated MET trafficking through tubular endosomes.</p>
<p>KIF16B is a plus-end-directed motor known to promote RAB14 vesicle movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). KIF16B also regulates the RAB14-dependent MT1-MMP recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Our data show that HGF stimulation increased the colocalization of KIF16B with MET-containing vesicles in a RAB14-dependent way (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>, S4J). We observed that MET and RAB14, harbouring endosomal tubules, also contain KIF16B (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Literature suggests that motors not only regulate vesicular movement but also help in the formation of endosomal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). A study by Skjeldal et al has previously shown that KIF16B drives tubulation in early endosomes. Our live cell imaging data showed that the dominant negative mutant of KIF16B-expressing cells showed less RAB14 tubulation compared to the WT motor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>, <xref rid="video6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 6</xref>). This highlights the role of KIF16B in promoting RAB14 endosomal tubulation.</p>

<title>Function of MT1-MMP at invadopodia</title>
<p>MT1-MMP is one of the invadopodia-associated metalloproteases and is overexpressed in TNBC cell lines. Perturbation in MT1-MMP delivery to invadopodia impairs ECM degradation and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Our observations suggest that the HGF-MET axis promotes MT1-MMP recycling to invadopodia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A-D</xref>). We observed that when co-expressed with WT or catalytically inactive (E240A) MT1-MMP, the MET degradation-defective mutant M1250T MET led to a significant increase in invadopodia formation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>) compared to that in the cells expressing only the MET mutant. Overexpression of the WT or the E240A MT1-MMP led to enhanced invadopodia formation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5K</xref>). Overall, our results corroborate the earlier report showing a novel catalytically independent role of the protease during the initiation stage of invadopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Further molecular dissection of MT1-MMP and MET interaction would be required to understand the functional dependency of MET and MT1-MMP association.</p>
<p>Together, our study provides a mechanistic understanding of the HGF-MET-mediated invadopodia formation and MT1-MMP recycling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). We present evidence demonstrating that MET localization to invadopodia is regulated by RAB4 and RAB14-dependent receptor recycling in response to HGF stimulation. HGF-mediated RCP phosphorylation strengthens its interaction with RAB14. We speculate that, through direct interaction with MET, RCP forms a trafficking-assembly with RAB14 and MET on sorting endosomes. RCP and MET also localize to the endosomal tubules emerging from RAB14 vesicles, representing the trafficking of MET through tubular carriers. KIF16B further gets recruited to the MET-positive endosomes through RAB14 and drives tubulation in RAB14 endosomes. In addition, our data suggests a novel functional interaction between the MET and MT1-MMP, which potentially facilitates the co-transport of MT1-MMP and MET to the invadopodia, driving ECM degradation during TNBC invasion.</p>

HGF also increases the recruitment of MET to invadopodia by stimulating the trafficking of the RTK in the RAB4 and RAB14-dependent trafficking pathway. HGF stimulation increases the phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) and colocalization of RCP with MET-containing RAB14 vesicles. RCP and MET are present on the endosomal budding site of RAB14, which further elongate and form tubules. KIF16B gets recruited to these endosomes through RAB14 and drives the endosomal tubulation for efficient cargo trafficking. MT1-MMP interacts with MET, presumably promoting their co-trafficking to invadopodia.</p></caption>

The objects were identified as vesicles in each channel depending on their size, fluorescence intensity, elongation, etc by Motiontracking. Objects identified in two different channels were considered to be colocalized if the relative overlap of respective areas was &gt;35%. The colocalization value is the ratio of the integral intensities of colocalized objects to the integral intensities of all objects in the base channel. The values can range from 0.0 to 1.0. The random colocalization was estimated by random permutation of object localization in different channels, and the apparent colocalization was corrected for random colocalization.

<title>Calculation of MT1-MMP exocytosis</title>
<p>The movies were imported into the MotionTracking software and processed as described by Goto-Silva et.al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Briefly, to distinguish endosomes from background fluorescence, we applied the Bayesian Foreground/Background Discrimination (BFBD) filter, as implemented in the MotionTracking software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://Motiontracking.mpi-cbg.de">https://Motiontracking.mpi-cbg.de</ext-link>). The BFBD algorithm separates the image intensity into a fast-changing foreground and a slowly changing background, corresponding to moving vesicles and cytoplasmic fluorescence, respectively. This procedure efficiently suppresses the Poisson noise of fluorescence. Since the BFBD attributed the signal from non-moving objects to the background, we sum the previously found foreground and background. Then, a new background estimation was performed as described in Kalaizidis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>) with a window size of 1µm and subtracted from the de-noised images. The images were thresholded by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) = 2.0, where the amplitude was estimated as signal uncertainty predicted by the BFBD algorithm. The resulting images were segmented by the watershed algorithm. Detected endosomes were associated with the tracks by a dynamic programming algorithm that performs local-in-time/global-in-space optimization as described in Rink et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). The exocytosis events were preceded by a docking event, which corresponds to immobilization of the endosome and a fast increase of intensity (flash) due to the physics of TIRF microscopy, with consequent total disappearance of the signal. We filtered events with a duration of flash &lt; 4 sec.</p>

<title>Track identification and quantification</title>
<p>MotionTracking was used to identify and analyze vesicles near the cell surface. In the time-lapse movie, fluorescent objects (vesicles) were detected in each frame. Each object was assigned an x-y position, and its fluorescence intensity and size were calculated. Next, objects were linked across consecutive frames to generate tracks, representing the trajectories of individual vesicles over time. Each track was characterized by parameters such as speed, direction, displacement, intensity, and area. To adjust the track break thresholds, the following parameters were considered: total score, area score, intensity score, and integral intensity score. These thresholds were critical for maintaining track accuracy. After optimization of the parameter, the tracks were generated per movie. Each track was considered to represent a vesicle positioned near the plasma membrane.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study identifies a mechanism responsible for the accumulation of the MET receptor in invadopodia, following stimulation of Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells with HGF. HGF-driven accumulation and activation of MET in invadopodia causes the degradation of the extracellular matrix, promoting cancer cell invasion, a process here investigated using gelatin-degradation and spheroid invasion assays.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, HGF stimulates the recycling of MET from RAB14-positive endodomes to invadopodia, increasing their formation. At invadopodia, MET induces matrix degradation via direct binding with the metalloprotease MT1-MMP. The delivery of MET from the recycling compartment to invadopodia is mediated by RCP, which facilitates the colocalization of MET to RAB14 endosomes. In this compartment, HGF induces the recruitment of the motor protein KIF16B, promoting the tubulation of the RAB14-MET recycling endosomes to the cell surface. This pathway is critical for the HGF-driven invasive properties of TNBC cells, as it is impaired upon silencing of RAB14.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is well-organized and executed using state-of-the-art technology. The effects of MET recycling in the formation of functional invadopodia are carefully studied, taking advantage of mutant forms of the receptor that are degradation-resistant or endocytosis-defective.</p>
<p>Data analyses are rigorous, and appropriate controls are used in most of the assays to assess the specificity of the scored effects. Overall, the quality of the research is high.</p>
<p>The conclusions are well-supported by the results, and the data and methodology are of interest for a wide audience of cell biologists.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The role of the MET receptor in invadopodia formation and cancer cell dissemination has been intensively studied in many settings, including triple-negative breast cancer cells. The novelty of the present study mostly consists of the detailed molecular description of the underlying mechanism based on HGF-driven MET recycling. The question of whether the identified pathway is specific for TNBC cells or represents a general mechanism of HGF-mediated invasion detectable in other cancer cells is not addressed or at least discussed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Khamari and colleagues investigate how HGF-MET signaling and the intracellular trafficking of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase influence invadopodia formation and invasion in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. They show that HGF stimulation enhances both the number of invadopodia and their proteolytic activity. Mechanistically, the authors demonstrate that HGF-induced, RAB4- and RCP-RAB14-KIF16B-dependent recycling routes deliver MET to the cell surface specifically at sites where invadopodia form. Moreover, they report that MET physically interacts with MT1-MMP - a key transmembrane metalloproteinase required for invadopodia function- and that these two proteins co-traffic to invadopodia upon HGF stimulation.</p>
<p>Although the HGF-MET axis has previously been implicated in invadopodia regulation (e.g., by Rajadurai et al., Journal of Cell Science 2012), studies directly linking ligand-induced MET trafficking with the spatial regulation of MT1-MMP localization and activity have been lacking.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript addresses a relevant and timely topic and provides several novel insights. However, some sections require clearer and more concise writing (details below). In addition, the quality, reliability, and robustness of several data sets need to be improved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of the study is the novel demonstration that HGF-mediated, RAB4- and RAB14-dependent recycling of MET delivers this receptor, together with MT1-MMP, to invadopodia -highlighting a previously unrecognized mechanism, regulating the formation and proteolytic function of these invasive structures. Another strong point is the breadth of experimental approaches used and the substantial amount of supporting data. The authors also include an appropriate number of biological replicates and analyze a sufficiently large number of cells in their imaging experiments, as clearly described in the figure legends.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Inappropriate stimulation times for endocytosis and recycling assays.</p>
<p>The experiments examining MET endocytosis and recycling following HGF stimulation appear to use inappropriate incubation times. After ligand binding, RTKs typically undergo endocytosis within minutes and reach maximal endosomal accumulation within 5-15 minutes. Although continuous stimulation allows repeated rounds of internalization, the temporal dynamics of MET trafficking should be examined across shorter time points, ideally up to 1 hour (e.g., 15, 30, and 60 minutes). The authors used 2-, 3-, or 6-hour HGF stimulation, which, in my opinion, is far too long to study ligand-induced RTK trafficking.</p>
<p>(2) Low efficiency of MET silencing in Figure S1I.</p>
<p>The very low MET knockdown efficiency shown in Figure S1I raises concerns. Given the potential off-target effects of a single shRNA and the insufficient silencing level, it is difficult to conclude whether the reduction in invadopodia number in Figure 1F is genuinely MET-dependent. The authors later used siRNA-mediated silencing (Figure S5C), which was more effective. Why was this siRNA not used to generate the data in Figure 1F? Why did the authors rely on the inefficient shRNA C#3?</p>
<p>(3) Missing information on incubation times and inconsistencies in MET protein levels.</p>
<p>The figure legends do not indicate how long the cells were incubated with HGF or the MET inhibitor PHA665752 prior to immunoblotting. This information is crucial, particularly because both HGF and PHA665752 cause a substantial decrease in the total MET protein level. Notably, such a decrease is absent in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with HGF in the presence of cycloheximide (Figure S2F). The authors should comment on these inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MET bands in Figure S1J appear different from those in Figure S1C, and MET phosphorylation seems already high under basal conditions, with no further increase upon stimulation (Figure S1J). The authors should address these issues.</p>
<p>(4) Insufficient representation and randomization of microscopic data.</p>
<p>For microscopy, only single representative cells are shown, rather than full fields containing multiple cells. This is particularly problematic for invadopodia analysis, as only a subset of cells forms these structures. The authors should explain how they ensured that image acquisition and quantification were randomized and unbiased. The graphs should also include the percentage of cells forming invadopodia, a standard metric in the field. Furthermore, some images include altered cells - for example, multinucleated cells - which do not accurately represent the general cell population.</p>
<p>(5) Use of a single siRNA/shRNA per target.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, using only one siRNA or shRNA carries the risk of off-target effects. For every experiment involving gene silencing (MET, RAB4, RAB14, RCP, MT1-MMP), at least two independent siRNAs/shRNAs should be used to validate the phenotype.</p>
<p>(6) Insufficient controls for antibody specificity.</p>
<p>The specificity of MET, p-MET, and MT1-MMP staining should be demonstrated in cells with effective gene silencing. This is an essential control for immunofluorescence assays.</p>
<p>(7) Inadequate demonstration of MET recycling.</p>
<p>MET recycling should be directly demonstrated using the same approaches applied to study MT1-MMP recycling. The current analysis - based solely on vesicles near the plasma membrane - is insufficient to conclude that MET is recycled back to the cell surface.</p>
<p>(8) Insufficient evidence for MET-MT1-MMP interaction.</p>
<p>The interaction between MET and MT1-MMP should be validated by immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, particularly since both are endogenously expressed in the studied cell lines.</p>
<p>(9) Inconsistent use of cell lines and lack of justification.</p>
<p>The authors use two TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 and BT-549, without providing a rationale for this choice. Some assays are performed in MDA-MB-231 and shown in the main figures, whereas others use BT-549, creating unnecessary inconsistency. A clearer, more coherent strategy is needed (e.g., present all main findings in MDA-MB-231 and confirm key results in BT-549 in supplementary figures).</p>
<p>(10) Inconsistency in invadopodia numbers under identical conditions.</p>
<p>The number of invadopodia formed in Figure 1E is markedly lower than in Figure 1C, despite identical conditions. The authors should explain this discrepancy.</p>
<p>(11) Questionable colocalization in some images.</p>
<p>In some figures - for example, Figure 2G - the dots indicated by arrows do not convincingly show colocalization. The authors should clarify or reanalyze these data.</p>
<p>(12) Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion require substantial rewriting.</p>
<p>(a) The abstract should be accessible to a broader audience and should avoid using abbreviations and protein names without context.</p>
<p>(b) The introduction should better describe the cellular processes and proteins investigated in this study.</p>
<p>(c) The discussion currently reads more like an extended summary of results. It lacks deeper interpretation, comparison with existing literature, and consideration of the broader implications of the findings.</p>

<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for his/her positive feedback and for considering our study to be well executed and rigorous.

<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We want to clarify that in TNBCs, the lack of the hormonal receptor progesterone receptor, estrogen receptor, and HER2 makes the overexpression of EGFR and MET crucial in terms of prognosis and treatment (PMID: 27655711, 25368674). Hence study of MET signalling and trafficking is more relevant for TNBCs compared to other cancer cells. We will add an explanation in the discussion section in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate the positive assessment we have from the reviewer, who also acknowledged the novelty and relevance of our study. Below, we have carefully addressed the comments/concerns raised regarding this study and will strengthen the reliability and robustness by revisiting the data, providing additional analyses where required, and clarifying methodological details.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>(1) Inappropriate stimulation times for endocytosis and recycling assays. The experiments examining MET endocytosis and recycling following HGF stimulation appear to use inappropriate incubation times. After ligand binding, RTKs typically undergo endocytosis within minutes and reach maximal endosomal accumulation within 5-15 minutes. Although continuous stimulation allows repeated rounds of internalization, the temporal dynamics of MET trafficking should be examined across shorter time points, ideally up to 1 hour (e.g., 15, 30, and 60 minutes). The authors used 2-, 3-, or 6-hour HGF stimulation, which, in my opinion, is far too long to study ligandinduced RTK trafficking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s concern regarding the HGF stimulation time point for endocytosis and recycling. We want to highlight that to study the recycling/surface delivery of MET in response to HGF, we performed TIRF microscopy-based imaging, where images were taken within 1h of HGF addition (Fig. 2I). Additionally, we will incorporate surface biotinylation to show the recycling of MET as suggested in comment -7. Moreover, we have observed the effect of HGF on gelatin degradation and invadopodia formation after 3h of HGF stimulation. We were curious to know where MET resides with prolonged ligand stimulation. Hence, to study the localization of MET to invadopodia or the endocytic markers, the cells were stimulated with HGF for 2-3 hours.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Low efficiency of MET silencing in Figure S1I. The very low MET knockdown efficiency shown in Figure S1I raises concerns. Given the potential off-target effects of a single shRNA and the insufficient silencing level, it is difficult to conclude whether the reduction in invadopodia number in Figure 1F is genuinely MET-dependent. The authors later used siRNA-mediated silencing (Figure S5C), which was more effective. Why was this siRNA not used to generate the data in Figure 1F? Why did the authors rely on the inefficient shRNA C#3?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the concern raised by the reviewer. We want to emphasize that we have employed three different approaches to investigate the effect of MET silencing/inhibition on invadopodia formation. (i) A MET kinase inhibitor, PHA665752, which shows reduced invadopodia formation. (Fig. 1D, E). (ii) Silencing with shRNA: Since the level of silencing of MET with the shRNA was not sufficient, cells were stained with MET as a readout for MET silencing, and images of the cells with depleted MET expression were captured, and invadopodia numbers were quantified (Fig. 1F). (iii) Using the SMARTpool siRNA of MET, we have shown the MT1-MMP containing invadopodia in Fig S5E, which shows another evidence of the role of MET in invadopodia activity. An additional graph showing invadopodia formation derived from the siRNA-mediated MET silencing will be added to the revised figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Missing information on incubation times and inconsistencies in MET protein levels. The figure legends do not indicate how long the cells were incubated with HGF or the MET inhibitor PHA665752 before immunoblotting. This information is crucial, particularly because both HGF and PHA665752 cause a substantial decrease in the total MET protein level. Notably, such a decrease is absent in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with HGF in the presence of cycloheximide (Figure S2F). The authors should comment on these inconsistencies. Additionally, the MET bands in Figure S1J appear different from those in Figure S1C, and MET phosphorylation seems already high under basal conditions, with no further increase upon stimulation (Figure S1J). The authors should address these issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologise for the unintentional omission of experimental detailing about HGF or drug incubation time, which will be incorporated into the figure legend appropriately. The blot will be replaced with a more appropriate representative image.</p>
<p>Regarding the decreased MET level in the drug-treated condition: literature suggests that the MET inhibitor PHA665752 also promotes MET degradation, corroborating our result shown in Fig. S1J (PMID: 15788682, 18327775). Further in Fig. S1J, the relative phosphorylation of MET when compared to the total MET level in the HGF-treated condition is higher. We will add the quantification in the revised manuscript to add more clarity.</p>
<p>Next, in the fig. S1C, the rabbit anti-MET (CST, D1C2 XP) antibody has been used, which binds to a c-terminal motif of MET and identifies both the 170kDa as well as 140kDa protein representing the uncleaved and cleaved form of MET. In Fig. S1J, the mouse antiMET (CST, L6E7) antibody has been used, which binds to an N-terminal motif of MET and recognizes only the 140kDa protein.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. The single-cell images are shown for clarity and to visualize the subcellular features; however, the conclusions are made based on the quantitative analysis of multiple cells collected from multiple frames (at least 30 frames per condition). Here, we would like to highlight that the image acquisition has been done over random fields in a coverslip. In the graphs shown in Fig. 1B, 1C, 4F, S1F, S1H, S5J’ it can be seen that there are frames where there is no degradation or invadopodia formed, which has also been taken into account. For a better representation of the population of cellforming invadopodia, a graph showing the percentage of cells forming invadopodia will be added to the figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Use of a single siRNA/shRNA per target. As noted earlier, using only one siRNA or shRNA carries the risk of off-target effects. For every experiment involving gene silencing (MET, RAB4, RAB14, RCP, MT1-MMP), at least two independent siRNAs/shRNAs should be used to validate the phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that we are using SMARTPool siRNA, which contains 4 individual siRNAs for the target gene. Literature suggests that using a pool of siRNA has reduced offtarget effects compared to using single oligos for gene silencing (PMID: 14681580, 33584737, 24875475).</p>
<p>While SMARTpool siRNA minimizes the off-target effect, it does not eliminate the possibility of it. To confirm that the observed phenotypes are specifically attributable to the genes investigated in this study, we will perform additional experiments using two independent siRNAs targeting RCP and RAB14. RAB4 is known to be associated with MET trafficking (PMID: 21664574, 30537020), and we have taken RAB4 as a positive control. Hence, we feel the suggested experiment is not required to support the conclusion made regarding RAB4.</p>
<p>For MET, we have used shRNA and an inhibitor to show the effect of MET inhibition/perturbation in the invadopodia-associated activity, which validates the observations of siRNA-mediated gene silencing.</p>
<p>We have shown the effect of MT1-MMP depletion on invadopodia formation using a CRISPR-based gene knock-out study, and another study from our group has shown the effect using siRNA (PMID: 31820782), which supports our MT1-MMP KO cell observation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Insufficient controls for antibody specificity. The specificity of MET, p-MET, and MT1-MMP staining should be demonstrated in cells with effective gene silencing. This is an essential control for immunofluorescence assays.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>MET immunofluorescence staining in the MET-depleted condition has been provided in Fig. 1F, and an immunoblot for the siRNA-mediated gene silencing has been provided in Fig. S5C. We will add the entire field of view to show the MET silencing in Fig. 1F.</p>
<p>The inhibition of MET kinase activity using PHA665752 abolished the MET phosphorylation, as shown in Fig S1J. In line with Joffre et.al. Fig 3C, S2I shows increased Tyr 1234/1235 phosphorylation of M1250T MET mutant (PMID: 21642981). Further, studies have shown the specificity of the antibody by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence using MET inhibitors (PMID: 21973114, 41009793).</p>
<p>For the MT1-MMP immunoblot showing significant depletion in MT1-MMP protein level by the SMARTpool siRNA has been provided in Fig. S5L. Further MT1-MMP silencing has been validated by immunofluorescence in the following studies. PMID: 22291036, 21571860, 20505159.</p>

<p>(7) Inadequate demonstration of MET recycling. MET recycling should be directly demonstrated using the same approaches applied to study MT1-MMP recycling. The current analysis - based solely on vesicles near the plasma membrane - is insufficient to conclude that MET is recycled back to the cell surface.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion for an alternative approach to show MET trafficking. We aim to demonstrate MET trafficking using a biochemical approach, which will be included in the revised version.</p>

<p>(8) Insufficient evidence for MET-MT1-MMP interaction. The interaction between MET and MT1-MMP should be validated by immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, particularly since both are endogenously expressed in the studied cell lines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of MET-MT1-MMP interaction at the endogenous level. We have carried out the immunoprecipitation of endogenous MET to validate the interaction with MT1-MMP. However, we could not capture the interaction of these proteins at endogenous levels. We hypothesize that the interaction between MT1MMP and MET may be weak in nature, with a high K<sub>d</sub> value, and accordingly, it was difficult to precipitate the endogenous MT1-MMP by MET. The immunoblot will be added to the revised manuscript and discussed.</p>

<p>(9) Inconsistent use of cell lines and lack of justification. The authors use two TNBC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 and BT-549, without providing a rationale for this choice. Some assays are performed in MDA-MB-231 and shown in the main figures, whereas others use BT-549, creating unnecessary inconsistency. A clearer, more coherent strategy is needed (e.g., present all main findings in MDA-MB-231 and confirm key results in BT549 in supplementary figures).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 are two well-characterized TNBC cell lines, which are being used extensively to study breast cancer cell invasion. These two cell lines also show overexpression of MET, making them suitable model cell lines for our study.</p>
<p>MDA-MB-231 has less transfection efficiency compared to BT-549. Additionally, MET is also a difficult gene to transfect, making it hard to perform experiments in MDA-MB-231 with MET overexpression. Though most of the experiments have been performed in both cell lines, a few of the studies have been performed only in the BT-549 cells. Further, we have focused on displaying the different approaches taken to validate an observation in the main figure, which led to showing the data in distinct cell lines.</p>
<p>Also, showing observations in different cell lines is a practice that has been followed by multiple authors in the past. (PMID:  39751400, 41079612, 25049275, 22366451)</p>

<p>(10) Inconsistency in invadopodia numbers under identical conditions. The number of invadopodia formed in Figure 1E is markedly lower than in Figure 1C, despite identical conditions. The authors should explain this discrepancy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for pointing out the inconsistency in invadopodia numbers across 2 experiments. Fig. 1C has 2 conditions: UT and the HGF-treated condition. The Untreated condition has the serum-free media without any stimulation. Whereas we have added vehicle (DMSO) in Fig. 1D, E, since the drug is resuspended in DMSO. This difference in the treatment is likely to be responsible for the decreased numbers of invadopodia in Fig. 1E.</p>

<p>(11) Questionable colocalization in some images. In some figures - for example, Figure 2G - the dots indicated by arrows do not convincingly show colocalization. The authors should clarify or reanalyze these data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comment. The apparent lack of convincing colocalization is likely due to the relatively lower fluorescence intensity of MET at these structures. We will add the line intensity plots for the indicated puncta to show the intensity of both channels in the figure.</p>
<p>To quantify the colocalization of two channels, we have used the automated image analysis software motiontracking (motiontracking.mpi-cbg.de), which has been detailed in the method section. Motiontracking considers only those objects to be colocalized if there is an overlapping area of more than 35% between the two channels. Lastly, the apparent colocalization is corrected for random colocalization, which is the random permutation of object colocalization. This makes object-based colocalization more reliable than intensitybased colocalization.</p>

<p>(12) Abstract, Introduction, and  Discussion require substantial rewriting. a) The abstract should be accessible to a broader audience and should avoid using abbreviations and protein names without context. b) The introduction should better describe the cellular processes and proteins investigated in this study. c) The discussion currently reads more like an extended summary of results. It lacks deeper interpretation, comparison with existing literature, and consideration of the broader implications of the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We will modify the abstract, introduction, and discussion as per the suggestion.</p>
