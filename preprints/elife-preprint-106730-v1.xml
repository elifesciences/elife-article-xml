<title>Abstract</title><p>The Mitotic Surveillance Pathway (MSP) monitors the duration of M-phase. Prolonged mitosis, caused by spindle attachment defects or microtubule-targeting drugs such as the taxane paclitaxel, induces the formation of the ternary âmitotic stopwatchâ complex consisting of 53BP1, USP28, and p53. This event protects p53 from degradation, resulting in cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in daughter cells. In paclitaxel-resistant cancers, cells bypass the MSP, enabling unchecked proliferation and survival, although the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that 53BP1 physically interacts with GMCL1 but not its paralog, GMCL2, and we mapped the interaction regions on both proteins. CRL3<sup>GMCL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> functions as a ubiquitin ligase that targets 53BP1 for degradation during M phase, impacting p53 levels in daughter cells. High GMCL1 expression significantly correlates with resistance to paclitaxel in cancer cell lines with wild-type p53, including endometrial, breast, and upper aerodigestive tract cancer cells. Loss of GMCL1 restores paclitaxel sensitivity in p53 expressing cells but not in p53 deficient cells. We propose that in cancers with high GMCL1 levels, the CRL3<sup>GMCL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>-mediated degradation of 53BP1 prevents the formation of the mitotic stopwatch complex, leading to p53 degradation and sustained proliferation. Finally, our results indicate that GMCL1 inhibition represents a novel strategy to restore taxane sensitivity in resistant cancers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mitosis is orchestrated by several intracellular signaling pathways to ensure proper cell division while maintaining genomic integrity. Errors during cell division, including chromosome mis-segregation or spindle defects, could lead to changes in chromosome content, producing aneuploid or polyploid progeny cells, which could be detrimental during development or lead to oncogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, cells have evolved quality control mechanisms to ensure proper cell division during M phase. One such surveillance mechanism is known as the Mitotic Surveillance Pathway (MSP), which senses prolonged mitosis as an indicator of mitotic defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>If a threshold mitotic duration is surpassed, the MSP induces cell cycle arrest in the daughter cells in a p53-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. During abnormally prolonged mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, the MSP is triggered by the formation of a ternary âmitotic stopwatchâ complex consisting of the deubiquitinase USP28 (ubiquitin-specific protease 28), 53BP1 (p53-binding protein 1), which acts as a substrate recognition subunit, and p53. During delayed mitosis, formation of the mitotic stopwatch complex allows USP28 to deubiquitinate and subsequently protect p53 from MDM2-mediated degradation. The 53BP1-USP28-p53 complex accumulates and persists in the G1 phase of daughter cells, where it promotes cell cycle arrest <italic>via</italic> p53-mediated upregulation of p21 expression.</p>
<p>Notably, proper mitotic arrest plays a crucial role in the mechanism of microtubule-targeting therapies, such as taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel), which disrupt spindle formation and chromosomal segregation. Recent studies have shown that pharmacological interventions targeting M phase, even without resulting in complete mitotic arrest, can induce controlled cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. For example, low dose paclitaxel treatments results in increased p21 expression and apoptosis in daughter cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, there are cancers that display resistance or insensitivity to treatment with taxanes, including metastatic breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate the strategies of paclitaxel resistance in such cancers.</p>
<p>Human germ cell-less protein-like 1 (GMCL1) is a putative substrate receptor of one of many CUL3-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRL3s). However, to date, GMCL1âs biological role and its substrates have remained uncharacterized. <italic>GMCL1</italic> received its namesake from its <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> homolog, <italic>GCL</italic> (Germ Cell-Less), which plays essential roles in early embryonic development and germ cell determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. <italic>GMCL1</italic>âs role in germ cell development appears to have been evolutionarily conserved as loss of <italic>GMCL1</italic> expression in mice has been shown to cause defects in meiosis and spermiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and altered <italic>GMCL1</italic> expression was functionally associated with human asthenozoospermia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Although <italic>GMCL1</italic> homologs have been primarily associated with germ cell biology, several databases (e.g., GTEx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> and GENT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>) indicate that <italic>GMCL1</italic> is expressed in somatic cells as well, suggesting broader biological functions beyond germ cell development. In contrast, the GMCL1 paralog GMCL2 is specifically expressed in germ cells.</p>
<p>Here, we present studies that shed light on the role of GMCL1 in somatic cells. We demonstrate that, like its <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> counterpart, GMCL1 acts as a CRL3 substrate receptor. We also identify 53BP1 as a <italic>bona fide</italic> substrate of CRL3<sup>GMCL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, demonstrating that its levels are regulated by GMCL1 during M phase. Reduction of mitotic 53BP1 by GMCL1 prevents the formation of the USP28-p53-53BP1 mitotic stopwatch complex and reduces p53 transmission to daughter cells. We therefore propose that GMCL1 inhibition, in combination with paclitaxel therapy, offers a promising strategy to overcome taxane resistance.</p>

<title>Identification of 53BP1 as an interactor of CRL3<sup>GMCL</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>We have shown that the GMCL1 ortholog in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, GCL, is a substrate recognition subunit of a CRL3 complex that is active specifically in mitosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. So, we predicted the human GMCL1 to also behave as a CRL3 substrate receptor. GMCL1 contains a BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-a -brac) and a BACK (BTB and C-terminal Kelch) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with other CRL3 receptors. On its C-terminus, GMCL1 also contains a GCL domain (residues 379-515), which is distinct from the Kelch domains commonly used by other CUL3 substrate receptors since it is predicted to form a Î²-sandwich characterized by two opposing anti-parallel Î²-sheets, each made up of four Î²-strands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). A Dali search<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> of GMCL1âs C-terminal domain reveals that it has some structural homology to the MATH (meprin and TRAF homology) domain used by another CRL3 substrate receptor, SPOP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, suggesting that the predicted structure of GMCL1âs GCL domain could also potentially act as a protein-protein interaction motif to recruit substrates.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of GMCL1 in somatic cells, we used immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to identify binding partners of GMCL1. Proteomics studies were performed by expressing and purifying the following FLAG-tagged proteins: (<italic>i</italic>) wild-type GMCL1 (GMCL1 WT), (<italic>ii</italic>) GMCL1 E142K (GMCL1 EK), which carries a mutation in the BTB domain that is predicted to disrupt its interaction with CUL3, and (<italic>iii</italic>) GMCL1 BTB/BACK-only (GMCL1 BBO) that lacks the GCL domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>). IP-MS analysis identified 1,765 potential binding partners that specifically interact with GMCL1 <italic>via</italic> its C-terminal domain. Using SAINT scores &gt; 0.70 and FDR &lt; 5%, this list was refined to 9 proteins that showed significant interaction with GMCL1 WT and GMCL1 EK, but not with GMCL1 BBO, with 53BP1 being the one of most enriched protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tables1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). This selective enrichment suggests that the C-terminal, âMATH-likeâ GCL domain of GMCL1 is critical for its interaction with binding partners, including 53BP1. The interaction between GMCL1 and endogenous 53BP1 and CUL3 was validated using immunoprecipitations (IPs) followed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,D</xref>).</p>

<p>To further study the direct interaction between GMCL1 and 53BP1, we used AlphaFold 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> to predict their binding interface and identify potential critical residues at the recognition interface between the substrate receptor and 53BP1to see if mutating these residues could abolish their interaction. Consistent with our initial IP-MS experiment, the Alphafold 3 model predicted that the C-terminal domain of GMCL1 would interact with 53BP1. Based on the GMCL1-53BP1 complex structure prediction, we identified Arg 433, which appears to be a solvent-exposed residue in GMCL1âs GCL domain that could interact with 53BP1 without impeding GMCL1âs binding to with CUL3. Thus, we generated the GMCL1 R433A (GMCL1 RA) point mutant and tested its binding to 53BP1 using IP. As predicted, compared to WT GMCL1, the R433A mutation completely abolished the binding of GMCL1 to 53BP1, but did not impact GMCL1âs binding to CUL3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine which region of 53BP1 mediates its binding to GMCL1, we mapped the predicted GMCL1-binding site on 53BP1 and identified a conserved IEDI amino acid sequence within the Minimal Focus Forming region (MFF) of 53BP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1B-E</xref>). Through IPs, we demonstrate that a 53BP1 mutant either lacking the MFF region or containing the IEDI-to-AAAA mutation within this region lost its interaction with CRL3<sup>GMCL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, suggesting that this conserved IEDI sequence within 53BP1âs MFF forms a critical degron recognized by GMCL1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the interaction between endogenous GMCL1 and endogenous 53BP1, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock in a FLAG tag at the C-terminus of <italic>GMCL1</italic>. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that endogenous GMCL1 interacts with both endogenous CUL3 and 53BP1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we sought to determine whether GMCL2, a GMCL1 paralog, is also able to interact with 53BP1.

<p>To further explore the role of GMCL1 on 53BP1 stability, we stably reconstituted U2OS <italic>GMCL1</italic> KO cells with either GMCL1 WT or binding mutants (i.e., GMCL1 EK and GMCL1 RA). Notably, the accumulation of 53BP1 in <italic>GMCL1</italic> KO cells was rescued only upon re-expression of GMCL1 WT. In contrast, 53BP1 levels remained high in <italic>GMCL1</italic> KO cells expressing either GMCL1 EK or GMCL1 RA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), emphasizing the importance of GMCL1âs ability to bind both CUL3 (through the E142 residue) and 53BP1 (through the R433 residue) to regulate 53BP1 levels. Furthermore, GMCL1 WT re-expression in <italic>GMCL1</italic> KO cells led to decreased mRNA levels of p21 and NOXA during mitosis, whereas the GMCL1 EK and GMCL1 RA mutants failed to suppress these transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings indicate that GMCL1 modulates 53BP1 availability through interactions with the CRL3<sup>GMCL</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> complex, playing a critical role in the regulation of 53BP1 levels in M phase.</p>
<p>During mitosis, 53BP1 has been implicated in monitoring centrosome integrity and mitotic progression <italic>via</italic> the Mitotic Stopwatch Pathway (MSP). A recent study demonstrated that cells experiencing abnormally prolonged mitosis transmit this information to daughter cells though a ternary complex containing 53BP1, USP28, and p53 called the âmitotic stopwatchâ complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To investigate whether GMCL1 regulates this complex, we analyzed GMCL1 levels in post-mitotic daughter cells seven hours after release from prolonged nocodazole arrest. <italic>GMCL1</italic> KO daughter cells, reconstituted with GMCL1 WT, successfully re-entered the cell cycle, exhibiting low levels of 53BP1, p53, and p21, along with reduced expression of apoptosis-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2B,C</xref>). In contrast, cells reconstituted with either the E142K or R433A mutant displayed persistently elevated levels of 53BP1, p53, and p21, accompanied by increased expression of apoptosis-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2B,C</xref>). Notably, compared to parental cells, GMCL1 KO cells, whether reconstituted with WT or mutant GMCL1 constructs, showed no significant alterations in cell cycle profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we used cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit translation and to assess the stability of 53BP1. We observed that in the chromatin-bound fraction of <italic>GMCL1</italic> KO cells, 53BP1 was more stable compared to cells rescued with GMCL1 WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>GMCL1 modulates paclitaxel resistance in cancer cells</title>
<p>Paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic drug, stabilizes microtubules and prevents their depolymerization, thereby halting cancer cell division and inducing apoptosis. To assess the clinical significance of GMCL1, we investigated the relationship between GMCL1 expression levels and Taxol resistance in various cancer cell lines. To this end, we leveraged the PRISM (profiling relative inhibition simultaneously in mixtures) repurposing dataset, which compiles the proliferation inhibitory activity of 4,518 compounds tested across 578 patient-derived cancer cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. This high-throughput screening dataset provides valuable insights into drug resistance mechanisms. We examined the impact of GMCL1 mRNA expression on Taxol resistance by analyzing taxane-related compounds from this dataset, including cabazitaxel, docetaxel, and paclitaxel, integrating it with the Cancer Dependency Map (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://depmap.org">https://depmap.org</ext-link>). Interestingly, we found that several cancer types (<italic>e.g.</italic>: endometrial, breast, and upper aerodigestive tract cancers) with high levels of GMCL1 mRNA exhibited resistance to paclitaxel, cabazitaxel, and/or docetaxel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-C</xref>). In contrast, lung cancer cell lines with high GMCL1 mRNA expression did not show such tendencies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Given that nearly half of lung cancers harbor p53 mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that p53 status may influence GMCL1-mediated Taxol resistance. To further investigate the functional relationship between GMCL1, 53BP1 and p53 in Taxol resistance, we stratified cancer cells based on their p53 status (wild-type vs mutant) and analyzed GMCL1 mRNA expression and 53BP1 protein levels. In cancer cells with wild type p53, high GMCL1 mRNA expression and low 53BP1 protein levels correlated with significant increased resistance to Cabazitaxel and Paclitaxel when compared to cells with low GMCL1 mRNA and high 53BP1 protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We identify GMCL1, a previously uncharacterized human CRL3 substrate receptor, as a regulator of taxane resistance. Specifically, we found that GMCL1 interacts with and mediates the degradation of 53BP1 during prolonged arrest in M phase. While 53BP1 is well known for its role in double-strand break (DSB) repair via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, it also participates to a so-called mitotic stopwatch composed of the 53BP1-USP28-p53 complex that stabilizes p53 during prolonged mitotic arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. We showed that GMCL1 controls the levels of 53BP1 and, consequently, those of p53 in mitotic cells, thereby influencing p53 transmission to daughter cells (see model in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). This data suggests that GMCL1 functions as a mitotic stress regulator, with potential oncogenic properties in certain contexts.</p>
<p>Cancer database analysis reveals that GMCL1 is overexpressed in multiple cancers, including bladder, brain, breast, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, prostate, skin, and stomach cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). This underscores GMCL1âs role in mitotic regulation and genomic stability, which may vary based on tumor type, genetic background, and additional oncogenic mutations. Recent studies indicate that the MDM2-p53 axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, along with the USP28-53BP1-p53 complex, functions as a mitotic timer enforcing G1 arrest following prolonged cell division. Our study identifies GMCL1 as an E3 ligase regulating this pathway by mediating 53BP1 degradation in mitosis. As often is the case for crucial regulatory proteins, 53BP1 is subject to regulation by multiple factors under different cellular circumstances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>GMCL1 has been primarily studied in the germ cells of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, where we have shown that it forms an active CRL3 complex during mitosis. Our new findings establish a critical role for GMCL1 in somatic cell fate decisions by regulating 53BP1 stability during prolonged mitosis. We found that GMCL1 loss enhances Taxol-induced cell death in p53 wild-type cancers but has no effect in p53-mutant cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). This suggests that GMCL1 inhibition could be selectively effective in cancers that retain functional p53. These findings position GMCL1 as a key modulator of mitotic stress and Taxol resistance, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment.</p>

<p>An equal aliquot of each sample was loaded onto a trap column (Acclaim PepMap 100 pre-column, 75 Î¼m Ã 2 cm, C18, 3 Î¼m, 100 A, Thermo Scientific) connected to an analytical column (EASY-Spray column, 50 m Ã 75 Î¼m internal diameter, PepMap RSLC C18, 2 Î¼m, 100 A, Thermo Scientific) using the autosampler of an Easy nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with solvent A consisting of 2% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid and solvent B consisting of 80% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid. The peptide mixture was gradient eluted using the following gradient: 5% solvent B for 5 minutes, 5â35% solvent B in 60 min, 35â45% solvent B in 10 min, followed by 45â100% solvent B in 10 min. The samples were acquired on the Orbitrap Eclipse using the following parameters: full MS spectra resolution of 120,000, an AGC target of 4e5, maximum ion time of 50 ms, scan range from 400 to 1,500 m/z. The MS/MS spectra were collected with the following parameters: a resolution of 30,000, an AGC target of 2e5, maximum ion time of 30 ms, one microscan, 2 m/z isolation window, normalized collision energy (NCE) of 27 and a dynamic exclusion of 30 s. To identify binding partners, all acquired MS2 spectra were searched against a UniProt human database using Sequest HT within Proteome Discoverer 1.4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>
<p>Fixed modifications were set on cysteine (carbamidomethyl), variable modifications of oxidation on methionine, and deamidation on glutamine and asparagine. The resulting peptide spectra matches and proteins are filtered to better than 1% false discovery rate (FDR) and only proteins with at least two different peptides are reported. Proteins differentially expressed between GMCL1 WT and EK, as determined by SAINT scores with a 5% FDR, were considered significantly enriched interactions when comparing to GMCL1 BTB.</p>

<title>Cell viability and apoptosis assays</title>
<p>Cells (2500/well) were plated in a 96-well plate. The medium was replaced with 50 ÂµL of medium containing the target siRNA (0.2 ÂµL/well). After 24 hours, an additional 50 ÂµL of the designated reagent was added. Luminescence was measured using BioTek Synergy Neo2 (Agilent) 48 hours post-treatment with CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Cell Viability Assay (Promega) or RealTime-Glo Annexin V Apoptosis and Necrosis Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturerâs protocol.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.2.1. For comparisons involving three or more groups, One-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroniâs post hoc test or the Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA test followed by DunnettâS T3 multiple comparisons test was applied. For bioinformatic data analysis, two-group comparisons were performed using the pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum test.</p>

<p>This study identifies 53BP1 as an interaction partner of GMCL1 (a likely CUL3 substrate receptor). The study seeks to link this finding to regulation of the mitotic surveillance pathway and paclitaxel resistance in cancer. The evidence for these claims is currently <bold>inadequate</bold>; concerns include the use of cell lines that have been reported to lack the mitotic surveillance pathway, insufficient consideration of paclitaxel mechanisms of action, and an overinterpretation of correlative results.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Pagano and colleagues test the idea that the protein GMCL1 functions as a substrate receptor for a Cullin RING 3 E3 ubiquitin ligase (CUL3) complex. Using a pulldown approach, they identify GMCL1 binding proteins, including the DNA damage scaffolding protein 53BP1. They then focus on the idea that GMCL1 recruits 53BP1 for CUL3-dependent ubiquitination, triggering subsequent proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated 53BP1.</p>
<p>In addition to its DNA damage signalling function, in mitosis, 53BP1 is reported to form a stopwatch complex with the deubiquitinating enzyme USP28 and the transcription factor p53 (PMID: 38547292). These 53BP1-stopwatch complexes generated in mitosis are inherited by G1 daughter cells and help promote p53-dependent cell cycle arrest independent from DNA damage (PMID: 38547292). Several studies show that knockout of 53BP1 overcomes G1 cell cycle arrest after mitotic delays caused by anti-mitotic drugs or centrosome ablation (PMID: 27432897, 27432896). In this model, it is crucial that 53BP1 remains stable in mitosis and more stopwatch complex is formed after delayed mitosis.</p>
<p>Pagano and coworkers suggest that 53BP1 levels can sometimes be suppressed in mitosis if the cells overexpress GMCL1. They carry out a bioinformatic analysis of available public data for p53 wild-type cancer cell lines resistant to the anti-mitotic drug paclitaxel and related compounds. Stratifying GMCL1 into low and high expression groups reveals a weak (p = 0.05 or ns) correlation with sensitivity to taxanes. It is unclear on what basis the authors claim paclitaxel-resistant and p53 wild-type cancer cell lines bypass the mitotic surveillance/timer pathway. They have not tested this. Figure 3 is a correlation assembled from public databases but has no experimental tests. Figure 4 looks at proliferation but not cell cycle progression or the length of mitosis. The main conclusions relating to cell cycle progression and specifically the link to mitotic delays are therefore not supported by experimental data. There is no imaging of the cell cycle or cell fate after mitotic delays, or analysis of where the cells arrest in the cell cycle. Most of the cell lines used have been reported to lack a functional mitotic surveillance pathway in the recent work by Meitinger. To support these conclusions, the stability of endogenous 53BP1 under different conditions in cells known to have a functional mitotic surveillance pathway needs to be examined. A key suggestion in the work is that the level of GMCL1 expression correlates with resistance to taxanes. For the mitotic surveillance pathway, the type of drug (nocodazole, taxol, etc) used to induce a delay isn't thought to be relevant, only the length of the delay. Do GMCL1-overexpressing cells show resistance to anti-mitotics in general?</p>
<p>Importantly, if GMCL1 specifically degrades 53BP1 during prolonged mitotic arrests, the authors should show what happens during normal cell divisions without any delays or drug treatments. How much 53BP1 is destroyed in mitosis under those conditions? Does 53BP1 destruction depend on the length of mitosis, drug treatment, or does 53BP1 get degraded every mitosis regardless of length? Testing the contribution of key mitotic E3 ligase activities on mitotic 53BP1 stability, such as the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is important in this regard. One previous study reported an analysis of putative APC/C KEN-box degron motifs in 53BP1 and concluded these play a role in 53BP1 stability in anaphase (PMID: 28228263).</p>
<p>There is no direct test of the proposed mechanism, and it is therefore unclear if 53BP1 is ubiquitinated by a GMCL1-CUL3 ligase in cells, and how efficient this process would be at different cell cycle stages. A key issue is the lack of experimental data explaining why the proposed mechanism would be restricted to mitosis. Indirect effects, such as loss of 53BP1 from the chromatin fraction during M phase upon GMCL1 overexpression, do not necessarily mean that 53BP1 is degraded. PLK1-dependent chromatin-cytoplasmic shuttling of 53BP1 during mitotic delays has been described previously (PMID: 38547292, 37888778). These papers are cited in the text, but the main conclusions of those papers on 53BP1 incorporation into a stopwatch complex during mitotic delays have been ignored. Are the authors sure that 53BP1 is destroyed in mitosis and not simply re-localised between chromatin and non-chromatin fractions? At the very least, these reported findings should be discussed in the text.</p>
<p>The authors use a variety of cancer cell line models throughout their study, most of which have been reported to lack a functional mitotic surveillance pathway. U2OS and HCT116 cells do not respond normally to mitotic delays, despite being annotated as p53 WT. Other studies have used p53 wild-type hTERT RPE-1 cells to study the mitotic surveillance pathway. If the model is correct, then over-expressing GMCL1 in hTERT-RPE1 cells should suppress cell cycle arrest after mitotic delays, and GMCL1 KO should make the cells more sensitive to delays. These experiments are needed to provide an adequate test of the proposed model.</p>
<p>To conclude, while the authors propose a potentially interesting model on how GMCL1 overexpression could regulate 53BP1 stability to limit p53-dependent cell cycle arrest, it is unclear what triggers this pathway or when it is relevant. 53BP1 is known to function in DNA damage signalling, and GMCL1 might be relevant in that context. The manuscript contains the initial description of GMCL1-53BP1 interaction but lacks a proper analysis of the function of this interaction and is therefore a preliminary report.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the role of GMCL1 in regulating the mitotic surveillance pathway (MSP), a protective mechanism that activates p53 following prolonged mitosis. The authors identify a physical interaction between 53BP1 and GMCL1, but not with GMCL2. They propose that the ubiquitin ligase complex CRL3-GMCL1 targets 53BP1 for degradation during mitosis, thereby preventing the formation of the &quot;mitotic stopwatch&quot; complex (53BP1-USP28-p53) and subsequent p53 activation. The authors show that high GMCL1 expression correlates with resistance to paclitaxel in cancer cell lines that express wild-type p53. Importantly, loss of GMCL1 restores paclitaxel sensitivity in these cells, but not in p53-deficient lines. They propose that GMCL1 overexpression enables cancer cells to bypass MSP-mediated p53 activation, promoting survival despite mitotic stress. Targeting GMCL1 may thus represent a therapeutic strategy to re-sensitize resistant tumors to taxane-based chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents potentially interesting observations. The major strength of this article is the identification of GMCL1 as a 53BP1 interaction partner. The authors identified relevant domains and showed that GMCL1 controls 53BP1 stability. The authors further show a potentially interesting link between GMCL1 status and sensitivity to Taxol.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the manuscript is significantly weakened by unsubstantiated mechanistic claims, overreliance on a non-functional model system (U2OS), and overinterpretation of correlative data. To support the conclusions of the manuscript, the authors must show that the GMCL1-dependent sensitivity to Taxol depends on the mitotic surveillance pathway.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Kito et al follow up on previous work that identified Drosophila GCL as a mitotic substrate recognition subunit of a CUL3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex.</p>
<p>Here they characterize mutants of the human ortholog of GCL, GMCL1, that disrupt the interaction with CUL3 (GMCL1E142K) and that lack the substrate interaction domain (GMCL1 BBO). Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry identified 9 proteins that interacted with wild-type FLAG-GMCL1 and GMCL1 EK but not GMCL1 BBO. These proteins included 53BP1, which plays a well-characterized role in double-strand break repair but also functions in a USP28-p53-53BP1 &quot;mitotic stopwatch&quot; complex that arrests the cell cycle after a substantially prolonged mitosis. Consistent with the IP-MS results, FLAG-GMCL1 immunoprecipitated 53BP1. Depletion of GMCL1 during mitotic arrest increased protein levels of 53BP1, and this could be rescued by wild-type GMCL1 but not the E142K mutant or a R433A mutant that failed to immunoprecipitate 53BP1.</p>
<p>Using a publicly available dataset, the authors identified a relatively small subset of cell lines with high levels of GMCL1 mRNA that were resistant to the taxanes paclitaxel, cabazitaxel, and docetaxel. This type of analysis is confounded by the fact that paclitaxel and other microtubule poisons accumulate to substantially different levels in various cell lines (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.90.20.9552 , DOI: 10.1091/mbc.10.4.947 ), so careful follow-up experiments are required to validate results. The correlation between increased GMCL1 mRNA and taxane resistance was not observed in lung cancer cell lines. The authors propose this was because nearly half of lung cancers harbor p53 mutations, and lung cancer cell lines with wild-type but not mutant p53 showed the correlation between increased GMCL1 mRNA and taxane resistance. However, the other cancer cell types in which they report increased GMCL1 expression correlates with taxane sensitivity also have high rates of p53 mutation. Furthermore, p53 status does not predict taxane response in patients (DOI: 10.1002/1097-0142(20000815)89:4&lt;769::aid-cncr8&gt;3.0.co;2-6 , DOI: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960915)78:6&lt;1203::AID-CNCR6&gt;3.0.CO;2-A , PMID: 10955790).</p>
<p>The authors then depleted GMCL1 and reported that it increased apoptosis in two cell lines with wild-type p53 (MCF7 and U2OS) due to activation of the mitotic stopwatch. This is surprising because the mitotic stopwatch paper they cite (DOI: 10.1126/science.add9528 ) reported that U2OS cells have an inactive stopwatch and that activation of the stopwatch results in cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis in most cell types, including MCF7. Beyond this, it has recently been shown that the level of taxanes and other microtubule poisons achieved in patient tumors is too low to induce mitotic arrest (DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3007965 , DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abd4811 , DOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.3002339 ), raising concerns about the relevance of prolonged mitosis to paclitaxel response in cancer. The findings here demonstrating that GMCL1 mediates degradation of 53BP1 during mitotic arrest are solid and of interest to cell biologists, but it is unclear that these findings are relevant to paclitaxel response in patients.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study identified 53BP1 as a target of CRL3GMCL1-mediated degradation during mitotic arrest. AlphaFold3 predictions of the binding interface, followed by mutational analysis, identified mutants of each protein (GMCL1 R433A and 53BP1 IEDI1422-1425AAAA) that disrupted their interaction. Knock-in of a FLAG tag into the C-terminus of GMCL1 in HCT116 cells, followed by FLAG immunoprecipitation, confirmed that endogenous GMCL1 interacts with endogenous CUL3 and 53BP1 during mitotic arrest.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The clinical relevance of the study is overinterpreted. The authors have not taken relevant data about the clinical mechanism of taxanes into account. Supraphysiologic doses of microtubule poisons cause mitotic arrest and can activate the mitotic stopwatch. However, in physiologic concentrations of clinically useful microtubule poisons, cells proceed through mitosis and divide their chromosomes on mitotic spindles that are at least transiently multipolar. Though these low concentrations may result in a brief mitotic delay, it is substantially shorter than the arrest caused by high concentrations of microtubule poisons, and the one mimicked here by 16 hours of 0.4 mg/mL nocodazole, which is not used clinically and does not induce multipolar spindles. Resistance to mitotic arrest occurs through different mechanisms than resistance to multipolar spindles. No evidence is presented in the current version of the manuscript that GMCL1 affects cellular response to clinically relevant doses of paclitaxel.</p>
