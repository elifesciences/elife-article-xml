<title>Abstract</title><p>The immune and sensory nervous systems, having evolved in parallel, communicate through shared receptors and transmitters to maintain homeostasis and respond to both external and internal disruptions. Although neural responses often confer protective benefits, they can also exacerbate inflammation during allergic reactions such as asthma. In our study, we modeled pollution-exacerbated asthma by exposing mice to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> particles alongside ovalbumin. Compared to exposure to ovalbumin alone, this co-exposure significantly increased the numbers of neutrophils and γδ T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We found that silencing nociceptor neurons at the peak of inflammation using intranasal QX-314 or ablating TRPV1-expressing neurons reduced lung neutrophil accumulation. Live <italic>in vivo</italic> intravital imaging confirmed that neuronal ablation reduced neutrophil numbers and increased their net displacement capacity. In neurons isolated from mice with pollution-exacerbated asthma, the chemical-sensing TRPA1 channel exhibited heightened sensitivity to its cognate ligand. Elevated levels of artemin were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pollution-exposed mice but returned to baseline in mice with ablated nociceptor neurons. Alveolar macrophages expressing the pollution-sensing aryl hydrocarbon receptor were identified as a putative source of artemin following exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub>. This molecule enhanced TRPA1 responsiveness and, in turn, drove nociceptor-mediated neutrophil recruitment, revealing a novel mechanism by which lung-innervating neurons respond to air pollution in the context of allergy. Overall, our findings suggest that targeting artemin-driven pathways could provide a therapeutic strategy for controlling neutrophilic airway inflammation in asthma, a clinical condition typically refractory to treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Organisms have evolved sophisticated fail-safe systems to preserve homeostasis, integrating threat detection, reflex responses, and tailored immune mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. These systems are jointly orchestrated by the immune and sensory nervous systems, which are designed to sense external threats and internal disturbances. Both systems rely on shared metabolic pathways and signaling molecules—including receptors, cytokines, and neuropeptides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This common molecular framework supports constant interactions between these systems, which play pivotal roles in monitoring barrier tissues (e.g., skin <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>), activating anticipatory immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and managing pathologies such as allergies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the context of lung disease, vasoactive intestinal peptide (<bold>VIP</bold>), released by pulmonary sensory neurons following IL-5 stimulation, fosters allergic inflammation by acting on CD4⁺ T cells and innate lymphoid type 2 cells (<bold>ILC2s</bold>). This action elevates T helper type 2 (<bold>T<sub>h</sub>2</bold>) cytokines, which are central drivers of asthmatic responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Expanding on these insights, our work shows that vagal nociceptor neurons contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> mucus metaplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and the detection of immunoglobulins E and G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. These neurons also mediate antibody class switching in B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and promote IgG production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. More recently, we discovered that a subset of nociceptors is reprogrammed by the asthma-associated cytokine IL-13, rendering them susceptible to the inhibitory influence of neuropeptide Y (<bold>NPY</bold>) secreted by lung-innervating sympathetic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Wildfire frequency and severity increased by 2.2-fold within the last 20 years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Between 2008 and 2018 in California, wildfire-attributable PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure caused an estimated ∼53,000 premature deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Combined with urban pollution, these events have driven escalating levels of particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), shifting asthma phenotypes from more responsive T helper 2 (T<sub>h</sub>2) / eosinophilic types to treatment-resistant neutrophilic and mixed T<sub>h</sub>17/T<sub>h</sub>1 variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, recent estimates suggest that neutrophilic asthma accounts for 15–25% of all asthma cases, with about half of these resistant to standard therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To investigate whether neuronal silencing can mitigate neutrophilic airway inflammation, we used an innovative asthma model which combines ovalbumin with fine particulate matter (<bold>FPM</bold>). We further explored the molecular mechanisms underlying heightened neuronal sensitivity in this setting, identifying artemin—produced by alveolar macrophages via the pollution-sensing aryl hydrocarbon receptor (<bold>AhR</bold>)—as a critical mediator of this hypersensitivity.</p>

<title>Heightened nociceptor sensitivity in pollution-exacerbated asthma</title>
<p>Prof. Ya-Jen Chang’s group developed a novel method to model pollution-exacerbated asthma and investigate the impact of fine particulate matter (<bold>FPM</bold>) on airway inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Their work demonstrates that FPM exposure induces airway hyperreactivity and neutrophilic inflammation, promotes T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>17 immune responses, and increases epithelial cell apoptosis rates <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Notably, γδ T cells significantly contribute to both the inflammation and airway hyperreactivity phenotypes by producing IL-17A <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Building on this foundation, we explored whether lung-innervating nociceptor neurons become sensitized during such asthma exacerbations. To test this, male and female C57BL/6 mice (6–10 weeks old) were sensitized with an intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin (<bold>OVA</bold>; 200 µg/dose) and aluminum hydroxide (1 mg/dose) emulsion on days 0 and 7, followed by intranasal challenges of OVA (50 µg/dose), with or without FPM (20 µg/dose), on days 14–16. On day 17, lung-innervating jugular-nodose-complex (<bold>JNC</bold>) neurons were harvested, cultured for 24 hours, and loaded with the calcium indicator Fura-2AM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Stimulation with the TRPA1 agonist AITC (10–100 µM) and the pan-neuronal activator KCl (40 mM) revealed increased responsiveness in neurons from mice exposed to both FPM and OVA, compared to OVA-only–exposed mice, whose sensitivity was similar to that of wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B–C</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>(A–C)</bold> Male and female C57BL/6 mice (6–10 weeks old) were sensitized via intraperitoneal injection with an emulsion of ovalbumin (OVA; 200 µg/dose) and aluminum hydroxide (1 mg/dose) on days 0 and 7. On days 14–16, mice were challenged intranasally with OVA (50 µg/dose), either alone or in combination with fine particulate matter (FPM; 20 µg/dose). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected, and jugular-nodose complex neurons were cultured on day 17 for 24 hours before being loaded with the calcium indicator Fura-2AM. Cells were sequentially stimulated with the TRPA1 agonist AITC (successively to 10 µM at 60–90 seconds, 30 µM at 90–120 seconds, 100 µM at 120–150 seconds) and then with KCl (40 mM at 420–435 seconds). Calcium flux was continuously monitored throughout the experiment. The amplitude of AITC responses was measured by calculating the ratio of peak F340/F380 fluorescence after stimulation to the baseline F340/F380 fluorescence measured 30 seconds prior to stimulation. Data are plots as the per dish average of AITC and KCl responsive neurons and show that AITC (10 µM) responses was higher in JNC neurons from OVA-FPM exposed mice when compared to vehicle or OVA alone (<bold>C</bold>). <italic>Data in are presented as means ± SEM (<bold>B-C</bold>).

<title>Transcriptomic reprogramming of TRPV1⁺ neurons</title>
<p>Recent data indicate that the asthma-associated cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 can reprogram lung-innervating nociceptor neurons to adopt a pro-allergic phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To investigate whether pollution-exacerbated asthma similarly reprograms these neurons, we used TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::tdTomato<sup>fl/wt</sup> mice subjected to our standard OVA protocol, with or without FPM. We isolated and dissociated TRPV1⁺ JNC neurons, enriched them by excluding satellite glial and immune cells, and then purified them by FACS-sorting followed by RNA sequencing. Our analysis revealed that several differentially expressed genes (<bold>DEGs</bold>) were upregulated in the OVA-FPM group compared to naive mice (<italic>Lifr, Oprm1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A–B</xref>), in OVA-FPM compared to OVA alone (<italic>Oprm1, Nefh, P2ry1, Prkcb, Gabra1, Kcnv1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C–D</xref>), and in OVA alone compared to naive controls (<italic>Cntn1, Piezo1, Npy1r, Kcna1</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E–F</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that pollution-exacerbated asthma both transcriptomically and functionally reprograms lung-innervating nociceptor neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tables1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Silencing nociceptor neurons reduces inflammation</title>
<p>To determine whether silencing nociceptor neurons affects pollution-exacerbated asthma, we adapted a previously established neuron-blocking strategy originally developed for pain and itch neurons. This method uses nonselective ion channels (TRPA1 and TRPV1) as a drug entry port for QX-314, a charged form of lidocaine. During inflammation, QX-314 enters sensory fibers, blocking sodium currents and producing a targeted, long-lasting (&gt;9 hours) electrical blockade of nociceptors without impairing immune cell function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Intranasal administration of QX-314 has already been shown to reverse allergic airway inflammation, coughing, mucus metaplasia, and hyperreactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In our model, an intranasal dose of QX-314 administered at the peak of inflammation (day 16, 5 nmol, 50 µL) significantly reduced neutrophil counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (<bold>BALF</bold>) of OVA-FPM-exposed mice, restoring them to levels typically seen in asthmatic (OVA-only) mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A–B</xref>). To validate these findings, we used mice genetically engineered to either retain (TRPV1<sup>wt</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup>; denoted as TRPV1<sup>WT</sup>) or lack (TRPV1<sup>cre</sup>::DTA<sup>fl/wt</sup>; denoted as TRPV1<sup>DTA</sup>) TRPV1-expressing nociceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Compared with controls, TRPV1<sup>DTA</sup> mice had markedly fewer BALF neutrophils and lung γδ T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C–E</xref>), underscoring the critical role nociceptor neurons play in shaping the inflammatory and immune responses in pollution-exacerbated asthma.</p>

<title>Mechanistic insights: artemin–nociceptor axis</title>
<p>To determine which vagal neuron subsets, express the artemin receptor GFRα3–RET, we performed an in-silico analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and found that <italic>Gfra3</italic> is expressed by several nociceptor subtypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C–D</xref>), including JG3 (OSM-R–expressing), JG4 (TRPA1/SSTR2-expressing), and JG6 (TRPM8-expressing). Concurrently, ImmGen data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> indicated robust <italic>Artn</italic> expression in macrophages, with <italic>Ahr</italic> levels slightly lower than those in ILC2s and eosinophils <bold>(SF. 1)</bold>. We then conducted an in-silico analysis of data from Karlsson et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> <bold>(SF. 2A)</bold>, Uhlén et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> <bold>(SF. 2B)</bold> and Abdulla et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> <bold>(SF. 2C)</bold>, showing that <italic>Ahr</italic> is also expressed in human lung, that AHR protein is detected in human lung macrophages, and that <italic>Artn</italic> and <italic>Ahr</italic> are co-expressed in lung macrophages, respectively.

<p>A recent study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> linked artemin overexpression to increased mRNA levels of several nociceptor markers (<italic>Gfra3</italic>, <italic>TrkA</italic>, <italic>Trpv1</italic>, <italic>Trpa1</italic>), accompanied by heightened thermal sensitivity.

Follow-up tests in naive C57BL/6 mice showed elevated AITC responsiveness in artemin-exposed JNC neurons compared to vehicle-treated controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H–J</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that alveolar macrophages, through pollutant-driven production of artemin, sensitize nociceptor neurons and thereby potentiate allergic airway inflammation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our research, in line with other studies, indicates that nociceptor neurons promote regulatory immunity in the context of bacterial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, viral<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, or fungal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> infections, as well as malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, however, the impact of neuro-immunity on neutrophilic asthma is less understood. Using a model of pollution-exacerbated airway inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we found that ablation or silencing of nociceptor neurons prevented the induction of neutrophilic airway inflammation, revealing a potentially novel therapeutic avenue for treating refractory asthma. This result parallels our earlier findings that nociceptor neuron silencing via charged blockers of voltage-gated sodium channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, or calcium channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> can halt eosinophilic airway inflammation.</p>
<p>During bacterial infections, Pinho-Ribeiro et al. demonstrated that nociceptor neurons inhibit neutrophil influx and antimicrobial activity by releasing the neuropeptide CGRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. In addition, Ugolini and colleagues showed that ablating Na<sub>V</sub>1.8<sup>+</sup> nociceptor neurons during HSV-1 infection increases skin neutrophil infiltration, cytokine production, and lesion severity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Building on these findings, we used intravital imaging to study neuro–immune interactions in our model, we observed that the total number of alveolar macrophages remained unchanged in OVA-exposed mice lacking nociceptor neurons, but their displacement was significantly reduced. In contrast, pollution-exposed asthmatic mice lacking nociceptor neurons exhibited a marked decrease in neutrophil recruitment and a corresponding increase in their displacement. These shifts in cellularity occurred regardless of whether nociceptor neurons were genetically ablated (TRPV1<sup>+</sup> or Na<sub>V</sub>1.8<sup>+</sup> populations) or pharmacologically silenced with QX-314, as confirmed by flow cytometry. Although individual neutrophil behaviors—such as adherence, crawling, patrolling, and tethering—did not change, neuronal ablation effectively “removed the brakes” on neutrophil motility. This likely led to reduced neutrophil accumulation in the lung and overall dampening of lung inflammation in pollution-exacerbated asthma. These findings are consistent with the pioneering work by Baral et al., who showed that vagal TRPV1<sup>+</sup> afferents suppress neutrophil recruitment and modulate lung γδ T cell numbers via CGRP signaling, thus supporting essential antibacterial clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Related studies in influenza-infected mice revealed that vagal nociceptor deficiency significantly alters the lung immune landscape— expanding neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>—and transcriptional analyses further indicated disrupted interferon signaling as well as imbalances among neutrophil subpopulations in nociceptor-ablated mice. Collectively, these results highlight the bidirectional crosstalk between recruited and tissue-resident phagocytes and nociceptors in air-pollution–exacerbated allergic airway inflammation.</p>
<p>The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (<bold>AhR</bold>) is a crucial modulator of inflammation, as seen in psoriasis models, where its activation reduces inflammation, whereas its absence exacerbates disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Besides being expressed in alveolar macrophages, AhR is also present in ILC2s, eosinophils, and neurons. A recent preprint suggests AhR has a dual role in neural protection and axon regeneration: AhR activation in dorsal root ganglion neurons inhibits axon growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. At the same time, its deletion lessens inflammation and stress signaling, driving pro-regenerative pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Additional work indicates that AhR regulates the gut-brain axis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Although we have not directly examined AhR in nociceptor neurons, our findings suggest that neurons, much like alveolar macrophages, may sense fine particulate matter via AhR. This possibility could explain the direct neuronal transcriptomic reprogramming we observed after pollutant exposure. Ongoing studies aim to probe this hypothesis using nociceptor-specific AhR knockout models.</p>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates that airway-innervating sensory neurons undergo significant transcriptomic alterations in neutrophilic asthma. Although some lung innervation arises from the dorsal root ganglia (DRG)—especially for nociception in the upper thoracic segments (T1–T5)—the majority (70–80%, sometimes up to 90%) of afferent fibers originate from the JNC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Because the JNC mediates critical mechanosensory and chemosensory functions, our analysis focuses on this primary vagal pathway. While single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed that JNC neurons are highly heterogeneous and control breathing and tracheal reflexes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>, the molecular changes that occur during chronic inflammation remain poorly characterized.</p>
<p>Using an Na<sub>V</sub>1.8 reporter mice and intranasal retrograde tracing, we identified a subset of nociceptors innervating the lungs that are reprogrammed in allergic airway inflammation and by the asthma-driving cytokine IL-13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Our transcriptomic data using sorted TRPV1<sup>+</sup> neurons confirm the upregulation of <italic>Npy1r</italic> during allergic airway inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and highlight the upregulation of <italic>Cacna1c</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> and <italic>Dmxl2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> during pollution-exacerbated asthma, suggesting heightened vesicle trafficking and changes in synaptic release dynamics that may influence neuronal sensitivity and plasticity in asthmatic conditions. Other genes such as <italic>Oprm1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> (mu-opioid receptor) and <italic>Hint1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup> (an opioid signaling modulator) suggest altered pain or irritant sensation in the lung, potentially shaping cough reflexes or bronchospasm. Changes in cytoskeletal regulators, including <italic>Map1b</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> and <italic>Apc</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, indicate that JNC axons may remodel their structure and synaptic architecture, potentially altering how airway signals are relayed to central circuits. <italic>Lifr</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup> (Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor alpha), which supports neuron survival and differentiation, may also be important in inflammatory or injury contexts in the lung.</p>
<p>Pathway analysis reveals gene clusters involved in synaptic structure, cytoskeletal organization, and epigenetic regulation. Enrichment in terms such as “synapse”, “presynaptic active zone,” and “postsynaptic density” indicates that both neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic excitability are being recalibrated, potentially amplifying neuro-immune feedback loops and leading to maladaptive reflexes like excessive bronchoconstriction or persistent cough in neutrophilic asthma. In parallel, pathways related to “cellular component organization,” “negative regulation of inclusion body assembly,” and “protein quality control” show that neurons may upregulate protective or adaptive mechanisms in response to chronic airway inflammation. These transcriptomic alterations point to a dynamic neuro-immune crosstalk in the inflamed lung, with neurons adapting their excitability and structural integrity in response to cytokines, environmental pollutants, and inflammatory cells, potentially exacerbating or perpetuating the pathophysiology of neutrophilic asthma.</p>
<p>Alveolar macrophages act as a critical early warning system in the lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, detecting pollutants such as FPM and initiating protective reflexes by secreting artemin. This cytokine activates and sensitizes nociceptor neurons—particularly TRPA1-expressing fibers—to noxious stimuli. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified a subset of TRPA1⁺, SSTR2⁺ neurons that express the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor receptor GFRα3 and are thereby sensitized by artemin. This finding aligns with earlier data showing that keratinocyte-derived TSLP can sensitize skin-innervating nociceptor neurons, promoting itch and atopic dermatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. In the lungs, germline TRPA1 knockout reduces allergic airway inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>, and clinical data from Genentech suggest that TRPA1 agonists are elevated in asthmatic human airways, contributing to both inflammation and hyperreactivity. GDC-0334, a selective TRPA1 antagonist they develop, mitigates airway inflammation, cough, and allergic responses in preclinical models and reduces pain and itch in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. These findings strongly support the central role of TRPA1 sensitization and nociceptor activation in driving asthma pathology.</p>
<p>Our prior work showed that nodose ganglion neurons, which are highly TRPA1⁺, exhibit heightened thermal sensitivity and outgrowth responses to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<bold>BDNF</bold>) but do not respond to nerve growth factor (<bold>NGF</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Here, we demonstrate that vagal nociceptors express GFRα3 and respond to artemin, which sensitizes TRPA1 channels and promotes subsequent airway inflammation. Indeed, jugular-nodose-complex (<bold>JNC</bold>) neurons undergo substantial transcriptomic reprogramming when exposed to OVA plus FPM, mirroring the effects of pro-asthmatic cytokines. Parallel data from other disease models support this link between inflammation-induced sensitization and elevated artemin. For example, increased <italic>Artn</italic> and EGR1 levels in atopic dermatitis correlate with enhanced nerve density and scratching, both of which are attenuated in EGR1-deficient mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. Similarly, artemin overexpression boosts sensory neuron thermal responses, underscoring its importance in driving neuronal outgrowth and sensitivity in atopic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. These observations raise the possibility that blocking GFRα3 may offer a novel strategy to prevent maladaptive nociceptor involvement in pollution-exacerbated asthma.</p>
<p>Our previous work showed that vagal nociceptor neurons can detect allergen-IgE immune complexes and respond by releasing substance P (<bold>SP</bold>) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (<bold>VIP</bold>), but not CGRP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. These findings were corroborated by analyzing bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (<bold>BALF</bold>) from asthmatic mice²⁴. Moreover, we demonstrated that SP drives mucus metaplasia in asthmatic lungs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and influences antibody class switching in B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, a result that other groups have replicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. We also observed that TRPV1⁺ nociceptor ablation impairs antigen trafficking to lymph nodes and reduces IgG production <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, possibly decreasing the severity or onset of allergic responses. Emerging work highlights the varied immunomodulatory roles of different neuropeptides. For instance, CGRP impairs dendritic cell migration in psoriasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>, whereas SP enhances dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes in atopic dermatitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. VIP and neuromedin U (<bold>NMU</bold>) boost pro-asthmatic cytokines from lung ILC2s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>, while CGRP can have similar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup> or opposing effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. In lung infections, CGRP reduces neutrophil and γδ T cell infiltration and protects against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> pneumonia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. Conversely, CGRP exacerbates psoriasis by inducing dendritic cells to release IL-23, which activates IL–17–producing γδ T cells, intensifying inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Likewise, during <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection, sensory neurons release CGRP that stimulates IL-23 production in CD301b⁺ dendritic cells, triggering T<sub>h</sub>17 and γδ T cell responses (marked by IL-17A and IL-22), enhancing host defense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In our model, nociceptor neuron ablation diminishes γδ T cell activation, which we posit is chiefly driven by SP/VIP, given the absence of heightened CGRP release in our asthma models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Future work will investigate whether neurons directly regulate γδ T cells and neutrophils through these or other neuropeptides.</p>
<p>Previous reports show that TRPV1⁺ neuron activation elicits a local type 17 immune response that enhances host defense against <italic>Candida albicans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. While our mixed OVA-FPM was expected to induce a strong T<sub>h</sub>17/T<sub>h</sub>2 component, we did not observe an increase in IL-17A in our cytokine bead array. Similarly, increases in classic asthma-driving cytokines were modest (IL-4, IL-5) or absent (IL-13). One possible explanation is that these experiments were conducted in C57BL/6 mice, rather than BALB/c mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We also noted an increase in TNFα and artemin, both of which were reduced by nociceptor neuron silencing. While we found that TNFα can reprogram nociceptor neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we propose that this TNFα may originate from activated neutrophils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>, consistent with the reduced TNFα and neutrophil activation seen in neuron-ablated mice. It is worth noting that the PM₂₅ used in this study—Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2786—was obtained from an air intake system in the Czech Republic and that we cannot rule out that it may contain trace levels of LPS that could contribute to this neutrophil–TNFα hypothesis. Our rationale for choosing SRM2786 was that it is commercially available and represents a broad spectrum of ambient air pollutants, in contrast to more specialized sources such as diesel exhaust particles. Future studies will need to validate these findings using wildfire-collected particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>, LPS-free air intake particles, and replication in BALB/c mice.</p>
<p>In summary, our study highlights how alveolar macrophages, via AhR-dependent pollutant detection and artemin secretion, sensitize TRPA1⁺ nociceptor neurons, thereby amplifying neutrophilic asthma. We propose several potential therapeutic strategies to curb neutrophilic airway inflammation: (i) targeting AhR signaling in alveolar macrophages, (ii) blocking Artemin’s interaction with GFRα3, (iii) using TRPA1 antagonists such as GDC-0334, and (iv) silencing nociceptor neurons with charged lidocaine derivatives. Collectively, these approaches offer new directions to manage the increasingly prevalent yet treatment-resistant, neutrophilic variant of asthma.</p>

Mice were anesthetized with 10 mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride and 200 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride, and body temperature was maintained at 37°C with a heating pad (World Precision Instruments). The right jugular vein was cannulated for additional anesthetic as needed and for injecting anti-mouse Ly6G Alexa Fluor 647 (BioLegend, clone: 1A8, # 127610) to label neutrophils. After exposing the trachea and inserting a catheter connected to a small rodent ventilator (Harvard Apparatus), the mouse was placed in a right lateral decubitus position. A small incision was made between ribs 4 and 5 to create an opening of about 1.5 cm, and an intercostal lung window was carefully fitted and stabilized by a vacuum of roughly 20 mmHg. Time-lapse images were acquired without delay using a 20X water-immersion objective (numerical aperture 1).</p>
<p>Images are presented as maximum-intensity projections of z-stacks. Alveolar macrophage movement was tracked for over 1 hour, and neutrophil behavior was recorded for 20 minutes. Cell displacement was quantified using the ICY software’s manual tracking plugin. Neutrophil behavior was classified into adherent, tethering, crawling, or patrolling using Imaris (Oxford Instruments) spot tracking. Track Duration and Track Speed Mean were used to define each behavior per field of view (FOV). Tethering was determined by a Track Duration under 150 seconds for cells that rapidly entered the FOV before arresting and exiting again. Adherent cells remained immobile for more than 150 seconds, with a Track Speed Mean of ≤ 0.03 µm/s. Crawling cells were motile with steady movement that persisted for at least half of the video’s duration; these had a Track Speed Mean &gt; 0.03 µm/s and a Track Duration &gt; 600 seconds. Patrolling cells shared the rapid entry observed with tethering cells but, instead of briefly arresting continued crawling and exited the FOV, showing a Track Speed Mean &gt; 0.03 µm/s and a Track Duration &gt; 150 seconds but &lt; 600 seconds.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic of nociceptor involvement in pollution-exacerbated allergic asthma</title><p>In our study, mice were exposed to PM₂₅ particles and ovalbumin (OVA) to model pollution-exacerbated asthma. Compared to mice exposed to OVA alone, co-exposure to PM₂₅ and OVA significantly increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophils and lung γδ T cells levels. To counteract this heightened airway inflammation, we administered intranasal QX-314—a charged lidocaine derivative—at the peak of inflammation, effectively normalizing BALF neutrophil levels. Ablation of TRPV1⁺ nociceptor neurons produced a similar effect.</p><p>Further analysis with calcium imaging revealed that neurons from the jugular-nodose complex in pollution-exposed asthmatic mice were more sensitive via their TRPA1 channels. Levels of TNFα and the growth factor artemin were also elevated in the BALF of these mice, returning to normal following nociceptor ablation.</p><p>We identified alveolar macrophages as the source of artemin, which they secrete upon sensing fine particulate matter (FPM) through aryl hydrocarbon receptors. Artemin, in turn, heightened TRPA1 responsiveness to its agonist (mustard oil), thereby exacerbating airway inflammation. Our findings suggest that silencing nociceptor neurons can disrupt this pathway, offering a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate neutrophilic airway inflammation driven by pollution.</p></caption>

On day 10, phagocytes were labeled by intranasal injection of PKH26 (25 pmol/dose). Mice were then challenged intranasally with OVA (50 µg/dose) alone or in combination with fine particulate matter (FPM; 20 µg/dose) on days 14–16. Alveolar macrophage intravital imaging was performed on day 17 and is presented as a 1-hour time-lapse video.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the presented study, the authors aim to explore the role of nociceptors in the fine particulate matter (FPM) mediated Asthma phenotype, using rodent models of allergic airway inflammation. This manuscript builds on previous studies, and identify transciptomic reprogramming and an increased sensitivity of the jugular nodose complex (JNC) neurons, one of the major sensory ganglion for the airways, on exposure to FPM along with Ova during the challenge phase. The authors then use OX-314 a selectively permeable form of lidocaine, and TRPV1 knockouts to demonstrate that nociceptor blocking can reduce airway inflammation in their experimental setup.</p>
<p>The authors further identify the presence of Gfra3 on the JNC neurons, a receptor for the protein Artemin, and demonstrate their sensitivity to Artmein as a ligand. They further show that alveolar macrophages release Artemin on exposure to FPM.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study builds on results available from multiple previous works, and presents important results which allow insights into the mixed phenotypes of Asthma seen clinically. In addition, by identifying the role of nociceptors, they identify potential therapeutic targets which bear high translational potential.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the results presented in the study are highly relevant, there is a need for further mechanistic dissection to allow better inferences. Currently, certain results seem associative. Also, certain visualisations and experimental protocols presented in the manuscript need careful assessment and interpretation.</p>
<p>While Asthma is a chronic disease, the presented results are particularly important to explore Asthma exacerbations in response to acute exposure to air pollutants. This is relevant in today's age of increasing air pollution and increasing global travel.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors sought to investigate the role of nociceptor neurons in the pathogenesis of pollution-mediated neutrophilic asthma. The authors overall achieved the aim of demonstrating that nociceptor neurons are important to the pathogenesis of pollution-exacerbated asthma. Their results support their conclusions overall, although there are ways the study findings can be strengthened. This work further evaluates how nociceptor neurons contribute to asthma pathogenesis important for consideration while proposing treatment strategies for under treated asthma endotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors utilize TRPV1 ablated mice to confirm the effects of intranasally administered QX-314 utilized to block sodium currents.</p>
<p>Use of intravital microscopy to track alveolar macrophage and neutrophil motility in their model</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that via artemin, which is upregulated in alveolar macrophages in response to pollution, sensitizes JNC neurons thereby increasing their responsiveness to pollution. Ablation or inactivity of nociceptor neurons prevented the pollution induced increase in inflammation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While neutrophilic, unclear of the endotype of asthma represented by the model</p>

<p>Asthma is a complex disease that includes endogenous epithelial, immune and neural components that respond to environmental stimuli. Small airborne particles with diameters in the range of 2.5 micrometers or less, so-called PM2.5, are thought to contribute to some forms of asthma. These forms of asthma may have neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage. Here, Wang and colleagues build on a recent model that incorporated PM2.5 which was found to have a neutrophilic component. Wang altered the model to provide an extra kick via the incorporation of ovalbumin. The major strength of this work is that silencing TRPV1-expressing neurons either pharmacologically or genetically, modulated inflammation and the motility of neutrophils. By examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, they found not only that levels of a number of cytokines were increased, but also that artemin, a protein that supports neuronal development and function, was elevated, which did not occur in nociceptor- ablated mice. Their data strengthens links between pollutants, immune and neural interactions.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The manuscript has been revised extensively, including the addition of new experiments, such as intravital microscopy. Did the comments from the reviewers, manifest by additional experiments and modifying how some of the data was presented, result in any changes in the hypotheses or the interpretation of such?</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable comments, which have significantly enhanced the quality of our manuscript. A point-by-point rebuttal is provided below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strength</p>
<p>The study builds on results available from multiple previous work and presents important results which allow insights into the mixed phenotypes of Asthma seen clinically. In addition, by identifying the role of nociceptors, they identify potential therapeutic targets which bear high translational potential.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>While the results presented in the study are highly relevant, there is a need for further mechanistic dissection to allow better inferences. Currently certain results seem associative. Also, certain visualisations and experimental protocols presented in the manuscript need careful assessment and interpretation. While Asthma is a chronic disease, the presented results are particularly important to explore Asthma exacerbations in response to acute exposure to air pollutants. This is relevant in today's age of increasing air pollution and increasing global travel.</p>
<p>Major</p>
<p>The JNC is a major group of neurons responsible for receiving sensory inputs from the airways. However, the DRG also contains nociceptors and is known to receive afference from the upper airways. An explanation of why the study was restricted to the JNC would be important.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that some afferents to the upper airways do arise from the DRG, specifically in the upper thoracic segments (T1–T5). We have added a statement in the text to note this subset of nociceptive and spinally mediated pathways. However, the preponderance of evidence indicates that the majority of airway and lung afferents (70–80%, sometimes up to 90%) originate from the jugular–nodose complex (JNC). Given this large imbalance—and because our study focuses on the mechanosensory, and chemosensory functions mediated primarily by the JNC—we restricted our analysis to this main vagal pathway. By contrast, DRG innervation, though functionally important for nociception and irritation-related reflexes, accounts for a smaller yet significant (~20–30%) fraction of the total afferent pool. The referenced tracing studies[1,2] support this distribution and are cited to clarify our rationale for emphasizing the JNC in our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Similarly, the role of the Artemin in the study remains associative. The study results present that Artemin sensitize nociceptors to lead to an increased inflammatory response (Supplementary Figure 2), however, both upstream and downstream evidence for this inference needs to be dissected further. For instance, the evidence for the role of Artemin in the model comes from ex vivo experiments with alveolar macrophages, but not in the experimental model created. Blocking or activation experiments could be performed, along with investigating the change in the total number of nociceptors with Artemin exposure. Similarly, the downstream effects of the potential Artemin-mediated JNC stimulation should be explored in the context of this experimental setup. A detailed dissection of the mechanisms is important. Additionally, it is also important to discuss the hypothesis leading to the selection of Artemin as a target, which currently seems arbitrary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our data show that exogenous i) OVA-FPM exposed AM secrete Artemin and that ii) recombinant Artemin can sensitize nociceptors, potentially heightening the inflammatory response. As suggested, we agree that more upstream and downstream evidence is needed for definitive mechanistic insight. In response, we have expanded our experiments to include intravital microscopy, which demonstrates impaired motility of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in nociceptor-ablated mice, suggesting a bidirectional crosstalk between AMs and nociceptor neurons.</p>
<p>In future studies, we will perform blocking or activation studies to clarify Artemin’s in vivo effects and confirm its role in modulating airway nociceptors. We also recognize the importance of examining whether Artemin exposure alters the phenotype of these neurons and lung innervation density. As recommended, we plan targeted interventions (e.g., Artemin-neutralizing antibodies or overexpression strategies) to delineate the mechanisms by which Artemin-mediated nociceptor stimulation influences the local inflammatory environment.</p>
<p>We have expanded our discussion to clarify that Artemin is a recognized growth factor known to sensitize certain sensory neurons, including those responsive to tissue injury and inflammation. This literature-based rationale guided our hypothesis that Artemin might increase nociceptor reactivity in the lung and thereby influence alveolar macrophage function. By combining ex vivo and intravital approaches, we have begun to map these interactions but agree that further in vivo studies are necessary to confirm causality, dissect signal transduction pathways, and fully validate Artemin’s contributions to AM–nociceptor crosstalk. We have revised our manuscript accordingly to highlight these limitations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A deeper exploration of the inflammatory parameters could be performed. The multiplex analysis of the cytokine analysis shows a reduction in certain cytokines like IL-6 and MCP (figure 3F), which needs to be discussed. Additionally, investigating the change in proportions of the different immune cell populations is important, which currently restricts the eosinophil and neutrophil counts in the BAL. This is also important as the study builds on work from Prof. Chang's group, which also identified the expansion of an invariant iNKT cell population by FPM, regulatory in nature. Adding data on airway hyperresponsiveness, if possible, would be a welcome addition, considering Asthma as the disease context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the need for a more comprehensive exploration of inflammatory parameters. To address these concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Cytokine Analysis: We re-ran all statistical analyses, including the CBA and ELISA assays, and confirmed that TNFα and Artemin are the only differentially expressed cytokines across experimental groups. We have expanded the Discussion to emphasize TNFα’s role in this context.</p>
<p>(2) Immune Cell Profiling in BALF: Our data show that co-exposure with FPM exacerbates CD45+ cells, eosinophil, neutrophil, T-cells and monocyte infiltration. Notably, CD45+ cells and neutrophils were the only population reduced under nociceptor neuron loss-of-function conditions (QX314–treated or TRPV1-DTA mice, Rebuttal Figure 1).</p>
<p>Of note, we also confirmed these data using intravital imaging and in a second line of nociceptor ablated mice (NaV1.8DTA). We are aware of Prof. Chang’s work suggesting expansion of an invariant iNKT cell population this population in future</p>
<p>(3) Airway Hyperresponsiveness (AHR): We recognize that adding AHR data would strengthen the asthma-related context. Unfortunately, we are not currently equipped to perform AHR measurements, but we intend to include this in future experiments to provide a more complete assessment of airway function.</p>

<p>The authors could revisit the data presented in terms of visualization. For instance, the pooled data presented in some of the figures is probably leading to a wide variation which makes interpretation more difficult. Presenting data separately for each experimental replicate might help the reader. This is also important considering the possible variation seen between experiments (for instance, in Figure 3A and 3C and 3B and 3D, the neutrophil and eosinophil panels for the same groups seem to have an almost 2-fold difference.). Similarly, in the cytokine analysis, the authors have used a common axis for depicting all cytokine values which leads to difficulties in interpretation (Figure 3F). Analysis of the RNA seq results and the DEGs could be revisited to include pathway analysis etc (Figure 2), and the supplementary information could include detailed lists of the major target genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this query, we have completely reformatted all graphs and included both gene lists and lists of enriched pathways for all three comparisons in Supplementary Table 1. We also confirmed our flow cytometry analysis functionally by performing intravital imaging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should also consider citing the previous experimental setup used for some particular protocols. For instance, the use of the specified protocol for OVA in a C57 background needs to be justified, as there are various protocols reported in the literature. Additionally, doses used in some experiments seem arbitrary (The FPM and Artemin exposure in Figure 4). Depicting the dose-response curve or citing previous literature for the same would be important. Similarly, different sample sizes seen in experiments should be explained, whether they are due to mortality, failure to exhibit phenotypes, or due to technical failures. The RNA seq experiment mentions only 2 biological replicates in one of the groups which should be addressed either by increasing the sample size or by replicating the experiment. Moreover, nested comparisons in experiments performed for Figure 1 need to be performed. Neurons isolated from each mouse should be maintained and analysed separately to retain biological replicates to better represent the heterogeneity.</p>

<p>We appreciate the request for clarity regarding the experimental protocols and sample sizes:</p>
<p>OVA Model in C57BL/6 Mice: We adapted a previously published OVA protocol in C57BL/6 mice[3-5] (PMID: 39661516), which uses two doses of sensitization to compensate for the lower Th2 response compared to BALB/c[6]. We increased the dose of OVA (100 µg) because our initial experiments produced low eosinophil infiltration. Although this dosage is on the higher side, some studies have noted local IFNγ induction in C57BL/6 mice; however, we did not detect IFNγ in our setup.</p>
<p>FPM and Artemin Doses: We did not perform a full dose-response assay for FPM and Artemin but used 100 ng/mL as reported in prior literature, where TRPA1 and TRPV1 mRNA were upregulated after 18 hours of incubation[7]. This reference has been added for clarity.</p>
<p>Sample Sizes and Exclusions: One control mouse was excluded from the RNA-seq experiment because a parallel PCA analysis indicated it was an outlier. This was the only exclusion in the study, and this have been indicated in the method section of the article.</p>
<p>Nested Comparisons and Biological Replicates: We reanalyzed the relevant data with a nested one-way ANOVA and updated the figures accordingly. Neurons isolated from each mouse were first averaged to preserve biological replicates and capture potential heterogeneity; and data was analysed on the per mouse averages.</p>

<p>The authors sought to investigate the role of nociceptor neurons in the pathogenesis of pollutionmediated neutrophilic asthma.</p>

<p>Strength</p>
<p>The authors utilize TRPV1 ablated mice to confirm effects of intranasally administered QX-314 utilized to block sodium currents. The authors demonstrate that via artemin, which is upregulated in alveolar macrophages in response to pollution, sensitizes JNC neurons thereby increasing their responsiveness to pollution. Ablation or inactivity of nociceptor neurons prevented the pollution induced increase in inflammation.</p>
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>While neutrophilic, the model used doesn't appear to truly recapitulate a Th2/Th17 phenotype.  No IL-17A is visible/evident in the BALF fluid within the model. (Figure 3F). Unclear of the relevance of the RNAseq dataset, none of the identified DEGs were evaluated in the context of mechanism. The authors overall achieved the aim of demonstrating that nociceptor neurons are important to the pathogenesis of pollutionexacerbated asthma. Their results support their conclusions overall, although there are ways the study findings can be strengthened. This work further evaluates how nociceptor neurons contribute to asthma pathogenesis important for consideration while proposing treatment strategies for undertreated asthma endotypes.</p>
<p>Major</p>
<p>Utilizing a different model, one using house dust mite or alternaria alternata or similar that is able to induce a true Th2/th17 type response that is also more translatable to humans for confirmation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion to use additional allergen models. In a pilot study, we did observe increased Artemin in the BALF of house dust mite–treated mice, although the levels were low under our current dosing schedule (20 µg/dose daily from Day 0–4 and Day 7–9, with sacrifice on Day 10; Rebuttal Figure 2). Conversely, using an Alternaria alternata model at 100 µg/dose daily from Day 0–2 (sacrificed on Day 3) did not yield a detectable increase in Artemin. We suspect these findings may reflect the specific dose and timing used. We plan to refine our protocols (e.g., longer exposures or higher doses) for HDM and/or Alternaria to better model a Th2/Th17 response and further validate our observations in a setting more translatable to human asthma.</p>

<p>Additional analysis, maybe pathway analysis on the RNAseq dataset presented in Figure 2. Unclear how these genes are relevant/how they affect functionality. At present it is acceptable to say they are transcriptionally reprogramed, but no protein evaluation is provided which would get more at function, however, the authors do show some functional data in Figure 1, so maybe this could somehow be discussed/related to Figure 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have expanded our RNA-seq analysis to include gene lists and enriched pathways for all three comparisons in Supplementary Table 1. We have also revised our discussion to align these transcriptomic changes with the functional data shown in Figure 1. While we have not yet performed protein-level validation for all identified genes, the patterns observed in our RNA-seq dataset suggest pathways potentially tied to nociceptor activation and the downstream inflammatory response. We plan to conduct targeted protein analyses in future studies to further substantiate these findings.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to include histological data showing the distribution of neutrophils, nociceptor neurons, and alveolar macrophages. While we have not yet performed detailed histological staining of these cell types, we have added live in-vivo intravital microscopy data (Figure 4) that illustrate impaired AM and neutrophil motility in nociceptor-ablated mice. We plan to include additional histological analyses in future studies to further localize these cells in the lung tissue.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Asthma is a complex disease that includes endogenous epithelial, immune, and neural components that respond awkwardly to environmental stimuli. Small airborne particles with diameters in the range of 2.5 micrometers or less, so-called PM2.5, are generally thought to contribute to some forms of asthma. These forms of asthma may have increased numbers of neutrophils and/or eosinophils present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and are difficult to treat effectively as they tend to be poorly responsive to steroids. Here, Wang and colleagues build on a recent model that incorporated PM2.5 which was found to have a neutrophilic component. Wang altered the model to provide an extra kick via the incorporation of ovalbumin. Building on their prior expertise linking nociceptors and inflammation, they find that silencing TRPV1-expressing neurons either pharmacologically or genetically, abrogated inflammation and the accumulation of neutrophils. By examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, they found not only that levels of the number of cytokines were increased, but also that artemin, a protein that supports neuronal development and function, was elevated, which did not occur in nociceptor-ablated mice. They also found that alveolar macrophages exposed to PM2.5 particles had increased artemin transcription, suggesting a further link between pollutants, and immune and neural interactions.</p>

<p>Weakness</p>
<p>There are substantial caveats that must be attached to the suggestions by the authors that targeting nociceptors might provide an approach to the treatment of neutrophilic airway inflammation in pollutiondriven asthma in general and wildfire-associated respiratory problems in particular.</p>
<p>These caveats include the uncertainty of the relevance of the conventional source of PM2.5, to pollution and asthma. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the standard reference material (SRM) 2786 is a mix obtained from an air intake system in the Czech Republic. It is not clear exactly what is in the mix, and a recent bioRxiv preprint, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.18.553903v3.full.pdf">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.18.553903v3.full.pdf</ext-link> reveals the presence of endotoxin. Care should thus be taken in interpreting data using particulate matter. Regarding wildfires, there is data that indicates that such exposure is toxic to macrophages. What impact might that then have on the production of cytokines, and artemin, in humans?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognize the potential limitations of using SRM2786 (obtained from a Czech air-intake system) as a model for realworld PM2.5 exposure. Our rationale for choosing SRM2786 is that it is commercially available and represents a broad spectrum of ambient air pollutants, in contrast to more specialized sources like diesel exhaust particles. However, we acknowledge in the discussion the presence of endotoxin in SRM2786, as suggested by recent reports, and agree that this may influence immune responses and should be considered when interpreting our data.</p>
<p>Regarding wildfire-associated exposure, we are aware that certain components of wildfire smoke can be toxic to macrophages. We do not think this play a significant role in the current study design as number of AMs, as determined by flow cytometry and intravital microscopy, are similar when comparing OVA-exposed mice to OVA-FPM exposed animals. Thus, these results rule out significant AM toxicity by FPM.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while our findings suggest that modulating nociceptor activity may reduce neutrophilic inflammation, we emphasize that additional research—including different PM2.5 sources, validation of endotoxin levels, and in vivo confirmation in human-relevant models—is necessary before drawing definitive conclusions about treating pollutiondriven asthma or wildfire-induced respiratory problems.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The Introductory paragraph implies links between wildfire events, particular exposure, and neutrophilic asthma. I am not aware of such a link having been established, in which case the paragraph needs revision. In the paragraph that begins with 'Urban pollution', it is suggested that eosinophilic asthma is treatment responsive in comparison to the neutrophilic form. That may not be the case, and they may often these cellular components may occur together. In much of the manuscript, there is a mismatch between the text and the figure numbers. For example, in the Results, Figure 2 should be Figure 3 some of the time, and Figure 3 is actually Figure 4, while the reference to Figure 1F-H is Figure 4H. Please check carefully.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>(a) Introduction Paragraph and Wildfire–Neutrophilic Asthma Link</p>
<p>We add references to the introduction to support the link between wildfire, respiratory symptoms and the link to neutrophilic asthma [8-12].</p>
<p>(b) Distinction Between Eosinophilic and Neutrophilic Asthma</p>
<p>We recognize that eosinophilic and neutrophilic airway infiltrates can co-occur in the same individual and that treatment responsiveness can vary considerably. Our intention was to note that conventional asthma therapies (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) are generally more effective for eosinophilic-driven disease than for neutrophilic phenotypes, but we agree that these inflammatory endotypes often overlap in clinical practice. We have revised the text in the “Urban pollution” section to acknowledge this complexity and to clarify that inflammatory cell populations in asthma are not always discrete.</p>
<p>Figure Numbering and Text–Figure Mismatch</p>
<p>We sincerely apologize for the confusion caused by mismatched figure labels and references in the Results section. We have carefully reviewed and corrected all figure references throughout the manuscript to ensure accuracy.</p>
