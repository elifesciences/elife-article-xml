    <title>Abstract</title><p>Planarians exhibit remarkable whole-body regeneration abilities. The formation of heads at forward-facing wounds and tails at rearward-facing wounds suggests an intrinsic tissue polarity guiding regeneration. While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, reports of double-headed regenerates from increasingly narrow tissue fragments have long been hypothesised to reflect gradient-based polarity specification. Here, we systematically re-examine this hypothesis in the modern model species <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> and a representative of the genus likely used in the original studies, <italic>Girardia sinensis</italic>. While we never observed double-heads in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, <italic>G. sinensis</italic> readily regenerated double-heads in a manner dependent on piece length, anatomical position and body size. We found that the reduced regeneration robustness of <italic>G. sinensis</italic> was partially explained by wound site-symmetric expression of the head determinant <italic>notum</italic>, which is highly anterior-specific in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>. Exploring what else might mediate head/tail regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, we examined the role of the conserved tail-to-head cWnt signalling gradient. By developing a time-resolved pharmacological approach to reduce the cWnt gradient slope without affecting wound-induced cWnt signalling dynamics, we observed an increased incidence of double-headed regenerates. In addition, the body size-dependence of double-head formation correlated with the decreasing steepness of the cWnt gradient due to scaling. Taken together, our results indicate that the slope of the cWnt gradient may contribute to planarian head/tail regeneration specificity. Furthermore, they suggest that planarian tissue polarity is composed of multiple parallely-acting polarity cues, the differential reliance on which contributes to the observed interspecies variation in regeneration specificity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The establishment and maintenance of species-specific shape and proportions remains a fascinating challenge in biology. In most animals, the body plan emerges during the course of embryonic development via a hierarchical cascade of developmental processes that is set in motion by symmetry-breaking events at the earliest stages of development. However, adults of many animal groups, including hydra, planaria, salamanders and fishes, can also regrow lost or injured body parts through the process of regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In sharp contrast to the fertilised zygote as invariant starting point of embryonic development, regeneration initiates from the unpredictable remnants of injury to restore precisely the missing body part and no more or less. For instance, when the head and the tail of a planarian are amputated, the remaining trunk piece regenerates one head and one tail to once again complete the species-specific body plan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Despite progress in recent years in multiple model systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, the mechanistic basis of “regeneration specificity” as the cellular and molecular mechanisms that so robustly ensure the re-completion of the species-specific body plan irrespective of the nature of the injury, remain incompletely understood in any system.</p>
<p>The ability of many planarian species to rapidly regenerate their entire body almost irrespective of the anatomical origin, shape or size of the regenerating tissue piece<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> makes them a powerful model system for addressing the mechanistic underpinnings of regeneration specificity. Particularly the question of how regenerating pieces succeed in robustly regenerating both head and tail has been subject to intense investigation for more than a century. The fact that the new head and tail regenerate in alignment with the original body axes (i.e., heads from forward- and tails from rearward-facing wounds) indicates that an intrinsic tissue polarisation is a core aspect of planarian regeneration specificity. Interestingly, T.H. Morgan noted already in 1898 the breakdown of regeneration specificity in very narrow cross-pieces (e.g., transverse amputations), which he reported to often form bipolar animals with heads regenerating from both wounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Attempting to rationalise the apparent piece-length dependence of double-head formation, he proposed an underlying “gradation of materials” along the anteroposterior (A/P) axis as mechanistic polarity manifestation. Specifically, he envisaged the resulting difference in “material” between the anterior and posterior wounds of a crosspiece as instructive for head/tail regeneration, and hence the breakdown of regeneration specificity in very narrow crosspieces once this difference becomes too small<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Further observations broadly consistent with the gradient hypothesis include the systematic decrease of head regeneration rates towards the posterior in many species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and the complete head regeneration failures of multiple planarian species in the posterior body half<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Importantly, the existence of organism-scale gene expression and signalling pathway activity gradients along the planarian A/P axis has meanwhile been demonstrated. These may include a head-to-tail gradient of extracellular-signal regulated kinase (Erk) activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and a demonstrated tail-to-head gradient of canonical Wnt (cWnt) signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, high cWnt signalling is necessary and sufficient for tail specification, while cWnt inhibition is necessary and sufficient for head specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. During regeneration, the selective expression of the cWnt antagonist <italic>notum</italic> at anterior-facing wounds is indispensable for head regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Although some of the signalling pathways contributing to the anterior specificity of <italic>notum</italic> expression have meanwhile been identified (including cWnt signalling itself)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and <italic>notum</italic> expression has been localised to longitudinal muscle fibres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, the nature of the head/tail specifying polarity cue and whether or not it involves signalling gradients remains fundamentally unknown.</p>
<p>We here systematically re-examine Morgan’s “gradient hypothesis”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> in the hope of obtaining new insights into planarian tissue polarity specification. While we were unable to replicate the breakdown of regeneration specificity in narrow cross pieces of the modern model species <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, we were able to replicate the finding in the <italic>Girardia</italic> genus that Morgan likely worked with<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Using a comparative approach, we find that <italic>G. sinensis notum</italic> expression occurs symmetrically at both wound sites and that <italic>notum</italic> expression symmetry contributes to the breakdown of regeneration specificity in very narrow <italic>G. sinensis</italic> cross-pieces. To address how broader <italic>G. sinensis</italic> cross-pieces manage to maintain regeneration polarity nevertheless, we developed a pharmacological approach for the selective perturbation of cWnt gradient shape prior to amputation and show that reductions in gradient steepness increase double-head frequency. With the body size-dependence of double-head formation and the size-dependent decrease in cWnt gradient steepness as additional evidence, our results indicate that the cWnt gradient contributes to tissue polarity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>. Overall, our results suggest that planarian tissue polarity consists of multiple cues acting in parallel and that differential reliance on these cues contributes to the species-dependence of regeneration defects.</p>

<title>Comparative analysis of regeneration specificity</title>
<p>Inspired by Morgan’s classical experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, we first set out to replicate the reported breakdown of regeneration specificity and regeneration of double-headed animals in very narrow cross-pieces in the modern model species <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Initial experiments established a minimal piece length of ∼1 mm that is required for successful regeneration in this species, with narrower pieces failing to seal the wound and disintegrating soon after cutting in our hands (data not shown). We started with large <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> of 18 mm body length to minimise the piece length relative to body length. The 1 mm or 2 mm long cross-pieces that we examined consequently correspond to 1/18th or 1/9th of the original body length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). To our surprise, we failed to observe even a single double-headed regenerate across two experimental series and ∼400 individual pieces. Almost all of the pieces correctly established regeneration specificity irrespective of piece length, A/P axis position origin or body size, with only a very small proportion of pieces (&lt; 5%) displaying failures of head or tail regeneration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-E</xref>). While we cannot exclude the possibility of length-dependencies in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> regeneration specificity below the piece length limits required for piece survival, our results stress the fascinating robustness of regeneration specificity in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> that was one of the selection criteria as model species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the fact that the rare head regeneration failures all occurred on pieces of anterior origins might hint at slight position-dependencies even in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> regeneration.</p>

</fig>
<p>Confronted with the discrepancy between our results and Morgan’s, we next considered the possibility of a species-dependence. <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> is a European species, while T.H. Morgan conducted his experiments at the Marine Biological Laboratory in the USA and worked with a locally sourced species at the time referred to as <italic>Planaria maculata</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Reasoning that Morgan’s <italic>P. maculata</italic> likely corresponds to the present-day designation <italic>Girardia tigrina</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, we screened several representatives of the <italic>Girardia</italic> genus that we maintain as part of our planarian species live collection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and identified one that we identified as a strain of <italic>Girardia sinensis</italic> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> that frequently regenerates double-heads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). We observed that 36% of 1 mm cross-pieces cut from 18 mm long worms regenerated double-heads, while 2 mm cross-pieces cut from same sized cohorts regenerated predominantly normal animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-H</xref>). Therefore, these results both confirm Morgan’s findings of length-dependence of regeneration specificity in the genus <italic>Girardia</italic> and, in addition, reveal clear species-dependencies in planarian regeneration specificity. Encouraged by this finding, we next queried the position-dependence of regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>. Interestingly, we found that 1 mm cross-pieces from the trunk region displayed the highest proportion of double-headed regenerates and other regeneration error categories, with only &lt; 20% of pieces regenerating normal animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Therefore, regeneration specificity is generally position-dependent in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> and least robust in the trunk region of the animal. To assay possible body size-dependencies in the piece length-dependence of regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, we complemented the previous regeneration scoring of 1 mm cross-pieces in 18 mm (large) animals with equivalent quantifications of 1 mm cross-pieces cut from 12 mm (medium) or 6 mm (small) animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). The regeneration of double-heads in 40%, 25% or 0% of 1 mm fragments originating from large, medium or small animals clearly reveals an additional body size-dependence of regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, meaning that the probability for double-head regeneration for a given piece length increases systematically with body size. Overall, our results demonstrate the piece length-, position- and body size-dependence of regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, which sharply contrasts with the robustness of regeneration specificity in the model species <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Wound site-symmetric <italic>notum</italic> expression contributes to the reduced <italic>G. sinensis</italic> regeneration specificity</title>
<p>To investigate possible causes for the dramatic species dependence in regeneration specificity between the two species, we first assembled and annotated a comprehensive <italic>G. sinensis</italic> transcriptome using our established PlanMine pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the <italic>G. sinensis β-catenin-1</italic> homologue resulted in a high penetrance of double-head regeneration, confirming both the broad conservation of cWnt inhibition as necessary and sufficient prerequisite for planarian head specification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and the functionality of the RNAi pathway in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2A</xref>). In <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, the asymmetric expression of the Wnt antagonist <italic>notum</italic> is responsible for cWnt inhibition at sites of head regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In regenerating <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> 2 mm trunk pieces cut from 6 mm animals, <italic>notum</italic> expression was induced predominantly at anterior-facing wounds as early as 6 h post amputation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Although some cells in the vicinity of posterior wounds also induce <italic>notum</italic> expression, the majority of <italic>notum</italic>-expressing cells were located within 600 µm of anterior wound sites and the maximum asymmetry in terms of expressing cells was reached by 18 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B-C</xref>), consistent with previous results. In 2 mm <italic>G. sinensis</italic> trunk pieces cut from 6 mm animals, the single <italic>notum</italic> homologue was also wound-induced with similar kinetics and in a similar salt-and pepper pattern that reflects muscle cell expression in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Strikingly and in sharp contrast to <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, the number of <italic>notum</italic> expressing cells was nearly identical between anterior and posterior wounds without any discernible A/P asymmetry at any of the examined time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). High-resolution imaging further confirmed the stark difference between the two species, with barely detectable versus clear <italic>notum</italic> expression at equivalent posterior positions of the two species at peak expression (18 hpa; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-H</xref>). Moreover, the invariance of <italic>notum</italic> expression symmetry across all pieces (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>) and the fact that the examined 2 mm <italic>G. sinensis</italic> pieces invariably establish correct regeneration specificity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>) imply that the posterior wound expression is not a consequence of already disturbed tissue polarity. Therefore, our results indicate that <italic>G. sinensis</italic> lacks <italic>notum</italic> expression asymmetry, at least in terms of detectable <italic>notum</italic>-expressing cells, and that <italic>notum</italic> expression asymmetry is not necessary for head/tail regeneration specificity in this species.</p>

<p>To ask whether <italic>notum</italic> nevertheless maintains a role in the determination of regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, we performed RNAi by feeding and examined the consequences of <italic>notum</italic> knockdown on the regeneration outcome of 1 mm pieces cut from 18 mm animals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). <italic>egfp(RNAi)</italic> controls displayed the expected 40% of double-heads and 23 % of normal regenerates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-K</xref>), consistent with our previous results for this cutting paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> increased the proportion of wild type animals to ∼40%, thus partially “rescuing” the species-specific regeneration defect of <italic>G. sinensis</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). In addition, <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> significantly reduced the fraction of double-headed regenerates to ∼10%, matched by a corresponding increase in the fraction of “headless” regenerates that appeared to form morphologically normal tails. The effects of <italic>notum(RNAi)</italic> were largely independent of A/P position (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>), indicating that the position-dependence of regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>) is independent of <italic>notum</italic>. Examination of the tail marker homologue <italic>wnt11-2</italic> confirmed that the “headless” regenerates indeed form bona-fide tails, including a majority of double-tailed regenerates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>), as in <italic>S. mediterranea notum(RNAi)</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Overall, the increase in tail and decrease in head regeneration are consistent with the conservation of the cWnt inhibitory role of <italic>notum</italic> at <italic>G. sinensis</italic> wound sites and, in conjunction with our expression data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-H</xref>), with a likely permissive <italic>notum</italic> role in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> regeneration specificity. Significantly, the rescue of wild-type regenerates by <italic>notum(RNAi</italic>) suggests that the symmetric <italic>G. sinensis notum</italic> expression contributes to the formation of double-heads and thus to reduced regeneration specificity.</p>

<p>The fact that 20% of 1 mm or 100% of 2 mm <italic>G. sinensis</italic> pieces display normal head/tail regeneration specificity despite symmetric <italic>notum</italic> expression implies that polarity cues other than <italic>notum</italic> must mediate regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>.

An initial search for cWnt signalling components in our <italic>G. sinensis</italic> transcriptome revealed a near-identical set of core pathway components as in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, with the putative absence of <italic>wnt11-3</italic> as only exception (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>; Supp. Table 1). To probe whether the tail to head cWnt signalling gradient was also conserved in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, we extended our previously established β-catenin-1 quantification by quantitative Western blotting (WB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> to <italic>G. sinensis.</italic> Note that β-catenin-1 levels can provide a useful proxy for planarian cWnt signaling due to the exclusive signalling function of this specific gene homologue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and the demonstrated Wnt-dependence of its detectability in lysates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. As our existing anti-β-catenin-1 monoclonal antibody demonstrated a relatively low affinity for <italic>G. sinensis</italic> β-catenin-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, we generated further monoclonal antibodies against the highly conserved N-terminus of β-catenin-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), i.e. the homologue mediating cWnt signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. One (clone 3588-D84-1) yielded a single prominent band at the expected size of ∼110 kDa that was sensitive to β-catenin-1 knockdown in both <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and <italic>G. sinensis</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2B</xref>). Performing quantitative WB along the A/P axis with our new antibody, we demonstrate that both species deploy a tail-to-head gradient of β-catenin-1 abundance, with the highest levels measured at the tail tip (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This result, taken together with observations in <italic>Schmidtea polychroa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and many species across planarian phylogeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> suggest that the β-catenin-1 gradient (hereafter referred to as “cWnt gradient”) may be generally conserved in planaria. Finally, we asked whether the A/P axis gene expression patterns associated with the cWnt gradient in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> are conserved in <italic>G. sinensis.</italic> Spatially-resolved transcriptome profiling in 10 equidistant sections along the A/P axis as in a previous <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> revealed that <italic>G. sinensis</italic> broadly recapitulates the axial gene expression patterns of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, with prominent clusters of organism-scale anterior-to-posterior and posterior-to-anterior gene expression gradients apparent in our data (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>; Supp. Table 3). Significantly, the components of the tail cWnt pathway component module and many cWnt signalling target genes expressed in tail gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> were similarly expressed in tail gradients in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).

<title>Establishment of a pharmacological approach for time-resolved cWnt gradient manipulations</title>
<p>If the cWnt gradient were indeed a polarity cue, then the experimental flattening of the gradient prior to amputation should reduce the difference in signalling activity between the two wounds and thus affect head/tail regeneration specificity. However, RNAi as the standard loss of function approach in the field is unsuitable for this purpose, as many of the signalling pathway components that shape the cWnt signalling gradient in intact animals also mediate critical post-amputation cWnt signalling dynamics during head/tail specification in regenerating pieces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Pharmacological cWnt signalling pathway interventions might offer the requisite temporal control to separate pre- and post-amputation cWnt signalling; however, pharmacological modulation of cWnt signalling has not been demonstrated in planarians to date. We therefore screened a total of 20 commercially-available small molecule cWnt signalling inhibitors and activators in the model species <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2C</xref>), with regeneration as functional readout. Only treatments with one of the compounds, Wnt-C59 (hereafter “C59”), produced a dose-dependent appearance of double-head regenerates characteristic of cWnt loss-of-function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, reaching up to 40% at 50 µM (higher concentrations were not possible due to C59 solubility limitations; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>). C59 inhibits cWnt signalling by targeting the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase Porcupine (Porcn) required for post-translational modification, secretion and activity of Wnts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Consistent with Porcn as the target of C59 in planaria, we found that RNAi of a so far uncharacterized <italic>porcupine</italic> homologue (designated here as “<italic>porcn-b</italic>”) caused double-head regeneration – and thereby phenocopied C59 – in around 25% of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> experimental specimens (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-D</xref>). The broad expression of <italic>porcn-b</italic> across cell types in single-cell RNAseq datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> contrasts with the known gut-specific expression of <italic>porcn-a</italic> in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, and is compatible with a functional role of <italic>porcn-b</italic> in the secretion of Wnt ligands from muscle cells (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2D</xref>). Encouraged by the results in the model species, we next examined the efficacy of C59 treatments in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>). Interestingly, C59 treatments caused 100% double-head regenerates already at a five-fold lower dose (10 µM), indicating that <italic>G. sinensis</italic> is more sensitive to C59 than <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E-F</xref>).</p>

<p>For the intended selective cWnt gradient shape alterations without compromising post-amputation cWnt signalling dynamics, the assessment of the C59 clearance kinetics from planarian tissues further became necessary. We found that C59 can be robustly detected by mass spectrometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>) and that C59 quantifications in our optimised planarian extract conditions afforded linear detection, even at sub-micromolar concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>). We therefore used mass spectrometry to quantify the residual C59 amounts in extracts of intact <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and <italic>G. sinensis</italic> at different time points post-treatment. In 12 mm <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, C59 was rapidly cleared and essentially undetectable already after 12 hours post washout (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). The <italic>G. sinensis</italic> clearance kinetics were significantly slower, respectively achieving 88% and 97% clearance in large (18 mm) and small (6 mm) animals after 4 d of washout (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Drug clearance rates were largely uniform along the A/P axis (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2E</xref>) and cWnt signalling remained strongly affected even after 4 d of washout in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2F</xref>). Overall, these results establish C59 as a viable tool for time-limited cWnt signalling perturbations in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, but with reduced efficacy in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>.</p>

<title>The cWnt gradient contributes to regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic></title>
<p>To test whether the cWnt signalling gradient indeed contributes to regeneration specificity, we first designed species-specific cWnt gradient perturbations that minimise potential effects on post-amputation cWnt signalling. In <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, treatments with 50 µM C59 for 14 days were necessary to achieve measurable alterations of the cWnt signalling gradient by quantitative Western Blotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>). Even so, measured cWnt signalling levels were only significantly reduced in the tail tip (piece 6), but not in more anterior body regions. Treated animals still appeared overtly normal after 14 days of drug treatment and morphological abnormalities only became apparent upon even longer treatment intervals (data not shown). Since the rapid C59 clearance kinetics in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>) likely limit drug effects to the first hours post-amputation, we omitted a dedicated wash-out step from the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> C59 treatment protocol (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Unlike the C59 treatments during the first 48 h of regeneration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-B</xref>), the C59 pre-treatment of 6 mm <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> did not affect the regeneration specificity of 1 mm cross-pieces (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-E</xref>). Therefore, at least the modest gradient shape alterations achievable by our treatment protocol did not affect regeneration specificity in <italic>S. mediterranea,</italic> and the double-head formation in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> were likely the result of post-amputation cWnt signalling inhibition. In the case of <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, C59 pre-treatments with 2 µM C59 for 7 days were already sufficient for achieving a significant reduction of cWnt signalling levels at the tail tip, again indicating a greater treatment efficacy in this species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-G</xref>). In order to account for the slower clearance kinetics in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, we incorporated a 4 day wash-out interval prior to amputation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), which is sufficient for near-complete C59 clearance in 6 mm animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Although some recovery of the cWnt signalling gradient occurred during the wash-out interval, the tail tip signalling levels and hence the slope of the cWnt signalling gradient in the tail remained significantly reduced at the time of amputation (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2F</xref>). Intriguingly and in contrast to <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, the C59 pre-treatment of 1 mm cross pieces from 6 mm animals induced ∼10% of double-headed regenerates and further increased the fraction of “tailless” animals, while DMSO-treated controls displayed the high regeneration specificity previously demonstrated for 1 mm cross-pieces from small animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref> vs. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1J</xref>). Moreover, the regeneration specificity effects were location-dependent, with double-heads originating exclusively from the central body region or the tail of pre-treated donor animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I-J</xref>). Given the near-complete clearance of C59 at the time of amputation in 6 mm animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>), these results were therefore consistent with an instructive role of pre-amputation cWnt signalling in regeneration specificity and thus a role of the cWnt signalling gradient in determining regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>.</p>

<p>We next examined the effect of C59 pre-treatment in large animals (15 mm long <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and 18 mm long <italic>G. sinensis</italic>), reasoning that the body size-dependence of regeneration specificity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>) might render large animals more sensitive to the mild gradient perturbations that our treatment protocol affords. In <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, the two-week C59 pre-treatment elicited similarly modest effects on the cWnt gradient shape as in 6 mm animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref> vs. 5B) and 1 mm transverse fragments displayed similarly high regeneration specificity as the DMSO-treated controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L,N</xref>). However, 2 out of 187 fragments examined did regenerate double-heads (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3A</xref>), with both originating from the anterior or central body regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>). Even though we never observed double-heads amongst an even greater number of untreated controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), the low frequency of the phenotype again emphasised the robustness of regeneration specificity in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>. In the case of <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, the 7d C59 pre-treatment of 18 mm animals resulted in a more significant gradient flattening with our 6-point assay than in 6 mm animals, with significant reductions of cWnt signalling in both pieces 5 and 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5O</xref>). In addition, C59 pre-treatment elicited &gt;15% of double-headed regenerates in 2 mm cross-pieces, which otherwise largely regenerated normal animals in untreated and DMSO treated controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5P,R</xref> vs. 1H; Supp. Video 1). The increase in double-headed regenerates is unlikely due to the somewhat slower clearance of C59 from 18- as compared to 6 mm animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>), as the application of the residual drug concentration to the culture medium during the regeneration interval resulted in fewer double-headed animals than pre-amputation treatments (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3B-E</xref>). Interestingly, the fragments originating from central body regions were most sensitive to C59 pre-treatments, with &gt;50% of fragments regenerating double-heads (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Q</xref>). Notably, the regeneration outcome of the C59 pre-treatments 2 mm pieces from 18 mm <italic>G. sinensis</italic> almost perfectly phenocopies that of “wild-type” 1 mm pieces from 18 mm <italic>G. sinensis</italic> in terms of both frequency and position-dependence of double-heads (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5P-Q</xref> vs. 1H-I). Overall, these results are consistent with a contribution of the cWnt gradient to regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, that is a threshold-level difference in cWnt signalling activity across a piece as requirement for differential head/tail regeneration.</p>

<p>If <italic>G. sinensis</italic> tissue pieces were indeed using the steepness of the cWnt gradient (referred to as “slope” in the following) as a polarity cue, a progressive flattening of the gradient with increasing body size might explain the body size-dependence of both the critical piece length and C59 efficacy (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). To test this prediction, we examined the scaling of the cWnt gradient in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> and <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>. Using our qWB assay, we quantified β-catenin-1 amounts in 6 equiproportional transverse pieces (i.e., each piece accounting for ⅙ of the length of the A/P axis) of 6 mm, 12 mm and 18 mm long individuals. Plotting the individual measurements by their relative A/P axis position-of-origin revealed remarkably similar shapes of the length-normalised cWnt signalling profile shape between the two species and across the examined body size range, thus clearly indicating that the planarian cWnt signalling gradient scales (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref>). However, in considering the absolute A/P axis length variations (6 mm, 12 mm and 18 mm) and the slight decrease in absolute gradient peak amplitude (tail piece) towards larger body sizes, our data indicate that the slope of the cWnt signalling gradient becomes progressively less steep with increasing body length, thus reducing the difference in signalling activity per A/P axis unit length. The scaling of the cWnt signalling gradient is therefore consistent with the observed size-dependent decrease in regeneration specificity and the greater sensitivity to mild slope reductions in large animals. Overall, the size-dependency of cWnt signalling therefore provides further experimental evidence for a functional contribution of the cWnt gradient slope to tissue polarity specification in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, our results suggest the following model (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>): The intrinsic tissue polarity that instructs planarian head/tail regeneration specificity is a multi-factorial cue comprised of at least two distinct pathways: 1) the slope of the organismal cWnt signalling gradient (and possibly other signalling gradients; see below); and 2) asymmetric/anterior-enriched <italic>notum</italic> expression and its upstream regulatory mechanisms. Both cues are capable of independently influencing the autocatalytic and mutually exclusive up- or down-regulation of cWnt signalling at wound sites at 18 h post amputation that signifies the head/tail regeneration commitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Planarian species in which both pathways are functional (e.g. <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>) display the most robust regeneration specificity due to the functional complementation of both cues. In <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, the loss of anterior-enriched <italic>notum</italic> expression leaves the cWnt gradient as the remaining polarity cue and concomitantly uncovers its intrinsic functional limitations, e.g., piece length-, body size- and position-dependence. Our model provides a rationale for the species-dependent regeneration defect in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> and why Morgan’s seminal demonstration of double-head regeneration from narrow cross pieces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> could never be replicated in the modern model species <italic>S. mediterranea.</italic> The cWnt gradient slope as polarity cue and the requirement for a minimal activity threshold difference across regenerating cross pieces are consistent with the general length (piece width) dependence of <italic>G. sinensis</italic> regeneration specificity, with our findings of body-size-dependent reductions in cWnt gradient slope and the body size-dependence of regeneration specificity in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> as further confirmation of the model. Finally, our demonstration that experimental reductions in the cWnt gradient slope prior to amputation increase the length-dependence of regeneration specificity provide direct evidence for the contribution of the cWnt signalling gradient to tissue polarity specification in planarians.</p>
<p>Although the concept of gradient-based polarity specification was already proposed by T.H. Morgan more than 100 years ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> and the existence of long-range signalling gradients deployed by the shell-like planarian body wall musculature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> have meanwhile been demonstrated at least for the tail-to-head cWnt signalling gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, the possibility of gradient-mediated polarity specification has not featured prominently during the molecular revival of planarian research. Besides the lack of demonstrable piece-length dependence in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, part of the reason is the discovery of the critical symmetry-breaking function of asymmetric <italic>notum</italic> expression in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Although the anterior-enriched expression of <italic>notum</italic> in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> requires cWnt signalling (i.e. the much-reduced expression of <italic>notum</italic> after <italic>β-catenin-1(RNAi)</italic>), the global activation of cWnt signalling by <italic>APC(RNAi)</italic> does not abrogate the anterior-specificity of <italic>notum</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Hence, the anterior-specificity of <italic>notum</italic> expression is thought to be independent of the cWnt gradient and although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, recent results point towards the orientation and intrinsic polarisation of the <italic>notum</italic>-expressing longitudinal body wall muscle fibres via <italic>activin-2</italic> and non-canonical Wnt signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In this context, our findings are important for the following reasons: First, although we cannot formally exclude <italic>notum</italic> expression asymmetry below the detection threshold of our in situ hybridization approach or post-transcriptional asymmetry generation in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> (e.g. anterior-specific translation), our results suggest that <italic>notum</italic> expression asymmetry is not universally conserved in planarians and that concomitantly head/tail specification is possible without <italic>notum</italic> expression asymmetry in cross-pieces above a critical length (e.g. &gt;1 mm in 6 mm animals or &gt;2 mm in 18 mm <italic>G. sinensis</italic>). Second, our demonstration that pre-wounding manipulation of the cWnt signalling profile influences regeneration specificity and that the body size and position-dependencies of regeneration specificity correlate with the measured shape and scaling of the cWnt signalling gradient provide experimental evidence for a polarity-specifying role of this signalling gradient.</p>
<p>Given that the planarian body plan is constitutively polarised via tail-to-head Wnt ligand and receptor expression gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, and that tail/head regeneration requires activation or inhibition of cWnt signalling at the wound site, the reinforcement of residual cWnt signalling differences across the regenerating piece provides an attractive potential mechanism for ensuring head/tail regeneration in alignment with wound orientation. The known propensity of certain classes of self-organised signalling patterns to reinforce existing spatial differences in signalling activity <italic>in silico</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, and the intrinsic pattern length scales arising from the diffusion/degradation kinetics of molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, provide a conceptual framework for envisaging gradient-mediated polarity specification at a mechanistic level. The many transcriptional and post-transcriptional feedback loops in planarian cWnt signalling, and the evidence for mutual antagonism between cWnt-mediated cWnt signalling and a yet-to-be-identified signal patterning the oppositely oriented head-to-tail gene expression gradients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> as the molecular basis of the tail/head decision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, make this view plausible. Furthermore, the low amplitude of both gradients in the central body regions correlates with the low point of regeneration specificity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), thus also providing a potential explanation for the position-dependence of <italic>G. sinensis</italic> regeneration specificity. In general, the head/tail specification process during planarian regeneration has interesting analogies to symmetry-breaking mechanisms in early embryos, which often involve the context-dependent triggering of self-amplifying but mutually antagonistic signalling networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the deep phylogenetic conservation of symmetry-breaking signalling patterns (e.g. cWnt, Bmp4/Admp) contrasts with the apparently rapid divergence of the upstream mechanisms that trigger symmetry-breaking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. The intrinsic tendency of self-organising signalling patterns to amplify small initial differences may contribute to the evolvability of symmetry-breaking mechanisms, since any process leading to a small local change in signalling intensity may be sufficient for symmetry-breaking. Similarly, the asymmetry of <italic>notum</italic> expression and the residual slope of the cWnt signalling gradient can be considered as independent but synergistic modulators of the wound site signalling environment, triggering the mutually exclusive head or tail signalling pattern depending on the polarity of the adjacent tissue. The cWnt signalling gradient as a polarity cue is particularly attractive in this context, as it combines polarity encoding (slope of the spatial signalling profile) and symmetry breaking (temporal transition between alternative signaling states) in one and the same mechanism.</p>
<p>That said, the correlation between the various length dependencies in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> regeneration and the scaling of the cWnt signalling gradient does not prove causality and the causal link between gradient slope reductions and regeneration specificity in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> is subject to the limitations of our current pharmacological tool kit. Although our drug clearance rate quantifications (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I-J</xref>; <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2E-F</xref> and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">3B-C</xref>) make it unlikely that the increased frequency of double-headed regenerates is caused by residual post-amputation cWnt signalling inhibition, C59 treatments allowed only comparatively minor reductions of the cWnt gradient slope, even in <italic>G. sinensis</italic>. The much reduced C59 efficacy in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic>, even at 25-fold higher dosage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), aligns with various anecdotal indications in the field that the model species may be particularly resistant to drug treatments. Given that C59 targets the porcupine-mediated lipidation and activation of de novo-synthesised Wnt ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, elucidating the extent by which Wnt ligand deposition/stabilization in the extracellular matrix or potentially partially lipidation-independent Wnt signaling contribute to the slow onset and long lasting effect of C59 treatments constitute interesting questions for future studies. In addition, our model predicts that symmetric <italic>notum</italic> expression in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> should uncover the residual contributions of the cWnt gradient to regeneration specificity. Knockdown of <italic>activin-2</italic> and both <italic>wnt11-1</italic> and <italic>wnt11-2</italic> together has meanwhile been shown to reduce the asymmetry of <italic>notum</italic> expression and to cause a fraction of double-headed regenerates in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Whether the penetrance of these phenotypes display any piece length- or body size dependences has not been examined and provides an interesting avenue for future explorations. Alternatively, it is also possible that <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> has reduced or lost the contribution of the cWnt signalling gradient to polarity specification and instead relies entirely on “hard-wired” muscle fibre polarisation and downstream <italic>notum</italic> asymmetry for polarity specification. Finally, it is important to stress that the gradient hypothesis provides a compelling explanation for piece length- body size- and even position-dependence of regeneration specificity, but that other mechanisms may also give rise to the observed length dependencies. One interesting possibility is the anatomical fine structure of muscle fibres and the body size- or species-dependent scaling of associated length scales, along with the elucidation of the mechanistic basis of asymmetric (<italic>S. mediterranea</italic>) or symmetric (<italic>G. sinensis</italic>) <italic>notum</italic> gene expression. Another possibility is that double-head formation might not reflect ambiguities in the upstream polarity cue as assumed by our model, but rather downstream consequences of initially correctly specified wound site signalling patterns (e.g., a larger and size-dependent Wnt inhibition zone associated with early <italic>G. sinensis</italic> head regeneration). Clearly, the visualisation of spatial and temporal signalling dynamics during regeneration and the development of the requisite tools will be ultimately required for a mechanistic understanding of planarian tissue polarity.</p>
<p>Overall, our results once again highlight the extent of mechanistic divergence between planarian species. Together with the previously reported lack of wound-induced <italic>wnt1</italic> expression in <italic>D. lacteum</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, the absence of <italic>notum</italic> expression asymmetry in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> demonstrates a lack of conservation of already two presumed core components of planarian regeneration. On the one hand, this highlights the need for extending mechanistic studies beyond the model species to distinguish species-specific adaptations from core mechanisms. On the other hand, the experimentally demonstrated importance of asymmetric <italic>notum</italic> expression or wound-induced <italic>wnt1</italic> expression in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> regeneration raises the challenge of understanding how else regeneration remains possible in their absence. In general, redundancy between parallel-acting pathways, as in our model, is an attractive concept for both the robustness of physiological processes and the evolvability of the underlying mechanisms, and planarians as a model taxon provide ample opportunities for studying it.</p>

<p>Animals were immobilised on a chilled peltier element and amputated using a stab knife. Specific-length pieces (e.g., 1 or 2 mm) were isolated through progressive fractionation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. For instance, to obtain 1 mm pieces, 18 mm long animals were first cut into three 6 mm segments. Each 6 mm segment was then divided into two 3 mm segments, and each 3 mm segment was further cut into three 1 mm pieces. The first (head tip) and last (tail tip) pieces were excluded due to having only one wound site. The remaining pieces were transferred to well plates or petri dishes with fresh water, which was regularly changed to ensure optimal viability of the regenerating fragments. Regeneration was visually assessed after 14 days for <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and 21 days for <italic>G. sinensis</italic> using a dissecting microscope.

<title>Spatially-resolved transcriptomic profiling along the A/P axis</title>
<p><italic>S. mediterranea</italic> RNA-seq data were generated previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Four 18 mm long <italic>G. sinensis</italic> were dissected into 10 pieces each and immediately placed in pre-chilled RNAlater. Note that <italic>G. sinensis</italic> pharynges were not intentionally removed by sodium azide treatment prior to amputation, but were spontaneously ejected during amputation. Once all pieces were collected, the RNAlater was replaced with 1 ml of Trizol, and the samples were stored at −80°C. After mechanical homogenization with a TissueLyser II (2 minutes at 30 Hz), total RNA was extracted from each of the ten samples using phenol/chloroform extraction, purified with a Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit, and assessed for quality with a Bioanalyzer. mRNA was then enriched through poly-DT pull-down. Libraries were prepared using a NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced as 100 bp paired-end reads on a NovaSeq 6000 with a 200-cycle S4 Reagent Kit. Sequencing reads (both our new <italic>G. sinensis</italic> data and the previously-reported <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> data) were converted to fastq format using bcl2fastq2, quality controlled using FastQC, trimmed using TrimGalore, quality controlled again using FastQC and mapped to the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> or <italic>G. sinensis</italic> transcriptome using Trinity script align_and_estimate_abundance.pl with aln_method=bowtie2 and est_method=RSEM.</p>
<p>The distribution of the log-transformed expression data is well represented by the superposition of two Gaussians (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4A-B</xref>). We associate the Gaussian with the lower mean with noise and the Gaussian with the higher mean with a biologically meaningful signal. This allows us to define a threshold (2 for <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and 0.6 for <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, solid black lines). We only consider genes, for which the expression is above the threshold in 3 consecutive worm slices. Furthermore, we restrict our analysis to genes, which show a large expression change in comparison to the fluctuation between adjacent slices. For this, we compute the mean expression over a sliding window of 3 data points and determine the standard deviation relative to this smoothed curve. The difference between lowest and largest expression value generally increases for genes with increasing standard deviation (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4C-D</xref>). This allows us to define a threshold to exclude genes with small overall change relative to the fluctuations (we choose the difference between maximum and minimum value to be at least 5x larger than the standard deviation about the smoothed trend, solid black line). Next we perform complete hierarchical clustering based on the correlation distance. We determine a cut-off from the behaviour of cluster numbers (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 4E-F</xref>). For small cut-off values, there are only very few non-trivial clusters, which combine only the most highly correlated genes. With increasing cut-off, there are more clusters and the clusters are also growing in size. Yet, there is a maximum, after which the cluster number decreases again and eventually all genes are combined into one giant cluster. We observe a small plateau / inflection point at 13 clusters for <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> and 17 clusters for <italic>G. sinensis</italic>, respectively (solid black lines), for which the cluster number is stable for a larger range in the cut-off value, before it rapidly decreases again. We assume that this provides a set of meaningful clusters, which we sort based on the position of the maximum expression value (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-E</xref>).</p>

<title>Identification and amplification of planarian orthologous genes</title>
<p><italic>G. sinensis</italic> orthologues of <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> genes were identified as follows. First, a deposited <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> cDNA sequence corresponding to a gene of interest was downloaded from Genbank, imported into the Geneious software and queried against the reference <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> transcriptome assembly to identify the full-length cDNA sequence. Second, the longest open reading frame (ORF) was identified and translated to get an amino acid sequence that could be used as input for blastp. Third, the translation was queried against our new <italic>G. sinensis</italic> transcriptome assembly to identify potential <italic>G. sinensis</italic> orthologues ranked according to degree of pairwise identity. Fourth, the top hit was verified as a bona fide <italic>G. sinensis</italic> orthologue of the desired <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> gene by reciprocal BLAST to the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> transcriptome. All orthologues are listed in Supp. Table 1.</p>
<p>Species-specific cDNA libraries were synthesised from total RNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System exactly according to manufacturer’s instructions. Target sequences were amplified from cDNA using Phusion DNA polymerase and primers listed in Supp. Table 2. Most amplified sequences were inserted by ligation-independent cloning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> into the pPRT4P<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> vector. <italic>S. mediterranea β-catenin-1</italic> and <italic>ef1a</italic> were alternatively cloned into the paff8cT4P vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> or pHAT2-T4P vector for protein expression. For certain genes, we bypassed cloning by adding universal overhangs during cDNA amplification, followed by a second round of PCR to introduce the T7 primer sites necessary for downstream in vitro transcription. In all cases, the desired target’s successful amplification was confirmed through Sanger DNA sequencing, either of the final plasmid when cloning was performed or the in vitro transcription template when cloning was not performed.</p>

<p>All steps of antibody production were carried out as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.

BALB/c mice were immunised with each antigen separately, and those with sera that detected the target planarian protein by Western blotting were sacrificed; their splenocytes were then used to create clonal hybridoma cell lines. Clone supernatants were initially screened using the Meso Scale Discovery platform, and promising candidates were further evaluated by Western blotting. Positive clones were expanded, and the antibodies were purified from the supernatant, acid-eluted, and buffer-exchanged into PBS.

<p>Animals were fixed and stored for several days to weeks at −80°C in a custom zinc-based fixative (100 mM ZnCl₂ in 100% ethanol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, until ready for protein isolation. For analyses of β-catenin-1 abundance along the A/P axis, animals were transferred to a Peltier-cooled surface set at 4°C and then cut into six equal-length sections using a stab knife. The sections were pooled into six different 1.5 ml tubes according to their A/P position. Residual zinc fixative was removed from whole worms or tissue sections, and 120 µl of urea-based lysis buffer (9 M urea, 100 mM NaH₂PO₄, 10 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 130 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl₂, pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.01 volume of Benzonase and 0.01 volume of protease inhibitor cocktail was added. Samples were left at room temperature for 20 minutes to allow the lysis buffer to fully permeate the tissue, then homogenised using a pellet mixer until no tissue was visible, and left at room temperature for an additional 20 minutes to ensure complete homogenization. For samples with a relatively large tissue volume, extra lysis buffer was added after mechanical homogenization to maintain an adequate lysis buffer-to-tissue ratio. Samples were then centrifuged at maximum speed (21,000 rcf) for 10 minutes at room temperature to pellet any insoluble matter, and supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. A 2 µl aliquot from each sample was diluted 1:10 in autoclaved water and measured using a Nanodrop with the Protein A280 function, using a 1:10 dilution of the lysis buffer as a blank. Samples were then supplemented with homemade 5x lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS; 530 mM Tris-HCl, 700 mM Tris Base, 10% w/v LDS, 50% w/v Glycerol, 2.55 mM EDTA, 500 mM DTT, 0.110 mM SERVA Blue G250, 0.875 mM Phenol Red, pH 8.5) sample buffer to reach a final concentration of 1x, followed by vortexing, aliquoting, and storage at −80°C.</p>
<p>Before loading onto the gel, samples were thawed, vortexed, heated to 70°C for 10 minutes, vortexed again, and spun down using a benchtop centrifuge. The samples were then run on 10-, 12-, 15-, or 17-well NuPage 4-12% Bis-Tris gels using XCell SureLock MiniCell devices set to a constant voltage of 120V and a homemade MOPS-based running buffer (50 mM MOPS, 50 mM Tris Base, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM NaHSO₃, pH 7.7). Following gel electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the XCell II Blot module at a constant 30V with a pre-chilled, homemade NuPage transfer buffer (25 mM Bicine, 25 mM Bis-Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05 mM chlorobutanol, 0.01% SDS, pH 7.2). When a large number of samples needed to be analysed on a single membrane (e.g., for gradient scaling experiments), the gels were cut with a scalpel after SDS-PAGE to isolate the regions where β-catenin-1 and EF1A bands were located. Four gel pieces containing β-catenin-1 or EF1A were then transferred together onto one membrane, allowing more samples to be compared on a single blot than would be possible without cutting (such as on a 17-well gel). After transfer, the membranes were dried at 37°C for 30 minutes and, if necessary, cut into sections for probing with different antibodies from the same species.</p>
<p>Membranes were blocked in blocking solution (5% w/v soy protein isolate in PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature with agitation. The detection procedure was carried out twice: first for β-catenin-1 and then for EF1A, since both primary antibodies were raised in mice. Membranes were incubated in β-catenin-1 primary antibody solution (0.2 µg/ml anti-β-catenin-1 in 0.5% soy protein isolate) overnight at 4°C with agitation, followed by three rinses with PBS and three washes for 10 minutes each with PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Membranes were then incubated in a secondary antibody solution (IRDye 800CW or CF770, diluted 1:20000 in 5% soy protein isolate) in the dark at room temperature with agitation. After three rinses with PBS, three 10-minute washes with PBST, and a final 15-minute wash with PBS, membranes were dried at 37°C for 20 minutes. Dried blots were imaged using an Odyssey Sa or Typhoon imager. Subsequently, membranes were rehydrated in PBS and incubated overnight in the EF1A primary antibody solution (0.03 µg/ml anti-EF1A in 0.5% soy protein isolate), and the remaining steps were repeated as done for β-catenin-1. Background-subtracted signal intensities were measured using Image Studio Lite or ImageQuant TL software, and the values were imported into an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. The β-catenin-1 signal was normalised first to its respective EF1A signal to adjust for variations in protein loading, and then normalised again to one reference sample (as indicated in the figure legends) to facilitate data plotting.</p>

<title>RNA interference</title>
<p>The general strategy for inducing RNAi involved feeding planaria liver paste mixed with in vitro-synthesised double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) complementary to the target endogenous mRNA, largely as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. dsDNA templates containing flanking T7 promoter sites, necessary for in vitro transcription, were generated by PCR from target sequences cloned into the pPRT4P vector. In vitro transcription was carried out in 200 µl reactions consisting of 8 µg of column-purified DNA template, 1x transcription buffer (0.4 M Tris pH 8.0, 0.1 M MgCl₂, 0.002 M spermidine, 0.1 M DTT), 1.5 mM Tris-buffered NTPs, 200 units of RiboLock RNase inhibitor, 0.3 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 170 units of T7 polymerase, and autoclaved water, incubated at 37°C overnight. The resulting dsRNA was annealed by heating at 95°C for 3 minutes and slowly cooling to room temperature using a ThermoShaker. It was then precipitated by mixing 1:1 with a precipitation solution (2.5 mM NaCl, 20% polyethylene glycol, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and centrifuged at 21,000 rcf at 4°C for more than 30 minutes. The pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol, briefly air-dried, and resuspended in autoclaved water. The concentration of dsRNA was determined using a Nanodrop (with a custom conversion factor of 45), and its quality (verified by the presence of a single band at the expected size) was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. To prepare RNAi food, 12-16 µg/µl dsRNA solutions were mixed 1:4 with liver paste to achieve a final working concentration of 3-4 µg dsRNA/µl of total food volume. This mixture was aliquoted and stored at −80°C. RNAi was induced by feeding the planaria six times over a 16-day period, followed by a 7-day starvation period.</p>

<title>In situ hybridisation (ISH)</title>
<p>Sample preparation was carried out largely as previously detailed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> with several modifications. Intact and regenerating specimens were euthanized in 5% NAC (10% for fully-regenerated pieces from 18 mm <italic>G. sinensis</italic>) diluted in 1x PBS (supplemented with 0.1% MgCl₂ and 0.1% Tween-20 for <italic>G. sinensis</italic>), fixed in 4% PFA for 30 minutes (60 minutes for <italic>G. sinensis</italic>), and washed in 1x PBS with 0.3% (v/v) Triton-X-100 (PBSTx). Fully regenerated pieces from 18 mm <italic>G. sinensis</italic> were further treated with a “reduction solution” (1% NP-40, 1% SDS, 50 mM DTT, 1x PBS, brought to volume with autoclaved H₂O) at 37°C for 10 minutes. Samples were dehydrated in 50% (v/v) MeOH/PBSTx, followed by 100% MeOH, and stored at −20°C until FISH.</p>
<p>Riboprobe synthesis was also largely performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. dsDNA templates containing a single flanking T7 promoter were generated by PCR from cloned or amplified planarian sequences. In vitro transcription was performed using 20 µl reactions containing &gt;1 µg of column-purified DNA template, 1x transcription buffer, 1x DIG RNA labelling mix, 40 units of RiboLock RNase inhibitors, 0.03 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 40 units of T7 polymerase, and nuclease-free water, incubated at 37°C overnight. Following transcription, 1 µl of RNase-free DNase was added to remove template DNA by incubation at 37°C. Single-stranded RNA was precipitated by adding 0.75 volume of chilled 7.5 M ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol, vortexed briefly, incubated at −80°C for over 30 minutes, and centrifuged at 21,000 rcf at 4°C for over 30 minutes. The samples were washed twice with 70% ethanol, air-dried briefly, and resuspended in 100 µl of deionized formamide.</p>
<p>The ISH proper was also largely performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Samples were transferred to 12-well plates, rehydrated in 50% MeOH/PBSTx, then PBSTx, and equilibrated in 1x saline-sodium citrate (SSC). Bleaching was done using a bleaching solution (5% non-deionized formamide, 1.2% H₂O₂, 0.5X SSC, autoclaved water to volume) on a light box for 2 hours, followed by PBSTx washes. Samples were treated with 2 µg/ml Proteinase K in 0.1% SDS for 10 minutes, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 10 minutes, washed in PBSTx, and equilibrated in “PreHyb” solution (50% formamide, 5X SSC, 1X Denhardt’s Solution, 100 µg/µl heparin, 1% Tween-20, 1 mg/ml torula yeast RNA, 50 mM DTT) for 2 hours at 56°C. Hybridization was carried out by incubating samples overnight (&gt;12 hours) at 56°C in “riboprobe mix” (riboprobes diluted 1:3000-1:5000 in “Hyb” solution: 50% formamide, 5X SSC, 1X Denhardt’s Solution, 100 µg/µl heparin, 1% Tween-20, 0.25 mg/ml torula yeast RNA, 50 mM DTT, 5% w/v dextran sulfate) within a humidified hybridization oven. To prevent evaporation-associated artifacts, water was added to empty wells and the space between wells and the plate was double-sealed prior to overnight incubation. Post-hybridization, samples were washed twice for 20 minutes with “Wash Hyb” (50% formamide, 0.5% Tween-20, 5X SSC, 1x Denhardt’s), twice for 20 minutes with 0.5X Wash Hyb + 1X SSC, three times for 20 minutes with 2x SSC, and three times for 20 minutes with 0.2x SSC, all at 56°C. After cooling to room temperature, samples were washed three times for 5 minutes with PBSTx and incubated in a blocking solution (5% sterile horse serum + 0.5% Roche Western Blocking Reagent in PBSTx) for 1 hour at room temperature. Next, samples were incubated overnight at 4°C in an antibody solution (1:2000 anti-DIG-POD diluted in blocking solution).</p>
<p>For fluorescent detection (all targets except <italic>G. sinensis sfrp1</italic>), samples were washed 6x 20 min with PBSTx, then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in TSA buffer (2M NaCl, 0.1M Boric acid pH 8.5) with 0.006% H₂O₂, 1:3000 Sulfo-Cyanine 3 tyramide, and 20 µg/ml 4-IPBA peroxidase enhancer (in the dark). From this point on, samples were exposed to minimal light to preserve fluorescent signals. They were washed in PBSTx twice for 5 minutes at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4°C in 1:2000 DAPI diluted in PBSTx, post-fixed for 20 minutes in 4% PFA/PBSTx at room temperature, washed twice for 5 minutes, and cleared in Scale S4 (10% glycerol, 15% DMSO, 40% sorbitol, 4M urea, 0.1% Triton X-100)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. For colorimetric detection (<italic>G. sinensis sfrp1</italic>), samples were washed 6x 20 min with TNTx, then incubated in “AP” solution (0.1M Tris pH 9.5, 0.1M NaCl, 0.05M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Tween-20) for 10 min, AP supplemented with 0.27% NBT (Roche) and 0.53% BCIP (Roche) substrates for 10 min and “DEV” solution (0.1M Tris pH 9.5, 0.1M NaCl, 0.05M MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% Tween-20, 7.8% PVA, 0.27% NBT, 0.53% BCIP) for at least 30 min in the dark, until the expected expression pattern was unambiguous. Samples were washed in PBSTx 2x 5 min at RT then overnight at 4°C, post-fixed for 45 min in 4% PFA/PBSTx at RT, washed 2x 5 min at RT and cleared in “Scale A2” (2M Urea, 75% glycerol)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.

<title>Pharmacology</title>
<p>Commercially available C59 was diluted to 10 mM in DMSO and stored in single-use aliquots at −80°C. Experimental drug solutions were prepared by mixing C59 stock (to achieve final concentrations of 0.4, 2, 10, or 50 µM as indicated in the figure legends) with supplemental DMSO (to a final concentration of 0.5% in <italic>G. sinensis</italic> experiments and 0.75% in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> experiments) in planarian water, followed by vortexing at maximum speed for 30 seconds. For cWnt gradient perturbations, uninjured animals were maintained in the drug solution for 7-14 days (as specified in the figure legends), with daily exchanges of the solution. After the treatment period, the animals were transferred to a plastic container holding 1.1 litres of planarian water, which was continuously agitated by an aquarium air pump to facilitate the removal of C59 from the tissue. For post-amputation cWnt perturbations, freshly cut pieces were exposed to the drug solution for 48 hours (with a solution exchange after 24 hours) before being moved to fresh petri dishes with planarian water to wash out C59 from the tissue. In all experiments, vehicle-only control cohorts were maintained in planarian water supplemented with 0.5% (<italic>G. sinensis</italic>) or 0.75% (<italic>S. mediterranea</italic>) DMSO and otherwise treated identically to C59-treated ones.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry</title>
<p>Pools of intact or regenerating <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> or <italic>G. sinensis</italic> were transferred to pre-weighed 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, rinsed once with planarian water, aspirated to remove excess liquid, and stored at −80°C. Samples were then dried for 1 hour at 37°C in a vacuum concentrator and reweighed. Homogenization involved adding 300 µl of mass spectrometry-grade MeOH containing 2 µM LGK-974 (used as an internal control to account for technical variability) and three 2.3 mm stainless steel beads to each sample. The samples were mechanically disrupted for 5 minutes at 30 Hz using a TissueLyser II. After homogenization, samples were centrifuged at 21,000 rcf and room temperature for 5 minutes, and the supernatants were purified using MicroSpin C18 columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples, hereafter referred to as “worm extracts”, were stored at −20°C until mass spectrometry analysis.</p>
<p>Immediately prior to mass spectrometric analysis, 5 µl of each worm extract was diluted 1:10 with spray mix (7.5 mM ammonium formate in a 4:2:1 v/v/v mixture of isopropanol:MeOH:chloroform) in wells of a skirted twin.tec PCR plate, in triplicate. To enable absolute quantification, five “standards”, generated by serially diluting pure C59 in untreated worm extract to a final concentration of 2560/5120/10240/20480/40960 nM, were also diluted 1:10 with spray mix and included on the plate in triplicate. Samples were introduced into a Q Exactive hybrid quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer via TriVersa NanoMate automated ion source equipped with microfluidics ESI Chip. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed in positive mode under the following instrumental settings: running time 2.5 min/sample, capillary temperature 200°C, resolution <italic>R<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>/<italic>z</italic>=200</sub> 140000, scan range m/z 200-500; lock mass 445.12003 and 338.34174. To confirm the identity of C59 and LGK-974 signals in worm extracts, MS2 was performed for the corresponding precursors with m/z 397.177 and 380.176 using mass isolation window of 3Da and normalised collision energy (NCE) 25 and 45 respectively and the spectra compared with fragmentation pattern of the commercial C59 standard. Raw data were first processed with PeakStrainer software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> to remove noise signals. To obtain the signal intensities for precursors of analytes of interest, C59 and LGK-974, the resulting files in *.mzXML format were processed by LipidXplorer software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Relative C59 tissue abundance was calculated as follows. First, C59 signal intensity was normalised to the LGK-974 signal intensity to correct for technical variability. Second, linear regression analysis was applied to the LGK-normalised C59 signals of the five standard samples to create an equation for determining the unknown absolute amount of C59 in each experimental sample. Third, the concentration of C59 in the tissue was calculated by dividing the total C59 amount by the dry weight of the sample, which was determined by subtracting the initial weight of the empty tube from the weight of the tube containing the dried tissue sample. Fourth, the concentration of each sample was normalised to a single sample from within the same experiment (the 0 days washout sample in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I-J</xref> and the Pre 1 dpa sample in <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3C</xref>) and converted to % to facilitate graphical representation.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study investigates the different mechanisms that provide instructions for a missing body part to regenerate its appropriate identity. The authors use two species of planarians to identify a key role for bodywide canonical Wnt gradients in controlling the outcome of regeneration. The study provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for variable regeneration efficiency among planarian species that will be of interest to developmental biologists interested in regeneration.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript entitled 'A comparative analysis of planarian regeneration specificity reveals tissue polarity contributions of the axial cWnt signalling gradient.' Cleland et al. study the robustness of regenerating a head or a tail in the proper position in two different planarian species (S. mediterranea and G. sinensis). The authors find that the expression of notum, a Wnt inhibitor that is triggered after any cut, shows different dynamics of expression in both planarian species, being more symmetrical in the species that display a higher number of double-headed or Janus heads (G. sinenesis), which they refer to a less robust regeneration. The authors claim that the reduced robustness of G. sinensis regeneration is partially explained by this anterior-posterior symmetric expression of notum, since in S. mediterranea, which shows a 'robust regeneration' it appears asymmetric. So, the first claim of the manuscript is that the symmetry in notum expression could underlie the poor robustness of regenerating a head/tail in small bipolar regenerating planarian fragments.</p>
<p>Then, they analyse the role of a proposed tail-to-head cWnt signalling gradient during the regeneration of heads and tails in the same planarian species. To do so they develop an antibody that allows the quantification of b-catenin activity along the AP axis, together with a pharmacological approach that reduces the pre-existent cWnt gradient without affecting the wound-induced. Through this strategy the authors can demonstrate the slope of the b-catenin activity, which is a very nice result, and that it changes according to the size of the animal. Furthermore, they are able to demonstrate that by reducing the cWnt signalling in the pre-existent tissue, there is an increase in the number of double-headed regenerates (Janus heads) and that it depends on the body size and on the decreasing steepness of the cWnt gradient. This result relies on G. sinensis species since the drug is not so effective in S. mediterranea. Thus, the authors' second claim is that the slope of the cWnt gradient may contribute to head-tail regeneration specificity in planarians.</p>
<p>To conclude, it is proposed that regeneration of the correct identity in each wound depends on multiple cues acting in parallel and that their species-specificity provides variations in the regenerative capability of the different planarian species.</p>
<p>The study has great potential to have a high impact on the regeneration community, since the opportunity to compare mechanisms between close species provides the framework for understanding the essential mechanism of regeneration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The project has several strengths. The authors are able to reproduce the Janus heads phenotypes described by Morgan TH by analysing different planarian species. This is of great importance in the planarian field, because with the current model species, S. mediterranea, this could not be reproduced. So, these results demonstrate that small planarian fragments do make errors during regeneration, giving rise to double-headed animals, which supports the well-known hypothesis that it exists an anteroposterior gradient underlying anteroposterior identity during regeneration. However, and importantly, it does not occur in all planarian species. So, there are differences between planarian species in the robustness of regeneration and may be in the mechanisms that drive this regeneration. The finding of different behaviours and gene expressions in different planarian species is very interesting and promising in the field of regeneration.</p>
<p>A second strength of the study is the demonstration of the b-catenin1 slope in planarians and how it changes with the animal size, and also the establishment of a method to decrease it in the pre-existent tissue but not in the wound. This strategy allows us to examine specifically the role of the pre-existent cWnt signal, demonstrating that it does have a role in the decision of making head or tail during regeneration, which was an essential question in the field of planarians and animal regeneration.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The finding that notum, which is the main head determinant identified in planarians, has a different dynamic in both planarian species is very suggestive. However, the different dynamics of notum expression during regeneration, which is the basis of the subsequent rationale, is not properly demonstrated, nor is its correlation with the robustness in regenerating a proper head/tail identity. Main concerns regarding this point:</p>
<p>a) The authors observe that 'In regenerating S. mediterranea 2 mm trunk pieces cut from 6 mm animals, notum expression was induced predominantly at anterior-facing wounds as early as 6 h post-amputation (Figure 2A), as previously reported (Petersen and Reddien 2011)'. However, in the graphics in Figures 2B and C, the expression of notum at 6h is shown as symmetric. It definitely does not agree with the in situ, with the text, or with the published data. How was it measured? It should be corrected and explained since it is the basis of the subsequent rationale.</p>
<p>b) Then, when measuring notum in G. sinensis the authors conclude: 'Strikingly and in sharp contrast to S. mediterranea, the number of notum expressing cells was nearly identical between anterior and posterior wounds without any discernible A/P asymmetry at any of the examined time points (Figures 2E-F)'. However, in the in situ results of 12 h regenerating G. sinensis, there is a clear difference in notum expression between anterior and posterior wounds. Is it not representative of the image? Again, how exactly the measurements were performed? Are dots or pixels quantified? It is not explained in the text. This is a crucial result that has to be consistent.</p>
<p>c) A more general weakness of this part of the manuscript is that even if the authors demonstrate that in G. sinensis the expression of notum is symmetrical in contrast to S. mediterranea, this is just an observation of 1 species that has symmetrical notum and regenerates less robustly than 1 species that has asymmetrical expression and regenerates more robustly. If they for instance look at the expression of wnt1, maybe they also see differences between both species that could be linked to their different regeneration properties (related to this, see below the comment on wnt1 expression). That is to say, comparing 1 to 1 species cannot give any cause-effect evidence.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the authors rely on the fact that notum inhibition rescues the wild-type phenotype to conclude that is the symmetric expression of notum that underlies the appearance of Janus heads. This is what can be read in the results: 'Significantly, the rescue of wild-type regenerates by notum(RNAi) suggests that the symmetric G. sinensis notum expression contributes to the formation of double-heads and thus to reduced regeneration specificity'; and in the Summary: We found that the reduced regeneration robustness of G. sinensis was partially explained by wound site-symmetric expression of the head determinant notum, which is highly anterior-specific in S. mediterranea.' However, notum RNAi decreases notum in both wounds, so it does not produce an asymmetric expression (at least this is not shown). So, it does not link the symmetry or asymmetry of notum with the appearance of Janus heads.</p>
<p>d) If the authors want to maintain the claim that the symmetry of notum is one of the reasons that explain the increase in Janus head phenotype in G. sinensis, there are several possibilities to test it. For instance:</p>
<p>i) Analyse notum expression in different planarian species and relate its symmetry or asymmetry with the appearance of Janus heads. If the claim is true, the species that are more robust should show more asymmetric expression of notum. This would sustain strongly the first claim, and would really be a breakthrough in the field of regeneration.</p>
<p>ii) Another possibility is a more in-depth analysis of notum expression in the species of the study. If the authors show that larger fragments show fewer Janus heads, and also that it depends on the anteroposterior level of the fragments, they could try to relate the rate of Janus heads with the degree of asymmetry in notum expression in both wounds. For instance, they could analyze notum expression in bipolar regenerating fragments along the anteroposterior axis in both species; it should be more symmetric in G sinenesis, in all fragments, according to Figure 2 L. Or they could analyze notum expression in bipolar regenerating fragments of different sizes, mainly in 1 or 2 mm fragments of big planarians, since they are the fragments analyzed that form or not the Janus heads. In G sinensis the expression of notum should be more symmetrical than in S. mediterranea in these fragments.</p>
<p>iii) The authors could design an experiment to demonstrate that the symmetry in the expression of notum affects the rate of Janus heads. The experiment that the authors show is the rescue of the Janus heads in G. sinensis after notum RNAi. However, notum RNAi suppresses notum in both wounds, thus not making them asymmetric. Furthermore, the rescue could be explained by the posteriorizing effect that notum RNAi has in planarians, as reported by several authors. A possibility could be to inhibit APC, which increases notum expression in S. mediterranea (Petersen and Reddien 2011). If APC RNAi in G. sinenesis produces an increase in notum in both wounds and the rate of Janus heads is not rescued, then it would support the hypothesis that notum symmetry is the cause of the Janus heads. However, if it produces an increase of notum in an asymmetric manner, then the Janus phenotype should be rescued.</p>
<p>(2) The second weakness of the study is related to the methodology used to support the second claim, that the slope of bcatenin1 activity has a role in the decision of regeneration - a head and a tail in the correct tip. The main concerns relate to the specificity of the anti-bcatenin1 antibody and to the broad effect of C59 in the secretion of all Wnts.</p>
<p>a) Raising an antibody against beta-catenin1 that allows the quantification by western blot is a strength of the study, since beta-catenin1 is the key element of the cWnt pathway, and their levels are directly associated with the activation of the pathway. Since this is one of the tools that support the second claim of the study, a characterization of the antibody and additional tests to prove its specificity are required. The authors show a Western blot in which the band intensity decreases after beta-catenin1 inhibition in both species. Further analysis should be shown:</p>
<p>
i) Demonstration that the intensity of the band increases after APC or Axin inhibition.</p>
<p>
ii) Does the antibody work in immunohistochemistry? It would provide further evidence of the specificity of a nuclear signal could be demonstrated.</p>
<p>
iii) Explanation and discussion of the protocol used to analyse the levels of b-catenin1 activity along the anteroposterior axis is required. It has been reported that beta-catenin1 is highly expressed and required in the brain in planarians, and also in the pharynx, and in the sexual organs (Hill and Petersen 2015, Sureda-Gomez et al 2016). How is it then explained the anterior-to-posterior gradient of expression of beta-catenin1 seen in this study in both species? Has the pharynx been removed before the protein extraction? What about the beta-catenin1 activity demonstrated in the brain? Why is it not reflected in the western blot analysis using the antibody? This point should be clarified.</p>
<p>b) The second tool used in the second part of the manuscript is the drug C59, which inhibits Porcupine, a protein required for palmitoylation and secretion of Wnts. Because Porcupine could be required for the secretion of all Wnts, the phenotype obtained with the drug could be the sum of the inhibition of cWNT signal (wnt1 for instances) and non-canonical WNT (as wnt5). This is in fact the phenotype resulting after the inhibition of Wntless in planarians (Adell et al. 2009), which is also required for the secretion of Wnts. Thus, in the phenotypes resulting from C59 treatment the analysis of the nervous system and posterior/anterior markers is required. Looking at the in vivo phenotype it appears that in fact the drug is affecting both canonical and no canonical pathways since the animal with protrusions in the lateral part (Figure 4B-double head, or Supplementary Figure 3A) is very similar to the one reported after Wntless inhibition. In case the phenotypes observed also show non-canonical Wnt inhibition, this should be clearly shown and discussed.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned weaknesses are the most important concerns about the present manuscript. However, there are other concerns related to a further analysis of the phenotypes and the analysis of additional Wnt elements as wnt1, which are essential to complete the study and are directly discussed with the authors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study identifies a key role for bodywide canonical Wnt gradients in controlling the outcome of regeneration within planarians, likely acting in parallel to injury-induced cues that also use tissue asymmetry to control this process. In S. Mediterranea a central part of this decision process is the asymmetric expression of the Wnt inhibitor notum specifically at injury sites facing in the anterior direction to promote head formation and inhibit tail formation through regulation of canonical Wnt signaling pathways. Leveraging classic studies by T.H. Morgan over a century ago, which found that amputated thin transverse fragments occasionally incorrectly regenerate 2 heads rather than a head and a tail in a species of Girardia planarians, this study identifies a closely related species G. Sinensis which undergoes errors to regeneration specificity under similar challenges. Morgan had proposed that his results might arise from the use of a &quot;gradient of materials&quot; providing axis information across the body axis such that small tissue fragments are too narrow to interpret gradient differences, leading to head/tail polarity defects in regeneration. The authors show very convincingly that this species of planaria undergoes notum expression after injury, but unlike in S. Mediterranea, this occurs symmetrically at the onset of regeneration. Using RNAi, they show notum participates in the regeneration of mispolarized heads (though interestingly apparently not in normal head regeneration unlike in Smeds, at least under these conditions). G. Sinensis planarians, like many organisms, have abundant expression of Wnt genes posteriorly. To test whether this gradient of Wnts may participate in the regeneration distinct from any Wnt signals activated after injury, the authors use chemical inhibition to reduce Wnt signaling prior to injury and then alleviate inhibition following injury by removal of the drug and confirming successful washout of the drug using mass spec. They also raise a new antibody that can detect beta-catenin-1 in this species in order to monitor the body-wide cWnt gradient after these treatments, and correlate this with outcomes on the head/tail regeneration decision. Using this approach, they find that homeostatic inhibition of porcupine (required for Wnt secretion) could dampen the cWnt/beta-catenin gradient and increase the incidence of inappropriate head regeneration at posterior-facing wounds. In addition, they find that the cWnt gradient is less steep in larger animals that also concurrently have a higher incidence of mistakes in regeneration specificity. Together, the paper presents compelling experiments and analysis to support the conclusion that cWnt gradients are an important determinant of head/tail identity determination decisions in G. Sinensis, and thereby proposes a plausible model that the notum asymmetry present in S. Mediterranea could act in parallel to support the higher regeneration robustness observed in that species.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a great paper, an instant classic. It addresses an enduring problem that Morgan and others initiated more than a century ago and brings a new synthesis of ideas to clarify an important mechanism. I also like the term &quot;regeneration specificity&quot; which can provide a nice unification and generalization of ideas that other authors have variously described as regeneration patterning or regeneration polarity. The work is a tour de force that creatively builds new tools and observations to leverage a new model of planarian species for unraveling general mechanisms of regeneration decision-making. The experiments are rigorously conducted and I find the overall data to be quite compelling. I have some comments for the authors to consider below for drawing out the interpretation and also clarifying the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The G. Sinesis species showed accurate head/tail specificity in 2mm thick fragments but was strongly impaired at 1 mm thick. I am assuming that outcomes of pieces greater than 2mm would make similarly robust head/tail choices, implying a rather sharp transition occurring between 1 and 2 mm. In that case, in the gradient model, are there theoretical reasons to predict that polarity outcomes would decline sharply rather than gradually as size thickness decreases? I think the muscle fibers themselves are thought to have lengths on the order of 200 microns, so I wonder what could account for the characteristic length of less than 1mm here? From the lab's prior analysis of beta-cat gradient, is this perhaps the minimal length where a difference in bcat protein levels can be detected? This is not essential to resolve in this draft (in my view), just a very interesting question arising from the present study. Relatedly, it seems that the slope of cWnt at the wound site itself might not be enough information for polarity because at a highly granular level, this should be identical at posterior-facing wounds from trunk fragments versus thin transverse fragments obtained at the same AP position, yet trunk fragments succeed at regeneration specificity whereas thin transverse fragments fail.</p>
<p>(2) The paper nicely shows strong evidence that notum expression is definitely symmetric at the first occurrence of its expression by 6 hours in D. Sinensis, and this is a really important result of the paper. At 12 hours, it does look to me in the FISH experiments that there is more persistence of expression at the anterior-facing wound versus the posterior-facing wounds (Fig 2D), although the methods for quantification in Fig2E/F do not show a difference in expression at the two wound sites at this time point. Could this difference arise from differences in the perdurance or timing of early wound-induced signaling at the two wound sites that was perhaps too subtle to detect in the quantification methods used? Or perhaps these images do not represent the population? On a related note, the quantification method seems to fail to show that in 6h Smeds, notum expression is indeed asymmetric. Probably the issue here is not the data in the FISH images themselves which strongly support the author's interpretations, but rather a deficiency or limitation of the quantification method used, which should be resolved so that the conclusions from the single FISH images can be interpreted robustly. For example, some authors have used a method of counting notum+ cells and I wonder if this could provide better quantitative information here.</p>
<p>(3) Given that the double-headed phenotype is observed from thin transverse fragments, ideally, the symmetry of notum could be established to occur in those types of fragments as well. This experiment would clarify that notum is expressed at posterior-facing wounds in the very same types of fragments that undergo the highest levels of mistakes in regeneration specificity.</p>
<p>(4) Is wnt1 expressed symmetrically at wound sites in this species? It seems there are cases like acoels where wound-induced Wnt activation can occur asymmetrically but through preferential expression of Wnts at posterior-facing wounds, rather than notum. It would be interesting to know although I also think the work the authors already have done in this study itself already constitutes a very comprehensive advance and could be the subject of future work.</p>
<p>(5) I agree that notum is relatively much more strongly expressed at the far posterior region in D. Senesis than in Smeds, but it does seem from the RNAseq data it also has some locally enriched expression at the anterior pole. Because the RNAseq analysis involves scaling expression across the regions for each gene, it is difficult to know if the anterior expression is relatively lower or perhaps even about the same level of expression as the anterior pole expression of this gene in Smeds. Though not essential to make the desired arguments, in situs on notum in the intact animals would be helpful to clarify this. Relatedly it would be fascinating to know whether D. Senesis notum undergoes anterior-pole expression around the 72 hour or similar timepoint as in Smeds.</p>
<p>(6) The assessment of beta-catenin gradients was done through protein extractions from whole tissue fragments. However, it has been shown in other planarian species that beta-catenin can have strong tissue-specific expression in, for example, the pharynx, brain, and reproductive systems. Some supporting evidence or argument should be presented to clarify the interpretation that the graded expression observed by western blotting cannot be fully explained by this kind of tissue-specific expression of beta-catenin rather than representing a true signaling gradient as interpreted by the authors. For example, if this antibody could be used in immunostaining, this could support the beta-catenin signaling gradient. Alternatively, information about the location of the pharynx or any other posterior reproductive tissues in D. Sinensis could be calibrated with respect to the fragment bins used for the gradient--perhaps a portion of the C59-dependent body-wide gradient measured here occurs fully within tail tissue that lacks other regionalized tissue that could be a potential additional source of beta-catenin. Further discussion and interpretation, or additional experiments, should be included to rule out alternative confounding sources of beta-catenin in order to clarify the interpretation of the western blot as representing a beta-catenin signaling gradient.</p>
<p>(7) I find the analysis in Figure 5 to be quite compelling for showing the importance of cWnt/Bcat gradients in contributing to head/tail determination, and I also think that the author's discussion of the limitations of the approach are well articulated and considered. Based on prior literature, it also seems very likely that there is a third redundantly acting component to regeneration specificity, which is the amplification of small differences in cWnt in a directional-dependent manner early in the regeneration process (24-72 hours in Smeds). This would explain why post-amputation with porcupine inhibitor in D. Sinensis caused 100% penetrant defects in regeneration specificity while the pre-treatment paradigm caused a weaker effect (25-40% for larger animals). In Smeds, it is known already that delivery of dsRNAs against beta-catenin-1, wnt1, and notum only after injury caused polarity defects, and thus all three genes certainly have a function relevant for head/tail after injury (Petersen and Reddien 2008, 2009, 2011- please note these experiments were reported in the text of these studies and not in individual figures). This evidence, combined with extensive FISH and complementary RNAi studies in the field, strongly suggests that some combination of the 6-18h injury-induced phase but also very likely the subsequent &quot;pole-specific phase&quot; of wnt1 expression is likely to be important for driving or enacting the tail fate program and is therefore a component of the regeneration specificity mechanism described here.</p>
<p>(8) Prior work has also demonstrated roles for Wnt genes expressed in gradients to participate in regeneration specificity. In particular, inhibition of the wntP-2/wnt11-5 gene, which is expressed in an animal-wide gradient, strongly enhanced the effects of inhibition of wnt1, which is the earliest wound-activated Wnt gene, to cause 100% penetrant posterior head regeneration phenotypes in S. mediterranea (Petersen and Reddien 2009). These observations are complementary to the present study by implicating Wnts expressed in bodywide gradients in the process of regeneration decision-making. Given that this study also showed that wnt1 is necessary for new wntP-2 expression during the wound-induced early phase and that wnt1 activation does not require beta-catenin for its expression, collectively suggest a more complex process involved in gradient detection and the involvement of wound signals likely beyond only autoregulation of the cWnt gradient or notum asymmetry mechanisms. Although this paper is cited already, framing the present study more fully in context with this and other relevant prior work would be helpful to contextualize the advance for the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors revisit the hypothesis of gradient-based polarity specification during planarian regeneration proposed over a century ago, but here they apply molecular techniques and a valuable comparative approach. By using a comparative analysis with classic and modern planarian model organisms, the authors have identified variable molecular mechanisms that different planarian species utilize to ensure that the proper tissues are regenerated following wounding.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The comparative approach of using 2 different planarian species allowed the study to elucidate different molecular mechanisms that planarians utilize in re-establishing anterior-posterior axis polarity during regeneration. Without this comparative approach, the mystery of T.H. Morgan's data classic studies that demonstrate mistakes in this axis re-polarization would remain unanswered. Furthermore, the use of both a modern molecular model species and another more classical planarian species, which the authors have fully developed with molecular tools and techniques, sheds light on the diversity of genetic processes that closely related species seem to utilize in regeneration. To dissect the role of a long-hypothesized canonical cWnt signaling gradient, the authors developed a novel strategy using chemical genetics to titer this gradient, which led to phenotypes with enhanced aberrant axis polarity re-establishment. Together these experimental approaches establish a well-supported initial model for explaining the molecular mechanisms that different planarian species utilize to allow for proper regeneration of lost tissues.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While pharmacological perturbation of signaling pathways could produce off-target effects, the authors provide well-documented evidence that canonical Wnt signaling is altered with drug treatment. The correlation between altered cWnt signaling gradients and the incidence of double-headed regeneration is strong, but it is not clear that the axial cWnt signaling gradient is the ultimate cause of the modified regeneration polarity. However, the model established here and supported by considerable data provides a useful alternative to the mechanism of notum upregulation that has been well-documented in the Schmidtea mediterranea, the workhouse model in planarian research. Throughout the manuscript, the authors suggest that Girardia sinensis lost the ability to upregulate notum at anterior-facing wounds, but until additional planarian species are evaluated, it remains plausible (and equally parsimonious) that S. mediterranea could have innovated a novel strategy to re-establish axis-polarity through asymmetric notum expression.</p>
<p>The study is very well-designed with considerable confirmation of results, especially in the novel use of the pharmacological inhibitor C59. This study is invaluable in its comparative approach, finding that well-established molecular processes may not explain similar developmental outcomes for different species; this corroborates the need to study additional model organisms and how an evolutionary approach to the study of development is imperative.</p>
