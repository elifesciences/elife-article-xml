<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis (TBM) are frequent and strongly associated with the inflammatory response to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection. However, the mechanisms driving the associations are uncertain. We sought to identify the gene modules, hubs and pathways associated with the pathogenesis and mortality from TBM, and to identify which best-predicted death.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We used whole blood RNA sequencing to obtain transcriptional profiles from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM (207 HIV-negative; 74 HIV-positive), 295 with pulmonary TB (PTB), and 30 healthy controls. The TBM cohort was divided randomly into a discovery cohort (n=142) and a validation cohort (n=139). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified clusters of genes (or ‘modules’) and hub genes associated with death or disease severity. An overrepresentation analysis identified pathways associated with TBM mortality, with a consensus analysis identifying consensual patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. A multivariate elastic-net Cox regression model selected the candidate predictors of TBM mortality, then model prediction performance using logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose best predictors.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Overall, TBM mortality was associated with increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways. Death from TBM was associated with increased angiogenesis in HIV-positive adults, and with activated TNF signaling and down-regulated extracellular matrix organization in HIV-negative adults. PTB and TBM have similar transcriptional profiles compared to healthy controls, although inflammatory genes were more activated in HIV-positive than HIV-negative TBM. The expression of four hub genes – <italic>MCEMP1</italic>, <italic>NELL2</italic>, <italic>ZNF354C</italic> and <italic>CD4</italic> – were strongly predictive of death from TBM (AUC 0.80 and 0.86 for HIV-negative and HIV-positive, respectively).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Whole blood transcriptional profiling revealed that TBM is associated with a characteristic systemic inflammatory response, similar to that invoked by pulmonary tuberculosis, but with key gene modules, hubs and pathways strongly associated with death. Our analysis suggests a novel 4-gene biomarker for predicting death from TBM, but also opens a new window into TBM pathogenesis that may reveal novel therapeutic targets for this lethal disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Of 7.1 million new tuberculosis (TB) cases in 2019, tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is estimated to have developed in 164,000 adults, around 25% of whom were living with HIV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. TBM is the most severe form of TB, causing death or neurological disability in half of all cases. Overall, TBM mortality is around 25%, but rises to around 50% in those with HIV, with most deaths occurring in the first 3 months of treatment<sub>1,2.</sub></p>
<p>The poor outcomes from TBM are strongly associated with the inflammatory response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, with both a paucity and an excess of inflammation linked to death from TBM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. However, the mechanisms behind these observations remain uncertain. Immune responses in TBM are thought to be compartmentalized within the central nervous system. Studies have shown that immune cell counts, cytokine concentrations, metabolites and transcriptional responses differ between the peripheral blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In adults with TBM, leukocyte activation is higher in the CSF than in peripheral blood, although a marked myeloid response in peripheral blood has been reported <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Blood transcriptomic analysis has found increased neutrophil-associated transcripts and inflammasome signaling in those with HIV-associated TBM and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In children with TBM, whole blood transcriptional profiles showed increased inflammasome activation and decreased T-cell activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Taken together, these studies suggest the inflammatory response associated with TBM may have a greater systemic component than originally thought and its characterization may help define the immune mechanisms leading to death and disability.</p>
<p>The accurate and early detection of patients at highest risk of complications and death from TBM may help to target treatment for those most in need. The British Medical Research Council (MRC) grades have been used to categorize TBM severity for almost 80 years <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, and the system strongly predicts TBM mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Previously, we and others developed new prognostic models from studies of 1699 adults with TBM using clinical and laboratory parameters, including MRC grade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These models predicted outcome more accurately than MRC grade alone. However, they might be improved by measures of host inflammatory response. Host-based peripheral blood gene expression analysis has been used to identify active or progressive pulmonary TB and in pulmonary TB treatment monitoring <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, but has yet to be applied to TBM.</p>
<p>In the current study, we investigated whole blood transcriptional profiles in 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 with pulmonary TB (PTB), and 30 healthy controls. Our objective was to use weighted gene co-expression network analysis, an unbiased and well-evaluated approach, to identify the biological pathways and hub genes associated with TBM pathogenesis and assess the predictive value of gene expression for early mortality from TBM.</p>

<title>Characteristics and outcomes of the cohorts</title>
<p>Four cohorts (all ≥18 years) were used in the study, representing a total of 606 participants. The characteristics of these cohorts are provided in <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>. There were 281 adults with TBM; 207 HIV-negative and 74 HIV-positive. In the HIV-negative TBM adults, the median age was 46 years (IQR 34, 58), 127 (61%) were male, and the median Body Mass Index (BMI) was 20.2 (IQR 18.2, 22.3). HIV-positive adults were more likely than HIV-negative adults to be male, younger, have lower BMI, have previously received TB treatment, and to have microbiologically confirmed TBM. Total white cell counts in blood and CSF in HIV-positive adults were lower than in HIV-negative adults. The PTB cohort consisted of 295 adults with the median age of 44 years (IQR 31, 52), 228 (77%) were male, the median of BMI was 19.4 (IQR 17.7, 21.6) and 129 (48%) had pulmonary cavities on chest X-ray. Of the 30 healthy controls, 11 (37%) were male, and the median age was 33 (IQR 29, 37) (<bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The clinical variables associated with three-month mortality of the 281 adults with TBM are given in <bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>. The discovery (n=142) and validation (n=139) cohorts had similar characteristics (<bold><xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold>). 47.5% (133/280) had definite TBM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, with microbiologically confirmed disease, accounting for 45.9% (101/220) of survivors and 52.4% (32/61) of those who died. The overall three-month mortality rate was 21.7% (61/281): 16.4% (34/207) in HIV-negative and 36.5% (27/74) in HIV-positive (p&lt;0.001). We did not observe differences in mortality by sex, age and diagnostic category. Greater disease severity, MRC grades 2 and 3 at enrolment, was associated with increased mortality compared to grade 1 (p&lt;0.001). In those who died, CSF and peripheral blood neutrophil counts were higher and peripheral blood lymphocyte count lower, compared to those who survived.</p>

<title>Whole blood transcriptional profiles of the four cohorts</title>
<p>We analyzed the whole blood transcriptomics, using bulk RNA sequencing from 606 participants in the 4 cohorts.

<p>Enrichment scores from single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), which based on expression rank of genes relevant to pathways, were measured in some pathways already known to be important mediators of TB or TBM pathogenesis (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). As anticipated, inflammatory response, cytokine signaling, interferon signaling, TNF signaling, and inflammasome activation pathways, were enriched in PTB and TBM cohorts as compared to healthy controls. In TBM, enrichment of genes in these pathways were generally higher in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative individuals (<bold>Table S1, Table S5</bold>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Transcriptional gene modules associated with TBM severity and mortality</title>
<p>Transcriptional profiles associated with TBM mortality were generated by identifying differentially expressed genes. Of the top 20,000 genes with most variation, we observed 724 (3.6%) genes that were differentially expressed (FDR &lt;0.05, absolute fold change (FC) &gt;1.5) in all those with TBM (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Table S2</bold>). Next, we applied weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to 5000 most variable genes from 281 TBM samples (n= 207, HIV-negative; n=74, HIV-positive) to define clusters of highly correlated genes (modules) associated with TBM severity and mortality. Gene modules are clusters of genes that have highly interconnected expression, usually related to their biological functions. Hub genes are genes with high connectivity to other genes within a respective module. First, we used WGCNA to construct a network of gene modules in the discovery cohort. Then we validated the presence of these transcriptional modules in the validation cohort, labelling the modules with different colors. In the discovery cohort (n=142), 15 modules were identified overall, consisting of 44 to 1350 genes per module (<bold>Figure S1, Table S6</bold>). All 15 modules were preserved in the validation cohort (n=139) through the preservation analysis (<bold>Figure S2</bold>).</p>

<p>The associations between the 15 modules and TBM severity and mortality are presented in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold> for both the discovery and validation cohorts. Modules were linked to each other in a hierarchical structure, with major biological processes annotated. Associations of the modules with TBM disease severity (MRC grade) at baseline were estimated by Spearman correlations between MRC grade and the first principle component (PC1) of each module. Similarly, associations of the modules with mortality were measured by hazard ratio (HR) per increase 1 unit of PC1 using Cox regression model adjusted for age, HIV status and dexamethasone treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>) in both discovery and validation cohorts.</p>

<p>Of the 15 preserved modules, five modules were significantly associated with mortality in the discovery and validation cohorts, with false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). These five modules were separated into two big module clusters. The first cluster contained the blue module (n=799 genes), involved in inflammatory and innate immune responses, and the cyan module (n=44 genes) with unknown biological function. These modules were upregulated in those who died, as shown in the heat-map in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold> (HR: 3.0 and 2.2 for the blue module, and 2.2 and 1.7 for the cyan module, FDR &lt; 0.05 for all comparisons). The black (n= 207 genes), brown (n=698 genes) and red (n=229 genes) modules were in the second cluster and were generally involved in adaptive immunity including T and B cell signaling pathways. These three modules were down-regulated in those who died (HR: 0.43 and 0.36 for brown, 0.46 and 0.39 for red, 0.59 and 0.49 for black) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>It is known that TBM MRC grade before treatment initiation strongly predicts outcome from TBM. Here, we investigated correlations between each module and MRC grade and their association with mortality. The pink module, involved in hemostasis and platelet activation, was positively correlated with MRC grade, but not mortality. Of the five modules associated with death from TBM, all were correlated with MRC grade (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). Four of these five modules, were enriched for immune responses.</p>

<title>Transcriptional immune pathways associated with TBM mortality</title>
<p>To better understand the biological functions of the five modules associated with TBM mortality, a gene set associated with mortality in each module was functionally annotated using known pathway databases, such as gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using fold enrichment to determine if the prevalence of genes in a pathway were different from that expected by chance. We also used ssGSEA enrichment scores based on gene expression ranking of genes in a particular pathway within a single individual, to show the activity of this pathway between death and survival TBM as well as across 4 cohorts. These analyses helped to identify the pathways linked to mortality within the gene modules.</p>
<p>In the blue module, we found TBM mortality was associated with upregulated inflammatory and innate immune response transcripts, particularly in pathways involved in the acute inflammatory response and the regulation of inflammatory responses, including responses to bacteria and neutrophil activation. KEGG pathway analysis suggested this signal was associated with transduction and immune system pathways, such as toll-like receptor signaling, TNF signaling, NF-kappa B signaling and neutrophil extracellular trap formation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Table S8</bold>).</p>
<p>We did not find any pathway significantly associated with mortality in the upregulated cyan gene module, although in the hierarchical clustering the cyan module was highly correlated with the blue - inflammatory response module (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). In contrast, analyses of the down-regulated brown, red and black modules highlighted pathways involved in adaptive immunity, predominantly those mediated by lymphocytes. These included downregulations of lymphocyte proliferation, T cell activation, B cell activation, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and their signaling pathways such as antigen receptor-mediated, T and B cell receptor (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Table S8</bold>).</p>
<p>We also investigated the association between pathways known to be important to TB pathogenesis and mortality (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref></bold>). Looking at those who died vs. survived amongst HIV-positive TBM, there was little difference between the groups with respect to inflammatory response, cytokine signaling, and icosanoid and inflammasome activation. This was also the case for HIV-negative individuals. However, interferon and TNF pathways were more active in those with HIV, and TNF signaling expression was significantly higher in HIV-negative adults who died rather than survived.</p>

<title>HIV influence on modules, hub genes, and pathways associated with TBM mortality</title>
<p>Transcriptional profiles associated with TBM mortality stratified by HIV status are shown in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>. In HIV-negative individuals, 786 (3.9%) genes were differentially expressed, whereas in HIV-positive the number was 1620 (8.1%) genes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Table S2 &amp; S3)</bold>. We hypothesized that host transcriptional signatures associated with TBM mortality differ according to HIV status.

Modules were identified with colors and to discriminate them from the modules linked to mortality alone we added an annotated function on the module name. We focused on modules that failed to form consensus associations with mortality due to opposite associations in the two cohorts.</p>
<p>Sixteen gene co-expression modules (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, Table S9</bold>), ranging from 60 to 958 genes, were obtained from the HIV-negative and positive cohorts.

<p>Hub genes associated with mortality, which are highly correlated with other genes in the module, were identified in the two modules.

<p>Pathway enrichment analysis showed genes in the blue-angiogenesis module were significantly enriched for angiogenesis or blood vessel development, leukocyte and neutrophil activation, and signal transduction pathways (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, Table S11</bold>).

<p>In addition, almost all of the pathways significantly associated with TBM mortality were similar in HIV-negative and positive cohorts, confirming that these important pathways were common to all TBM (<bold>Figure S6</bold>).

Death in HIV-negative TBM was associated with increased enrichment of these pathways, but with less TNF transcript compared to HIV-positive individuals.

<title>Predictors of TBM mortality</title>
<p>We aimed to identify baseline gene signatures that might help predict death or survival from TBM. We selected potential gene predictors from 26 common and 10 HIV-specific hub genes; these hub genes represented the dominant modules associated with mortality. Three predefined clinical factors known to be associated with outcome (age, MRC grade and CSF lymphocyte count) were also used for candidate predictor selection. Using a multivariate Cox elastic-net regression model for 39 predictors, six predictors were selected for HIV-negative TBM (MRC grade, age, CSF lymphocyte count, gene set 1: <italic>MCEMP1</italic>, <italic>TRABD2A</italic> and <italic>CD4</italic>), and 6 predictors were selected for HIV-positive TBM (MRC grade, age, CSF lymphocyte count, gene set 2: <italic>NELL2</italic>, <italic>MCEMP1</italic> and <italic>ZNF354C</italic>) (<bold>Table S12</bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The biological pathways involved in pathogenesis of TBM are unclear. In general, previous studies investigating TBM pathogenesis have been small, testing for relatively small numbers of selected genes or molecules, and have been unable to take an unbiased and broader view of the inflammatory response. This study investigated the pathways associated with death from TBM at a whole-genome transcriptome level, characterizing a global dysregulation in immune responses, including inflammation, and revealing specific functional pathways and hub genes involved in TBM and the mechanisms leading to death.</p>
<p>We sought to understand better the pathogenesis of TBM by identifying pretreatment blood transcriptional gene modules associated TBM disease severity and three-month mortality. Four out of five identified modules were involved in immunological functions, indicating multiple functional pathways of systemic immunity are involved in the pathogenesis of TBM. In particular, mortality was strongly associated with increased acute inflammation and neutrophil activation, and decreased adaptive immunity and T and B cell activation. Whilst there appeared to be many common pathways involved in TBM mortality in HIV-positive and negative individuals, there were differences: death was associated with increased expression of angiogenesis genes in HIV-positive adults, and with TNF signaling and down regulated extracellular matrix organisation in HIV-negative adults. We also identified a four-gene signature as a potential host response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status.</p>
<p>TBM mortality was associated with increased acute inflammatory responses, the regulation of inflammatory responses, and neutrophil activation. Previous blood transcriptome studies have shown that IFN-inducible neutrophil-driven transcripts were over-expressed in blood neutrophils from active TB patients compared to those with latent TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Another study described that TBM adults who developed IRIS during treatment, also had significantly more abundant neutrophil-associated transcripts that preceded the development of TBM-IRIS <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Our own earlier studies have also suggest a role for neutrophils in TBM pathogenesis, with high pretreatment CSF bacterial loads being correlated with high neutrophil numbers in both CSF and blood and more frequent new neurological events or paradoxical inflammatory complications <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Taken together with previous studies, our findings support an important role for over-activation of neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses in TBM pathogenesis and its lethal complications. Looking further into specific pathways, TBM mortality was neither associated with inflammatory response and cytokine signaling pathways in general, nor with interferon or inflammasome activation. However, increased transcripts in some specific immunity pathways, including TNF signaling, Toll-like receptor, NF-kappa B and neutrophil extracellular trap formation, were associated with TBM mortality. These pathways are involved as activators or effectors in the process of neutrophil activation and regulation, leading to an exacerbated inflammatory response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We found blood transcriptional responses of T cells and B cells were under-expressed in those who died from TBM, indicating an impairment in adaptive immunity in fatal disease. A reduction of activities in both T cell and B cell receptor signaling pathways in death were identified, independent of over-expression of neutrophil-mediated immune responses, indicating that multiple functional pathways influence TBM mortality. TBM pathogenesis is known to be associated with T cell impairment. Previous studies have shown lower numbers of T cells, reduced ability to respond to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> antigens or reduced expression of activation markers and cytokine production in TBM compared to PTB and healthy individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This impaired T cell function has correlated with disease severity and poor clinical outcomes in participants with PTB and TBM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>B cells and antibodies also influence humoral immunity against <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. Studies have shown a decreased memory B cell proportion, and lower levels of IgG, IgM antibodies and Fcγ receptors binding capacity in plasma in those with active lung TB compared to those with latent TB or healthy volunteers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. But little is known about the role of B cells in TBM. The observed association between TBM mortality and decreased transcriptional responses in B cell activation and B cell receptor signaling pathways suggest an unanticipated role for B cells and humoral immunity in TBM pathogenesis that needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic profiles from four cohorts, including healthy controls and PTB, provide a broad view of host responses in different TB clinical forms. Our data showed common transcriptional pathways and genes between PTB and TBM. A range of immune responses, involving in inflammation, cytokines, interferon, inflammasome and neutrophil signaling pathways, were activated in both PTB and TBM, but with significantly greater activation in HIV-positive TBM than HIV-negative TBM. This finding aligns with our previous data showing a dyregulated hyper-inflammation in HIV-associated TBM, with significantly higher CSF cytokine concentrations than in those without HIV infection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. These data suggest that different forms of TB are associated with similar inflammatory responses, but with different degrees of host responses, exemplified by hyper-inflammation in those with HIV.</p>
<p>The HIV-driven differences in TBM-associated inflammation appear sufficient to influence response to adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy with corticosteroids. An earlier randomized controlled trial of corticosteroids in 545 predominantly HIV-negative Vietnamese adults showed they significantly improved survival <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Our group recently completed a similar sized trial exclusively in HIV-positive adults without any clear benefit upon mortality (NEJM 22-16218.R2, in press). Therefore, the differences in gene expression associated with TBM mortality in the current study – with angiogenesis activation linked to HIV-positive TBM mortality only, for example – may provide an explanation for the poor response and offer alternative therapeutic strategies. Recent studies have shown that angiogenesis is induced by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection, which then contributes to inflammation, tissue damage and is correlated with disease severity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Developing prognostic models for TBM is important for guiding clinical decision making and improving outcomes. Several studies have developed and validated prognostic models for TBM using clinical, laboratory and radiological variables. These models have demonstrated moderate to high accuracy in predicting mortality and functional outcomes from TBM patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In this study, we used blood transcriptional signatures and co-expression network analysis to identify module-representative hub genes. We identified a four-gene set at the start of treatment (<italic>MCEMP1</italic>, <italic>NELL2</italic>, <italic>ZNF354C</italic> and <italic>CD4</italic>) whose expression strongly predicted three-month TBM mortality. Our prognostic models combining this four-gene host response in blood and two routine clinical predictors achieved very good performance, with AUC 0.80 and 0.86 for HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals with TBM, respectively. This is proof-of-concept that whole blood RNA host response might be a useful pre-treatment biomarker to predict early TBM mortality. Although further investigation and validation is needed, we have identified potential gene candidates for future development as prognostic biomarkers.</p>
<p>In summary, we present a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of the gene transcripts associated with TBM severity and mortality. Our data open a new window on TBM pathogenesis, with dysregulation in both innate and adaptive immune responses strongly associated with death from TBM. Furthermore, we have identified similarities and differences in the inflammatory responses associated with TBM in HIV-positive and negative adults, which may explain the different therapeutic effects of adjunctive corticosteroid treatment. We also revealed a 4-gene host response signature in blood that might represent a novel biomarker for defining those at highest risk of death, regardless of their HIV status.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>We collected data and whole peripheral blood samples for transcriptomic profiling from adults (≥18 years) with TBM enrolled into two randomized controlled trials conducted in Vietnam. The two trials investigated whether adjunctive dexamethasone improves outcome from TBM and the protocols for both trials have been published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> The ACT-HIV trial (NCT03092817) completed enrolment and follow-up of 520 HIV-positive adults with TBM in April 2023, with the results accepted for publication (NEJM 22-16218.R2, in press). The LAST-ACT trial (NCT03100786) completed enrollment of 720 HIV-negative adults with TBM in March 2023, with the last participants due to complete follow-up in March 2024.</p>
<p>Peripheral blood samples were taken from 281 trial participants: the first 207 consecutively enrolled HIV-negative participants from the LAST-ACT trial, and 74 randomly selected HIV-positive participants from the ACT-HIV trial. The samples were taken at enrollment, when patients could not have received more than 6 days of anti-tuberculosis drugs. All trial participants then received standard 4-drug anti-tuberculosis treatment for 2 months, followed by 3 drugs for 10 months, and were randomly allocated to dexamethasone or identical placebo for the first 6-8 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The investigators remain blind to the treatment allocation until the last participant completes follow-up and the database has been locked. Therefore, an analysis of the direct influence of corticosteroids on inflammatory response and outcome is not included in the current study.</p>
<p>Peripheral blood samples were taken for transcriptional profiling from two other cohorts: 295 adults with PTB and 30 healthy controls. The PTB cohort was enrolled in Pham Ngoc Thach hospital and District TB Units in Ho Chi Minh city, from a prospective observational study of the host and bacterial determinants of outcome from PTB. Participants had culture-confirmed PTB, either drug susceptible TB or a new diagnosis of multidrug-resistant TB. All participants in this cohort had &lt;7 days of anti-TB drugs at enrolment and did not have clinical evidence of extra-pulmonary TB. Healthy controls were enrolled in Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh city, from a prospective study for epidemiological characteristics of human resistance to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection. Participants in this cohort were adults without signs or symptoms of TB nor history of TB contact within the last two years.</p>
<p>Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional review board at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital and the ethics committee of the Ministry of Health in Vietnam, and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, UK (OxTREC 52-16, 36-16, 24-17, 33-17 and 532-22).

<title>Study design</title>
<p>The objectives and cohorts used in this study are presented in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold> and a workflow of data analysis is shown in <bold>Figure S9</bold>. Briefly, blood transcriptional profiling was generated from four cohorts of 207 TBM HIV-negative, 74 TBM HIV-positive, 279 PTB and 30 healthy controls. To define transcriptional signatures associated with TBM mortality, data from all 281 TBM participants were used. To ensure reproducibility, in our main analysis we randomly split our TBM data into two datasets, a discovery cohort (n=142) and a validation cohort (n=139). After identifying gene modules associated with mortality, related functional pathways and hub genes were determined with more details of the data analysis provided in <bold>Figure S9</bold>. In a broader view, gene enrichment and expression from significant pathways and hub genes were illustrated across all four cohorts. Finally, outcome prediction models were developed for TBM.</p>

<title>Sample processing and RNA-seq</title>
<p>Whole blood samples, collected from participants at enrollment, were stored in PAXgene collection tubes at −80°C. RNA samples were isolated at the same time using the PAXgene Blood RNA kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions, except for an additional washing step before RNA elution. DNA was digested on columns using the RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Quality control of the RNA extraction was performed using the Epoch spec for quantity and quality, and Tapestation Eukaryotic RNA Screentape for integrity. Samples with RNA integrity number below 4 were exclude for further steps. RNA-seq was performed by the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics (Sydney, Australia). One microgram of total RNA was used as input for each sample, using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Ribo-zero Globin kit (Illumina). Libraries were generated on the Sciclone G3 NGS (Perkin Elmer, Utah, USA) and the cDNA was amplified using 11 PCR cycles. Libraries were pooled 75 samples per pool and sequenced using NovaSeq 6000 S4 reagents at 2×100bp to generate about 30 million reads per sample.</p>

<title>RNA-seq data quality control and pre-processing</title>
<p>Quality control and alignment were performed using an in-house pipeline modified from previously published practices for RNA-seq analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> in linux command line. Briefly, the quality of the sequencing fastq files was analyzed using FastQC (v0.11.5) and poor quality samples were excluded from further analysis. Sequence reads were adapter and quality trimmed using Trimmomatic (v0.36), followed by duplicated optical read removal using BBMap (v38.79) tool. STAR aligner (v2.5.2a) was used to align the reads to the human reference genome (GRCh38 build 99) downloaded from Ensembl, allowing for maximum 2 mismatches in each 25 bp segment and a maximum of 20 alignment hits per read <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The alignment results were sorted and indexed for downstream analyses as BAM format files. The aligned reads were further utilized to generate gene expression counts using FeatureCounts (v2.0.0) against the human reference annotation (GRCh38 build 99) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Next, 60,067 genes in the expression matrix were first normalized by variance stabilizing transformation method built in DESeq2 package in R <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Subsequently, the batch effect was removed for 20,000 most variable genes using combat function in the SVA package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The primary outcome examined in this study was TBM three-month mortality. In the descriptive analysis, we summarized and tested association of patient characteristics with three-month mortality using univariate Cox regression analysis. We presented the proportion for binary variables and median (1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> interquartile range) for continuous variables.</p>
<p>To explore transcriptional profiles associated with mortality in TBM, differential expression analysis was performed on the 20,000 normalized gene expression matrix to find differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We constructed the contradicted matrix with survival and death status adjusted for covariates including: age, HIV status, dexamethasone treatment (LAST-ACT trial investigators remained blind), and sequencing batch. Linear models were used to assess DEGs using limma R package. Empirical Bayes moderated-t p-values were computed for each genes and Benjamini-Hochberg were used for correcting multiple testing (FDR). We defined the DEGs with the parameters (fold change &gt; 1.5 and FDR &lt;0.05). To visualize samples clustering in the 4 cohorts, a unsupervised principal component analysis was performed on 20,000 normalized genes, and the first principle component was plotted against the second principle component. The 95% confidence ellipse was drawn for each group using multivariate t-distribution ellipse. To compare enrichment activity of interested pathways between death vs survival, TBM vs PTB or healthy controls, enrichment scores of these pathways were calculated for single patient using single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm (ssGSEA). Pairwise Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for comparison between any two cohorts.</p>
<p>In the primary analysis, we initially conducted <italic>weighted gene co-expression network analysis</italic> (WGCNA) on the whole-blood transcriptomic profiling of the discovery cohort to identify clusters of genes (or ‘modules’) in the gene co-expression network among host transcriptomic genes. We then performed a <italic>network modules preservation analysis</italic> to assess the reproducibility of these modules and the network in the validation cohort. Subsequently, we conducted a <italic>module-trait association analysis</italic> to identify modules associated with the clinical traits of mortality and TBM severity. For the association analysis with mortality, we used a <italic>Cox regression model</italic> with the PC1 of the module as an independent variable. We adjusted the model for age, HIV status, and corticosteroid treatment (dexamethasone vs. placebo).</p>
<p>To analyze the association with TBM severity, we calculated the <italic>Spearman correlation</italic> between TBM severity (MRC grade) and the module’s PC1. We corrected for false discovery rate (FDR) for the dependent hypotheses by using the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure. Target modules were defined as modules associated with mortality in both the discovery and validation cohorts at FDR &lt; 0.05. Hub genes within each targeted module were identified based on 3 criteria: protein coding gene, module membership cut off 0.85 (MM) and high rank of gene significance rank (GS). MM defined as correlation between individual gene and the module’s PC1. GS defined as −log<sub>10</sub> p value association of gene with mortality using Cox regression model adjusted for age, HIV status and treatment. Genes were first filtered for protein coding function and MM above 0.85. Genes then was ranked based on its GS and top 3% were selected if number of genes in module above 500, otherwise top 5% were selected. Overlap hub genes between discovery and validation cohort were consider validated.</p>
<p>In the subsequent analysis, to determine the biological funcions or processes potentially related to each module we conducted <italic>overrepresentation analysis</italic> (ORA) using ShinyGO v0.77 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Genes were first filters for association with three-month mortality at p &lt; 0.05 and then were input into ShinyGO. We used both <italic>GO and KEGG databases</italic> for this analysis. We pre-specified significant pathways with overlap gene in pathway &gt; 5 and FDR &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to compare <italic>enrichment activity</italic> of resulting pathways between death vs survival, TBM vs PTB or healthy controls, enrichment scores of these pathways were calculated for single patient using ssGSEA algorithm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Pairwise Wilcoxon rank rum test were applied for comparison between 2 cohorts. To compare or visualize the difference of pathway effect on mortality between HIV-negative and HIV-positive TBM, <italic>fold change enrichment</italic> of interested pathways were calculated using Quantitative Set Analysis for Gene Expression (QuSAGE) method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In the secondary analysis, we performed a <italic>consensus analysis</italic> to identify consensus patterns of co-expression networks between HIV-positive and HIV-negative conditions in our TBM cohort. We conducted similar association analyses for TBM severity and mortality as in the preceding WGCNA analysis for both the HIV-negative and HIV-positive cohorts. We visualized the results using a heatmap. We defined strongly associated modules in HIV-positive or HIV-negative cohort as HIV-positive-specific signals and HIV-negative-specific signals. Additionally, we functional enrichmet ORA was performed for these consensus modules and the HIV-specific modules</p>
<p>We then performed variable selection using a <italic>multivariate elastic-net Cox regression model</italic> to select the important predictors for HIV-negative and HIV-positive TBM prognosis separately. Candidate predictors in HIV-negative TBM consisted of the combination of common hub genes, HIV-negative specific hub genes and clinical biomarkers: age, TBM severity and CSF lymphocyte count. Similarly, for HIV-positive TBM, candidate predictors consisted of common hub genes, HIV-positive specific hub genes and clinical biomarkers. We performed the analysis with 1,000 bootstrap sampling with replacement. The chosen variables were 1) among the top 75% of selected variables and 2) one representative hub gene per module. Subsequently, we developed a prediction model based on a <italic>logistic regression model</italic> incorporating only the chosen variables. We also assessed the overall model performance (by <italic>optimism-corrected Brier score</italic>), the discrimination (by <italic>optimism-corrected AUC</italic>), and calibration (by <italic>optimism-corrected calibration-slope</italic>) of the developed model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is one of the most severe forms of extrapulmonary TB. TBM is especially prevalent in people who are immunocompromised (e.g. HIV-positive). Delays in diagnosis and treatment could lead to severe disease or mortality. In this study, the authors performed the largest-ever host whole blood transcriptomics analysis on a cohort of 606 Vietnamese participants. The results indicated that TBM mortality is associated with increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways. Furthermore, increased angiogenesis was also observed in HIV-positive patients who died from TBM, whereas activated TNF signaling and down-regulated extracellular matrix organisation were seen in the HIV-negative group. Despite similarities in transcriptional profiles between PTB and TBM compared to healthy controls, inflammatory genes were more active in HIV-positive TBM. Finally, 4 hub genes (MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4) were identified as strong predictors of death from TBM.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is a really impressive piece of work, both in terms of the size of the cohort which took years of effort to recruit, sample, and analyse, and also the meticulous bioinformatics performed. The biggest advantage of obtaining a whole blood signature is that it allows an easier translational development into a test that can be used in the clinical with a minimally invasive sample. Furthermore, the data from this study has also revealed important insights into the mechanisms associated with mortality and the differences in pathogenesis between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients, which would have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The data on blood neutrophil count is really intriguing and seems to provide a very powerful yet easy-to-measure method to differentiate survival vs. death in TBM patients. It would be quite useful in this case to perform predictive analysis to see if neutrophil count alone, or in combination with gene signature, can predict (or better predict) mortality, as it would be far easier for clinical implementation than the RNA-based method. Moreover, genes associated with increased neutrophil activation and decreased T cell activation both have significantly higher enrichment scores in TBM (Figure 9) and in morality (Figure 8). While I understand the basis of selecting hub genes in the significant modules, they often do not represent these biological pathways (at least not directly associated in most cases). If genes were selected based on these biologically relevant pathways, would they have better predictive values?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript describes the analysis of blood transcriptomic data from patients with TB meningitis, with and without HIV infection, with some comparison to those of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and healthy volunteers. The objectives were to describe the comparative biological differences represented by the blood transcriptome in TBM associated with HIV co-infection or survival/mortality outcomes and to identify a blood transcriptional signature to predict these outcomes. The authors report an association between mortality and increased levels of acute inflammation and neutrophil activation, but decreased levels of adaptive immunity and T/B cell activation. They propose a 4-gene prognostic signature to predict mortality.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-Biological evaluations of blood transcriptomes in TB meningitis and their relationship to outcomes have not been extensively reported previously.</p>
<p>
-The size of the data set is a major strength and is likely to be used extensively for secondary analyses in this field of research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The bioinformatic analysis is limited to a descriptive narrative of gene-level functional annotations curated in GO and KEGG databases. This analysis can not be used to make causal inferences. In addition, the functional annotations are limited to 'high-level' terms that fail to define biology very precisely. At best, they require independent validation for a given context. As a result, the conclusions are not adequately substantiated. The identification of a prognostic blood transcriptomic signature uses an unusual discovery approach that leverages weighted gene network analysis that underpins the bioinformatic analyses. However, the main problem is that authors seem to use all the data for discovery and do not undertake any true external validation of their gene signature. As a result, the proposed gene signature is likely to be overfitted to these data and not generalisable. Even this does not achieve significantly better prognostic discrimination than the existing clinical scoring.</p>

<p>Response: We appreciate eLife’s positive assessment, although we challenge the conclusion that we ‘fail to define aspects of biology very precisely’. Our stated objective was to use bioinformatics tools to identify the biological pathways and hub genes associated with TBM pathogenesis and the eLife assessment affirms we have investigated ‘the transcriptional landscape of tuberculous meningitis’. To more precisely define aspects of the biology will require another study with different design and methods. Therefore the criticism seems unnecessarily harsh given the limitations of our stated objective.</p>

<p>Response: Blood neutrophil count was not found to be a predictor for TBM mortality in our previous studies. We agree it could be useful to perform predictive analysis with neutrophil count as suggested by reviewer. Regarding hub genes versus genes representative of the biological pathways, we cannot know which have better predictive values without performing variable selection for the sets of all genes including both hub genes and pathway representative genes, additional analysis which we will undertake.</p>

<p>Response: As explained in response to the eLife assessment, our objective was to use bioinformatics tools to identify the biological pathways and hub genes associated with TBM pathogenesis. We agree that ‘This analysis can not be used to make causal inferences’: that would require different study design and approaches. The proposed gene signature has higher AUC values than the existing clinical model. We agree that validation of the gene signature in an independent sample set will be a crucial next step.</p>
