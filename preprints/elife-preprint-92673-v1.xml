<title>Abstract</title><p>Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD), which is the leading neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). However, whether LRRK2 mutations cause PD and degeneration of DA neurons <italic>via</italic> a toxic gain-of-function or a loss-of-function mechanism is unresolved and has pivotal implications in LRRK2 based PD therapy. In this study, we investigate whether LRRK2 and its functional homologue LRRK1 play an essential, intrinsic role in DA neuron survival through the development of DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> conditional double knockout (cDKO) mice. We first generated and characterized floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice and then confirmed that germline deletions of the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles result in null alleles, as evidenced by the absence of <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mRNA and protein in the respective homozygous deleted mutant mice. We further examined the specificity of Cre-mediated recombination driven by the <italic>dopamine transporter</italic>-<italic>Cre</italic> (<italic>DAT-Cre</italic>) knockin (KI) allele using a GFP reporter line and confirmed that <italic>DAT-Cre</italic>-mediated recombination is restricted to DA neurons in the SNpc. Crossing these validated floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice with <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> KI mice, we then generated DA neuron-restricted <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice and further showed reduced levels of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in dissected ventral midbrains of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice. While DA neuron-restricted <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice of both sexes exhibit normal mortality and body weight, they develop age-dependent loss of DA neurons in the SNpc, as demonstrated by the progressive reduction of DA neurons in the SNpc of cDKO mice at 20 and 24 months of age. Moreover, DA neurodegeneration is accompanied with increases of apoptosis and elevated microgliosis in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder and is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Dominantly inherited missense mutations in the <italic>leucine-rich repeat kinase 2</italic> (<italic>LRRK2</italic>) gene are the most common cause of both familial and sporadic PD, highlighting the importance of LRRK2 in PD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). LRRK2 is a large protein of 2,527 amino acid residues containing several functional domains including several leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a GTPase-like domain of Ras-of-complex (Roc), a C-terminal of Roc (COR) domain, and a serine/threonine MAPKKK-like kinase domain. LRRK1, a homologue of LRRK2, belongs to the evolutionarily conserved Roco protein family and contains similar LRRs, Roc, COR, and kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). LRRK proteins are broadly expressed with LRRK2 being most abundant in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). While most PD mutations are found in LRRK2, rare variants in the Roc, COR, and kinase domains of LRRK1 have been reported and may be associated with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Furthermore, the Roc-COR domain of LRRK2 forms dimers and exhibits conventional Ras-like GTPase properties, and the R1441/C/G/H and I1371V mutations destabilize dimer formation and decrease GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Recent high-resolution cryoEM structural studies of full-length LRRK2 demonstrated its existence as dimers and pathogenic mutations such as R1441/C/G/H and Y1699I at the Roc-COR interface, whereas the G2910S mutant and wild-type LRRK2 share similar structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous genetic studies demonstrated that LRRK2 plays essential roles in the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Consistent with abundant expression of LRRK2 in kidneys, <italic>LRRK2</italic>-/-mice develop age-dependent phenotypes in the kidney, including autophagy-lysosomal impairments and increases of α-synuclein, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). It has also been reported that LRRK2 is important for maintaining lung homeostasis, and <italic>LRRK2</italic> deficiency results in impaired autophagy in alveolar type II epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). It was proposed that the lack of brain phenotypes in <italic>LRRK2</italic>-/-mice might be due to the presence of LRRK1 and potential functional compensation mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Indeed, <italic>LRRK</italic> double knockout (DKO) mice develop age-dependent, progressive loss of DA neurons in the SNpc, beginning at 14 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). However, <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice also exhibit lower body weight and increased mortality, raising the possibility that DA neurodegeneration in <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice may be secondary to poor health.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate whether LRRK2 and its functional homologue LRRK1 play an essential, intrinsic role in DA neuron survival through the development of DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> conditional DKO (cDKO) mice. We first generated and confirmed floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice, and then crossed them with the deleter <italic>CMV-Cre</italic> to create germline deletions of the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles, followed by Northern and Western analyses to confirm the absence of <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mRNA and protein in the respective homozygous deleted mutant mice. We also crossed a GFP reporter mouse with <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> KI mice and found that Cre-mediated recombination occurs in most, if not all, DA neurons and is restricted to DA neurons in the SNpc. We then crossed these thoroughly validated floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice with <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> KI mice to generate DA neuron-restricted <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice and further confirmed the reduction of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in dissected ventral midbrains of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice. While DA neuron-restricted <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice of both sexes exhibit normal mortality and body weight, they develop age-dependent loss of DA neurons in the SNpc, as demonstrated by the progressive reduction of TH+ DA neurons or NeuN+ neurons in the SNpc of cDKO mice at 20 and 24 months of age. Interestingly, quantitative electron microscopy analysis showed a similar number of electron-dense vacuoles in SNpc neurons of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice relative to controls, in contrast to age-dependent, dramatic increases of vacuoles in SNpc neurons of germline <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Moreover, DA neurodegeneration is accompanied with increases of apoptosis and elevated microgliosis in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice. These findings provide unequivocal evidence for the importance of LRRK in DA neurons and raise the possibility that LRRK2 mutations may impair this crucial physiological function, leading to the loss of DA neurons in Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<title>Generation and molecular characterization of the floxed and deleted <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles</title>
<p>LRRK2 and its homologue LRRK1 share several functional (LRRs, GTPase Roc, COR, and kinase) domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the intrinsic role of LRRK in DA neurons, we generated floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> (<italic>fLRRK1</italic>) and floxed <italic>LRRK2</italic> (<italic>fLRRK2</italic>) mice, which permit deletions of <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> selectively in DA neurons by <italic>DAT-Cre</italic>, which expresses Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous <italic>DAT</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). We introduced two <italic>loxP</italic> sites in introns 26 and 29 of <italic>LRRK1</italic> through homologous recombination and site-specific recombination by FLP recombinase to remove the positive selection <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette, which is flanked by two <italic>FRT</italic> sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The embryonic stem (ES) cells carrying the targeted allele or the floxed allele were identified and validated by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes as well as the <italic>neo</italic> probe (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>). The validated ES cells carrying the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> allele were injected into mouse blastocysts to develop floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> mice, which were further confirmed by Southern using the 5’ and 3’ external probes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). In the presence of Cre recombinase, the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> region containing part of intron 26 (1,288 bp), exons 27-29, which encode the kinase domain, and part of intron 29 (1,023 bp) is deleted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and the removal of exons 27-29 (625 bp) results in a frameshift of downstream codons.</p>

<p>The <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeting vector contains the 5’ homologous region, a <italic>loxP</italic> site 1,768 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site, exons 1-2, the <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette flanked by two <italic>loxP</italic> sites and two <italic>FRT</italic> sequences, and the 3’ homologous region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>; <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The ES cell clones carrying the targeted allele were identified and validated by Southern analysis using the 5’ external probe (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 6</xref>) and genomic PCR followed by sequencing. Mice carrying the <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeted allele were further verified by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 6</xref>) as well as the <italic>neo</italic> probe and were then crossed with the <italic>Actin-FLP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) to remove the <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette flanked by two <italic>FRT</italic> sites to generate floxed <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The resulting floxed <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice were confirmed by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). In the presence of Cre recombinase, the floxed <italic>LRRK2</italic> region containing the promoter and exons 1-2 are deleted, likely resulting in a null allele, as we previously targeted a very similar region (∼2.5 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site and exons 1-2) to generate germline deletion of <italic>LRRK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc are a small neuronal population embedded in the ventral midbrain, making it difficult to confirm whether DA neuron-specific deletions of the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> regions result in null alleles. We previously generated three independent <italic>LRRK1</italic> knockout (KO) mice, and only one KO line (Line 2) represents a <italic>LRRK1</italic> null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), whereas deletion of <italic>LRRK2</italic> promoter region and exons 1-2 resulted in a <italic>LRRK2</italic> null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). We therefore generated germline deleted <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice from floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice, respectively, by crossing them to germline deleter <italic>CMV-Cre</italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>We then performed Northern analysis of <italic>LRRK1</italic> using both an upstream probe specific for exons 2-3 and a downstream probe specific for exons 27-29 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Because of the low expression level of <italic>LRRK1</italic> and the relative abundance of <italic>LRRK1</italic> in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), we enriched polyA+ RNA from the lung of the mice carrying homozygous germline deleted (Δ/Δ) <italic>LRRK1</italic> alleles derived from the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> alleles. Using a probe specific for exons 2-3, the <italic>LRRK1</italic> transcripts in wild-type mice are the expected size of ∼7.4 kb, whereas the detected <italic>LRRK1</italic> transcripts in <italic>LRRK1</italic> Δ/Δ mice are smaller, consistent with the deletion of exons 27-29 (625 bp), resulting in a frameshift of downstream codons and the likely degradation of the truncated <italic>LRRK1</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1G</xref>; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 8</xref>). Using a probe specific for exons 27-29, there is no <italic>LRRK1</italic> transcript in <italic>LRRK1</italic> Δ/Δ mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure. 1G</xref>; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 8</xref>). Extensive RT-PCR analysis of total RNA isolated from the kidney, brain, and lung of <italic>LRRK1</italic> Δ/Δ mice using an exon 32-specific primer for RT and exon-specific primer sets for PCR (<italic>e.g.</italic> exons 4-8, 11-17, 20-25, and 25-31), followed by sequencing confirmation of the PCR products, indicated normal <italic>LRRK1</italic> splicing in <italic>fLRRK1/fLRRK1</italic> mice and the lack of <italic>LRRK1</italic> exons 27-29 in <italic>LRRK1</italic> Δ/Δ mice (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, Northern analysis of <italic>LRRK2</italic> using a probe specific for exons 1-5 and RT-PCR followed by sequencing confirmed the absence of <italic>LRRK2</italic> mRNA in <italic>LRRK2</italic> Δ/Δ brains and normal <italic>LRRK2</italic> transcripts in <italic>fLRRK2/fLRRK2</italic> brains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 10</xref>, <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). Furthermore, Western analysis confirmed the absence of LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins in the brain of <italic>LRRK1</italic> Δ/Δ and <italic>LRRK2</italic> Δ/Δ mice, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Taken together, our Northern, RT-PCR followed by sequencing, and Western analyses demonstrated that deletion of the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles results in null mutations. Thus, floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> alleles can be used to generate DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice.</p>

<p>To determine whether the inactivation of LRRK selectively in DA neurons of the SNpc impacts their survival, we performed TH immunostaining and quantified TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice and littermate controls.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>LRRK2 mutations represent ∼5% familial and 1-2% of sporadic PD cases, and the G2019S mutation is the most common mutation but with a higher age of onset and incomplete penetrance (74% at age 79) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Despite the importance of LRRK2 in PD pathogenesis, whether LRRK2 mutations cause PD <italic>via</italic> a loss-of-function or a gain-of-function mechanism remains highly debated and unresolved. Neither <italic>LRRK2</italic>-deficient mice nor <italic>LRRK2</italic> R1441C and G2019S KI mice develop dopaminergic neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). It was proposed that the lack of brain phenotypes in <italic>LRRK2</italic>-/-mice might be due to the presence of LRRK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), which is broadly expressed in the brain including the midbrain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154237-LRRK1/brain">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154237-LRRK1/brain</ext-link>). Indeed, germline deletions of LRRK2 and LRRK1 result in age-dependent loss of DA neurons and increases of apoptosis and microgliosis in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). However, the pleiotropic roles of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>), and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), and the observed earlier mortality and lower body weight in <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice raised the possibility that DA neurodegeneration in <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice may be due to poor health.</p>
<p>In this study, we address this important question through the development of floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>; <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1-figure supplement 1-11</bold></xref>), which permit the dissection of cell intrinsic function of LRRK in DA neurons. We generated DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice using the <italic>DAT-</italic></p>
<p><italic>Cre</italic> KI allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) to delete floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic> regions selectively in DA neurons. Indeed, using an EGFP reporter line, we found that <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> drives Cre-mediated recombination in almost all DA neurons in the SNpc (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Unlike the <italic>LRRK</italic> germline DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), DA neuron-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice exhibit normal body weight and mortality during mouse lifespan (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Importantly, <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice develop age-dependent DA neurodegeneration, as evidenced by progressive reductions of DA neurons in the SNpc at the age of 20-24 months (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>) and increases of apoptotic DA neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>), whereas the number of noradrenergic neurons in the LC is uncaged, consistent with the lack of Cre-mediated recombination in the LC by <italic>DAT-Cre</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>). Interestingly, quantitative EM analysis showed similar numbers of electron-dense vacuoles in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO and control mice even at 25 months of age (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>), in contrast to dramatic, age-dependent increases of vacuoles in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> DKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Lastly, DA neurodegeneration in the SNpc of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice is accompanied with elevated microgliosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The toxic gain-of-function pathogenic mechanism was supported by earlier biochemical reports showing that LRRK2 mutations (<italic>e.g.</italic> R1441C/G, G2019S) enhance kinase activity, leading to elevated levels of pSer1292-LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), pSer935-LRRK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), pT73-Rab10, and pS106-Rab12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). However, most transgenic mice overexpressing mutant LRRK2 did not produce neurodegeneration or DA neuron loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), suggesting that enhanced kinase activity does not correlate with compromised DA neuronal survival, though two reports showed that overexpression of LRRK2 G2019S but not R1441C resulted in DA neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Thus, further studies are needed to elucidate the differences of these seemingly conflicting transgenic findings and to understand the differences between the R1441C and G2019S mutations.</p>
<p>The loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism was supported by mouse knockout findings showing that germline inactivation of LRRK results in age-dependent loss of DA neurons in the SNpc and DA terminals in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The current study demonstrated a cell intrinsic role of LRRK in support of DA neuron survival in the SNpc of the aging brain, providing further genetic evidence of an essential, cell autonomous requirement of LRRK in DA neuron survival. However, highly penetrant PD-linked mutations are dominantly-inherited missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) in LRRK2, and there have been no reported deletion mutations that are linked to or causal of familial PD, despite various variants were reported in LRRK2 and LRRK1 that are associated with sporadic PD (but not linked to familial PD). One plausible explanation is that LRRK2 mutant may act in a dominant negative manner, inhibiting the activity of the wild-type LRRK2. This notion is supported by structural studies showing that the GTPase domain forms a dimer, and that the R1441/C/G/H and I1371V mutations destabilize dimer formation and decrease GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). LRRK2 may function as a dimer, which is further supported by the crystal structure of LRRK2’s WD40 domain dimer at 2.6 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Additional studies also suggested that LRRK2 functions as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), and that LRRK2 and LRRK1 can form a heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Furthermore, LRRK2 G2385R variant, a risk factor for PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), has been reported as a partial loss-of-function mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Future studies are needed to differentiate the possibility between a toxic gain-of-function pathogenic mechanism vs. loss-of-function mutations exerting a dominant negative effect further impairing LRRK2 activity of the wild-type protein encoded by the LRRK2 wild-type allele, as the gain-of-function or loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism underlying LRRK2 mutations pivots opposing LRRK2 based therapeutic development of PD therapies.</p>
<p>Finally, it was surprising to find no accumulation of autophagic and autolysosomal vacuoles in SNpc neurons of <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice, even at the age of 25 months. This suggests that non-dopaminergic cells (<italic>e.g.</italic> microglia), in which LRRK expression is unaffected in cDKO mice but is absent in germline DKO mice, may contribute to the dramatic phenotypic differences. Development of cell type-specific cDKO mice, such as microglia-specific <italic>LRRK</italic> cDKO mice, would permit further dissection of cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous role of LRRK in dopaminergic neuronal survival and whether glial LRRK plays a more important role in the regulation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway.</p>

<p>All animal use was approved by the IACUC committees of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and conformed to the USDA Animal Welfare Act, PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the “ILAR Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” and other applicable laws and regulations. Mice were housed in constant humidity- and temperature-controlled rooms and maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle and were given standard rodent chow and water.

<title>LRRK1</title>
<p>To generate the <italic>LRRK1</italic> targeting vector, we first PCR amplified the <italic><underline>left middle</underline></italic> homologous region (2,079 bp) containing partial intron 26, exon 27, and partial intron 27 of <italic>LRRK1</italic> from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-213J23, BACPAC Resources Center) using primers, P3 and P4. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the <italic>pGEM-T</italic> vector (A1360, Promega) to generate pLM1 (for details, see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). The <italic><underline>right middle</underline></italic> homologous region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,403) containing <italic>LRRK1</italic> genomic region from partial intron 27 to partial intron 29 was amplified by PCR using primers, P5 and P6, and then subcloned into the <italic>pGEM-T</italic> vector (pLM2). The <italic><underline>left middle</underline></italic> homologous region containing <italic>pGEM-T</italic> plasmid was then digested with <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Kpn</italic>I (endogenous <italic>Kpn</italic>I site in the intron 27) and subcloned into the <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Kpn</italic>I sites of the <italic><underline>right middle</underline></italic> homologous region containing <italic>pGEM-T</italic> plasmid (pLM3).</p>
<p>After that, the <italic>middle</italic> homologous region (5.5 kb), from partial intron 26 to partial intron 29, was released by <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Sac</italic>II digestions and was blunted by Klenow, and then subcloned into the <italic>Sma</italic>I site of <italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> vector (#13445, addgene) to generate the <italic>middle</italic> homologous region-<italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> plasmid (pLM4).</p>
<p>The <italic><underline>left</underline></italic> homologous region (2,016 bp) containing partial intron 25, exon 26, and partial intron 27 of <italic>LRRK1</italic> was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-213J23, BACPAC Resources Center) using primers, P1 and P2. The PCR fragment was digested with <italic>Sac</italic>II (introduced by P1) and <italic>Not</italic>I (introduced by P2 along with <italic>Hind</italic>III), and was subcloned into the <italic>Sac</italic>II and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of the <italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> vector (pLM5). The <italic><underline>right</underline></italic> homologous region (3,131 bp) containing partial intron 29, exon 30, and partial intron 30 of <italic>LRRK1</italic> was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-213J23) using primers, P7 and P8. The PCR fragment was digested with <italic>Sal</italic>I (introduced by P7) and <italic>Hind</italic>III (introduced by P8), and was subcloned into the <italic>Sal</italic>I and <italic>Hind</italic>III sites of the <italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> vector (pLM6).</p>
<p>The <italic><underline>left</underline></italic> homologous region in the <italic>PGKneoF2L2DAT</italic> vector (pLM5) was digested with <italic>Sac</italic>II and <italic>Not</italic>I, and subcloned into the <italic>Sac</italic>II and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of the <italic><underline>right</underline></italic> homologous region containing <italic>pGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> plasmid (pLM6) to generate pLM7. Finally, the <italic><underline>loxP-middle</underline></italic> homologous region-<italic>PGK-Neo</italic>-<italic>loxP</italic> fragment was released from pLM4 by <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I digestions, and subcloned into the <italic>Not</italic>I and <italic>Sal</italic>I sites of pLM7 to generate the final target vector (pLM8), which contains two <italic>loxP</italic> sites (intron 26 and intron 29). Upon Cre-mediated recombination, the endogenous <italic>LRRK1</italic> genomic sequence flanked by the 5’ <italic>loxP</italic> site (1,288 bp upstream of <italic>LRRK1</italic> exon 27) to the 3’ <italic>loxP</italic> site (1,023 bp downstream of exon 29) is excised. The <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette flanked by two <italic>FRT</italic> sites is under the control of the mouse <italic>phosphoglycerate kinase 1</italic> (<italic>PGK</italic>) promoter and contains the <italic>bovine growth hormone</italic> polyA signal. To enhance the ratio of ES cells carrying homologous recombination events instead of random insertion of the targeting vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), the negative selection <italic>PGK-DTA</italic> cassette, which encodes diphtheria toxin A chain, was also included in the <italic>LRRK1</italic> targeting vector.</p>
<p>The <italic>LRRK1</italic> targeting vector was linearized by <italic>Xho</italic>I digestion, and then electroporated into MKV6.5 embryonic stem (ES) cells (a gift from R. Jaenisch), which were derived from B6/129 F1 mice (The Jackson Laboratory, IMSR_JAX:101043). G418 was applied to the culture at 150 μg/ml 24 h later, and after 6 days of G418 selection, the surviving ES clones (480) were picked and screened by Southern analysis using <italic>Hind</italic>III digestion of genomic DNA followed by hybridization with the 5’ external and 3’ external probes to confirm proper recombination events in the 5’ and 3’ homologous regions, respectively.</p>
<p>25 ES cell clones were confirmed to carry the proper homologous recombination events at the 5’ homologous region, giving rise to the 17.0 kb and the 4.8 kb bands, which represent the wild-type and the targeted allele, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), and the 3’ homologous region, giving rise to the 17.0 kb and the 14.1 kb bands, which represent the wild-type and the targeted allele, respectively. We then expanded the selected 4 ES cell clones (3A11, 3D8, 3H1, and 3H6) and further verified by Southern using the 5’ and 3’ external, and <italic>neo</italic> probes. Two ES cell clones (3D8 and 3H6) were transfected with <italic>pCAGGS-flpE-puro</italic> (#20733, addgene) to delete the <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette by FLP recombinase. Three resulting ES cell clones (3D8C5, 3D8E5, and 3H6G7) were confirmed by Southern analysis using the 5’ and 3’ external probes and the <italic>neo</italic> probe to confirm the floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> allele by the deletion of the <italic>PGK-neo</italic> cassette.</p>

<p>To generate the <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeting vector, the <italic><underline>left</underline></italic> homologous region (2,579 bp) containing the <italic>LRRK2</italic> promoter region was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-526A2, BACPAC Resources Center) using primers, P9 and P10, and subcloned into the <italic>pGEM-T</italic> vector to generate pLRRK2#1 (for details see <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 4</xref>). The <italic>BamH</italic>I-<italic>loxP</italic>-<italic>Nhe</italic>I-<italic>Spe</italic>I fragment (56 bp), which was generated by annealing two complementary oligos, P39 and P40, was introduced to the <italic>BamH</italic>I and <italic>Spe</italic>I sites of pLRRK2#1 to generate pLRRK2#2. The <italic><underline>middle</underline></italic> homologous region, containing genomic sequences from the promoter region to partial intron 2, was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-526A2) using primers, P11 and P12, digested with <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I, and subcloned into the <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of the <italic>pGEM-T</italic> vector to generate pLRRK2#3, which was digested with <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I, and subcloned into the <italic>Xba</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of pLRRK2#2 to generate pLRRK2#4. The <italic><underline>right</underline></italic> homologous region (3,503 bp), which contains partial intron 1, exon 2, and partial intron 2, was PCR amplified from mouse BAC DNA (clone RP23-526A2) using primers, P13 and P14, and the PCR fragment was subcloned into the <italic>EcoR</italic>V site of <italic>pBluescript II KS</italic> (+) vector (212207, Agilent) to generate pLRRK2#5. The <italic><underline>right</underline></italic> homologous region in pLRRK2#5 was digested with <italic>BamH</italic>I followed by Klenow, and then digested with <italic>Cla</italic>I. The released fragment was subcloned into the <italic>EcoR</italic>V and <italic>Cla</italic>I sites of the <italic>PGKneoF2L2DTA</italic> vector to generate pLRRK2#6. <italic>LFNT-tk/pBS</italic> plasmid (a gift from S.

Finally, pLRRK2#4 containing the <italic><underline>left-loxP-middle</underline></italic> homologous regions was digested with <italic>EcoR</italic>V and <italic>Not</italic>I, and subcloned into <italic>Ale</italic>I and <italic>Not</italic>I sites of pLRRK2#7 containing the <italic><underline>loxP-FRT-PKG-neo-loxP-FRT-right</underline></italic> homologous region to generate the final targeting vector, which contains the <italic>loxP</italic> sites in the promoter region (1,768 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site) and in <italic>LRRK2</italic> intron 2 (878 bp downstream of exon 2). Upon Cre-mediated recombination, the floxed endogenous <italic>LRRK2</italic> genomic sequences from the 5’ <italic>loxP</italic> site (1,768 bp upstream of <italic>LRRK2</italic> transcription) to the 3’ <italic>loxP</italic> site in intron 2 (878 bp downstream of exon 2) are excised. The negative selection <italic>PGK-DTA</italic> cassette is also included in the <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeting vector.</p>
<p>The <italic>LRRK2</italic> targeting vector was linearized by <italic>Ahd</italic>I digestion, and then electroporated into MKV6.5 ES cells. G418 was applied to the culture at 150 ug/ml 24 h later, and after 6 days of G418 selection, the surviving ES clones (480) were picked and screened by Southern analysis using <italic>Nhe</italic>I digestion of genomic DNA followed by hybridization with the 5’ external probe (753 bp, PCR amplified using P19 and P20). Southern analysis confirmed that two ES cell clones (N24 and N34) carry the proper recombination event in the 5’ homologous arm, giving rise to 11.6 kb and 3.6 kb bands, which represent the wild-type and targeted alleles, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), followed by genomic PCR confirmation for the proper recombination in the right arm.</p>
<p>Three (3D8C5, 3A11, 3H6) and one (N24) ES clones for <italic>LRRK1</italic> and <italic>LRRK2</italic>, respectively, were microinjected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts to generate chimera mice, which were bred with B6/129 F1 mice to produce heterozygous floxed <italic>LRRK1</italic> and targeted <italic>LRRK2</italic> mice.

<p>The number of GFP+ and GFP+/TH+ cells in the SNpc of <italic>DAT-IRES-Cre/+; Rosa26-CAG-LSL-ZsGreen1/+</italic> reporter mice were quantified using 3 comparable coronal sections (16 µm in thickness, spaced 320 μm apart) per brain (n = 3 brains, one hemisphere).

<p>Quantification of TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc or LC was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>).

Total number of TH+ cells in the SNpc was calculated as follows: [total number of TH+ DA neurons quantified in all 6-9 sections] x 10 (every 10<sup>th</sup> section sampled) x 2 (both hemispheres). Similar results were obtained independently by two investigators using coded samples. Total number of TH+ noradrenergic neurons in the LC (a total of 6-9 sections, spaced 80 µm apart) was calculated as follows: [total number of TH+ noradrenergic neurons quantified in all 6-9 sections] x 5 (every 5<sup>th</sup> section sampled) x 2 (both hemispheres).</p>
<p>NeuN+, active Caspase-3+, or Iba1+ cells in the SNpc, which was marked by TH immunoreactivity, were quantified using serial coronal sections (16 μm in thickness, every 10<sup>th</sup> section, a total of 6-9 sections per brain). Compared to chromogenic DAB immunostaining followed by counting under the stereomicroscope, which captures TH-positive dopaminergic neurons from the single plane layer of the sections, immunofluorescence immunostaining picks up more cells with higher sensitivity by maximal intensity projection mode throughout the entire layer of the section under the confocal microscope. Thus, more TH-positive dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc were captured and quantified under confocal microscopy compared to DAB staining. The total number of NeuN+, active Caspase-3+, or Iba1+ cells in the SNpc, which was marked by TH immunoreactivity, was calculated as follows: [total number of NeuN+, active Caspase-3+, or Iba1+ cells in all sections counted] x 10 (every 10<sup>th</sup> section sampled) x 2 (both hemispheres).</p>

<title>Quantitative EM analysis</title>
<p>The collection and quantification of the EM images were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). Mice were perfused with PBS containing 0.25 g/L heparin and 5 g/L procaine followed by a fixative solution containing 2.5% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) (#1549, Electron Microscopy Science). Brains were dissected and post-fixed overnight in a fixative solution at 4°C. The dissected tissues were trimmed to 1-2 mm<sup>3</sup> cubes followed by osmication and uranyl acetate staining, dehydration in graded alcohol, and embedded in TABB 812 Resin (Marivac Ltd.) at the Harvard Medical School EM facility. 0.5 μm sections were stained with toluidine blue and viewed under the light stereomicroscope (Nikon Eclips E600) to find the SNpc area for EM viewing. Then adjacent sections were cut with 80 nm in thickness with the Leica Ultracut S microtome, picked up on formvar-carbon coated slot Copper grids, stained with 0.2% Lead Citrate, and viewed and imaged under the JEOL 1200x Electron Microscope. A minimum of 10 micrographs containing the entire cell body in the SNpc area were analyzed for each brain. The image was analyzed by using the Fiji version of ImageJ. The number of electron-dense autophagic and lysosomal vacuoles (&gt; 0.5 μm in diameter) in individual neuronal profiles was quantified. We previously calculated the diameter of electron-dense autophagic/lysosomal vacuoles by measuring the longest side manually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In the current study, we used Feret’s Diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>) to accurately measure the longest distance between any of two points in the electron-dense autophagic/lysosomal vacuoles, resulting in a higher number of electron-dense vacuoles quantified. The number of electron-dense vacuoles (&gt; 0.5 μm in diameter) in individual neuronal profiles was quantified. The area of electron-dense vacuoles (&gt; 0.5 μm in diameter) was quantified and averaged in individual neuronal profiles. Finally, the average number or area of vacuoles was calculated per genotype. Experiments were done in a genotype blind manner (after scarifying mice, the brain samples were coded and sent to the Harvard Medical School EM Core, where the images were captured, and the vacuoles were quantified by another independent experimenter).</p>

<p>This work describes new validated conditional double KO (cDKO) mice for LRRK1 and LRRK2 that will be <bold>useful</bold> for the field, given that LRRK2 is widely expressed in the brain and periphery, and many divergent phenotypes have been attributed previously to LRRK2 expression. The manuscript presents <bold>solid</bold> data demonstrating that it is the loss of LRRK1 and LRRK2 expression within the SNpc DA cells that is not well tolerated, as it was previously unclear from past work whether neurodegeneration in the LRRK double Knock Out (DKO) was cell autonomous or the result of loss of LRRK1/LRRK2 expression in other types of cells. Future studies may pursue the biochemical mechanisms underlying the reason for the apoptotic cells noted in this study, as here, the LRRK1/LRRK2 KO mice did not replicate the dramatic increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles previously noted in germline global LRRK1/LRRK2 KO mice.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an important work showing that loss of LRRK function causes late-onset dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a cell-autonomous manner. One of the LRRK members, LRRK2, is of significant translational importance as mutations in LRRK2 cause late-onset autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). While many in the field assume that LRRK2 mutant causes PD via increased LRRK2 activity (i.e., kinase activity), it is not a settled issue as not all disease-causing mutant LRRK2 exhibit increased activity. Further, while LRRK2 inhibitors are under clinical trials for PD, the consequence of chronic, long-term LRRK2 inhibition is unknown. Thus, studies evaluating the long-term impact of LRRK deficit have important translational implications. Moreover, because LRRK proteins, particularly LRRK2, are known to modulate immune response and intracellular membrane trafficking, the study's results and the reagents will be valuable for others interested in LRRK function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This report describes a mouse model where the LRRK1 and LRRK2 gene is conditionally deleted in dopaminergic neurons. Previously, this group showed that while loss of LRRK2 expression does not cause brain phenotype, loss of both LRRK1 and LRRK2 causes a later onset, progressive degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons and dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC). However, because LRRK genes are widely expressed with some peripheral phenotypes, it was unknown if the neurodegeneration in the LRRK double knockout (DKO) was cell autonomous. To rigorously test this question, the authors have generated a double conditional (cDKO) allele where both LRRK1 and LRRK2 genes were targeted to contain loxP sites. In my view, this was beyond what is usually required, as most investigators might might combine one KO allele with another floxed allele. The authors provide a rigorous validation showing that the Driver (DAT-Cre) is expressed in most DAergic neurons in the SN and that LRRK levers are decreased selectively in the ventral midbrain. Using these mice, the authors show that the number of DAergic neurons is normal at 15 but significantly decreased at 20 months of age. Moreover, the authors show that the number of apoptotic neurons is increased by ~2X in aged SN, demonstrating increased ongoing cell death, as well as an increase in activated microglia. The degeneration is limited to DAergic neurons as LC neurons are not lost as this population does not express DAT. Overall, the mouse genetics and experimental analysis were performed rigorously, and the results were statistically sound and compelling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I only have a few minor comments. First is that in PD and other degenerative conditions, loss of axons and terminals occurs prior to cell bodies. It might be beneficial to show the status of DAergic markers in the striatum. Second, previous studies indicate that very little, if any, LRRK1 is expressed in SN DAergic neurons. This also the case with the Allen Brain Atlas profile. Thus, authors should discuss the discrepancy as authors seem to imply significant LRRK1 expression in DA neurons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Shen and collaborators described the generation of cDKO mice lacking LRRK1 and LRRK2 selectively in DAT-positive DAergic neurons. The Authors asked whether selective deletion of both LRRK isoforms could lead to a Parkinsonian phenotype, as previously reported by the same group in germline double LRRK1 and LRRK2 knockout mice (PMID: 29056298). Indeed, cDKO mice developed a late reduction of TH+ neurons in SNpc that partially correlated with the reduction of NeuN+ cells. This was associated with increased apoptotic cell and microglial cell numbers in SNpc. Unlike the constitutive DKO mice described earlier, however, cDKO mice did not replicate the dramatic increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles. The study supports the authors' hypothesis that loss of function rather than gain of function of LRRK2 leads to PD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study described for the first time a model where both the PD-associated gene LRRK2 and its homolog LRRK1 are deleted selectively in DAergic neurons, offering a new tool to understand the physiopathological role of LRRK2 and the compensating role of LRRK1 in modulating DAergic cell function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The model has no construct validity since loss of function mutations of LRRK2 are well-tolerated in humans and do not lead to PD. The evidence of a Parkinsonian phenotype in these cDKO mice is limited and should be considered preliminary.</p>

<p>Kang, Huang, and colleagues investigated the impact of LRRK1 and LRRK2 deletion, specifically in dopaminergic neurons, using a novel cDKO mouse model. They observed a significant reduction in DAergic neurons in the substantia nigra in their conditional LRRK1 and LRRK2 KO mice and a corresponding increase in markers of apoptosis and gliosis. This work set out to address a long-standing question within the field around the role and importance of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in DAergic neurons and suggests that the loss of both proteins triggers some neurodegeneration and glial activation.</p>
<p>The studies included in this work are carefully performed and clearly communicated, but additional studies are needed to strengthen further the authors' claims around the consequences of LRRK2 deletion in DAergic neurons.</p>
<p>1. In Figures 2E and F, the authors assess the protein levels of LRRK1 and LRRK2 in their cDKO mouse model to confirm the deletion of both proteins. They observe a mild loss of LRRK1 and LRRK2 signals in the ventral midbrain compared to wild-type animals. While this is not surprising given other cell types that still express LRRK1 and LRRK2 would be present in their dissected ventral midbrain samples, it does not sufficiently confirm that LRRK1 and LRRK2 are not expressed in DAergic neurons. Additional data is needed to more directly demonstrate that LRRK1 and LRRK2 protein levels are reduced in DAergic neurons, including analysis of LRRK1 and LRRK2 protein levels via immunohistochemistry or FACS-based analysis of TH+ neurons.</p>
<p>2. The authors observed a significant but modest effect of LRRK1 and LRRK2 deletion on the number of TH+ neurons in the substantia nigra (12-15% loss at 20-24 months of age). It is unclear whether this extent of neuron loss is functionally relevant. To strengthen the impact of these data, additional studies are warranted to determine whether this translates into any PD-relevant deficits in the mice, including motor deficits or alterations in alpha-synuclein accumulation/aggregation.</p>
<p>3. The authors demonstrate that, unlike in the germline LRRK DKO mice, they do not observe any alterations in electron-dense vacuoles via EM. Given their data showing increased apoptosis and gliosis, it remains unclear how the loss of LRRK proteins leads to DAergic neuronal cell loss. Mechanistic studies would be insightful to understand better potential explanations for how the loss of LRRK1 and LRRK2 may impair cellular survival, and additional text should be added to the discussion to discuss potential hypotheses for how this might occur.</p>
<p>4. The authors discuss the potential implications of the neuronal cell loss observed in cDKO mice for LRRK1 and LRRK2 for therapeutic approaches targeting LRRK2 and suggest this argues that LRRK2 variants may exert their effects through a loss-of-protein function. However, all of the data generated in this work focus on a mouse in which both LRRK1 and LRRK2 have been deleted, and it is therefore difficult to make any definitive conclusions about the consequences of specifically targeting LRRK2. The authors note potential redundancy between the two LRRK proteins, and they should soften some of their conclusions in the discussion section around implications for the effects of LRRK2 variants. Human subjects that carry LRRK2 loss-of-function alleles do not have an increased risk for developing PD, which argues against the author's conclusions that LRRK2 variants associated with PD are loss-of-function. Additional text should be included in their discussion to better address these nuances and caution should be used in terms of extrapolating their data to effects observed with PD-linked variants in LRRK2.</p>

<p>This work describes new validated conditional double KO (cDKO) mice for LRRK1 and LRRK2 that will be useful for the field, given that LRRK2 is widely expressed in the brain and periphery, and many divergent phenotypes have been attributed previously to LRRK2 expression. The manuscript presents solid data demonstrating that it is the loss of LRRK1 and LRRK2 expression within the SNpc DA cells that is not well tolerated, as it was previously unclear from past work whether neurodegeneration in the LRRK double Knock Out (DKO) was cell autonomous or the result of loss of LRRK1/LRRK2 expression in other types of cells. Future studies may pursue the biochemical mechanisms underlying the reason for the apoptotic cells noted in this study, as here, the LRRK1/LRRK2 KO mice did not replicate the dramatic increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles previously noted in germline global LRRK1/LRRK2 KO mice.</p>

<p>We thank the editors for handling our manuscript and for the succinct summary that recognizes the significance of our findings and points out interesting directions for future studies. We also thank the reviewers for their helpful comments and positive evaluation of our work. Below, we have provided point-by-point responses to the reviewers’ comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is an important work showing that loss of LRRK function causes late-onset dopaminergic neurodegeneration in a cell-autonomous manner. One of the LRRK members, LRRK2, is of significant translational importance as mutations in LRRK2 cause late-onset autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease (PD). While many in the field assume that LRRK2 mutant causes PD via increased LRRK2 activity (i.e., kinase activity), it is not a settled issue as not all disease-causing mutant LRRK2 exhibit increased activity. Further, while LRRK2 inhibitors are under clinical trials for PD, the consequence of chronic, long-term LRRK2 inhibition is unknown. Thus, studies evaluating the long-term impact of LRRK deficit have important translational implications. Moreover, because LRRK proteins, particularly LRRK2, are known to modulate immune response and intracellular membrane trafficking, the study's results and the reagents will be valuable for others interested in LRRK function.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This report describes a mouse model where the LRRK1 and LRRK2 gene is conditionally deleted in dopaminergic neurons. Previously, this group showed that while loss of LRRK2 expression does not cause brain phenotype, loss of both LRRK1 and LRRK2 causes a later onset, progressive degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons and dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC). However, because LRRK genes are widely expressed with some peripheral phenotypes, it was unknown if the neurodegeneration in the LRRK double knockout (DKO) was cell autonomous. To rigorously test this question, the authors have generated a double conditional (cDKO) allele where both LRRK1 and LRRK2 genes were targeted to contain loxP sites. In my view, this was beyond what is usually required, as most investigators might might combine one KO allele with another floxed allele. The authors provide a rigorous validation showing that the Driver (DAT-Cre) is expressed in most DAergic neurons in the SN and that LRRK levers are decreased selectively in the ventral midbrain. Using these mice, the authors show that the number of DAergic neurons is normal at 15 but significantly decreased at 20 months of age. Moreover, the authors show that the number of apoptotic neurons is increased by ~2X in aged SN, demonstrating increased ongoing cell death, as well as an increase in activated microglia. The degeneration is limited to DAergic neurons as LC neurons are not lost as this population does not express DAT. Overall, the mouse genetics and experimental analysis were performed rigorously, and the results were statistically sound and compelling.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I only have a few minor comments. First is that in PD and other degenerative conditions, loss of axons and terminals occurs prior to cell bodies. It might be beneficial to show the status of DAergic markers in the striatum. Second, previous studies indicate that very little, if any, LRRK1 is expressed in SN DAergic neurons. This also the case with the Allen Brain Atlas profile. Thus, authors should discuss the discrepancy as authors seem to imply significant LRRK1 expression in DA neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s recognition of the importance of the study as well as our rigorous experimental approaches and compelling results. Our responses to the reviewer's two minor comments are below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. DAergic markers in the striatum:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed TH immunostaining in the striatum and quantified TH+ DA terminals in the striatum of DA neuron-specific LRRK cDKO and littermate control mice at the ages of 15 and 24 months. We found similar levels of TH immunoreactivity in the striatum of LRRK cDKO and littermate control mice at the age of 15 months (p = 0.6565, unpaired Student’s t-test) and significantly reduced levels of TH immunoreactivity in the striatum of LRRK cDKO, compared to control mice at the age of 24 months (~19%, p = 0.0215), suggesting an age-dependent loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum of DA neuron-specific LRRK cDKO mice. These results are now included as Figure 5 of the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. LRRK1 expression in the SNpc:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is shown in the Mouse brain RNA-seq dataset and the Allen Mouse brain ISH dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154237-LRRK1/brain">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000154237-LRRK1/brain</ext-link>) that LRRK1 is broadly expressed in the mouse brain and is expressed at modest levels in the midbrain, comparable to the cerebral cortex. Indeed, our Western analysis also showed that levels of LRRK1 detected in the dissected ventral midbrain and the cerebral cortex of control mice are similar (40µg total protein loaded per lane; Figure 2E). Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that deletion of LRRK2 (or LRRK1) alone does not cause age-dependent loss of DA neurons in the SNpc, but deletions of both LRRK1 and LRRK2 result in age-dependent loss of DA neurons in LRRK DKO mice, indicating the functional importance of LRRK1 in the protection of DA neuron survival in the aging mouse brain (Tong et al., PNAS 2010, 107: 9879-9884, Giaime et al., Neuron 2017, 96: 796-807).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Shen and collaborators described the generation of cDKO mice lacking LRRK1 and LRRK2 selectively in DAT-positive DAergic neurons. The Authors asked whether selective deletion of both LRRK isoforms could lead to a Parkinsonian phenotype, as previously reported by the same group in germline double LRRK1 and LRRK2 knockout mice (PMID: 29056298). Indeed, cDKO mice developed a late reduction of TH+ neurons in SNpc that partially correlated with the reduction of NeuN+ cells. This was associated with increased apoptotic cell and microglial cell numbers in SNpc.</p>
<p>Unlike the constitutive DKO mice described earlier, however, cDKO mice did not replicate the dramatic increase in the number of autophagic vacuoles. The study supports the authors' hypothesis that loss of function rather than gain of function of LRRK2 leads to PD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study described for the first time a model where both the PD-associated gene LRRK2 and its homolog LRRK1 are deleted selectively in DAergic neurons, offering a new tool to understand the physiopathological role of LRRK2 and the compensating role of LRRK1 in modulating DAergic cell function.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The model has no construct validity since loss of function mutations of LRRK2 are well-tolerated in humans and do not lead to PD. The evidence of a Parkinsonian phenotype in these cDKO mice is limited and should be considered preliminary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for commenting on the usefulness of this new PD mouse model.</p>
<p>The reviewer did not include a reference citation for the statement &quot;loss of function mutations of LRRK2 are well-tolerated in humans and do not lead to PD.&quot; It is possible that the reviewer was referring to a human population study (Whiffin et al., Nat Med 2020, 26: 869-877), entitled &quot;The effect of LRRK2 lossof-function variants in humans.&quot; In this study, the authors analyzed 141,456 individuals sequenced in the Genome Aggregation Database, 49,960 exome-sequenced individuals from the UK Biobank, and more than 4 million participants in the 23andMe genotyped dataset, and they looked for human genetic variants predicted to cause loss-of-function of protein-coding genes (pLoF variants). The reported findings were interesting, and the authors were careful in stating their conclusions. However, this is not a linkage study of large pedigrees carrying a single, clear-cut loss-of-function mutation (e.g. large deletions of most exons and coding sequences). Therefore, the experimental evidence is not compelling enough to conclude whether loss-of-function mutations in LRRK2 cause PD or do not cause PD.</p>
<p>The current report is an unbiased genetic study in an effort to reveal the normal physiological role of LRRK in dopaminergic neurons. It was not intended to produce Parkinsonian phenotypes in LRRK cDKO mice, which would be a biased effort. However, the unequivocal discovery of the cell intrinsic role of LRRK in the protection of DA neurons from age-dependent degeneration and apoptotic cell death should be considered seriously, while we contemplate the disease mechanism and how LRRK2 mutations may cause DA neuron loss and PD.</p>

<p>Kang, Huang, and colleagues investigated the impact of LRRK1 and LRRK2 deletion, specifically in dopaminergic neurons, using a novel cDKO mouse model.

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this incredibly important but often overlooked issue. We agree that the data in Figure 2E, F alone would be inadequate to validate DA neuron-specific LRRK cDKO mice.</p>
<p>Cell type-specific conditional knockouts are a mosaic with KO cells mixed with other cell types expressing the gene normally. DA neuron-specific cDKO is particularly challenging, as DA neurons are a subset of cells embedded in the ventral midbrain. Rather than using immunostaining, which relies upon specific, good LRRK1 and LRRK2 antibodies for IHC, or FACS sorting of TH+ neurons followed by Western blotting (few cells, mixed cell populations, etc.), we chose a clean genetic approach by generating germline mutant mice carrying the deleted LRRK1 and LRRK2 alleles in all cells from the floxed LRRK1 and LRRK2 alleles. This approach permits characterization of these deletion mutations in germline mutant mice using molecular approaches that yield unambiguous results.</p>
<p>We crossed CMV-Cre deleter mice with floxed LRRK1 and LRRK2 mice to generate respective germline LRRK1 KO and LRRK2 KO mice, in which all cells carry the LRRK1 or LRRK2 deleted alleles that are identical to those in DA neurons of cDKO mice. We then performed Northern, extensive RTPCR followed by sequencing, and Western analyses to show the absence of the full length LRRK1 and LRRK2 mRNA (Figure 1G, H, Figure 1-figure supplement 8 and 10), and the expected truncation of LRRK1 and LRRK2 mRNA (Figure 1-figure supplement 9 and 11), and the absence of LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins (Figure 1I). These analyses together demonstrate that in the presence of Cre, either CMV-Cre expressed in all cells or DAT-Cre expressed selectively in DA neurons, the floxed LRRK1 and LRRK2 exons are deleted, resulting in null alleles. We further demonstrated the specificity of DAT-Cremediated recombination (deletion) by crossing DAT-Cre mice with a GFP reporter, showing that 99% TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc are also GFP+ (Figure 2A, B), indicating that DAT-Cre-mediated recombination of the floxed alleles occurs in essentially all TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors observed a significant but modest effect of LRRK1 and LRRK2 deletion on the number of TH+ neurons in the substantia nigra (12-15% loss at 20-24 months of age). It is unclear whether this extent of neuron loss is functionally relevant. To strengthen the impact of these data, additional studies are warranted to determine whether this translates into any PD-relevant deficits in the mice, including motor deficits or alterations in alpha-synuclein accumulation/aggregation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, the reduction of DA neurons in the SNpc of cDKO mice at the age of 20-24 months is modest. At 15 months of age, the number of TH+ DA neurons in the SNpc is similar between LRRK cDKO mice (10,000 ± 141) and littermate controls (10,077 ± 310, p &gt; 0.9999). At 20 months of age, the number of DA neurons in the SNpc of LRRK cDKO mice (8,948 ± 273) is significantly reduced (-12.7%), compared to control mice (10,244 ± 220, F1,46 = 16.59, p = 0.0002, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc multiple comparisons, p = 0.0041). By 24 months of age, the number of DA neurons in the SNpc of LRRK cDKO mice (8,188 ± 452) relative to controls (9,675 ± 232, p = 0.0010) is further reduced (15.4%).</p>
<p>Similar results were obtained by an independent quantification by another investigator, also conducted in a genotype blind manner, using the fractionator and optical dissector method, by which TH+ cells were quantified in 25% areas. These results are included as Figure 3-figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript. Because of the more limited sampling, the quantification data are more variable, compared to quantification of TH+ cells in all areas of the SNpc, shown in Figure 3. With both methods, we quantified TH+ cells in every 10th sections encompassing the entire SNpc (3D structure), as sampling using every 5th or every 10th sections yielded similar results.</p>
<p>We also performed behavioral analysis of LRRK cDKO mice and littermate controls at the ages of 10 and 25 months using the beam walk test (10 mm and 20 mm beam) and the pole test, which are sensitive to impairment of motor coordination. We found that LRRK cDKO mice at 10 months of age showed significantly more hindlimb errors (p = 0.0005, unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test) and longer traversal time (p = 0.0075) in the 10mm beam walk test, compared to control mice, though their performance is similar in the 20 mm beam walk (hindlimb slips: p = 0.0733, traversal time: p = 0.9796) and in the pole test. At 22 months of age, the performance of LRRK cDKO mice and littermate controls is more variable and worse, compared to the younger mice, and is not significantly different between the genotypic groups. These results are now included as Figure 9 of the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>We agree that this phenotypic difference between germline DKO and DA neuron-specific cDKO mice is intriguing, suggesting a non-cell autonomous contribution of LRRK in age-dependent accumulation of autophagic and lysosomal vacuoles in SNpc neurons of germline LRRK DKO mice. We will discuss the phenotypic difference further in the revised manuscript. We are generating microglial specific LRRK cDKO mice to investigate the role of LRRK in microglia and whether microglia contribute in a cell extrinsic manner to the regulation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in DA neurons.</p>
