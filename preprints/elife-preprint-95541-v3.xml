<title>Abstract</title><p>Male factors account for almost half of the causes of infertility. In rodents and humans, most of the components of semen are supplied by the seminal vesicles, and they support male reproductive ability, but there are many unknown details. In this study, the metabolic changes in the seminal vesicle epithelial cells were focused on, and the mechanisms by which testosterone affects the seminal plasma composition were investigated. A factor that improves the linear motility of sperm was secreted from the seminal vesicles, which were synthesized in an androgen-dependent manner. Bioassays, gene expression, and flux analysis studies demonstrated that testosterone promotes glucose uptake in seminal vesicle epithelial cells via GLUT4, resulting in oleic acid synthesis. Oleic acid was shown to be taken up by sperm and to promote linear motility, thereby improving fertilization rates both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. ACLY was a critical factor in this metabolic change, which produces oleic acid and enhances their fertilization ability <italic>in vivo</italic>. In conclusion, the critical role of testosterone-induced metabolic changes in the seminal vesicles is to ensure the synthesis of oleic acid, which is important for sperm fertilization <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings provide new perspectives for the development of potential biomarkers of male fertility and advances in the treatment of male infertility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infertility is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the failure to conceive within 12 months despite contraceptive-free sexual intercourse. Its prevalence has increased over the decades and accounts for 17.5% of couples worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The male partner is thought to be solely or in combination responsible for 50% of infertility cases, and the male factor in the etiology of infertility is highly recognized. Male fertility depends largely on the quality of semen composed of sperm and seminal plasma and decreases with aging(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Spermatogenesis occurs in the testes. While passing through the epididymis, sperm undergo a maturation process, but sperm do not fully acquire their fertilizing ability in the epididymis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Therefore, sperm collected from the epididymis cannot fertilize oocytes unless they acquire the ability to fertilize in <italic>in vitro</italic> and cannot maintain sustained liner motility required for migration from the uterus to the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Thus, when epididymal sperm are artificially inseminated to the cervix or uterus, fertilization rates are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). However, when epididymal sperm are mixed with seminal plasma at the time of ejaculation or when sperm are exposed to seminal plasma <italic>in vitro</italic>, even for only a brief period, they acquire <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization potential and are capable of passing through the female reproductive tract and fertilizing ovulated oocyte <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Thus, sperm formation occurs in the testis; they mature in the epididymis but only acquire the <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization ability after exposure to seminal plasma.</p>
<p>Seminal plasma is mainly produced in the seminal vesicles (approximately 65-75%), with approximately 20-30% produced by the prostate, and small amounts secreted by the bulbourethral and urethral glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The mixing of seminal fluid with accessory reproductive gland fluid during ejaculation causes semen to clot and liquefy in humans and causes vaginal plug formation in rodents. Vaginal plugs not only inhibit continuous mating but also play a role in maintaining sperm in the uterus and ensuring male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). TGFβ, a component of seminal plasma, increases antigen-specific Treg cells in the uterus of mice and humans, which induces immune tolerance, resulting in pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Furthermore, SVS2, secreted from the seminal vesicle, is also known to be required for sperm to escape attack by the female immune system in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In addition, seminal plasma contains various biochemical components that support sperm metabolism, including lipids and organic acids. Differences in the relative size of the accessory reproductive glands reflect differences in the seminal plasma composition. Accordingly, there are considerable differences in the properties of seminal plasma between animal species. Specifically,</p>
<p>Rosecrans et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) found significant differences in the levels of most biochemical components in seminal plasma compared to blood, with specific factors like fructose being rarely detected in blood but abundant in seminal plasma. Our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) documented that seminal plasma also contains creatine and fatty acids taken up by sperm within minutes. These substances play crucial roles in regulating sperm metabolic pathways and enhancing sperm motility. These observations indicate that seminal plasma not only alters the female immune system to protect sperm but also directly influences sperm metabolic pathways, facilitating the transformation of sperm capable of <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization.</p>
<p>Some specific factors that male accessory glands contribute to seminal plasma and impact male fertility have been elucidated. For example, surgical removal of seminal vesicles in male mice and rats was associated with infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The observation that fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and citric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) concentrations in seminal plasma of control mice and rats are higher than in castrated animals indicates that specific functions of the accessory glands might be affected by testicular-derived testosterone that is known to activate the intracellular androgen receptor (AR; NR3C4), required for gene regulation of transcription. AR-deficient mice have been found to be infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), and long-term administration of androgen receptor antagonists, like flutamide, abolished male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). AR-deficient mice and transcriptome analyses have identified specific targets of AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). In both mice and human, androgen levels decrease with aging, and their concentrations have been reported to cause a decrease in male fertility, especially ejaculated sperm motility. Therefore, the reduction of androgen concentrations may affect the metabolic mechanisms of the accessory reproductive glands and alter the composition of seminal plasma with aging. However, the metabolic mechanisms that impact sperm functions are governed by a complex of enzymatic reactions. Therefore, the intricate interplay between testosterone and seminal plasma synthesis in the accessory reproductive glands requires further investigation.</p>
<p>In this study, we first performed various bioassays to identify which accessory reproductive glands are essential for sperm fertility. Subsequently, comparative <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses were performed using a hypoandrogenic model. In addition, biochemical and molecular techniques such as RNA-seq, flux analysis, mass spectrometry, and knockdown experiments were employed. These analyses revealed that testosterone promotes the synthesis of oleic acid in seminal vesicle epithelial cells and its secretion into seminal plasma, and the oleic acid ensures the linear motility and fertilization ability of sperm.</p>

<title>The effect of androgen-dependent changes in mouse seminal vesicle secretions on the linear motility of sperm</title>
<p>A direct comparison was conducted to clarify the effects of secretions from the prostate and seminal vesicles on the motility parameters of epididymal sperm. Since it is difficult to collect the ejaculated semen of mice, a pseudo-seminal plasma was prepared by preparing fluids from the seminal vesicle secretion and homogenized prostate tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.1A</xref>). When seminal vesicle secretions were added to the HTF medium, the sperm motility, progressive motile, the straight line velocity (VSL), and the percentage of linearity (LIN) values increased significantly compared to when only prostate extract was used. However, the curvi-linear velocity (VCL) did not change (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B-F</xref>). Meanwhile, the secretions from the prostate and seminal vesicles did not affect the viscosity of the medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>). These results indicate that sperm exposure to seminal plasma factors significantly improves sperm linear motility (high VSL and LIN).</p>

<p>Androgens regulate the functions of seminal vesicles. Therefore, to elucidate whether the seminal vesicle factors, which enhance sperm linear motility, are synthesized in an androgen- dependent manner, bioassays were performed using seminal vesicle secretions collected from control mice or mice treated daily for 7 consecutive days with flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.1B</xref>). The results showed that Motile, Progressive motile, LIN, and VSL were significantly reduced in the sperm cultured in seminal vesicle secretions from flutamide-treated (Flutamide) compared to the sperm cultured in seminal vesicle secretions from controls (Ctrl) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1I-L</xref>). The reduction of VSL, Motile, and Progressive motile were also significantly lower in the sperm treated with seminal vesicle secretions from over 12 months old mice that showed low circular testosterone levels as compared with the sperm treated with seminal vesicle secretions from young adult mice (3 months old mice) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.2A,B</xref>). Furthermore, JC-1 staining to measure mitochondrial membrane potential, which is important for sperm linear motility, showed a significantly lower percentage of high mitochondrial membrane potential in sperm treated with the secretions of seminal vesicles from flutamide-treated mice and over 12 months old mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1M</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.1C,D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.2C</xref>). Since flutamide treatment and aging also affect spermatogenesis and sperm motility, it should be noted that epididymal sperm donors differ from seminal vesicle donors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). The baseline information for the epididymal sperm used in the experiment showed that the sperm were normal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.1A</xref>). These results indicated that androgen-dependent changes in seminal vesicle functions alter the levels/activity of seminal vesicle secretion factors, which regulate sperm linear motility. The changes in seminal vesicle functions were also induced by aging.</p>

<title>Testosterone-androgen receptor activity suppresses the proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title>
<p>To understand the difference between seminal vesicles that secrete factors for enhancing sperm linear motility and those that are impaired in this function, we performed histological analysis of seminal vesicles recovered from mice treated and non-treated with flutamide. In control mice, the seminal vesicle epithelial cells were in a single layer, and androgen receptors were localized in the nuclei of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). However, in mice treated with continuous administration of flutamide, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were multilayered, and the strong accumulation of androgen receptors in nucleus was not observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). To investigate the cause of this multilayering of cells, we performed Ki67 staining, a marker of cell proliferation, and apoptosis detection by TUNEL staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). The results showed that the percentage of Ki67- positive cells increased significantly after treatment with flutamide, but the percentage of TUNEL- positive cells did not change, suggesting that the testosterone-androgen receptor pathway is responsible for the inhibition of proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>). These changes of abnormal morphology and high proliferation activity were also observed in seminal vesicle of more than 12 months old mice that showed the low level of testosterone in serum (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2D-F</xref>). Therefore, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were collected and cultured in primary culture, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>. The changes in cell number were counted, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. When cultured without testosterone (c), the number of seminal vesicle epithelial cells increased day-dependent manner. However, the addition of testosterone significantly decreased the number of seminal vesicle epithelial cells during the 8-day culture period in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle on day 7 showed that the G0/G1 phase was significantly increased. The G2/M1 phase was significantly decreased by the addition of testosterone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F,G</xref>). These results indicate that the testosterone-androgen receptor pathway inhibits seminal vesicle epithelial cells in cell division.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Testosterone alters metabolic gene expression in seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title>
<p>To better understand the roles of testosterone in suppressing the proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells, RNA sequencing was done using the epithelial cells cultured with or without testosterone. DEG (Differential Expressed Genes) analysis revealed that a total of 23,459 genes were identified, including 997 upregulated genes and 3463 downregulated genes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells by testosterone relative to control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>). Genes largely upregulated by testosterone included those already reported in seminal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), such as the Seminal Vesicle Secretion (<italic>Svs</italic>) family (<italic>Svs1</italic>∼<italic>6</italic>), <italic>Pate4</italic>, <italic>Spinkl</italic>, <italic>Ceacam10</italic>, and <italic>Sva</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>,C). Therefore, the primary culture of seminal vesicle epithelial cells used in this experiment was considered to maintain the characteristics of seminal vesicle epithelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Many genes were downregulated by testosterone, and those with a high rate of variation included collagen synthase and <italic>Mmp2</italic>, which are involved in extracellular matrix formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>). However, KEGG analysis, rather than individual genes, was used to predict functions altered by testosterone. It was found that the expression of genes involved in the metabolic pathway was the most highly affected by testosterone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>). Because there is a close relationship between cell proliferation and metabolic activity and between metabolic substrates in seminal plasma and sperm motility, we hypothesized that testosterone induced changes in seminal vesicle epithelial cell metabolism alter the components of seminal plasma to mediate the enhancement of sperm motility.</p>

<title>Testosterone shifts the metabolic activity of seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title>
<p>In the presence of testosterone, the addition of glucose significantly activated the extracellular oxidation rate (ECAR) normalized by the total number of live cells compared to that in epithelial cells cultured without testosterone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A-C</xref>). However, there was no difference in the Oligomycin-sensitive ECAR, indicating that testosterone may increase glucose metabolism but does not enhance the expression of a group of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. To determine the metabolic fate of glycolytic end products, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were cultured with and without testosterone. Subsequently, the concentrations of pyruvate and lactate in the culture supernatant normalized by the total number of live cells were measured. The addition of testosterone significantly decreased the pyruvate concentration; however, the lactate concentration did not change significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D,E</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed mitochondrial metabolism using a flux analyzer, predicting that more glucose is metabolized, pyruvate is synthesized in response to testosterone, and is further metabolized in the mitochondria. Unexpectedly, when measuring mitochondrial respiratory metabolism normalized by the total number of live cells with a Flux analyzer, the basal respiratory rate (the electron transport chain activity) was significantly decreased by testosterone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4F-J</xref>). Oligomycin-sensitive respiration was also significantly suppressed by exposure to testosterone. Furthermore, the FCCP uncoupled respiration and spare respiration capacity were also significantly decreased in response to testosterone treatment. These results suggest that testosterone does not reduce transient enzyme activity in mitochondria but rather weakens the metabolic pathway of the mitochondrial TCA cycle and/or the electron transport chain due to the changes in gene expression patterns in seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</p>

<p>The expression of genes involved in glucose catabolism and anabolism in the <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system of seminal vesicle epithelial cells was analyzed by qPCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>). The gene expression of glucose transporter (<italic>Glut</italic>) and enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway was not significantly affected by testosterone, consistent with the results of metabolic flux analysis, which showed that the glycolytic pathway was not enhanced despite the activation of the glycolysis. Furthermore, testosterone did not significantly affect the expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in the TCA cycle in mitochondria. However, the expression of enzymes involved in the electron transport chain was significantly decreased. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>Acly</italic>, which encodes an enzyme that reconverts citric acid formed in the TCA cycle to Acetyl CoA and induces cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, was significantly increased by testosterone. Although <italic>Hmgcr</italic>, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis, was unchanged, the expression of <italic>Acc</italic>, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, was significantly upregulated by testosterone.

<title>Mechanism of testosterone-induced enhancement of glucose uptake and, thereby, fatty acid synthesis</title>
<p>Since it is known that testosterone regulates the intracellular localization of GLUT4, we focused on the intracellular localization of GLUT4 and its glucose uptake capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The effect of testosterone on glucose uptake in seminal vesicle epithelial cells was analyzed using fluorescence-labeled glucose.

<p>Furthermore, immunostaining analysis of the localization of GLUT4 in seminal vesicles revealed that GLUT4 was translocalized outside the nucleus of seminal vesicle epithelial cells under the presence of testosterone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>). These data suggest that GLUT4 was partially localized at the plasma membrane and contributed to glucose uptake. In contrast, in seminal vesicles from mice treated with flutamide continuously, no strong signal was detected at the presumed location of GLUT4 near the plasma membrane of seminal vesicle epithelial cells, even though the protein expression level was not affected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>,D). The same characteristics were observed in aged mice.</p>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the fatty acids synthesis was performed by GC-MS.

<title>Oleic acid (18:1) is taken up by sperm and promotes their linear motility</title>
<p>We observed that seminal vesicles secrete testosterone-dependent factors that induce sperm to move linear and that seminal vesicle epithelial cells synthesize and secrete oleic acid in a testosterone-dependent manner. In order to examine whether oleic acid is a factor that induces sperm linear motility, we examined whether or not oleic acid is taken up by sperm and then changes in sperm motility pattern. When epididymal sperm were incubated with fluorescently labeled oleic acid, the fluorescent signal was selectively detected in the midpiece of the sperm after quenching of extracellular fluorescence (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7A</xref>). The fluorescence intensity of sperm detected by flow cytometry significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7B</xref>, C). Oleic acid did not affect sperm and progressive motile at any concentration compared to the control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7D</xref>,E). In oleic acid-treated sperm, VSL was significantly increased in a dose- dependent manner in the 0 to 50 nM (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7F</xref>). LIN values were highest when 10 nM oleic acid was added (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7G</xref>). A flux analyzer was used to monitor real-time changes in mitochondrial β- oxidation normalized by the number of sperm to quantify metabolic changes in mitochondrial activity. The injection of 10 nM oleic acid induced a significant increase in OCR. Etomoxir, a β- oxidation inhibitor, significantly decreased the OCR that was induced by oleic acid (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7H</xref>, Supplemental Figure 5A). In situ ATP detection by BioTracker ATP-Red revealed that the percentage of sperm with high ATP production was significantly increased under the presence of oleic acid (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7I</xref>). To investigate the effect of oleic acid on the linear motility of sperm and its effect on the fertilization ability of sperm, <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) was performed. When the sperm number was sufficient, there was no change in the cleavage rate after <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization, but when the sperm count was reduced to less than one-tenth of the conventional level, the cleavage rate increased compared to the control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7J,K</xref>). Due to the strong effect of the decapacitation factor, we found that seminal vesicle fluid reduces the fertilization rate in IVF (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 5B</xref>). This results from inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation of sperm and acrosome reaction by seminal vesicle secretions. However, oleic acid did not have this inhibitory effect (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 5C-F</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine whether the addition of oleic acid to low quality seminal plasma (collected from flutamide-treated mice) restores <italic>in vivo</italic> the fertilization potential of epididymal sperm, sperm treated with seminal plasma collected from control or flutamide-treated mice was used for artificial insemination.

Although not significant, adding oleic acid to the seminal secretions of flutamide-treated mice (Flu+OA) increased the fertilization rate to 61.3 ± 3.9% (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7L</xref>). These results indicated that the physiological role of oleic acid is to increase the probability of fertilization by keeping the linear sperm motility. This increases the likelihood of the sperm passing through the female reproductive tract and environments that are unfavorable to sperm survival.</p>

<title>ACLY expression is upregulated by testosterone and is essential for the metabolic shift of seminal vesicle epithelial cells that mediates sperm linear motility</title>
<p>ACLY is upregulated in seminal epithelial cells as a factor that enables the utilization of citric acid from the TCA cycle for fatty acid synthesis outside the mitochondria. Therefore, we performed siRNA knockdown experiments on ACLY to clarify the impact of ACLY on the cellular metabolic shift. The addition of testosterone significantly increased the amount of ACLY protein in seminal epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8A</xref>,B). Viral infection with siRNAs encoding <italic>Acly-</italic> targeted siRNAs markedly decreased the amount of ACLY (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8C</xref>). When ACLY was knocked down using shRNA, the proliferation arrest caused by testosterone was released, and the cells began to proliferate again (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8D</xref>). This knockdown of ACLY increased the oxygen consumption of seminal epithelial cells in the control and testosterone-treated group (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8E</xref>,F). Thus, ACLY expression is associated with mitochondrial metabolic pathway activity in seminal epithelial cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of ACLY also significantly suppressed testosterone-induced fatty acid synthesis in seminal epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8G</xref>). According to the GC-MS quantification results, the amount of fatty acids secreted into the culture medium was also reduced by ACLY knockdown. In particular, the enhancement of oleic acid secretion by testosterone was inhibited by ACLY knockdown (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8H-J</xref>). Supernatants from epithelial cells of the testosterone-added group induced motility and linear motility (Highest VSL and LIN; <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8K-N</xref>). However, the knockdown of ACLY significantly reduced the effects of the culture supernatant on sperm motility and LIN (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8K-N</xref>). These results found that cell proliferation stops when a metabolic shift mediated by ACLY occurs, and glucose is reallocated to fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acid synthesis is an important function of the seminal vesicles, and it was found that when testosterone is present, fatty acid synthesis enhancement and cell proliferation stop simultaneously. However, it is not known what effects occur when cell proliferation stops.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Seminal plasma has a variety of functions, including sperm transport, nutritional support, interactions with the female reproductive tract, and especially the regulation of its relationship with the female immune system. Mammalian seminal plasma is secreted mainly from the seminal vesicle and is rich in cytokines, prostaglandins, and SVS family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). For this reason, recent studies have focused on the immunomodulatory function of seminal plasma in the female reproductive tract. On the other hand, fructose and lipids in seminal plasma are the major energy sources for sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). However, although metabolomic analyses of seminal plasma have shown that metabolic substrates are present at higher concentrations in seminal plasma than in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), how these substrates are synthesized and specifically how they alter sperm motility has not been determined. Moreover, though the motility of ejaculated spermatozoa is known to decrease with aging, few reports have revealed age-related changes in the seminal vesicles, which are responsible for seminal plasma synthesis.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on the reproductive organs that synthesize seminal vesicle secretion as target organs for testosterone and found that factors formed by testosterone-dependent metabolic changes in seminal vesicles activate sperm mitochondria and enhance their linear motility. Testosterone is known to activate intracellular ARs and alter intracellular metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), prostate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). ARs are known to directly regulate the expression of glycolytic and lipid metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In the present study, the nuclear localization of AR in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (i.e., functioning as a transcription factor) and the activation of the glycolytic system by testosterone were similar to those in the above cell types. In seminal vesicle epithelial cells, an increased trend in the expression of <italic>Glut3</italic> and an enhancement of GLUT4 function were observed in a testosterone-dependent manner. Such effects of testosterone on glucose metabolism have also been reported in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, where testosterone leads to the phosphorylation of GLUT4 and enhances its translocation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). This is consistent with the results of our metabolic flux analyses, which show that testosterone increases the rate of glycolysis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells by increasing glucose uptake. We further confirmed that GLUT4 is the transporter that mediates this glucose uptake using indinavir, a GLUT4- specific inhibitor.</p>
<p>This study suggests that fatty acid synthesis is an important function of the seminal vesicles, which provide an environment where the ejaculated sperm can carry out active metabolism. The shift to fatty acid synthesis was consistent with the cessation of cell proliferation in the presence of testosterone. This mechanism could prevent the seminal vesicles from excessively consuming the substrates necessary for sperm motility. Manipulation of ACLY expression in mouse myoblasts and embryonic stem cells has been shown to alter the TCA cycle into a &quot;non-normal cycle&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). One advantage of the non-normal TCA cycle is its ability to retain carbon instead of combusting it and to regenerate the cytosolic NAD+ needed to maintain glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). It suggests that ACLY, activated by testosterone, may suppress proliferation by skipping several steps in the mitochondrial TCA cycle and minimizing ATP production associated with aerobic respiration in seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Testosterone has been reported to cause hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Cell hypertrophy is partly due to the accumulation of fatty acids in the cytoplasm, which causes significant damage to cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). On the other hand, normal cell hypertrophy, especially in myofibers, involves the activation of signaling molecules such as Myc, hypoxia-inducible factor, and Pi3k-Akt-mTor, which regulate metabolic reprogramming in cancer by increasing glucose uptake in the presence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). In the present study, induction of ACLY expression by testosterone not only decreased cycling in the TCA cycle, but also promoted glucose assimilation, which played an important role in fatty acid synthesis. Thus, in tissues where fatty acid synthesis is promoted, either β-oxidation-dependent ATP production in mitochondria or the secretion of fatty acids occurs to maintain cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), providing evidence to explain why the presence of fatty acids in the cell has no adverse effect. In accessory reproductive glands, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, the glucose uptake is activated in a testosterone dependent. However, mitochondrial respiration is not enhanced, cell proliferation is not induced, and the metabolites are used as a substrate for sperm motility.</p>
<p>This may be because, in the prostate, pyruvate synthesized by the glycolytic system in response to testosterone is converted to acetyl CoA, which is then converted to citric acid in the TCA cycle, citric acid is released as the main component of seminal plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>The testosterone-dependent growth of cancerous prostate epithelial cells may be due to genetic mutations, such as elevated expression of the gene encoding aconitase, which converts citric acid to isocitrate, which blocks the TCA cycle and inhibits citric acid secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). On the other hand, in the analysis of seminal epithelial cells, testosterone treatment induced the expression of <italic>Acc</italic>, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, and <italic>Elovl6</italic>, which desaturates to oleic acid, significantly increasing total saturated fatty acid and oleic acid content. Therefore, testosterone promotes glucose conversion into fatty acids, especially oleic acid, in seminal epithelial cells. Although there is a commonality in the activation of the glycolytic system testosterone target tissues, the different expression patterns of genes involved in metabolism in mitochondria may exert their specific functions in each tissue. In addition to genes involved in fatty acid synthesis such as <italic>Fasn</italic> and <italic>Elovl6</italic>, <italic>Acly</italic> is also encoded in a region in close proximity to human chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11, suggesting that in seminal vesicle epithelial cells, this region is targeted to promote gene expression. The co-regulation of these genes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells leads to synthesizing oleic acid that ensures sperm motility and function.</p>
<p>Decreased testosterone synthesis in the testes is a phenomenon observed with aging associated with decreased spermatogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). However, the probability of obtaining sperm without ICSI or IVF is extremely low, despite the presence of sufficient numbers of sperm with normal-morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). This indicates that testosterone plays a major role not only in spermatogenesis but also in the functional maturation of sperm. In this study, metabolic abnormalities induced by inhibition of androgen receptor function caused abnormal proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells in aged mice. In other words, the findings of the seminal vesicle epithelial cell culture experiments and flutamide treatment may mimic the changes that occur with aging. Oleic acid synthesis by testosterone-dependent metabolic pathways was regulated in seminal vesicle epithelial cells and the oleic acid stimulated sperm motility and enhanced <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization success. It could be assumed that a decrease in testosterone levels causes abnormalities in the components of human semen. Specifically, the results open the possibility of translational studies to understand human male infertility, especially in cases of failure to conceive by natural mating or artificial insemination.</p>
<p>Because seminal plasma contains components specific to certain male reproductive organs, differences in protein composition may reflect pathological processes in these specific organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). However, although proteomic and metabolomic analyses of seminal plasma have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), the functional changes in seminal plasma, especially the effects on <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization potential, are not fully understood. Differences in fatty acid concentrations, including oleic acid, in seminal plasma may provide a predictive marker for the fertilization potential of both human and domestic animal semen. Furthermore, the addition of oleic acid to low-quality semen improved fertilization rates associated with artificial insemination, offering a strategy for improving artificial insemination. In our previous study, the addition of fatty acids to the thawing medium of frozen bull sperm improved linear motility and viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The similarities between mouse and human seminal vesicle epithelial cells demonstrated in this study have strong potential for the clinical application of these observations.</p>
<p>Overall, the results of the studies described herein strongly support the hypothesis that testosterone-dependent glucose to oleic acid conversion processes are required for normal seminal plasma functions in the seminal vesicle and normal reproductive performance in males (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig.10</xref>). This study advances our understanding of the role of testosterone in glucose metabolism and fatty acid synthesis and lays the groundwork for future research and potential therapeutic interventions in reproductive biology and fertility.</p>

<caption><title>Metabolic changes in the seminal vesicle epithelial cells by testosterone improve the fertility of sperm.</title>
<p>Left part: Testosterone promotes glucose uptake by changes in the localization of GLUT4 in seminal vesicle epithelial cells. ATP-citrate-lyase (ACLY) activated by testosterone promotes fatty acid synthesis by skipping some tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle steps. Simultaneously, cell proliferation in the epididymal epithelial cells is suppressed. Testosterone also promotes the synthesis of oleic acid from acetyl-CoA synthesized by ACLY. Right part: Oleic acid, incorporated into the sperm midpiece, increases the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in sperm mitochondria and increases ATP production. Therefore, oleic acid in seminal plasma is important for male fertility because it improves sperm linear motility and fertilization ability.</p></caption>

The ACLY sequence targeted by the shRNA vector used in this study was 5′-GCAGCAAAGATGTTCAGTAAA-3′. Lentivirally transduced cells were prepared according to manufacture protocol. Immediately after isolation, the mouse seminal vesicle epithelial cells were cultured overnight in a medium containing 5 µg/mL polybrene (VectorBuilder) and lentiviral particles expressing an shRNA targeting ACLY or a scramble (Multiplicity of Infection of 10). After an additional overnight incubation in a fresh culture medium, the cells were incubated for 5 days in a medium containing 1 µg/ml puromycin (19752-64, Nacalai tesque). 100 ng/mL of testosterone was added to all procedures for the testosterone-treated group. Infection efficiency, calculated based on the number of GFP-positive cells using an APX100 Digital Imaging System, ranged between 70% and 90%.</p>

<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>Protein samples of mouse seminal vesicle epithelial cells, seminal vesicle tissue, and sperm were prepared by homogenization in cell lysis buffer (04719964001, cOmplete™ Lysis-M EDTA-free, Roche) and diluted with an equal volume of sample buffer solution containing 2-ME (2 ×) for SDS-PAGE (30566-22, Nacalai tesque). The extracts (10 μg protein) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (10600069, Cytiva, Tokyo, Japan). The membranes were then treated with Tris- buffered saline and Tween 20 (TBST, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) Non-Fat Dry milk (MORINAGA MILK INDUSTRY Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for the nonspecific reaction was blocked. When detecting phosphotyrosine, containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was used as a blocking agent. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies: anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1:10,000; 8959; Cell Signaling), anti-GLUT4 antibody (1:100; ab33780; Abcam), anti-ACLY antibody (1:10,000; ab40793; Abcam) or anti-α/β-Tubulin antibody (1:1,000; 2148S; Cell Signaling). The next day, membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with HRP-labeled antibody specific for rabbit IgG (1:4000; 7074S; Cell Signaling). The bands were visualized by using Enhanched Chemiluminescence detection systems (RPN2232, Cytiva) and ChemiDoc<sup>TM</sup> MP Imaging System (BIO-RAD Laboratories). The bands were analyzed by using the software ImageJ. Densitometry analysis was performed using the ImageJ Gel Analysis tool, and the background of the gel was also removed individually for each band. The full-length blotting images are shown in Supplementary Figure 7.</p>

<title>ATP production in sperm</title>
<p>After 1 hour of incubation in the presence or absence of oleic acid (10 nM), ATP in sperm was visualized by BioTracker ATP-Red (SCT045, Sigma-Aldrich). The sperm were incubated with 10 nM of working solution containing BioTracker ATP-Red dye at 37 °C for 60 min in the dark. After washing, the sperm pellet was resuspended in the base medium and analyzed with the flow cytometry using a 488 nm laser and a filter with a bandwidth of 574/26 nm. A total of 100,000 sperm events were analyzed. The sperm population is shown in Supplementary Figure 6.</p>

<title>Artificial insemination</title>
<p>To examine the involvement of seminal vesicle secretions in fertilization, sperm from C57BL/6N mice were injected directly into the uterine bodies of superovulated CD1 mice by syringe, as previously described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). CD1 female mice were injected intraperitoneally with 8 IU eCG to stimulate follicle development and used as recipients for artificial insemination 48 hours later. Artificial seminal fluid was prepared in HTF medium to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL of collected control or frutamide-derived seminal vesicle secretions. As rescue experiment, 10 nM of oleic acid was added to the frutamide-derived seminal secretions. Cauda epididymis sperm was suspended with above artificial seminal fluid (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> sperm/mL), and a total of 40 µL (20 µL each per uterus) was injected through the cervix of the female mice. After artificial insemination, 7.5 IU of hCG was injected to stimulate ovulation. Subsequently, a mixture of vaseline and paraffin with a ratio of 10:1 was injected to form an artificial plug around the cervix. After 36∼48 hours of sperm injection, the putative eggs were retrieved from the oviducts. The number of two-cell embryos and mature unfertilized eggs were counted and used to estimate the fertilization success rate.</p>

In FSC-A and FSC-H dot plots and FSC-A and FSC-W dot plots, similar-size cells were accumulated near area; thus, using these plots, again similar-size cells were selected (R2, R3). The cells in R3 were applied to the propidium iodide (PI) histogram plot. Labelling DNA with PI allows fluorescence-based analysis of the cell cycle. The intensity of PI fluorescence correlates with the amount of DNA in each cell. Comparing the G1 and G2 phases, the amount of DNA doubles in the G2 phase, so the fluorescence intensity of the cell population also doubles.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this revised report, Yamanaka and colleagues investigate a proposed mechanism by which testosterone modulates seminal plasma metabolites in mice. Based on limited evidence in previous versions of the report, the authors softened the claim that oleic acid derived from seminal vesicle epithelium strongly affects linear progressive motility in isolated cauda epididymal sperm in vitro. Though the report still contains somewhat ambiguous references to the strength of the relationship between fatty acids and sperm motility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Often, reported epidydimal sperm from mice have lower percent progressive motility compared with sperm retrieved from the uterus or by comparison with human ejaculated sperm. The findings in this report may improve in vitro conditions to overcome this problem, as well as add important physiological context to the role of reproductive tract glandular secretions in modulating sperm behaviors. The strongest observations are related to the sensitivity of seminal vesicle epithelial cells to testosterone. The revisions include the addition of methodological detail, modified language to reflect the nuance of some of the measurements, as well as re-performed experiments with more appropriate control groups. The findings are likely to be of general interest to the field by providing context for follow-on studies regarding the relationship between fatty acid beta oxidation and sperm motility pattern.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The connection between media fatty acids and sperm motility pattern remains inconclusive.</p>

<p>Using a combination of in vivo studies with testosterone-inhibited and aged mice with lower testosterone levels as well as isolated mouse and human seminal vesicle epithelial cells the authors show that testosterone induces an increase in glucose uptake. They find that testosterone induces a difference in gene expression with a focus on metabolic enzymes. Specifically, they identify increased expression of enzymes regulating cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to increased production of 18:1 oleic acid. The revised version strengthens the role of ACLY as the main regulator of seminal vesicle epithelial cell metabolic programming. The authors propose that fatty acids are secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells and are taken up by sperm, positively affecting sperm function. A lipid mixture mimicking the lipids secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells, however, only has a small and mostly non-significant effect on sperm motility, suggesting the authors were not apply to pinpoint the seminal vesicle fluid component that positively affects sperm function.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this revised report, Yamanaka and colleagues investigate a proposed mechanism by which testosterone modulates seminal plasma metabolites in mice. The authors identify oleic acid as a particularly important metabolite, derived from seminal vesicle epithelium, that stimulates linear progressive motility in isolated cauda epidydimal sperm in vitro. The authors provide additional experimental evidence of a testosterone dependent mechanism of oleic acid production by the seminal vesicle epithelium.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Often, reported epidydimal sperm from mice have lower percent progressive motility compared with sperm retrieved from the uterus or by comparison with human ejaculated sperm. The findings in this report may improve in vitro conditions to overcome this problem, as well as add important physiological context to the role of reproductive tract glandular secretions in modulating sperm behaviors. The strongest observations are related to the sensitivity of seminal vesicle epithelial cells to testosterone. The revisions include addition of methodological detail, modified language to reflect the nuance of some of the measurements, as well as re-performed experiments with more appropriate control groups. The findings are likely to be of general interest to the field by providing context for follow-on studies regarding the relationship between fatty acid beta oxidation and sperm motility pattern.</p>

<p>Thank you for summarizing and your positive evaluation of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Support for the proposed mechanism is stronger in this revised report than in the previous report, but there are many challenges in measuring sperm metabolism and its direct relationship with motility patterns. This study is no exception and largely relies on correlations between various experiments in lieu of direct testing. Additionally, the discussion is framed from a human pre-clinical perspective, and it should be noted that the reproductive physiology between mice and humans is very different.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing out the challenges in our paper. We appreciate your comment on the limited evidence supporting the direct relationship between sperm metabolism and motility patterns under current experimental conditions. Based on your and reviewer2’s suggestions, we have decided to remove the experiments and discussion on the “effects of OA on sperm metabolism, motility and fertility (Fig. 7, Supplemental Figure 5A and C-F.)” and the corresponding parts in the Discussion section from the paper. (See also Reviewer 2's main comment) These data mainly show correlations, and did not show direct evidence of causality. Instead, we added a new experiment to the manuscript, in which a lipid mixture that mimics the fatty acid profile secreted testosterone-dependently from seminal vesicle epithelial cells was added to the sperm culture medium (New Supplemental Figure 5, Lines 259-268). In this experiment, motility parameters were measured using CASA. This experiment evaluates the direct effects of lipid exposure on sperm motility. With these revisions, we are able to focus on the metabolic changes caused by testosterone in seminal vesicle epithelial cells, which are the central focus of our research. We have added a short statement agreeing the potential importance of OA and our intention to more rigorously investigate the role of OA in sperm function in subsequent studies (Lines 402-407).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have revised text, clearly state the limitations of the species difference and clarify that the translational aspects to humans are speculative (Lines 383-384, 395-397, 408-410).</p>
<p>We appreciate your guidance. We believe that these changes will strengthen our research.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Using a combination of in vivo studies with testosterone-inhibited and aged mice with lower testosterone levels as well as isolated mouse and human seminal vesicle epithelial cells the authors show that testosterone induces an increase in glucose uptake. They find that testosterone induces a difference in gene expression with a focus on metabolic enzymes. Specifically, they identify increased expression of enzymes regulating cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to increased production of 18:1 oleic acid. The revised version strengthens the role of ACLY as the main regulator of seminal vesicle epithelial cell metabolic programming. 18:1 oleic acid is secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells and taken up by sperm, inducing an increase in mitochondrial respiration. The difference in sperm motility and in vivo fertilization in the presence of 18:1 oleic acid and the absence of testosterone, however, is small. Additional experiments should be included to further support that oleic acid positively affects sperm function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for carefully reading the manuscript and for your comments. We appreciate your understanding that the role of ACLY in metabolic programming of seminal vesicle epithelial cells has been strengthened in the revised version. On the other hand, we agree with your view that the increase in sperm motility and fertilization rate by oleic acid is minimal under the current experimental conditions. We agree that further evidence is needed to support our conclusion regarding the positive effects of oleic acid on sperm function. Based on your comments and our re-evaluation of the data, we have decided to remove the experiments and discussion on “OA and sperm motility” from the current paper (Fig. 7, Supplemental Figure 5A and C-F). In the revised paper, we have significantly toned down the claims on the previous role of oleic acid and instead focused on the metabolic regulatory mechanisms of seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</p>
<p>We hope that these revisions address your concerns and improve the overall clarity of the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>Note from the reviewing editor: The reviewers agree that the revised manuscript is significantly improved and view the work as important. Both reviewers agree that the evidence for testosterone effects on seminal vesicle epithelial cells to support fatty acid synthesis is strong and suggest that the authors tone down their conclusion of oleic acid effect on sperm motility as the effect is very small. With this minor changes, the evidence to support the conclusion of the study is viewed as solid.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for recognizing the improvements that we have made to our manuscript and for appreciating the importance of our research. We also appreciate your assessment that the evidence for the effect of testosterone on seminal vesicle epithelial cells that support fatty acid synthesis is solid.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we agree with the two reviewers that the effect of oleic acid on sperm motility is limited and that the relevant data do not measure a direct relationship. Therefore, we have decided to withdraw the data set on the effect of oleic acid on sperm (Fig. 7, Supplemental Figure 5A and C-F) and focus this paper on seminal vesicle epithelial cells (in response to reviewer 2's suggestion). Given that testosterone-induced lipid (Fatty acid) synthesis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells is a key aspect of our study, we have included additional experiments in the revised manuscript to show how lipids affect sperm (New Supplemental Figure5, Lines 259-263).</p>
<p>With these revisions, the manuscript emphasizes the importance of testosterone-dependent fatty acid synthesis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells and the fact that this includes oleic acid. The title has also been partially revised in line with these revisions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>With the experiments included in their revised version the authors strengthen their conclusions about testosterone-induced metabolic reprogramming in seminal vesicle cells resulting in reduced proliferation. The experiments surrounding ACLY are well-designed and give insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms. For other parts, the manuscript became less clear and it is often hard to follow the author's line of thoughts for their conclusions.</p>
<p>Based on the experiments shown in the manuscript this reviewer is still not convinced that OA positively affects sperm function. The changes in linear motility are minor, blastocyst levels are lower and the authors do not show that OA alone positively affects cleavage rate during AI. Without additional experiments that show a stronger effect on sperm function, the authors should consider focusing the manuscript exclusively on seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your constructive comments on our paper. We thank the reviewer for pointing out that the effect of oleic acid (OA) on sperm function is limited in our current experiments. As reviewer 1 also pointed out, we agree that further experiments and improved methodology are needed to reliably demonstrate the functional effects of OA on sperm. Because the strength of the data on the direct relationship between fatty acids in seminal fluid and improved sperm function is currently insufficient, we have removed the data set for oleic acid and sperm motility (Fig. 7, Supplemental Figure 5A and C-F) and focused on the “the mechanism of metabolic regulation of testosterone in seminal vesicle epithelial cells”. We have consistently narrowed the focus of the paper to the theme of “how testosterone changes energy metabolism in seminal vesicle epithelial cells”. In accordance with this change, the structure of the paper has also been partially revised (red text in the manuscript). With these revisions, the main point of the paper focuses on the mechanism by which testosterone regulates metabolic pathways in the seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</p>

<p>(1) 45-55 still need major revision. It will not become clear to the reader what the authors mean by epididymal maturation. 'Ability to fertilize in in vitro?' Epididymal sperm are moving linearly in the absence of seminal vesicle fluid. Increased progressive motility, hyperactivation, and the ability to undergo the acrosome reaction are induced upon exposure to seminal vesicle fluid. The authors should introduce the concept of capacitation and that capacitation can be induced in vitro by exposure to bicarbonate and a cholesterol acceptor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the ambiguity of epididymal maturation, the need to clarify the concept of capacitation, and the role of seminal plasma in this context. The revised text explains that epididymal maturation only gives sperm their potential ability to fertilize. It also explains that it is the subsequent capacitation process—inducible in vitro by incubation with bicarbonate and cholesterol acceptors—that gives full fertilization potential. On the other hands, we emphasize that in vivo, seminal plasma, which contains both capacitation-promoting and decapacitation factors, plays a key role in fine-tuning the timing of capacitation, ensuring that sperm acquire fertilization competence at the appropriate moment. We hope that these revisions clarify our intended meaning and strengthen the overall message of the paragraph. (lines 42-54)</p>
<p>“Sperm that have completed spermatogenesis in the testis acquire their potential to fertilize while maturing in the epididymis (5–7). The physiological change of sperm during fertilization process are collectively referred to as “capacitation”. This change includes a large amplitude of flagella (called hyperactivation) and developing the capacity to undergo the acrosome reaction, and can be induced by culturing sperm collected from the epididymis in a medium containing bicarbonate and cholesterol acceptors (8, 9). However, once capacitation is complete, sperm cannot maintain that state for a long time. Therefore, even if epididymal sperm that have not been exposed to seminal plasma are artificially inseminated into the cervix or uterus, the fertilization rate remains low (10–12). That is because, in vivo, during ejaculation, exposure of epididymal sperm to seminal plasma masks the unintended capacitation as they pass through the female reproductive tract and ensures fertilization of sperm that reach the oviduct (13). In other words, seminal plasma plays an important role in fine-tuning the timing of sperm capacitation and in maintaining the sustained sperm motility needed to reach the oviduct.”</p>

<p>(2) 81: Similar as in their rebuttal the authors should further elute on the connection between fructose, citrate, and testosterone. That still does not become clear. Based on the author's explanation in the rebuttal, why are citrate and fructose levels higher when the animals are castrated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank you for the opportunity to clarify our statement regarding the relationship between fructose, citrate, and testosterone. Our original explanation was intended to reflect the fact that testosterone from the testes has a stimulating effect on the accessory reproductive glands, and to report that the concentrations of fructose and citric acid were higher in the non-castrated (control) animals than in the castrated animals. In castrated animals, the absence of testosterone leads to decreased activity of these glands and, consequently, lower levels of these metabolites. To make this clear, we have revised the manuscript as follows. (lines 76-82)</p>
<p>“Several specific factors produced by the male accessory glands that contribute to seminal plasma and impact male fertility have been elucidated. For example, surgical removal of seminal vesicles in male mice and rats was associated with infertility (17, 22, 23). The observations that fructose (24) and citric acid (25) concentrations in seminal plasma of control mice and rats are higher than in castrated animals suggest that the specific metabolism of the accessory glands might be affected by testosterone derived from the testes, which activate intracellular androgen receptors (AR; NR3C4) required for gene regulation of transcription.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) 111: This reviewer does not understand the author's obsession with reporting linear motility. Sperm are moving linearly when isolated from the epididymis. Again, increase of progressive motility is a well-defined hallmark of capacitation and primarily used in the field when discussing changes in sperm motility during capacitation. This reviewer is assuming that the changes in progressive vs linear motility in Fig. 7 are not significant because the data is more scattered. The % increase seems to be approximately the same. The same is true for Fig. 8. The increase in LIN is so small and not dose-dependent that this reviewer is not comfortable making that one of the main conclusions of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our claim is based on the observation that seminal vesicle secretions significantly improve the linear motility (VSL and LIN) of sperm even in an environment that does not contain capacitation-inducing factors such as BSA. We interpret this as a survival strategy for sperm to pass through the female reproductive tract efficiently. Therefore, we believe that this does not mean that the meaning of “progressive motility” in the context of conventional capacitation is the same as that of progressive motility observed in seminal plasma.</p>
<p>However, the reviewer's point that the current data set does not sufficiently support what the minor increase in linear motility caused by oleic acid means is agreed with. Therefore, we have decided to withdraw the dataset on the effect of oleic acid on sperm motility (Fig. 7, Supplemental Figure 5A and C-F) and have revised the conclusion. (Lines 406-410)</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have included an explanation of antimycin as a control in the main text (Lines 920-921). In addition, we have added some reference scatter plots and also added an explanation of the gating strategy between low and high membrane potentials (Supplemental Figure 1C and D, Lines 1101-1104).

<p>(5) 190: What do the authors mean by: 'However, there was no difference in the Oligomycin-sensitive ECAR, indicating that testosterone may increase glucose metabolism but does not enhance the expression of a group of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway.'</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our original intention was to state that testosterone probably increases basal glycolytic flux via increased glucose uptake (as supported by the GLUT4 translocation data), but does not increase maximal glycolytic capacity, as indicated by the lack of difference in oligomycin-sensitive ECAR.</p>
<p>However, as Reviewer 1 previously pointed out, we agree that the assay conditions themselves, such as the use of oligomycin to inhibit oxidative mitochondria, may create non-physiological conditions and not fully reflect the energy distribution in vivo. Under these conditions, there is a possibility that the flow of glycolysis will increase artificially as a compensatory reaction, and parameters such as “maximum glycolytic capacity” should have been interpreted with caution.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have revised the manuscript to clarify that our data are a single-time point under defined experimental conditions and do not necessarily provide direct insight into changes in expression or activity of individual glycolytic enzymes.</p>
<p>“These data indicate that testosterone enhances glucose utilization. This leads to the interpretation that testosterone increases the flow of glycolysis by increasing glucose uptake and alters metabolic flux distribution.” (Lines 186-188)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) 205: Could the authors elaborate further on how they came to this conclusion: 'These results suggest that testosterone does not reduce transient enzyme activity in mitochondria but rather weakens the metabolic pathway of the mitochondrial TCA cycle and/or the electron transport chain due to the changes in gene expression patterns in seminal vesicle epithelial cells.' Based on their results at this point the authors have no insights about changes in enzyme activity or gene expression that might explain the phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our statement is based on the following observations. In testosterone-treated cells, the addition of glucose increased ECAR, suggesting an increase in glycolytic flux due to an increase in glucose uptake. On the other hand, mitochondrial respiratory parameters (basal respiration, oligomycin-sensitive respiration, FCCP-uncoupled respiration, and reserve respiratory capacity) were significantly decreased under testosterone treatment.</p>
<p>From these results, it was speculated that testosterone promotes the redistribution of metabolic flux, directing it away from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and towards the glycolytic pathway and, possibly, lipid synthesis. However, as the reviewers correctly point out, at this point, we have not directly measured changes in the activity or expression of individual enzymes in the TCA cycle or ETC. Therefore, in the next experiment, we extracted mRNA from the cells and performed gene expression analysis using real-time PCR. To make this clear, we have revised the manuscript as follows.</p>
<p>“Overall, these data indicate that testosterone promotes the redistribution of metabolic flux. In other words, testosterone increased glycolysis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells while decreasing mitochondrial respiration. To determine whether these changes were accompanied by changes in gene expression of specific metabolic-related enzymes, we analyzed gene expression levels.” (Lines 201-205)</p>

<p>(7) 219: Characterizing ACLY as an enzyme of the ETC is misleading. ACLY is a cytosolic enzyme that connects the TCA cycle with fatty acid synthesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank you for pointing out that the description of the function of ACLY could be misunderstood. We agree that characterizing ACLY as an enzyme of the ETC could be misleading. Therefore, we have revised the sentence to clearly indicate that ACLY is a cytosolic enzyme that links the TCA cycle with fatty acid synthesis. The revised text is as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;Interestingly, testosterone significantly increased the expression of Acly, which encodes a cytoplasmic enzyme that converts citrate transported from the TCA cycle into acetyl-CoA, a substrate that is essential for fatty acid synthesis.&quot; (lines216-218)</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer for this point. In preliminary experiments, we analyzed ETC protein expression using real-time qPCR. Our data show that treatment with flutamide significantly upregulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial ETC, such as mtND6, while decreasing the expression of the lipogenic genes Acly and Acc. These additional data are now presented in Supplementary Figure S3B. (lines 223-226)</p>

<p>(10) 285: Based on the author's results OA increases the oocyte cleavage rate but then reduces the rate of blastocyst to cleaved oocyte. Doesn't that mean OA affects negatively early development?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. The one-hour pre-treatment is designed to reflect the transient exposure of sperm to the seminal plasma during ejaculation. In this context, it is unlikely that such a short exposure would impair the overall developmental potential of the embryo. However, although pre-conditioning with oleic acid does not ultimately affect the development of the offspring, it may lead to a decrease in the blastocyst rate at a certain point (approximately 96-120 hours after fertilization). We agree that additional research is needed to demonstrate this.</p>
<p>Therefore, because the experiments related to the effects of oleic acid on sperm and fertilization are currently incomplete, we have decided to withdraw them for future research.</p>

<p>(11) 305: What happens to pyruvate and lactate levels when ACLY expression is reduced?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s question regarding the fate of pyruvate and lactate when ACLY expression is reduced. In the absence of testosterone (Ctrl), the expression level of ACLY decreases. At this time, the concentration of pyruvate in the culture medium increased compared to that of testosterone (Testo; Fig. 4D,E). This is probably a reflection of the fact that when the expression of ACLY is suppressed, the rate at which the products of the glycolytic pathway are converted to the fat-producing pathway (i.e., the conversion of citrate to acetyl-CoA) decreases.</p>
<p>On the other hand, lactate levels did not change significantly. This suggests that the flow of lactate production via lactate dehydrogenase is relatively constant, independent of metabolic reprogramming by ACLY.</p>
<p>Therefore, our data suggest that a decrease in ACLY expression leads to a decrease in pyruvate demand, while lactate production is maintained. We interpret these findings as supporting the idea that ACLY is important for directing the carbon produced by the glycolytic pathway to lipid synthesis (by transporting citrate from the mitochondria).</p>
<p>We hope that this explanation clarifies the interpretation of the data.</p>
