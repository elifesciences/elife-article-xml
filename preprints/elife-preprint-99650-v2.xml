<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During and even after development, the nervous system undergoes functional modification usually not depending on cell turn over. Caspase, best known as a cysteine aspartic acid protease involved in cell death, participates neuronal functional modulation through non-lethal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>). In zebrafish embryo, non-lethal caspase activity promotes axon arbor dynamics in retinal ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Campbell and Okamoto, 2013</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, caspase activation promotes engulfment of pruned dendrites during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Williams et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, non-lethal caspase activity promotes the maturation of olfactory sensory neurons during development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ohsawa et al., 2010</xref>). In the mature nervous system, non-lethal caspase activity induces long-term depression by AKT cleavage in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2010</xref>). These processes are termed caspase-dependent non-lethal cellular processes (CDPs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aram et al., 2017</xref>). While a growing number of CDPs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nakajima and Kuranaga, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shinoda and Miura, 2024</xref>), relatively less is known about its regulatory mechanisms that enable specific non-lethal functions without causing cell death especially in nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>). One potential mechanism is the restriction of the extent and spread of activated caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>), yet experimental evidence is limited.</p>
<p>Proteins that interact with initiator caspases are among the key regulators of CDPs. Tango7, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> translation initiation factor eIF3 subunit m, acts as an adapter and regulates the localization of the initiator caspase Dronc. During sperm individualization, Tango7 directs Dronc to the individualization complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">D’Brot et al., 2013</xref>). In salivary glands, Tango7 directs Dronc to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kang et al., 2017</xref>). In both cases, caspase activity promotes cellular remodeling without inducing cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">D’Brot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kang et al., 2017</xref>). CRINKLED, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> unconventional myosin, functions as an adaptor of Dronc and facilitates the cleavage of Shaggy46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Orme et al., 2016</xref>). Shaggy46, activated by caspase-mediated cleavage, suppresses the emergence of ectopic sensory organ precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kanuka et al., 2005</xref>). During apoptosis-induced proliferation (AiP), Myo1D, another <italic>Drosophila</italic> unconventional myosin, facilitates Dronc translocation to the basal side of the plasma membrane of imaginal discs to promote AiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amcheslavsky et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, initiator caspase-interacting proteins regulate caspase activity in CDPs. However, given the importance of executioner caspases, which are activated by the initiator caspase to cleave a broad range of substrates and are essential for apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Julien and Wells, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kumar, 2007</xref>), little is known about the subcellular compartmentalization and interacting proteins of those involved in CDPs. This lack of understanding is partly due to the absence of protein-protein interaction domains (e.g., DED and CARD) in the N-terminus of executioner caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand the molecular mechanism regulating caspase activity involved in CDPs, we focused on the proximal proteins of executioner caspases using TurboID, a proximity labeling technique that analyzes protein proximity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). We have previously established C-terminal TurboID knocked-in caspase fly lines for Dronc (initiator), Drice (executioner), and Dcp-1 (executioner) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shinoda et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, we have demonstrated that one of the preferred substrates of Drice, BubR1, is proximal to Drice <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shinoda et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that substrate preference is exploited by protein proximity. Therefore, the proximity of executioner caspases to proteins is emerging as a means of regulating specific non-lethal functions.</p>
<p>To investigate the regulatory mechanisms of non-lethal function of caspase in the nervous system, we conducted comprehensive analysis of proximal proteins of executioner caspase Drice. We discovered that Drice is, as an inactive proform, primarily proximal to cell membrane proteins, including cell adhesion molecule Fasciclin 3 (Fas3). Notably, Drice is proximal to the specific alternative splicing isoforms of Fas3, Fas3G. To ascertain whether Fas3G modulates caspase activity, we developed a Gal4-Manipulated Area Specific CaspaseTracker/CasExpress (MASCaT) system, which permits the monitoring of caspase activity near plasma membrane with high sensitivity and simultaneous genetic manipulation in the cells of interest. Using MASCaT, we demonstrated that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression enhances caspase activation without killing olfactory receptor neurons through the induction of the expression of initiator caspase Dronc, which also comes proximal to Fas3G. Subsequently, we showed that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation in olfactory receptor neurons suppresses innate olfactory attraction behavior. Collectively, our findings suggest that caspase activation is subcellularly restricted, the platform of which is defined by caspase proximal proteins, for non-lethal functions. In contrast to lethal activation, suppressing neuronal activity with non-lethal caspase activation is reversible. By regulating caspase proximal proteins, reversible modification of neuronal functional by non-lethal caspase activation will be achieved.</p>

<title>Drice is the major executioner caspase expressed in the adult brains</title>
<p>Apoptotic stimuli activate initiator caspases that trigger a proteolytic cascade, leading to the activation of executioner caspases and culminating in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Green, 2019</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the caspase-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway is highly conserved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nakajima and Kuranaga, 2017</xref>). The activity of executioner caspases, specifically Drice and Dcp-1, is regulated by apoptotic signaling pathways, including the initiator caspase Dronc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To investigate the expression patterns of <italic>Drosophila</italic> caspases, we employed <italic>Caspase::V5::TurboID</italic> knocked-in fly lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shinoda et al., 2019</xref>). We found low levels of expression of the initiator caspase Dronc in adult heads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Conversely, we observed high expression of the executioner caspase Drice, whereas Dcp-1 was expressed at lower levels in adult heads (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The proximal proteins of each caspase were labeled with TurboID in adult heads by administration of 100 µM biotin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, we investigated the expression patterns of caspases using histochemical analysis by examining streptavidin (SA) signal. Consistent with the western blotting findings, Drice showed higher expression levels than Dronc and Dcp-1, which were expressed at lower levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We found that Drice was expressed in distinct regions, including the mushroom bodies (MBs), suboesophageal ganglions (SOGs), optic lobes (OLs), and antennal lobes (ALs), which showed the highest levels of expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> ALs comprise synaptic contacts between the axons of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), the dendrites of projection neurons (PNs), and local interneuron (LNs) processes. Neuron-type-specific Gal4s were used to knockdown <italic>Drice</italic> and the expression patterns were subsequently examined. We found that Drice was expressed predominantly in ORNs in the AL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These results show that Drice is highly expressed in a specific subset of neurons in the adult brains. Comparisons of the expression patterns of Drice were consistent across both males and females (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), indicating an absence of sex-based differences, which justifies the use of males for functional simplicity in this study.</p>

<title>Drice is proximal to cell membrane proteins rather than cytosolic proteins in the adult brains</title>
<p>To comprehensively identify proximal proteins of Drice, we employed a proximity labeling approach. Specifically, we used <italic>Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> knocked-in flies fed 100 µM biotin. We confirmed biotinylation of Drice proximal proteins in the adult brains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). After purifying the biotinylated proteins using NeutrAvidin magnetic beads, we performed LC-MS/MS analysis of the samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We identified 643 proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Table S1), of which 158 were highly specific to <italic>Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> flies compared to wild-type flies (<italic>Drice::V5::TurboID</italic>/<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> &gt; 10; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Table S1). Gene ontology analysis revealed that Drice proximal proteins were enriched in the plasma membrane, synaptic vesicles, postsynaptic membranes, and adherens junctions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, Table S2). This finding suggests that Drice is localized primarily in cell membrane compartments rather than in the cytoplasm of the adult brain. Additionally, because the SA signal of <italic>Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> is mainly observed in the AL where the axons of ORNs project (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), the enrichment of cell membrane proteins in the proximal proteins of Drice is reasonable.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>A specific splicing isoform of Fasciclin 3 is in proximity to Drice</title>
<p>During our analysis of proteins proximal to Drice, we discovered that the expression patterns of Fasciclin 3 (Fas3) in the adult brain closely resembled those of Drice, especially within the OLs, SOGs, and ALs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Thus, we focused on Fas3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chiba et al., 1995</xref>), a transmembrane protein containing immunoglobulin-like domains that regulates synaptic target recognition and axon fasciculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kose et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>Fas3</italic> is encoded by seven splicing isoforms, resulting in the production of five protein isoforms that share extracellular domains but differ in intracellular domains with low-complexity sequences (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Only one specific protein isoform, Fas3 isoform G (Fas3G), was identified in the LC-MS/MS analysis as a Drice-proximal protein in the adult brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, Table S1). Using AlphaFold2-Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>), Drice was predicted to interact with Fas3A (ipTM = 0.456) and Fas3G (ipTM = 0.372) rather than Fas3C (ipTM = 0.298), Fas3D/E (ipTM = 0.220) and Fas3B/F (ipTM = 0.207). Among Fas3 isoforms, only Fas3G is predicted to interact with Drice with 2 intracellular regions (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</xref>). To validate this result, we generated an antibody specific to Fas3G (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, E</xref>). We confirmed that only the Fas3G was labeled with Drice::V5::TurboID and purified using NeutrAvidin magnetic beads as detected using western blotting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). To further confirm the isoform specificity to Drice proximity, we overexpressed 3xFLAG-tagged <italic>Fas3 isoforms A</italic>, <italic>B/F</italic>, <italic>C</italic>, <italic>D/E</italic>, and <italic>G</italic> in olfactory receptor neurons using <italic>Pebbled-Gal4</italic> in a <italic>Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> knocked-in background. After proximity labeling with TurboID, followed by NeutrAvidin purification, we found that the Fas3G was highly enriched compared to the other isoforms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). These findings suggested that Drice is proximal to a specific isoform of Fas3 in olfactory receptor neurons, regardless of its protein expression level. We also investigated whether Drice and Fas3G statically interact by co-immunoprecipitation. Although Fas3G was labelled by Drice::V5::TurboID, indicating its proximity to Drice within the ORNs of adult brains, Drice did not co-immunoprecipitate with Fas3G (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A</xref>). This result suggests that while Drice and Fas3G are proximate, their interaction is not static, highlighting the utility of proximity labeling as a superior technique to conventional co-immunoprecipitation for identifying proteins that are spatially close.</p>

<title>Fasciclin 3s are not substrates of caspase</title>
<p>It is often observed that proteins in close proximity to caspases are their preferred substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shinoda et al., 2023</xref>). To investigate this, we examined whether any of the Fas3 isoforms are substrates for caspase by expressing all isoforms in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. However, we found that none of the Fas3 isoforms were cleaved by caspase following the induction of apoptosis (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2–figure supplement 2B</xref>).

<title>MASCaT: a cell type-specific highly sensitive caspase activity reporter</title>
<p>We investigated whether Fas3G regulates caspase activity in lethal or non-lethal processes. CaspaseTracker/CasExpress is a highly sensitive reporter of caspase activity that uses caspase-activatable Gal4 tethered to the membrane by mCD8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). However, reliance on Gal4 to report their activity presents a challenge in reconciling Gal4/UAS-dependent gene manipulations. To overcome this limitation, we created a new reporter to capture caspase activation independent of caspase-activatable Gal4. We replaced the caspase-activatable Gal4 with the caspase-activatable QF2 (<italic>mCD8::DQVD::QF2</italic>), where DQVD is a caspase cleavage sequence, and first expressed directly downstream of <italic>UAS</italic> sequence (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the caspase-activatable QF2 induced mNeonGreen expression under <italic>QUAS</italic> sequence even either with a pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, or an uncleavable DQVA mutant probe (<italic>mCD8::DQVA::QF2</italic>, insensitive to caspase-mediated cleavage which serves as a negative control) (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>), potentially because the Gal4/UAS binary system expressed excessive mCD8::DQVD/A::QF2 probes that results in caspase activation-independent induction of QF2/QUAS system. Thus, to reduce the amount of probes expression, we generated <italic>Ubi-FRT-STOP-FRT-mCD8::DQVD::QF2</italic>, simultaneously expressing <italic>Flippase</italic> (<italic>FLP</italic>) under <italic>UAS</italic> to restrict reporter expression to the cells of interest (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells undergo weak caspase activation only by transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shinoda et al., 2023</xref>). Taking advantage of that, this system reports caspase activity through the caspase-activatable QF2/QUAS system, expressing mNeonGreen, which is not detected by caspase-non-activatable QF2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We named this novel reporter a Gal4-<underline>M</underline>anipulated <underline>A</underline>rea <underline>S</underline>pecific <underline>Ca</underline>spase<underline>T</underline>racker/CasExpress (MASCaT; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Using MASCaT, we detected caspase activity, specifically in the neurons of adult brains, using <italic>ELAV-Gal4</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Caspase activity was prominent in OLs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), which is consistent with the previously reported activation pattern of caspase detected by CaspaseTracker/CasExpress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). Previously, we reported that a specific subset of ORNs, including Or42b neurons, undergoes age-associated caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we detected age-dependent caspase activation in the AL (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). We further confirmed the age-dependent caspase activation in Or42b neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, our newly established reporter, MASCaT, enables the highly sensitive detection of caspase activity near the plasma membrane in cells of interest reconciling with Gal4/UAS-dependent gene manipulations.</p>

<title>Fas3G overexpression activates caspase in a non-lethal manner</title>
<p>To investigate the regulatory role of Fas3 in caspase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used Or42b neurons as a model, which have previously been shown to undergo age-dependent caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>). Initially, we evaluated the effects of <italic>Dronc</italic> overexpression on apoptosis by quantifying cell body numbers in the antenna in young flies. Dronc induced cell loss while catalytically inactive Dronc (Dronc<sup>CG</sup>) did not, suggesting that Dronc induce apoptosis in a catalytic-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). We then evaluated the effects of the overexpression of the executioner caspases <italic>Dcp-1</italic> and <italic>Drice</italic>. Interestingly, although Dcp-1 induced complete cell loss, Drice did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>), suggesting that Drice requires an initiator caspase for activation, whereas Dcp-1 does not. These results indicate that Or42b neurons are competent in caspase-mediated cell loss and thus serve as a model for evaluating apoptosis. However, the expression of <italic>Fas3G</italic>, even in combination with <italic>Drice</italic>, did not reduce the number of cells, implying that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression did not induce apoptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>).</p>

<p>Subsequently, we assessed the regulation of non-lethal caspase activity by Fas3G <italic>in vivo</italic>. We first confirmed that MASCaT probes were distributed in the axons of ORNs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Using MASCaT, we observed weak caspase activation even in the control group at a young age (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>). The expression of <italic>Fas3G</italic> significantly promoted caspase activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>), indicating that Fas3G regulates non-lethal caspase activation. Moreover, the simultaneous expression of <italic>Drice</italic> and <italic>Fas3G</italic> significantly enhanced caspase activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>), signifying the promoting effect of their proximity. Moreover, the concurrent expression of Diap-1, an E3 ligase known to inhibit caspase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ditzel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hay et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), mitigated the caspase activation induced by <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H, I</xref>). This indicates that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation is dependent on the core apoptotic machinery. To test whether endogenous Fas3G regulates caspase activation, we generated <italic>Fas3G</italic>-specific <italic>shRNA</italic> expressing strain (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Fas3</italic> or <italic>Fas3G</italic> in Or42b neurons didn’t suppress the inherent, weak caspase activation (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). In agreement with this, Drice’s presence in the axon of ORNs with Fas3G was observed, yet its presence was not strictly contingent on Fas3 or Fas3G (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4–figure supplement 1E</xref>). Given the numerous other membrane proteins in proximity to Drice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G, H</xref> and Table S1), it is probable that additional proteins may be responsible for recruiting Drice to the axon. These findings collectively imply that while Fas3G is not essential for mild endogenous caspase activation, overexpression of <italic>Fas3G</italic> does enhance non-lethal caspase activation in ORNs, thus providing a valuable model for exploring the molecular processes that facilitate caspase activation without leading to cell death.</p>

<sec id="s2g">
<title>Fas3G is proximal to Dronc which is required for non-lethal caspase activation</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the underlying mechanism that enhances non-lethal activation facilitated by <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression. Executioner caspases, Drice and Dcp-1, are activated by initiator caspases, Dronc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We precisely analyzed expression pattern of Dronc in adult brains and found that while its expression was low in control, overexpression of <italic>Fas3G</italic> in ORNs markedly increased Dronc levels in those neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, akin to Drice, Dronc was also found in close proximity to the overexpressed Fas3G, but not to the overexpressed Fas3C in ORNs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Consequently, we examined whether Dronc is required for the non-lethal caspase activation enhanced by <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression. Employing MASCaT, we discovered that both knockdown of <italic>Dronc</italic> and the expression of the <italic>dominant-negative form of Dronc</italic> (<italic>Dronc<sup>DN</sup></italic>) hindered the non-lethal caspase activation facilitated by <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, D</xref>), indicating a dependence on initiator caspase activity. Importantly, the genetic suppression of Dronc activity did not alter the proximity between Drice and Fas3G (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that the inactive Drice proform is primarily proximal to Fas3G. Solo overexpression of <italic>Dronc</italic> led to cell death in Or42b neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>), whereas <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression elevated Dronc expression without causing cell death (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Collectively, these findings imply that the non-lethal caspase activation driven by <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression is orchestrated by an increase in Dronc induced by Fas3G, bringing Dronc in close vicinity to Fas3G and thus enabling caspase activation near the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>Non-lethal caspase activation regulates innate attraction behavior</title>
<p>Finally, we examined the function of <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation. Apple cider vinegar (ACV) excites six glomeruli in the AL, including DM1, which is innervated by the axons of Or42b neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Semmelhack and Wang, 2009</xref>). We have previously reported that Or42b neurons undergo aging-dependent caspase activation and partial cell death, which reduces neuronal activity and attraction behavior in response to ACV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of caspase activity in aged flies restores attraction behavior but does not affect that of young flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>). Using a two-choice preference assay with ACV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), we found that 16 hours of starvation combined with 25% ACV in the trap elicited a robust attraction behavior to the vinegar (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, 4 hours of starvation with 1% ACV in the trap resulted in milder attraction behavior, with the preference index value being close to 0 but still showing a positive trend (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Under the milder experimental condition, we first confirmed that inhibition of caspase activity through expressing <italic>Dronc<sup>DN</sup></italic> didn’t affect attraction behavior in young adult (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>).We then observed that the overexpression of <italic>Fas3G</italic>, which activates caspases, did not impair attraction behavior. Instead, it rather appeared to enhance the tendency for attraction behavior (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that Fas3G promotes attraction behavior. Finally, we found that inhibiting <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation by expressing <italic>Dronc<sup>DN</sup></italic>strongly promoted attraction to ACV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression has a dual function: it enhances attraction behavior while also triggering non-lethal caspase activation, which counteracts the behavioral response, functioning as a regulatory brake without causing cell death.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>Proximal proteins of executioner caspases regulate non-lethal caspase activity</title>
<p>It is important to identify the proximal proteins of executioner caspases, which cleave a wide range of substrates and are essential for apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Julien and Wells, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kumar, 2007</xref>), as proximity often dictates substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Shinoda et al., 2023</xref>). In humans, caspase-3 and caspase-7 have been shown to share but also have discrete substrate preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Walsh et al., 2008</xref>). Caspase-7 leverages an exosite to facilitate interaction with RNA and enhance the proteolysis of RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boucher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Desroches and Denault, 2019</xref>). Thus, protein proximity can be used to precisely regulate specific cellular functions by selectively cleaving a limited pool of substrates in non-lethal scenarios compared with lethal cleavages where all the substrates are potentially cleaved during apoptosis. We showed that executioner caspases, before activation as proforms, are exclusively sequestered in specific subcellular domains, including the plasma membrane of axons. We found that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression facilitates non-lethal activation, underscoring the importance of protein proximity not only in substrate cleavage, but also in localizing non-lethal activation to the vicinity of plasma membrane of axons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Our results suggest that subcellularly restricted caspase activation mediated by caspase proximal proteins is one of the potential mechanisms regulating caspase activation without inducing cell death.</p>

<title>MASCaT as a highly sensitive reporter for identifying non-lethal caspase regulators</title>
<p>Various caspase activity reporters have been developed, including SCAT3, a FRET-based reporter with superior temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Takemoto et al., 2003</xref>), CaspaseTracker/CasExpress, Caspase-activatable Gal4-based reporters with superior sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). However, to date, no reporter has been developed that is sensitive enough to identify non-lethal regulators of caspases in cells of interest. In this study, we developed a novel caspase reporter, MASCaT, that can detect caspase activation with high sensitivity in a cell type-specific manner following gene manipulation. Using MASCaT, we identified previously overlooked regulators of non-lethal activation of caspases in a cell type-specific manner. Proximal proteins of executioner caspases are potential non-lethal regulators, and combining TurboID-mediated identification of these proteins will pave the way for identifying non-lethal components and broaden our understanding of the molecular mechanism of non-lethal caspase activation.</p>

<title>Non-lethal caspase activation regulates neuronal activity and behaviors</title>
<p>We previously reported that age-dependent caspase activation reduces neuronal activity and innate attraction behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chihara et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we found that, while <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression did not impair attraction behavior by itself, caspase activation upon <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression suppressed attraction behavior toward ACV (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). In mice, L1CAM, an immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule similar to Fas3, facilitates neuronal excitability by regulating the voltage-gated Na+ channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Valente et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that non-lethal caspase activation antagonizes the neuronal excitability promoted by Fas3G. In neurons, caspases have diverse non-lethal functions, including axon degeneration and macro- and micro-pruning, to regulate synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dehkordi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>). In presynaptic terminals, it has been recently reported that Caspase-3 modulates synaptic vesicle pools via autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gu et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that non-lethal activation regulates synaptic pools and neuronal activity in a reversible manner without killing the cells. Analyzing the functions mediated by Drice and Fas3G proximity, including the identification of specific substrates, will pave the way for identifying diverse CDPs and understanding their molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>While suppressing innate attraction behavior does not seem beneficial by itself, it should be a great advantage in decision-making. To survive, flies must constantly make appropriate behavioral decisions (e.g., feeding versus mating) depending on their physiological conditions. In males, a subset of neurons regulated by tyramine controls feeding versus mating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cheriyamkunnel et al., 2021</xref>). In regard of that, it is important to adequately promote or suppress neuronal activity, which controls behaviors of the organisms, by precisely controlling caspase activation in a subcellularly restricted manner in neurons. Compared with lethal activation which irreversibly removed the neurons of interest, suppressing neuronal activity with non-lethal reversible caspase activation is beneficial for decision makings depending on their varying physiological conditions. As regulating caspase proximal proteins enables non-lethal activation which is not achieved by directly manipulating caspase expression, our results open the possibility of the methodological development for reversible manipulation of neuronal activity via non-lethal caspase activity.</p>

<title>Proximal proteins of executioner caspases define the site of caspase activation “hotspot”</title>
<p>Although the core apoptotic machinery has been well characterized during the last 30 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nakajima and Kuranaga, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shinoda and Miura, 2024</xref>), the precise regulation of CDPs, remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, we identified <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression activates Drice. Mechanistically, we found that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression induced the expression of initiator caspase Dronc, which also comes close to Fas3G, regulating non-lethal caspase activation. Direct overexpression of Dronc alone results in cell death within olfactory receptor neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). However, when Dronc expression is upregulated due to <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression, it does not lead to cell death in ORNs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>). The exact process by which Dronc expression is increased in response to <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression remains to be elucidated. It is known that Dronc can be upregulated via the ecdysone signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dorstyn et al., 1999</xref>) and the Hippo signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the overexpression of <italic>Fas3G</italic> might potentially activate Dronc expression through one or both signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Fas3 is an immunoglobulin-like domain-containing transmembrane protein that regulates axonal fasciculation and neuronal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chiba et al., 1995</xref>). NCAM, a mammalian homologue of Fascicilin 2, is an immunoglobulin-like domain-containing cell adhesion molecule. NCAM can physically bind to caspase-8, and depending on NCAM clustering, caspase-8 and -3 are activated and contribute to neurite outgrowth by cleaving its substrate spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Westphal et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it seems likely that cell adhesion molecule-mediated subcellularly restricted caspase activation is conserved among species. Indeed, caspase-9/Apaf-1-dependent caspase-3 activation, without resulting in cell death, has also been observed in the axon of olfactory sensory neurons during mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ohsawa et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>While the restriction of the extent and spread of activated caspases is proposed as one of the potential molecular mechanisms for non-lethal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mukherjee and Williams, 2017</xref>), experimental evidences are limited. A critical insight from our research is that the executioner caspase is pre-compartmentalized in proximity to a specific set of proteins prior to activation, poised for the initiator caspase to approach. Consequently, the “hotspot” for non-lethal caspase activity appears to be determined by these neighboring proteins of executioner caspases. While the “hotspot” located in the axon of the ORN may exert an inhibitory effect on neuronal activity, it could also play a role in avoiding cell death by localizing caspase activity, especially during development.</p>
<p>Recently, a protein interactome analysis in humans showed that tissue-preferentially expressed proteins that interact with known apoptosis regulators participate in apoptosis sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luck et al., 2020</xref>). Given that CDPs are often cell-and tissue type-specific processes, the identification of modulators of context-dependent apoptotic pathways will aid in understanding the precise molecular regulation of CDPs. Importantly, alternative splicing can diversify protein-protein interaction networks. A recent report showed that minor spliceosomes regulate alternative splicing, including Fas3. A specific isoform of Fas3 has distinct functions and cannot be substituted by other isoforms during neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Our results support the idea that alternative splicing may not only diversify the protein itself, but also its interaction networks to regulate module-dependent activation. Further interactome analysis using TurboID will reveal the regulatory mechanisms of the non-lethal activation of caspases.</p>

<title>Two choice preference assay</title>
<p>Newly eclosed adult male flies were raised in vials containing 25 fly/vial, and incubated at 29℃, 65% humidity with 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. The flies were transferred every 2–4 days to vials containing fresh food for 1 week. The 1-week-old young flies were starved in MilliQ (MQ) water for 4 h or 16 h prior to the assay in constant dark condition. About 75 flies were put in 1000-mL glass beaker, which contained two standards bottles (traps) filled with 500 µl 1% or 25% apple cider vinegar (ACV; Mizkan) and 500 µl MQ water. The bottles were then covered with sponge plugs containing pipette tips. The pipette tip was cut to increase the size of the opening such that only one fly could climb into the bottle at a time. The glass beaker was covered with a mesh fabric (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The beakers were set in an incubator at 29℃ for 2 h for the assay in constant dark condition. The experiments were evaluated only if at least one of the tested flies entered either of 2 bottles. The preference index equaled the number of flies in the ACV minus the number of flies in the MQ water, divided by the number of total live flies in both inside and outside of the bottles, and multiplied by 100. Values greater than zero indicate a preference for ACV and values less than zero indicate aversion. We repeated the same experiment with different sets of flies and the number of times is indicated by N.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study identifies a mechanism by which caspases are activated in a non-lethal context to induce functional modulation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons. To deliver, the authors generated a new reporter of caspases, used TurboID to identify proteins proximal of the Drosophila executioner caspases Drice, and then focused on Fasciclin 3 as a mediator. The experimental results and the main conclusions are <bold>convincing</bold>. This substantial body of work will be of interest to researchers across fields, from neuroscience of olfaction to development and cell biology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Muramoto and colleagues have examined a mechanism by which the executioner caspase Drice is activated in a non-lethal context in Drosophila. The authors have comprehensively examined this in the Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons using sophisticated techniques. In particular, they had to engineer a new reporter by which non-lethal caspase activation could be detected. The authors conducted a proximity labeling experiment and identified Fasciclin 3 as a key protein in this context. While removal of Fascilin 3 did not block non-lethal caspase activation (likely because of redundant mechanisms), its overexpression was sufficient to activate non-lethal caspase activation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>While non-lethal functions of caspases have been reported in several contexts, far less is known about the mechanisms by which caspases are activated in these non-lethal contexts. So, the topic is very timely. The overall detail of this work is impressive and the results, for the most part, are well controlled and justified.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The behavioral results shown in Fig. 6 need more explanation and clarification (more details below). As currently shown, the results of Fig. 6 seem uninterpretable. Also, overall presentation of the Figures and description in legends can be improved.</p>

<p>In this revised version of the study, the authors investigate the role of caspases in neuronal modulation through non-lethal activation. They analyze proximal proteins of executioner caspases using a variety of techniques, including TurboID and a newly developed monitoring system based on Gal4 manipulation, called MASCaT. They demonstrate that overexpression of Fas3G promotes the non-lethal activation of caspase Dronc in olfactory receptor neurons. In addition, they investigate the regulatory mechanisms of non-lethal function of caspase by performing a comprehensive analysis of proximal proteins of executioner caspase Drice. It is important to point out that the authors use an array of techniques from western blot to behavioral experiments and also that the generated several reagents, from fly lines to antibodies. In this revised version of the manuscript the authors addressed the concerns raised by this reviewer in a very thorough way. This is an interesting work that would appeal to readers of multiple disciplines. As a whole these findings suggest that overexpression of Fas3G enhances a non-lethal caspase activation in ORNs, providing a novel experimental model that will allow for exploration of molecular processes that facilitate caspase activation without leading to cell death.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewing Editor comments:</bold></p>
<p>I am pleased to let you know that our reviewers found the results in your paper important and the evidence compelling. There are a few minor comments and a point was raised regarding figure 6 for which further details were asked. Please see the reviewer's comments. We are looking forward to receiving an updated version of your very interesting paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful to you and the reviewers for dedicating time to review our manuscript and for providing insightful comments and suggestions. We have revised our manuscript in line with the reviewers' feedback. The major revision involves clarifying the two-choice preference assay presented in Figure 6. Details of these revisions are provided in our point-by-point responses to the reviewers’ comments below. The new and extensively modified sections of text are highlighted in blue. We have introduced new panels (Figures 1D, 3D, 6B, and 6C) and made modifications to Figure 6A. The previous Figure 1D has been relocated to Figure 1–figure supplement 1B. Additionally, our detailed responses to the reviewers’ comments are also highlighted in blue within the point-by-point response section. With all concerns and suggestions from the Editor and reviewers addressed, our conclusion—that executioner caspase is proximal to Fasciclin 3 which facilitates non-lethal activation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory receptor neurons—is now more robustly supported. We are confident that our revised manuscript makes a significant contribution to the fields of caspase function and neurobiology. We remain hopeful that the reviewers will find it suitable for publication in eLife.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The main comment here is related to Figure 6, which needs to be better explained. First, if the results in Figure 6B and C are conducted with young flies, why is the preference index close to 0? Aren't these young flies more attracted to ACV? Second, what are the results with Dronc-RNAi and DroncDN alone? These should be shown to more accurately assess the outcome of Fas3G expression with and without Dronc inhibition. Third, if Fas3G overexpression induces non-lethal caspase activation and a behavioral change, why does Dronc inhibition enhance (and not suppress) this behavioral change?</p>

<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the comment. We used one-week-old young flies for the two-choice preference assay. We found that 16 hours of starvation combined with 25% ACV in the trap elicited a robust attraction behavior to the vinegar (New Figure 6B). In contrast, 4 hours of starvation with 1% ACV in the trap resulted in milder attraction behavior, with the preference index value being close to 0 but still showing a positive trend (New Figure 6B). Since our hypothesis is that non-lethal caspase activation suppresses attraction behavior, and that inhibiting caspase activation could enhance attraction, we used the milder experimental condition for subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>In the original manuscript, we did not test Dronc inhibition alone because caspase activation is rarely observed in young flies (as demonstrated in Figure 3C, New Figure 3D, etc), suggesting that Dronc inhibition during this stage would not affect behavior. This hypothesis is further supported by previous research showing that inhibition of caspase activity in aged flies restores attraction behavior but does has no effect in young flies (Chihara et al., 2014). To validate this hypothesis, we conducted the two-choice preference assay again, including caspase activity inhibition by <italic>Dronc<sup>DN</sup></italic> expression alone. As expected, Dronc inhibition alone did not alter behavior in young flies (New Figure 6C).</p>
<p>We also observed that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression promotes a weak, though not statistically significant, enhancement in attraction behavior. Importantly, simultaneous inhibition of caspase activity further enhanced attraction behavior (New Figure 6C). These results suggest that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression has a dual function: one aspect promotes attraction behavior, while the other induces non-lethal caspase activation. In this context, non-lethal caspase activation appears to counteract the behavioral response, acting as a regulatory brake. To address the reviewer’s comments comprehensively, we included the New Figure 6B and replaced the original Figure 6B and C with New Figure 6C. Additionally, we revised the manuscript text as follows:</p>
<p>Using a two-choice preference assay with ACV (Figure 6A), we found that 16 hours of starvation combined with 25% ACV in the trap elicited a robust attraction behavior to the vinegar (Figure 6B). In contrast, 4 hours of starvation with 1% ACV in the trap resulted in milder attraction behavior, with the preference index value being close to 0 but still showing a positive trend (Figure 6B). Under the milder experimental condition, we first confirmed that inhibition of caspase activity through expressing <italic>Dronc<sup>DN</sup></italic> didn’t affect attraction behavior in young adult (Figure 6C), consistent with a previous report (Chihara et al., 2014).We then observed that the overexpression of <italic>Fas3G</italic>, which activates caspases, did not impair attraction behavior. Instead, it rather appeared to enhance the tendency for attraction behavior (Figure 6C), suggesting that Fas3G promotes attraction behavior. Finally, we found that inhibiting <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression-facilitated non-lethal caspase activation by expressing <italic>Dronc<sup>DN</sup></italic> strongly promoted attraction to ACV (Figure 6C). Overall, these results suggest that <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression has a dual function: it enhances attraction behavior while also triggering non-lethal caspase activation, which counteracts the behavioral response, functioning as a regulatory brake without causing cell death.</p>

<p>Other minor comments are below:</p>
<p>The authors should clarify that while they refer to their caspases reporters as &quot;non-lethal caspase reporters&quot;, these are caspase reporters in general and can report both lethal and non-lethal caspase activation. Of course, the only surviving cells are those that experience non-lethal caspase activation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. This reporter can monitor caspase activation with high sensitivity only if the cell is capable of transcribing and translating the reporter proteins following cleavage of the probe, most likely in living cells. However, as mentioned, using the term “non-lethal reporter” is not accurate, as additional experiments are required to determine whether caspase activation leads to cell death. Therefore, we removed the term “non-lethal” and referred to this reporter simply as a highly sensitive caspase reporter in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(7) Figure 1D. Why do you use only females?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In the original manuscript, we analyzed female flies by crossing each Gal4 strain with <italic>UAS-Drice-RNAi; Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> virgin females. In this case, because <italic>Pebbled-Gal4</italic> is located on X chromosome, we could only use female flies for the analysis. To address this, we examined the expression pattern in males flies by crossing each Gal4 virgin female with <italic>UAS-Drice-RNAi; Drice::V5::TurboID</italic> males. As expected, Drice expression is also mostly depleted when using the ORN-specific Gal4 driver, <italic>Pebbled-Gal4</italic>, suggesting that Drice expression is predominantly observed in ORNs in males as well. We have added New Figure 1D to present the male data. The original Figure 1D, which presents female data, has been relocated to Figure 1–figure supplement 1B.</p>

<p>(9) Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 images are very good. I would recommend the use of a different color palette, to help visualization for colorblind readers (such as this reviewer).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience caused. We chose the green/magenta color pair because these are complementary colors, which generally provide better contrast compared to other color pairs. Therefore, we have decided to continue using this pair. To enhance readability, we have intensified the magenta signal in the New Figure 1D and Figure 1–figure supplement 1B. We retained the original magenta signal levels in Figure 1C and Figure 1–figure supplement 1A to avoid oversaturation. Instead, we have kept the Streptavidin-only signal images alongside the color merged images for clarity. We hope these adjustments improve the visualization and help you better interpret the figures.</p>

<p>Please refer to our reply to comment #7. We have now included the results for males in the New Figure 1D, which show a similar expression pattern to that observed in females. The results for females originally shown in Figure 1D have been relocated to Figure 1–figure supplement 1B.</p>

<p>(11) Why were the old versus young flies used for Figure 3 raised at 29C? Why not let the animals age at 25C? The use of 29C throughout the manuscript is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Most of the UAS fly strains used in this study, including a <italic>Fas3G</italic> overexpression line, are <italic>UASz</italic> lines, which exhibit relatively low expression levels compared to UASt lines (DeLuca and Spradling, 2018). Since the Gal4/UAS system is temperature-dependent (Duffy, 2002), we performed most of the experiments at 29°C to enhance gene expression.</p>
<p>For the aging experiments, we chose to rear flies at 29°C because higher temperatures accelerate aging including neuronal aging (Okenve-Ramos et al., 2024), allowing for faster experimentation, and 29°C is within the ecologically relevant range of temperatures for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (SotoYéber et al., 2018). Additionally, we confirmed that a subset of olfactory receptor neurons undergo aging-dependent caspase activation at both 29°C and 25°C, as shown in New Figure 3D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) Why not use an Or42b specific GAL 4 for the aging experiment? What are the odorants that are detected by this ORN? Are any of the odorants behaviorally relevant compounds?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. While the exact odorant detected by Or42b neurons has not been fully determined, these neurons innervate the DM1 region in the antennal lobe, which is activated by ACV. Additionally, Or42b neurons have been shown to be required for attraction behavior to ACV (Semmelhack and Wang, 2009), supporting the relevance of ACV for the behavioral experiment.   We used <italic>Or42b-Gal4</italic> to confirm that Or42b neurons undergo aging-dependent caspase activation, which is detectable using the MASCaT system (New Figure 3D). Furthermore, we verified that these neurons exhibit aging-dependent caspase activation at both 25°C and 29°C (New Figure 3D).</p>
