<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The atypical cadherins Fat and Dachsous (Ds) signal through the Hippo pathway to regulate growth of numerous organs, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing. Here, we find that Ds-Fat signaling tunes a unique feature of cell proliferation found to control the rate of wing growth. The duration of the cell cycle increases in direct proportion to the size of the wing, leading to linear rather than exponential growth. Ds-Fat signaling enhances the rate at which the cell cycle lengthens with wing size, thus diminishing the linear rate of wing growth. We show that this results in a complex but stereotyped relative scaling of wing growth with body growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Finally, we examine the dynamics of Fat and Ds protein distribution in the wing, observing graded distributions that change during growth. However, the significance of these dynamics is unclear since perturbations in expression have negligible impact on wing growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A fundamental aspect of animal development is growth. At the organismal level, growth is coupled with morphogenesis and development, and can also be separated into stages with physical constraints (e.g., molting events). At the organ level, growth is coupled with body growth to ensure relative scaling for proper form and function. At the cellular level, growth is interpreted as the decision to divide or not and to increase in size or not. These three levels of growth are integrated with one another to ensure that cells make appropriate growth choices based on feedback from the other two levels.</p>
<p>Growth of the body and its organs are controlled in two ways. The rate of growth over time is internally regulated with an upper limit set independent of such environmental factors as nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Conlon and Raff, 1999</xref>). The size setpoint when growth ceases is also internally controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Leevers and McNeill, 2005</xref>). Typically, the setpoint is reached when the animal transitions to adulthood. The two control processes are linked with one another. For example, <italic>Drosophila</italic> that are deficient in insulin signaling grow slowly and their final size setpoint is smaller than normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>). However, sometimes the growth-arrest process compensates for an abnormal growth rate to generate a normal size setpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Leevers and McNeill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Penzo-Mendez and Stanger, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The wing of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a well-established model system to study organ growth control. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, the anlage fated to form the adult wing blade is composed of an epithelial domain embedded within a larger epithelial sheet named the wing imaginal disc or wing disc (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The anlage, called a wing pouch, is surrounded by wing disc cells that will form the wing hinge and notum, which is the dorsal thorax. Two wing discs reside within the body cavity of a larva (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), and they grow in size as the larva undergoes three successive molts. Wing discs uniformly grow by asynchronous cell division until the animal undergoes the final molt at the end of its third larval instar stage and pupates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bryant and Levinson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Neto-Silva et al., 2009</xref>). During pupation, each wing pouch develops into a single adult wing blade.</p>

<p>Growth control of the wing disc operates through several mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nijhout and Callier, 2015</xref>). Hormones such as insulin-like peptides and ecdysone coordinate wing growth with environmental inputs such as nutrition and molting events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>). Paracrine growth factors are secreted from a subset of wing disc cells and are transported through the disc tissue to stimulate cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baena-Lopez et al., 2012</xref>). The BMP morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Wnt morphogen Wingless (Wg) are two such growth factors.</p>
<p>Another signal transduction pathway - the Hippo pathway - also operates to regulate growth of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boggiano and Fehon, 2012</xref>). The Hippo pathway is controlled by two different signals, both of which are locally transmitted. Mechanical stress from local tissue compression caused by differential growth alters the cytoskeletal tension in wing disc cells, which in turn regulates the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Legoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). Increased tension inactivates the Warts kinase, leading to upregulation of the Yorkie (Yki) transcription factor and growth promotion. A second signal that modulates the Hippo pathway in wing disc cells is mediated by two atypical cadherin molecules, Fat and Dachsous (Ds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pan, 2010</xref>). Ds and Fat are growth inhibitory factors. The two proteins bind to one another on opposing cell membranes at adherens junctions, and Ds is thought to be a ligand for Fat in many circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Clark et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Matakatsu and Blair, 2004</xref>). However, Ds has receptor-like properties as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Matakatsu and Blair, 2006</xref>). Binding of Fat and Ds is also modulated by the kinase Four-jointed (Fj) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ishikawa et al., 2008</xref>). When Fat is activated, it induces the destruction of an unconventional myosin called Dachs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).This derepresses Warts, which then inhibits Yki from transcribing growth-promoting genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Vrabioiu and Struhl, 2015</xref>). A prevailing model for Ds signaling to Fat is not via its absolute concentration but by the steepness of its local concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pan, 2010</xref>). Ds is expressed across the wing pouch in a graded fashion, and if the gradient is steep, growth is stimulated whereas if the gradient is shallow, growth is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Willecke et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Various molecular models for wing growth control have been developed in detail. However, what is unresolved are explanations for how these molecular mechanisms regulate the macroscopic features of growth. Namely, how do the molecular mechanisms regulate growth of the different domains of the wing disc: wing pouch, hinge, notum. How do they regulate the relative scaling of the wing to the body as both are growing in size. How do the different molecular mechanisms precisely regulate the two key growth control processes: growth rate and growth arrest.</p>
<p>Here, we focus on Ds-Fat signaling and address these questions with the aim of connecting the molecular perspective of growth control to a more macroscopic perspective. We find that Ds-Fat signaling tunes a unique feature of cell proliferation found to control the rate of wing pouch growth. The duration of the cell cycle increases in direct proportion to the size of the wing pouch, leading to linear rather than exponential growth. Ds-Fat signaling enhances the rate at which the cell cycle lengthens with wing size, thus diminishing the linear rate of wing growth. Duration of the cell cycle is coupled to relative change in Dpp signaling over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that Ds-Fat signaling increases cell sensitivity to fold-changes in Dpp over time. We show that this results in a complex but stereotyped relative scaling of wing growth with body growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Finally, we examine the dynamics of Fat and Ds protein distribution in the wing pouch, observing graded distributions that change during growth. However, the significance of these dynamics is unclear since perturbations in expression have negligible impact on wing growth.</p>

<title>Quantitative properties of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval wing growth</title>
<p>Organ growth in animals is coupled to body growth in complex ways that are specific for both the organ and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huxley and Teissier, 1936</xref>). We first sought to determine the relationship between growth of the wing and body in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Although previous work has studied this relationship, none have provided a quantitative description of it. Therefore, we measured body size by both wet weight and volume, while we measured wing pouch size by its volume. As expected, measurements of body weight and body volume showed a strong correlation (<xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - figure supplement 1</xref>). To measure wing pouch volume, we generated a 3D stack of confocal microscopic sections of the wing disc and used morphological landmarks (tissue folds) to demarcate the boundary between wing pouch and surrounding notum-hinge. We validated the efficacy of this method by comparing the landmark-defined boundary to the expression boundary of <italic>vestigial</italic>, a selector gene specifically expressed in wing pouch cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kim et al., 1996</xref>). The landmark method gave wing pouch measurements that were within 95.5% of measurements made by <italic>vestigial</italic> expression (<xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>We focused our growth study on the third instar larval stage, which occurs over a two-day period. Beginning at 3.0 days after egg laying (AEL), we measured third instar larval bodies and wing discs every 12 hours until the larva-pupa molt. Larval body weight increased linearly from 3.0 to 4.0 days AEL, followed by a 12 hr period of slower growth, and thereafter weight remained constant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The time point at which larvae stopped growing (4.5 days AEL) coincided with the time at which they stopped feeding and underwent a 12 hr non-feeding stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Slaidina et al., 2009</xref>). We also monitored weight as larvae underwent their molt into pupae. Weight remained constant during the one-hr white prepupal (WPP) stage and also one hr later at the brown prepupal (BPP) stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>We also measured wing pouch growth. Wing pouch volume increased linearly over time during the early third instar stage and continued to grow during the non-feeding larval stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This was in contrast to body growth, which ceased at the non-feeding stage. However, growth of the wing pouch ceased at the larva-pupa molt and its size remained constant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). A similar growth trajectory was observed for the notum-hinge although it stopped growing sometime during the non-feeding stage (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). End-of-growth of the wing pouch was confirmed by phospho-histone H3 (PHH3) staining, which marks mitotic cells. At larval stages, dividing cells were observed throughout the wing pouch (<xref rid="figs1-4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - figure supplement 4A,B</xref>), whereas at the WPP stage, dividing cells were only found in a narrow zone where sensory organ precursor cells undergo two divisions to generate future sensory organs (<xref rid="figs1-4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - figure supplement 4C-E</xref>).</p>
<p>The scaling of organ growth relative to body growth during development is known as <italic>ontogenetic allometry</italic>. For most animal species, allometric growth of organs follows a power law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huxley and Teissier, 1936</xref>), such that logarithmic transformation of the organ and body size measurements fits a linear relationship (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). When the organ grows at the same rate as the body, it exhibits isometric growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Huxley and Teissier, 1936</xref>). When the organ grows at a faster or slower rate than the body, it has positive or negative allometric growth, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Allometric organ growth in holometabolous insects such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> presents a special problem arising from the fact that many adult organs derive from the imaginal discs, which are non-functional in larvae. For this reason, there are fewer constraints on relative scaling, and allometric growth is freer to deviate from simple scaling laws. For example, in the silkworm, its wing disc grows linearly with its body while the larva feeds, but then continues its linear growth after larvae have ceased feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Williams, 1980</xref>). Thus, its allometric growth has two linear phases; the first is isometric and the second is positively allometric.</p>
<p>Since ontogenetic allometric growth of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing pouch has not been studied, we plotted wet-weight body measurements versus wing pouch volume measurements taken from different developmental stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). As with silkworms, allometric growth of the wing pouch had two linear phases, both of which showed positive allometry. The inflection point was the time when larvae ceased feeding. In contrast, the notum-hinge exhibited simpler linear-like positive allometric growth (<xref rid="figs1-3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - figure supplement 3C</xref>). Therefore, allometric growth control of the wing imaginal disc appears to be composed of multiple mechanisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Global gradients of Fat and Ds in the growing wing pouch</title>
<p>One mechanism for growth control of the wing imaginal disc is through the atypical cadherin proteins Fat and Ds. Both are type I transmembrane proteins with extensive numbers of extracellular cadherin domains: 34 in Fat and 27 in Ds (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Qualitative descriptions of <italic>ds</italic> gene expression in the wing pouch indicate that cells transcribe the gene at different levels depending upon their position in the pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Strutt and Strutt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ma et al., 2003</xref>). We confirmed that there is graded transcription across the pouch by using single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - figure supplement 1A</xref>). A previous model hypothesized that this generates a Ds protein gradient across the wing pouch, and the gradient regulates growth by inducing Fat polarization in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pan, 2010</xref>). When the Ds gradient becomes flattened, it leads to growth cessation. If correct, the model suggests that the Ds protein gradient should become shallow as the wing pouch reaches its final size. To test this, we used quantitative confocal microscopy to measure endogenous Ds protein tagged with GFP at its carboxy-terminus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Wing discs were co-stained with antibodies directed against Wingless (Wg) and Engrailed (En) proteins, which mark the wing pouch midlines (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). We measured Ds-GFP across the wing pouch, excluding peripodial signal, along the two midlines to gain a Cartesian perspective of the 2D expression pattern (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - figure supplement 2C</xref>). We focused our analysis on wing pouches taken from the third instar larval stage. Beginning at 4.0 days AEL, we measured Ds-GFP in the wing pouch every 12 hours until the larva-pupa molt. We also measured Ds-GFP at the WPP stage of the larva-pupa molt.</p>

</fig>
<p>At all timepoints, there was a graded distribution of Ds-GFP along both anterior-posterior (AP) and dorsal-ventral (DV) axes, high at the margins and low in the center of the pouch (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C,D</xref>). The gradient was asymmetric along the AP axis, being lower at the A margin than the P margin. As the pouch grew larger, the Ds gradient appeared to become progressively shallower. When we normalized all of the Ds-GFP profiles to their corresponding pouch sizes, the profiles along the AP axis collapsed together (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). This occurred because the maximum and minimum limits of Ds-GFP abundance were conserved as the wing pouch grew. It implies that dividing cells take up intermediate scalar values from their neighbors during growth, and over time the steepness of the Ds gradient diminishes. In contrast, along the DV axis the normalized profiles remained distinct because both maximum and minimum limits of Ds-GFP progressively diminished as the wing grew (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>We next turned to quantitative analysis of Fat protein expression. Fat is thought to be uniformly expressed in the wing pouch, though it has also been described as enriched along the DV midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Garoia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mao et al., 2009</xref>). We measured endogenous Fat protein tagged at its carboxy-terminus with GFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - figure supplement 2D</xref>). Surprisingly, Fat-GFP had a graded distribution along both the AP and DV axes; low at the margins and high in the center of the wing pouch (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G,H</xref>). The gradient profile was opposite to the one we observed for Ds-GFP. As the pouch grew in size, the Fat gradient appeared to grow shallower, becoming flat along the AP axis by the WPP stage. When we normalized all of the Fat-GFP profiles to their corresponding pouch sizes, the profiles did not collapse (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I,J</xref>). The minimum limit of Fat-GFP was conserved but the maximum limit of Fat-GFP progressively diminished as the wing grew.</p>
<p>The observation of a graded distribution of Fat protein was surprising since it was reported that <italic>fat</italic> gene transcription is uniform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Garoia et al., 2000</xref>). We confirmed this observation using smFISH (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - figure supplement 1B</xref>). We considered the possibility that the gradient is generated by a post-transcriptional mechanism. To test the idea, we expressed a <italic>fat</italic> transgene under the control of a UAS promoter. The transgene’s transcription was activated by Gal4 driven under control of the <italic>daughterless</italic> (<italic>da</italic>) promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>). <italic>da-Gal4</italic> is uniformly expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gilbert et al., 2006</xref>). The transgenic Fat protein was epitope tagged for visualization. As a control, cells also expressed Bazooka-mCherry from a second UAS transgene. We then measured the abundance of tagged Fat and Bazooka across the wing pouch. Bazooka protein distribution was fairly uniform along the AP axis while Fat protein was graded in a similar pattern to endogenous Fat (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>). Thus, the Fat gradient is generated by a post-transcriptional mechanism.</p>
<p>Ds is known to physically interact with Fat protein and so it was possible that the Fat protein gradient was controlled by Ds. To test this, we examined Fat-GFP distribution in a <italic>ds</italic> mutant background. The magnitude of peak Fat-GFP levels at the wing pouch center was the same as wildtype but the level of Fat-GFP near the margins was abnormally high (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref>). Since Ds levels are highest and most steep near the margins, perhaps Ds inhibits Fat expression in a dose- or gradient-dependent manner. We also followed Fat-GFP dynamics in the <italic>ds</italic> mutant. We did not observe the progressive flattening of the Fat-GFP profile to the WPP wing (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - figure supplement 3A</xref>). Instead, the Fat-GFP profile was graded at the WPP stage and flattened somewhat more by the BPP stage (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - figure supplement 3B</xref>). We also tested whether Fj regulates the Fat expression pattern by examining Fat-GFP in a <italic>fj</italic> mutant. However, the distribution of Fat-GFP was unchanged in the <italic>fj</italic> mutant (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 - figure supplement 3C</xref>). Therefore, Ds regulates the dynamics of Fat protein expression.</p>

<title>The Ds gradient directly scales with pouch volume</title>
<p>The Ds gradient scales with the size of the wing pouch as measured along the length of the AP axis of symmetry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Since the wing pouch can be approximated as an ellipse, the scaling we measured was possibly one related to pouch area. However, the wing pouch is a 3D structure and so Ds gradient scaling might be coupled to wing volume rather than area. To test this idea, we altered the dimensions of the wing pouch without changing its volume. Perlecan is a basement membrane proteoglycan required for extracellular matrix functionality across many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gubbiotti et al., 2017</xref>). Knockdown of perlecan expression by RNAi causes wing disc cells to become thinner and more elongated due to the altered extracellular matrix in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kirkland et al., 2020</xref>). We used a Gal4 driver under the control of the <italic>actin5C</italic> promoter (<italic>actin5C</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic>) to knock down <italic>trol</italic> gene expression via UAS-RNAi. The <italic>trol</italic> gene encodes perlecan. We measured the dimensions of the wing pouch at the WPP stage and observed that <italic>actin5C&gt;trol</italic>(RNAi) caused a reduction in the area of the wing pouch and an increase in the thickness of the wing pouch (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,B</xref>). The overall change in pouch dimensions had no effect on wing pouch volume (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). We then measured the Ds-GFP profile at WPP stage and found <italic>actin5C&gt;trol</italic>(RNAi) had no effect on the gradient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Thus, Ds appears to scale with the volume and not the area of the wing pouch. We also examined Fat-GFP to see if its dynamics were altered, and found the gradient flattened normally at the WPP stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>Ds gradient might directly scale to wing pouch volume or it might be a consequence of scaling to another feature such as cell number, which correlates with wing volume. To test this possibility, we decreased cell number while keeping total volume constant by over-expressing the cell cycle inhibitor RBF. Using a Gal4 driver under the control of the <italic>engrailed</italic> (<italic>en</italic>) promoter, a <italic>UAS-RBF</italic> transgene was overexpressed in the posterior (P) compartment of the wing disc. Previous work had found such overexpression resulted in half the number of cells in the P compartment but they were two-fold larger in size, such that the P compartment size was unchanged relative to the anterior (A) compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Neufeld et al., 1998</xref>). We confirmed that <italic>en&gt;RBF</italic> generated fewer and larger P cells, and the ratio of P/A compartment ratio was unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F,G</xref>). Nevertheless, the Ds gradient in the P compartment at WPP stage was indistinguishable from wildtype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). The Fat gradient also flattened normally at the WPP stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). In summary, the Ds gradient appears to directly scale to wing pouch volume as the pouch grows in size. Fat gradient flattening also appears to be coupled to pouch volume rather than cell number or pouch area. Therefore, the dynamics of these atypical cadherins are coupled to a global physical feature of the wing.</p>

<title>Fat and Ds regulate allometric wing growth</title>
<p>We next wanted to understand how Fat and Ds regulate growth of the wing pouch. Prior work had shown that loss-of-function <italic>fat</italic> mutants delay the larva-pupa molt and overgrow the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bryant et al., 1988</xref>). We applied our quantitative growth analysis pipeline on loss-of-function <italic>fat</italic> mutants. Mutant larvae did not stop growing at 4.5 days AEL as wildtype larvae did, but continued to increase in weight for another day until they entered the non-feeding stage and pupated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). The mutant larval notum and wing pouch grew at a faster rate than normal, and at the larva-pupa molt, the wing pouch continued to grow (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,D</xref> and <xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 - figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p>

<p>Loss-of-function <italic>ds</italic> mutants also delayed the larva-pupa molt but only by 12 hours. Mutant larvae continued to gain weight past the wildtype plateau, and they only ceased weight gain at the larva-pupa molt (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). The mutant larval notum and wing pouch grew at a rate comparable to those of wildtype, but their growth period was extended (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 - figure supplement 1A</xref>). While the mutant notum ceased to grow prior to the larva-pupa molt, the wing pouch only stopped growing at the BPP stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 - figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Allometric growth of the <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ds</italic> mutant wing pouch was significantly different from wildtype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). In wildtype, there are two linear phases to wing allometric growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Allometric growth of the <italic>ds</italic> and <italic>fat</italic> mutant wing pouches had a first phase that was more extended than normal and a second phase that was less extended than normal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>).

<title>Autonomous effects of Fat and Ds on wing growth</title>
<p>Fat and Ds proteins are extensively expressed throughout the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> body, and their loss has clear effects on overall body growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mahoney et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Clark et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, we wished to know what the wing-autonomous effects of Fat and Ds are on allometric growth. We used the <italic>nubbin-Gal4</italic> (<italic>nub-Gal4</italic>) driver, which is expressed in the wing pouch and distal hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zirin and Mann, 2007</xref>), to knock down <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ds</italic> gene expression via UAS-RNAi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The RNAi resulted in near-complete depletion of Fat and Ds proteins in the wing pouch (<xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 - figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).</p>
<p>As expected, knockdown of either <italic>fat</italic> or <italic>ds</italic> in the wing pouch had no effect on body growth of larvae, and animals reached a normal final weight setpoint (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,C</xref>). The third instar stage ended at the same time as for wildtype. Knockdown of both <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ds</italic> together (<italic>nub&gt;fat ds</italic>(RNAi)) in the wing pouch had a slight effect on larval growth but animals reached their normal weight setpoint at the normal time (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B,C</xref>). Thus, <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ds</italic> are not required in the wing to limit body growth.</p>

<p>Knockdown of <italic>ds</italic> caused the wing pouch to grow at a faster rate than normal. The wing pouch was 28% larger at the WPP stage and continued to grow an additional 14% to the BPP stage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>fat</italic> had a weak effect; <italic>nub&gt;fat</italic>(RNAi) wings at WPP stage were approximately 11% larger than controls but were no larger at the BPP stage (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>). The weak effect was not due to incomplete knockdown, since increasing the number of <italic>UAS-fat</italic>(RNAi) transgenes did not lead to more overgrowth (data not shown). Knockdown of both <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ds</italic> together resulted in wing growth that resembled growth of <italic>nub&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi), although the final wing size was slightly larger when both <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ds</italic> were knocked down (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>). In contrast, notum growth in <italic>nub&gt;fat</italic>(RNAi)<italic>, nub&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi), and <italic>nub&gt;fat ds</italic>(RNAi) animals was similar to controls, which would be expected if the genes were not required in the wing pouch for notum growth control (<xref rid="figs5-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 - figure supplement 2</xref>). In conclusion, the autonomous effects of <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ds</italic> on wing growth were less severe than those of whole-body loss of <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ds</italic>, suggesting there are additional, non-autonomous requirements for Fat/Ds in wing growth.</p>
<p>Allometric growth of the wing pouch was also examined (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>ds</italic> caused the entire allometric relationship to shift such that <italic>nub&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi) wings were consistently bigger for their given body size. A similar trend was observed for <italic>nub&gt;fat ds</italic>(RNAi) wings, although like the <italic>fat</italic> loss-of-function mutant, the first linear phase of allometric growth was extended (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). In summary, it appears that Ds is required to tune down the allometric relationship of the wing to the body. Allometric wing growth appears to have little autonomous need for Fat alone. However, Fat may have some overlapping function with Ds since allometric growth of <italic>nub&gt;fat ds</italic>(RNAi) wings is slightly different from <italic>nub&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi) wings.</p>
<p>To further explore the autonomous requirements for Fat and Ds, we used <italic>ap-Gal4</italic> to specifically drive <italic>ds</italic> RNAi in the dorsal (D) compartment of the wing disc (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). This allowed us to measure growth effects by comparing the affected D compartment to the unaffected ventral (V) compartment, serving as an internal control. As expected, RNAi resulted in undetectable Ds protein in the D compartment, though it was detected in the V compartment (<xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 - figure supplement 1E</xref>). We measured the final set-point size of each compartment in the wing pouch. Knockdown of <italic>ds</italic> caused the D/V ratio of compartment size to increase by 60% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Overall wing pouch size was unaffected by <italic>ap&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi) knockdown (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I</xref>) since there are mechanisms in which the compartments sense overall pouch size, resulting in undergrowth of one compartment when there is overgrowth in the other compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1993</xref>). We also used an <italic>en-Gal4</italic> driver to specifically generate RNAi of <italic>fat</italic> or <italic>ds</italic> in the posterior (P) compartment of the wing disc (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>). As expected, RNAi resulted in undetectable Fat and Ds proteins in the P compartment but not the anterior (A) compartment (<xref rid="figs5-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 - figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). After knockdown, the P/A ratio of compartment size was increased by 63% and 23% in <italic>en&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi) and <italic>en</italic>&gt;<italic>fat</italic>(RNAi) wing pouches, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>). This was consistent with wing pouch knockdown of the genes, where <italic>nub&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi) was more severe than <italic>nub&gt;fat</italic>(RNAi) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>). <italic>en&gt;fat ds</italic>(RNAi) showed an increase in the P/A ratio by 193%, a synergistic effect greater than the sum of effects from knockdown of each individual gene alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>). This synergism had not been observed in the <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> knockdown experiments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref>). Possibly non-autonomous effects of knockdown in the P compartment of the notum are influencing wing pouch growth properties. <italic>en&gt;fat</italic>(RNAi), <italic>en&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi), and <italic>en&gt;fat ds</italic>(RNAi) affected overall wing pouch size to a lesser extent, with respective 10%, 19%, and 32% increases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5N</xref>).</p>

<title>Ds and Fat regulate wing pouch size by affecting cell proliferation</title>
<p>To determine whether Ds regulates cell number, cell size or both, we segmented cells in the imaged wing pouch of <italic>ap&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi) WPP animals using E-cadherin tagged with mCherry to outline the apical domains of cells. We used a computational pipeline that segments imaginal disc cells with &gt;99% accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gallagher et al., 2022</xref>). The number of <italic>ds</italic>(RNAi) cells in the D compartment was 42% higher than the wildtype control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). The average size of <italic>ds</italic>(RNAi) cells in the D compartment, as measured by apical domain area, was unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>). Thus, the enhanced size of <italic>ds</italic>(RNAi) wing pouches is primarily driven by an increase in cell number.</p>
<p>Ds might autonomously regulate wing cell number by stimulating apoptosis or by inhibiting cell proliferation. There is little to no apoptosis reported to occur in the third instar larval wing pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Milan et al., 1997</xref>), which we confirmed by anti-caspase 3 staining (data not shown). To monitor cell proliferation, we developed a method to infer the average cell cycle time from fixed and stained wing discs. Discs were stained with anti-PHH3, which exclusively marks cells in M phase of the cell cycle. During the third instar larval stage, sporadic PHH3-positive cells are uniformly distributed throughout the wing pouch, as expected for uniform asynchronous proliferation (<xref rid="figs1-4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). Using manual and computational segmentation of the images, we identified and counted the number of wing cells in M phase and also counted the total number of wing cells. The ratio of number of M-phase cells to total cells is known as the mitotic index (<italic>MI</italic>). We found the average time for third instar larval wing pouch cells to transit M phase to be 20.5 min or 0.34 hr (<xref rid="figs6-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 - figure supplement 1</xref>), which is highly similar to previous measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, the average cell cycle time <italic>T<sub>cc</sub></italic> can be inferred as

<p>We then estimated the average cell cycle time for the wing pouch at various times during the third instar larval stage. It had been previously reported that there was a progressive lengthening of the cell cycle over developmental time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fain and Stevens, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>).

The <italic>nub</italic>&gt;<italic>ds</italic>(RNAi) cell cycle time linearly scaled with wing pouch volume (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, the scaling coefficient for <italic>ds</italic>(RNAi) cells was much smaller than wildtype (<italic>p</italic> = 6.2 x10<sup>-4</sup>). This meant that cell cycle duration was not lengthening as rapidly as normal and so cell cycle times were consistently shorter. The shorter cell cycle in <italic>nub</italic>&gt;<italic>ds</italic>(RNAi) cells would account for the higher growth rate of the wing pouch size observed for <italic>nub&gt;ds</italic>(RNAi) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>We also examined the scaling relationship between cell cycle time and wing pouch volume when <italic>fat</italic> was knocked down by <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> driven RNAi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The scaling coefficient for <italic>nub&gt;fat</italic>(RNAi) cells was highly similar to the wildtype control. This is consistent with our observation that wing pouch size in <italic>nub&gt;fat</italic>(RNAi) animals was close to normal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Finally, we examined the scaling between cell cycle time and wing pouch volume when both <italic>ds</italic> and <italic>fat</italic> were simultaneously knocked down by <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> driven RNAi (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). This resulted in a much smaller scaling coefficient than normal (<italic>p</italic> = 9.6 x10<sup>-6</sup>), which was similar to the <italic>ds</italic>(RNAi) effect on the scaling coefficient (<italic>p</italic> = 0.089 comparing <italic>ds</italic>(RNAi) to <italic>fat ds</italic>(RNAi) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, Fat and Ds regulate a mechanism that couples the duration of the cell cycle to overall wing pouch size. They are not essential for the coupling mechanism itself but rather they tune the mechanism so as to ensure the growth rate of the wing is attenuated relative to the body. This coordinates the relative scaling of the wing to the final body size.</p>

<title>The gradients of Fat and Ds protein have little effect on wing pouch growth</title>
<p>Fat and Ds regulate the mechanism by which the cell cycle progressively lengthens as wing size increases, ensuring a proper allometric growth relationship between wing and body. As the wing grows in size, the complementary gradients of Fat and Ds protein across the wing pouch progressively diminish in steepness. These observations suggest a hypothesis that connects the two; namely, wing growth progressively slows because the Fat and Ds gradients become shallower, and growth ultimately ceases when the Fat gradient flattens. To test the hypothesis, we used <italic>nub-Gal4</italic>, which drives graded expression in the larval wing pouch, high in the center of the pouch and low at the margins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Using <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> to express <italic>UAS-ds,</italic> we were able to reverse the normal Ds protein gradient (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B-D</xref> and <xref rid="figs7-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 - figure supplement 1A</xref>). A peak of Ds was centered along the DV axis and skewed towards the anterior along the AP axis. As larvae reached the end of the third instar, the artificial gradient became shallower but was still reversed. Interestingly, the reversed Ds gradient caused a change in the Fat gradient (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). Its peak also became skewed to the anterior and did not normally flatten at the WPP stage. We then measured growth in the <italic>nub&gt;ds</italic> larvae (<xref rid="figs7-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 - figure supplement 1B-E</xref>). The growth curve of the larval wing pouch was indistinguishable from wildtype, and wing growth ceased normally at the WPP stage of the larva-pupa molt (<xref rid="figs7-1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 - figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). This result suggests that the dynamics of graded Ds expression do not control wing growth.</p>

<p>The Fat protein profile did not flatten at the WPP stage in <italic>nub&gt;ds</italic> animals, and yet wing growth ended. It suggests that the flattening of the Fat gradient does not trigger growth cessation. To further test this idea, we expressed HA-tagged Fat using the <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> driver without eliminating endogenous Fat (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref> and <xref rid="figs7-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 - figure supplement 2A</xref>). We monitored both transgenic and endogenous sources of Fat protein, and found both were distributed across the wing pouch in a gradient that was highest in the pouch center (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G,H</xref>). Strikingly, both transgenic and endogenous Fat gradients did not diminish in magnitude as larvae approached the pupa molt. Moreover, the gradients did not flatten at the WPP stage but only did so at the later BPP stage. We then examined the growth properties in <italic>nub&gt;fat-HA</italic> animals. The relationship between the cell cycle time in the <italic>nub&gt;fat-HA</italic> wing pouch and wing pouch size was indistinguishable from wildtype (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I</xref>). This was consistent with the observation that final wing pouch size in <italic>nub&gt;fat-HA</italic> animals was normal (<xref rid="figs7-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 - figure supplement 2B</xref>). In summary, Fat and Ds gradient dynamics do not appear to play a significant role in wing growth control.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Growth control of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing utilizes numerous mechanisms, ranging from systemic mechanisms involving insulin-like peptides and ecdysone secreted from other tissues, to autonomous mechanisms involving paracrine growth factors (Dpp and Wg), Hippo signaling, and cadherin molecules such as Fat and Ds. Here, we have focused on the macroscopic features of Fat and Ds that function in wing growth control. Fat and Ds attenuate the rate of wing growth so that it properly scales with body growth via a complex allosteric relationship. They do so by tuning the rate at which the cell cycle progressively lengthens in a linear fashion as the wing grows in size. This rate of lengthening is enhanced by the actions of Fat and Ds.</p>
<p>It has been long known that the cell cycle in the wing disc slows down, with a cell doubling time of 6 hr during the second instar increasing to 30 hr by the end of third instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fain and Stevens, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bryant and Levinson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bittig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). Although this phenomenon is expected to have an impact on the overall rate of wing growth, the phenomenon has not been extensively studied. It was found that lengthening of the G2 phase of the cell cycle is primarily responsible for the longer doubling times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fain and Stevens, 1982</xref>). A more recent study found a link between the cell doubling time and the morphogen Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). Dpp is continually synthesized in a stripe of cells at the AP midline of the wing disc and is transported to form a stably graded distribution of protein that is bilaterally symmetric around the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Teleman and Cohen, 2000</xref>). The Dpp gradient is maintained over days of larval development, during which its relative size adapts to the increasing size of the wing disc. The gradient precisely scales to remain proportional to the size of the growing disc by a mechanism involving the extracellular protein Pentagone and tissue-scale transport of recycled Dpp after endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ben-Zvi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hamaratoglu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wartlick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Romanova-Michaelides et al., 2022</xref>). As the gradient scales with the wing, the local concentration of Dpp any wing cell experiences continuously increases over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The doubling time of wing disc cells was found to strongly correlate with this temporal increase in Dpp concentration, such that an average cell divided when Dpp increased by 40% relative to its level at the beginning of the division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). This correlation suggests that cell cycle time is defined by a temporal increase in Dpp signaling, a hypothesis supported by mathematical modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Averbukh et al., 2014</xref>). The correlation was observed across larval development, indicating that progressive lengthening of the cell cycle may be caused by a slowing rate of increase in local Dpp concentration over time.</p>
<p>How then might Fat and Ds tune this relationship? Fat acts through an atypical myosin named Dachs; loss of the <italic>dachs</italic> gene completely suppresses the overgrowth phenotype of <italic>fat</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cho and Irvine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mao et al., 2006</xref>). Fat signaling inhibits or destabilizes apico-cortical localization of Dachs protein, consistent with the genetically antagonistic roles played by <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>dachs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brittle et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of <italic>dachs</italic> also suppresses overproliferation of wing disc cells when a constitutively-active form of the Dpp receptor protein is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, loss of <italic>fat</italic> enhances Dpp signaling within wing disc cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tyler and Baker, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that local Ds and Fat signaling between cells attenuates their sensitivity to Dpp as a mitogen. It would then require a larger temporal increase in Dpp concentration to trigger cells to divide. This model is consistent with our observation that <italic>fat ds</italic> (RNAi) wing cells do not lengthen their cell cycle as rapidly as normal.</p>
<p>Fat acts through Dachs to regulate the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pan, 2010</xref>). Dachs physically binds to Warts when overexpressed in cells and promotes its destruction. It is thought that Fat signals through Warts to attenuate the nuclear abundance of Yki, thus downregulating transcription of Yki target genes. What target genes might mediate the effects of Fat and Ds on cell cycle dynamics in the wing pouch? Target genes such as <italic>myc</italic> and <italic>cycE</italic> regulate the length of G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee and Orr-Weaver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gallant, 2013</xref>). However, the length of G2 phase was found to determine the progressive lengthening of the cell cycle in the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fain and Stevens, 1982</xref>). A more likely transcriptional target of Yki might be <italic>bantam</italic>, which indirectly activates Cdc25, a key regulator of the G2/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Oh and Irvine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gerlach et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, Fat signaling could attenuate <italic>bantam</italic> expression and Cdc25 activity, thus expanding the length of the G2 phase. This mechanism is particularly attractive since the transcriptional effector of Dpp signaling, Mad, also activates <italic>bantam</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Oh and Irvine, 2011</xref>). Yki and Mad proteins directly bind one another and associate with an enhancer in the <italic>bantam</italic> gene. Enhancer activity is weaker if Yki is knocked down but Dpp signaling is still present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Oh and Irvine, 2011</xref>). Perhaps Fat and Ds tune the cell cycle time though this common effector gene.</p>
<p>An alternative model is that Fat and Ds control the rate at which Dpp levels increase in the wing pouch over time. In this model, cells experience a slower rate in the rise of Dpp levels because of Fat/Ds signaling. Evidence to support the model comes from studies finding that the <italic>dally</italic> and <italic>dally-like</italic> (<italic>dlp</italic>) genes are transcriptionally activated by Yki in the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baena-Lopez et al., 2008</xref>). Dally and Dlp are glypicans that contribute to boosting the Dpp morphogen gradient range, perhaps by ensuring retention of Dpp at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stapornwongkul and Vincent, 2021</xref>). Fat and Ds signaling appears to diminish <italic>dally</italic> and <italic>dlp</italic> expression, and mutations in <italic>dally</italic> and <italic>dlp</italic> suppress the overgrowth phenotypes of <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ds</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baena-Lopez et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Ds is required in both signal-sending cells as well as signal-responding cells, suggesting that Ds has both ligand- and receptor-like activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Casal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Willecke et al., 2008</xref>). We find growth dependence on Ds and Fat is consistent with such complex activities. Knockdown of Ds alone stimulates growth while knock down of Fat alone does not. Thus, Ds is not solely acting through Fat to signal cells. Knockdown of both Ds and Fat has a slightly stronger effect on growth stimulation. Thus, Fat and Ds have overlapping functions in signaling cells to limit their growth. Absence of both cadherins results in cells having a cell cycle that lengthens in time at a slower pace than normal.</p>
<p>Ds and Fat have unusual properties for a ligand and receptor. Based on experiments with clones expressing Ds at different levels than their neighbors, it was suggested that Fat signaling is regulated by the steepness of a Ds gradient across a field of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Rogulja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Willecke et al., 2008</xref>). A steep gradient of Ds inactivates Fat signaling, whereas a shallow gradient activates Fat signaling. Indeed, we find the natural Ds expression pattern has a graded distribution with a steep slope in the lateral region of the wing pouch (near the margin) and a shallow slope in the medial region of the pouch (near the center). This is consistent with experiments finding Fat primarily inhibits growth in the medial region, where a shallow distribution of Ds occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schwank et al., 2011</xref>). We find that Ds not only regulates Fat activity but also its abundance. Fat is distributed in a gradient that is complementary to the Ds gradient - Fat is most abundant in cells where the Ds gradient is lowest and most shallow. Loss of Ds affects the Fat gradient such that distribution of Fat is uniformly upregulated to peak levels. Likewise, inversion of the Ds gradient has a similar effect on Fat distribution. These results suggest that Fat protein levels might be upregulated when cells sense a shallow gradient of Ds.</p>
<p>The graded distribution of Fat protein across the pouch is not stable over time but becomes progressively flatter as the larva-pupa molt is reached. The significance of these dynamics is unclear, but the flattening of the Fat gradient is not a trigger for growth cessation. Since Ds regulates the Fat gradient, perhaps Ds activity is variable over time, leading to these dynamics.</p>

<p>Animals were raised at 25°C under standard lab conditions on molasses-cornmeal fly food. Only males were analyzed in experiments. For staged collections, 100 adult females were crossed with 50 adult males and allowed to lay eggs for 4 hours (6 pm to 10 pm) in egg-laying cages with yeast paste. First-instar larvae that hatched between 7 and 9 pm the following day were collected, thus synchronizing age to a 2-hour hatching window. Approximately 200 - 300 larvae were transferred into a bottle. Third-instar larvae were collected from the bottle every 12 hours at 8 am and 8 pm, from 3.5 days after egg laying (AEL) until pupariation (i.e., 5 days for wildtype). We also collected animals at the white-prepupae (WPP) stage and the brown-prepupae (BPP) stage. The BPP stage is 1 hour after the WPP stage, when the pupal case begins to turn brown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bainbridge and Bownes, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Collected animals were weighed in batches of 5 individuals to account for instrument sensitivity. They were individually photographed using a Nikon SMZ-U dissection scope equipped with a Nikon DS-Fi3 digital camera at 1920 × 1200 resolution with a 8 µm x-y pixel size. Length and width were measured in a custom-built Matlab pipeline as follows. The outline of the body was recorded with manual inputs. The midline was calculated by the Matlab bwskel function and manually corrected. The midline was recorded as the length. At every pixel along the midline, a perpendicular line was computed, and the width recorded. The mean width was then calculated. We approximated the volume of each larva by treating it as a cylinder and using the measured length and average width of the larva for length and diameter, respectively.</p>

After 3 washes in PBSTx, between 5 - 40 wing discs were mounted in 40 µL of Vectashield Plus between a 18×18 mm number 1.5 coverslip (Zeiss # 474030-9000-000) and a 24×60 mm number 1.5 coverslip (VWR # 48393-251). Mounting between two coverslips allowed the samples to be imaged from both directions. The volume of mounting media used was critical so that discs were not overly compressed by the coverslips. Compression led to fluorescent signals from the peripodial membrane to be too close in z-space to the disc proper, making it difficult to distinguish the two during image processing.</p>

<title>Live disc imaging</title>
<p>Wing discs were dissected from third instar larvae bearing two copies of <italic>E-cadherin-GFP</italic>. These were cultured ex-vivo in live imaging chambers following the protocol exactly as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gallagher et al. (2022)</xref>. The samples were imaged using an inverted microscope (Leica DMI6000 SD) fitted with a CSU-X1 spinning-disk head (Yokogawa) and a back-thinned EMCCD camera (Photometrics Evolve 512 Delta). Images were captured every 5 minutes with a 40x objective (NA = 1.3) at 512 × 512 resolution with a 0.32 µm x-y pixel size.</p>

<title>Image acquisition of fixed samples</title>
<p>All experiments with fixed tissues were imaged using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. Whole wing discs were imaged using a 10x air objective (NA = 0.4) and 0.75x internal zoom at 1024 × 1024 resolution, with a 1.52 µm x-y pixel size. Wing pouches were imaged using a 63x oil objective (NA = 1.4) and 0.75x internal zoom at 1024 × 1024 resolution, with a 0.24 µm x-y pixel size and 0.35 µm z separation. Scans were collected bidirectionally at 600 MHz and were 3x line averaged in the following channels to detect: anti-PHH3 (blue), Fat-GFP and Ds-GFP (green), anti-Wg and anti-En (red), and anti-HA or anti-Ds or anti-E-cadherin (far red). Wing discs of different genotypes and similar age were mounted on the same microscope slide and imaged in the same session for consistency in data quality.</p>

<title>Image processing</title>
<p>Raw images were processed using a custom-built Matlab pipeline with no prior preprocessing. The pipeline consists of several modules: 1) surface detection, 2) wing disc, pouch, and midline segmentation, 3) volume measurement, 4) fluorescence intensity measurement, 5) cell segmentation, 6) mitotic index measurement.</p>
<sec id="s4h1">
<title>1) Surface detection</title>
<p>Fat-GFP and Ds-GFP proteins localize to the apical region of cells in the wing disc proper. These proteins are also localized in cells of the peripodial membrane, which is positioned near the apical surface of the disc proper. In order to get a 2D projection of the signal in the wing disc proper excluding the peripodial membrane signal, we used an open-source software package called ImSAnE – Image Surface Analysis Environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Heemskerk and Streichan, 2015</xref>). The detailed parameters we used have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gallagher et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, we used the MIPDetector module to find the brightest z-position of every xy pixel followed by tpsFitter to fit a single layer surface through these identified z-positions. Using the onionOpts function in ImSAnE, we output a 9-layer z-stack, 4 layers above and below the computed surface that capture the entire signal from the wing disc proper. However, this operation still sometimes includes fluorescence signals from the peripodial membrane. Therefore, we manually masked the residual peripodial signal using FIJI 1.53t. The resulting z-stack was sum-projected to form a 2D surface projection of the wing disc proper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h2">
<title>2) Wing disc, pouch, and midline segmentation</title>
<p>Wing discs were counterstained for both Wg and En proteins, which mark the wing pouch dorsal-ventral (DV) midline and anterior-posterior (AP) midline, respectively. Although both Wg and En proteins were stained with the same Alexa 546 fluorescent antibody, the two signals were readily distinguished by their distinct separation in z space. Wg is apically localized in cells of the disc proper and En is nuclear localized more basally in the disc proper. Moreover, the Wg signal was far stronger than En, allowing for detection of its stripe in the posterior compartment even with a max projection.</p>
<p>We built a semi-automated Matlab script that computationally segments the wing disc into discrete objects. i) <italic>Wing disc segmentation</italic>. Endogenous Fat-GFP or Ds-GFP signal was used to segment the wing disc from surrounding media. ii) <italic>Wing pouch segmentation.</italic> The 3D morphology of the wing disc creates narrow and deep tissue folds that surround the wing pouch (<xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - figure supplement 2A</xref>). Using these morphological landmarks that were visualized by the Fat-GFP or Ds-GFP signals, the Matlab script recorded user-derived mouse-clicks that defined the wing pouch boundary. This method was validated to be 95.5% accurate when compared to a wing pouch boundary that was defined by the expression boundary of a reporter for the <italic>vestigial</italic> quadrant enhancer, <italic>5x-QE-DsRed</italic> (<xref rid="figs1-2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 - figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). iii) <italic>DV midline segmentation.</italic> The Wg signal was used to segment the DV midline running through the segmented wing pouch. Since the Wg and En signals are distinguishable in z space, the upper third of the z-stack was max projected to segment Wg. An adaptive threshold of 0.6 was used to binarize the image into Wg-positive pixels. The binarized and raw images were used to inform manual input of the DV midline. iv) <italic>AP midine segmentation.</italic> The En signal was used to segment the AP midline running through the segmented wing pouch. The lower two-thirds of the z-stack was max projected and binarized in En+ pixels. The binarized and raw images were used to inform manual input of the AP midline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h3">
<title>3) Volume measurement</title>
<p>Areas of each of the segmented objects were calculated by summing the number of pixels in each object and multiplying by the pixel dimensions in xy physical space. Notum-hinge area was calculated by subtracting the segmented pouch area from total segmented wing disc area. The thickness of the wing pouch was measured at the intersection of the AP and DV midlines using the orthogonal views tool in FIJI. The first layer is defined by the initial signal of Fat-GFP or Ds-GFP at this xy position. The last layer is defined by the first appearance of background signal in the composite image. Thickness of the object was calculated by multiplying the sum of z-slices by the z-separation. To calculate the volume of segmented objects, we multiplied the thickness of the object (in µm) by the object’s surface area (in µm<sup>2</sup>). Conversion from µm<sup>3</sup> to nL units was performed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h4">
<title>4) Fluorescence intensity measurement of Fat-GFP and Ds-GFP</title>
<p>Fluorescence intensity values were averaged across a vector of 50 pixels length that was orthogonal to the segmented boundary of interest and having 25 pixels residing on each side of the segmented line. These values were then averaged in a sliding window of 100 pixels length that moved along the segmented boundary of interest. Physical distance along the boundaries were measured using ImSAnE function Proper_Dist to account for the curvature of the segmented objects. The intersection of the segmented DV and AP midlines was defined as the center (0,0 µm) of the wing pouch, with the anterior/dorsal annotated in units of negative µm and the posterior/ventral annotated in units of positive µm. A minimum of three wing discs of the same age and genotype were aligned by their (0,0) centers and their fluorescent measurements were averaged along the AP and DV midlines.</p>
<p>Older third instar, WPP, and BPP wing discs begin to evert such that the ventral compartment is partially folded underneath the dorsal compartment. However, the ventral compartment can still be accurately segmented to measure area and thickness even under these conditions. For GFP measurements, the folded specimen resulted in dimmer fluorescent signals from the compartment farthest from the objective due to tissue thickness and light scattering. Thus, measurements were limited to the compartment closest to the objective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h5">
<title>5) Cell boundary segmentation</title>
<p>To count cell numbers and cell sizes in the wing pouch, we analyzed wing discs imaged from <italic>E-cadherin-GFP</italic> or <italic>E-cadherin-mCherry</italic> larvae. We used a machine learning pixel-classification model based on a convolutional neural net to segment cell boundaries in the surface projections. This model was trained on a broad range of image data derived from Cadherin-GFP labeled <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gallagher et al., 2022</xref>). The model is &gt; 99.5% accurate at segmenting cells when compared to ground truth. Cell size (surface area) and number were computed for specific compartments in the wing pouch.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h6">
<title>6) Mitotic index measurement</title>
<p>Phospho-histone H3 (PHH3) has been used to estimate mitotic index previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wartlick et al., 2011</xref>). Wing discs were immunostained for PHH3, which labels nuclei undergoing mitosis. These nuclei were manually recorded by user-defined mouse clicks at or near the center of each nucleus. Their Euclidean distances relative to the segmented AP and DV midlines were calculated as was the number of PHH3+ cells. To estimate the total cell number in a wing pouch, we used E-cadherin to computationally segment cells as described above. Each imaged wing pouch had a subset of cell boundaries segmented in a subdomain of the pouch. This was then used to calculate cell density: number of segmented cells divided by subdomain area. The density value was multiplied by total wing pouch area to estimate the total number of wing pouch cells for that sample. We then derived an averaged conversion factor to apply to each volume measurement in order to estimate total cell number. This was done by plotting the estimated total cell number versus wing pouch volume for all discs of a given genotype. Linear regression of the data produced an equation to convert pouch volume to cell number (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The number of PHH3+ cells in a wing pouch was divided by the estimated cell number in that wing pouch to obtain the mitotic index, the fraction of cells in M phase at the time of fixation. Average M phase time, measured by live-imaging, was divided by the mitotic index to obtain the average cell cycle time.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical tests included two-tailed Student’s t-tests to compare between genotypes. We conducted linear regression modeling to fit pouch volume as an independent variable and cell cycle time as a dependent variable. To statistically test for differences between genotypes, we used a multiple linear regression model:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="551465v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Genotype was entered into the model as a covariate to test for differences in intercepts of the fits. Interaction of volume × genotype was entered to test for differences in slope of the fits. Linear regression models were plotted with 95% confidence intervals.</p>

<p>Summary and Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript presents novel results on the regulation of Drosophila wing growth by the protocadherins Ds and Fat. The manuscript performs a more careful analysis of disc volume, larval size, and the relationship between the two, in normal and mutant larvae, and after localized knockdown or overexpression of Fat and Ds. Not all of the results are equally surprising given the previous work on Fat, Ds, and their regulation of disc growth, pupariation, and the Hippo pathway, but the presentation and detail of the presented data is new. The most novel results concern the scaling of gradients of Fat and Ds protein during development, a largely unstudied gradient of Fat protein, and using overexpression of Ds to argue that changes in the Ds gradient do not underlie the slowing and halting of cell divisions during development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Below I list questions and suggestions about the methodology, the presentation, and the interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>1. Pouch growth: division or recruitment? The study chooses to examine growth only in the prospective wing blade (the &quot;pouch&quot;) rather than the wing disc as a whole. This can create biases, as fat and ds manipulations often cause stronger effects on growth, and on Hippo signaling targets, in the adjacent hinge regions of the disc. So I am curious about this choice.</p>
<p>The limitation to the wing region also creates some problems for the measurements themselves. The division between wing and pouch is not a strict lineage boundary, and thus cells can join or leave this region, creating two different reasons for changes in wing pouch size; growth of cells already in the region, or recruitment of cells into or out of the region. The authors do not discuss the second mechanism.</p>
<p>It is not at all clear that the markers for the pouch used by the authors are stable during development. One of these is Vg expression, or the Vg quadrant enhancer. But the Vg-expressing region is thought to increase by recruitment over late second and third instar through a feed-forward mechanism by which Vg-expressing cells induce Vg expression in adjacent cells. In fact, this process is thought to be driven in part by Fat and Ds (Zecca et al 2010). So when the authors manipulate Fat and Ds are they increasing growth or simply increasing Vg recruitment? I would prefer that this limitation be addressed.</p>
<p>The second pouch marker the authors use is epithelial folding, but this also has problems, as Fat and Ds manipulations change folding. Even in wild type, the folding patterns are complex. For instance, to make folding fit the Vg-QE pattern at late third the authors appear to be jumping in the dorsal pouch between two different sets of folds (Fig 1S2A). The authors also do not show how they use folding patterns in younger, less folded discs, nor provide evidence that the location of the folds are the same and do not shift relative to the cells. They also do not explain how they use folds and measure at later wpp and bpp stages, as the discs unfold and evert, exposing cells that were previously hidden in the folds.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors limit their measurements to cells with exposed apical faces and thus a measurable area but apparently ignore the cells inside the folds. At late third, however, a substantial amount of the prospective wing blade is found within the folds, especially where they are deepest near the A/P compartment boundary. Using the third vein sensory organ precursors as markers, the L3-2 sensillum is found just distal to the fold, the L3-1 and the ACV sensilla are within the fold, and the GSR of the distal hinge is found just proximal to the fold. That puts the proximal half of the central wing blade in the fold, and apparently uncounted in their assays. These cells will however be exposed at wpp and especially bpp stages. How are the authors adjusting for this?</p>
<p>1. Stabilizing and destabilizing interactions between Fat and Ds- The authors describe a distal accumulation of Fat protein in the wing, and show that this is unlikely to be through Fat transcription. They further try to test whether the distal accumulation depends on destabilization of proximal Fat by proximal Ds by looking at Fat in ds mutant discs.</p>
<p>However, the authors do not describe how they take into account the stabilizing effects of heterophilic binding between the extracellular domains (ECDs) of Fat and Ds; without one, the junctional levels and stability of the other is reduced (Ma et al., 2003; Hale et al. 2015). So when they show that the A-P gradient of Fat is reduced in a ds mutant, is this because of the loss of a destabilizing effect of Ds on Fat, as they assume, or is it because all junctional Fat has been destabilized by loss of extracelluarlar binding to Ds? The description of the Fat gradient in Ds mutants is also confusing (see note 6 below), making this section difficult for the reader to follow.</p>
<p>The authors do not propose or test a mechanism for the proposed destabilization. Fat and Ds bind not only through their ECDs, but binding has now also been demonstrated through their ICDs (Fulford et al. 2023)</p>
<p>1. Ds gradient scales by volume, rather than cell number - This is an intriguing result, but the authors do not discuss possible mechanisms.</p>
<p>2. Autonomous effects on growth- Fat and Ds are already known to have autonomous effects on growth and Hippo signaling from clonal analyses and localized knockdowns. One novelty here is showing that localized knockdown does not delay pupariation in the way that whole animal knockdown does, although the mechanism is not investigated. Another novelty is that the authors find stronger wing pouch overgrowth after localized ds RNAi or whole disc loss of fat than after localized fat RNAi, the latter being only 11% larger. The fat RNAi result would have strengthened by testing different fat RNAi stocks, which vary in their strength and are commonly weaker than null mutations, or stronger drivers such as the ap-gal4 they used for some of their ds-RNAi experiments or use of UAS-dcr2. Another reason for caution is that Garoia (2005) found much stronger overgrowth in fat mutant clones, which were about 75% larger than control clones.</p>
<p>3. Flattening of Ds gradients does not slow growth. One model suggests that the flattening of the Ds gradient, and thus polarized Ds-Fat binding, account for slowed growth in older discs. The difficulty in the past has been that two ways of flattening the Ds gradient, either removing Ds or overexpressing Ds uniformly, give opposite results; the first increases growth, while the latter slows it. Both experiments have the problem of not just flattening the gradient, but also altering overall levels of Ds-Fat binding, which will likely alter growth independent of the gradients. Here, the authors instead use overexpression to create a strong Ds gradient (albeit a reversely oriented one) that does not flatten, and show that this does not prevent growth from slowing and arresting.</p>
<p>To make sure that this is not some effect caused by using a reverse gradient, one might instead induce a more permanent normally oriented Ds gradient and see if this also does not alter growth; there is a ds Trojan gal4 line available that might work for this, and several other proximal drivers.</p>
<p>Another possible problem is that, unlike previous studies, the authors have not blocked the Four-jointed gradient; Fj alters Fat-Ds binding and might regulate polarity independently of Ds expression. A definitive test would be to perform the tests above in four-joined mutant discs.</p>
<p>The Discussion of these data should be improved. The authors state in the Discussion &quot;The significance of these dynamics is unclear, but the flattening of the Fat gradient is not a trigger for growth cessation.&quot; While the Discussion mentions the effects of Ds on Fat distribution in some detail, this is the only phrase that discusses growth, which is surprising given how often the gradient model of growth control is mentioned elsewhere. The reader would be helped if details are given about what experiment supports this conclusion, the effect on not only growth cessation but cell cycle time, and why the result differs from those of Rogjula 2008 and Willecke 2008 using Ds and Fj overexpression.</p>
<p>1. Discussion of Dpp. The authors spend much of the discussion speculating on the possibility that Fat and Ds control growth by changing the wing's sensitivity to the BMP Dpp. As the manuscript contains no new data on Dpp, this is somewhat surprising. The discussion also ignores Schwank (2011), who argues that Fat and Dpp are relatively independent. There have also been studies showing genetic interactions between Fat and signaling pathways such as Wg (Cho and Irvine 2004) and EGF (Garoia 2005).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript from Liu et al. examines the role of Fat and Dachsous, two transmembrane proto-cadherins that function both in planar cell polarity and in tissue growth control mediated by the Hippo pathway. The authors developed a new method for measuring growth of the wing imaginal disc during late larval development and then used this approach to examine the effects of disruption of Fat/Dachsous function on disc growth. The authors show that during mid to late third instar the wing imaginal disc normally grows in a linear rather than exponential fashion and that this occurs due to slowing of the mitotic cell cycle as the disc grows during this period. Consistent with their known role in regulating Hippo pathway activity, this slowing of growth is disrupted by loss of Fat/Dachsous function. The authors also observed a previously unreported gradient of Fat protein across the wing blade. However, graded expression of Fat or Dachsous is not necessary for proper growth regulation in the late third instar because ectopic Dachsous expression, which affects gradients of both Dachsous and Fat, has no growth phenotype.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although the role of the Hippo pathway in growth control has been extensively studied, our understanding of how the pathway controls growth during normal development remains relatively weak. This work addresses this question by examining normal growth of the wing imaginal disc during part of its development in the larva and characterizing the effects of Fat/Dachsous manipulation on that growth. The authors developed tools for measuring wing growth by measuring wing volume, an approach that could be useful in future studies of tissue growth.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Although the approach used to measure volume is new to this study, the basic finding that imaginal disc growth slows at the mid-third instar stage has been known for some time from studies that counted disc cell number during larval development (Fain and Stevens, 1982; Graves and Schubiger, 1982). Although these studies did not directly measure disc volume, because cell size in the disc is not known to change during larval development, cell number is an accurate measure of tissue volume. However, it is worth noting that the approach used here does potentially allow for differential growth of different regions of the disc.</p>
<p>2. Related to point 1, a main conclusion of this study, that cell cycle length scales with growth of the wing, is based on a developmentally limited analysis that is restricted to the mid-third instar larval stage and later (early third instar begins at 72 hr - the authors' analysis started at 84 hr). The previous studies cited above made measurements from the beginning of the 3rd instar and combined them with previous histological analyses of cell numbers starting at the beginning of the 2nd instar. Interestingly, both studies found that cell number increases exponentially from the start of the 2nd instar until mid-third instar, and only after that point does the cell cycle slow resulting in the linear growth reported here. The current study states that growth is linear due to scaling of cell cycle with disc size as though this is a general principle, but from the earlier studies, this is not the case earlier in disc development and instead applies only to the last day of larval life.</p>
<p>3. The analysis of the roles of Fat and Dachsous presented here has weaknesses that should be addressed. It is very curious that the authors found that depletion of Fat by RNAi in the wing blade had essentially no effect on growth while depletion of Dachsous did, given that the loss of function overgrowth phenotype of null mutations in fat is more severe than that of null mutations in dachsous (Matakatsu and Blair, 2006). An obvious possibility is that the Fat RNAi transgene employed in these experiments is not very efficient. The authors tried to address this by doubling the dose of the transgene, but it is not clear to me that this approach is known to be effective. The authors should test other RNAi transgenes and additionally include an analysis of growth of discs from animals homozygous for null alleles, which as they note survive to the late larval stages.</p>
<p>4. It is surprising that the authors detect a gradient of Fat expression that has not been seen previously given that this protein has been extensively studied. It is also surprising that they find that expression of Nubbin Gal4 is graded across the wing blade given that previous studies indicate that it is uniform (ie. Martín et al. 2004). These two surprising findings raise the possibility that the quantification of fluorescence could be inaccurate. The curvature of the wing blade makes it a challenging tissue to image, particularly for quantitative measurements.</p>
<p>5. Overall, in my view the impact of these findings is limited. The focus on growth solely at the end of larval development, when there are a number of potentially confounding variables (for example hormonal cues), makes the generality of the findings reported here difficult to judge. Additionally, the functional analysis of Fat/Dachsous function in this process is limited - for example does disruption of other Hippo pathway components have a similar effect?</p>
