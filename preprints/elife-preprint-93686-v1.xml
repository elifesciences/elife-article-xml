<title>Abstract</title><p>Connexins allow intercellular communication by forming gap junction channels (GJCs) between juxtaposed cells. Connexin26 (Cx26) can be regulated directly by CO<sub>2</sub>. This is proposed to be mediated through carbamylation of K125. We show that mutating K125 to glutamate, mimicking the negative charge of carbamylation, causes Cx26 GJCs to be constitutively closed. Through cryo-EM we observe that the K125E mutation pushes a conformational equilibrium towards the channel having a constricted pore entrance, similar to effects seen on raising the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>. In previous structures of connexins, the cytoplasmic loop, important in regulation and where K125 is located, is disordered. Through further cryo-EM studies we trap distinct states of Cx26 and observe density for the cytoplasmic loop. The interplay between the position of this loop, the conformations of the transmembrane helices and the position of the N-terminal helix, which controls the aperture to the pore, provides a mechanism for regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Connexins form hexameric channels in the plasma membrane known as hemichannels, which can either function as regulated passageways between the cell and its environment, or dock with a hemichannel from another cell to form a dodecameric intercellular channel, or gap junction channel (GJC). Connexins have been shown to be directly regulated by various stimuli such as voltage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> or indirectly via intracellular calcium ion concentrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Recent reports based on structural data also suggest that lipids may be involved in regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. We have shown, however, that connexin26 (Cx26) and other similar β-connexins (Cx30, Cx32), can be regulated by the direct action of physiological concentrations of carbon dioxide independently of pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Mutants of Cx26 are a leading cause of congenital deafness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. While many of the mutations are non-syndromic, others lead to severe diseases such as keratitis ichthyosis deafness syndrome (KIDS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Hemichannels are known to have different properties to GJCs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and our previous results show that elevated levels of the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PCO<sub>2</sub>) open Cx26 hemichannels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, which are closed in their resting state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, but close Cx26 GJCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, which are naturally open.</p>
<p>There are 20 connexin genes in the human genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and several structures have now been published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The connexin subunit, which is common to all, consists of four transmembrane helices (TMs) with a cytoplasmic N-terminal helix that in the hexameric arrangement of the hemichannel points towards the central pore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In structures of the dodecameric GJC, the extracellular part, involved in docking is well defined, whereas the cytoplasmic region is much more variable. A large cytoplasmic loop between TM2 and TM3, shown to be involved in regulation, has not been visible in any structure. Structures of the connexins either have the N-terminal helices tucked back against the wall of the channel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, in a raised position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, in an intermediate position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> or not well-defined in the density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and the conformation of the helix is thought to be important in regulation. We have shown previously for human Cx26 GJCs, that the position of the N-terminus is dependent on the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PCO<sub>2</sub>) at constant pH <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Examining structures from protein vitrified at different levels of PCO<sub>2</sub>, we observed that under conditions of high PCO<sub>2</sub> the conformation of the protein is biased towards a conformation where the N-terminus protrudes radially into the pore to form a constriction at the centre (Pore-Constricting N terminus; PCN). On the other hand, at low PCO<sub>2</sub> the N-terminus is less well-defined, appearing to have pulled back from the centre to give a more open channel (Pore Open Flexible N- terminus; POFN).</p>
<p>Based on a wealth of mutational data it has been hypothesised that the regulation of hemichannel opening by CO<sub>2</sub> is through a carbamylation reaction of a specific lysine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This post-translational modification is a reversible and highly labile reaction of CO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> that effectively changes the charge of a neutral lysine residue to make it negative. A so-called &quot;carbamylation motif&quot; K<sub>125</sub>VRIEG<sub>130</sub> was identified in CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive connexins that when introduced into a related CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitive connexin rendered the protein CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In the crystal structure of the Cx26 GJC that was published in 2009<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, Lys125, which is conserved amongst β-connexins that are known to be modulated by CO<sub>2</sub>, is positioned near to the N- terminus of TM3 within ∼6Å of Arg104 of TM2 of the neighbouring subunit, at either side of the disordered cytoplasmic loop. It was suggested that upon carbamylation, the negative charge of the modified lysine would attract Arg104 causing a conformational change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In hemichannels, mutation of Lys125 to glutamate, so mimicking the charge of the carbamylated lysine (K125E) results in constitutively open hemichannels consistent with elevated PCO<sub>2</sub>, whereas the corresponding K125R mutation results in hemichannels that cannot be opened by CO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In GJCs, the K125R mutation desensitises the channels to CO<sub>2</sub> so that they do not shut, though importantly, does not prevent closure by acidification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While our previous structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> demonstrated an effect of PCO<sub>2</sub> on the conformation of the protein, neither Lys125 nor Arg104 were visible in the density. Here we probe this further, with structures of mutants of Lys125. We show that the structure with the K125E mutation has a distinct conformational change consistent with the closure mechanism of the protein that we reported previously. By solubilising the protein in the detergent lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) rather than dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM) we obtain much more defined density for the cytoplasmic region of the protein. We refine two conformationally diverse structures of the protein, where we see profound differences in the cytoplasmic region of the protein. Together our data suggests a mechanism for closure involving the concerted movements of TM2 and the KVRIEG motif. The introduction of a negative charge at K125 favours the closed conformation of the protein.</p>

<title>Mutation of K125 to glutamic acid results in constitutively closed GJCs</title>
<p>Based on our experience with mutations of Cx26 we hypothesised that, if K125E results in constitutively open hemichannels, the same mutation would result in constitutively closed GJCs. To verify the effect of mutating Lys125 to a glutamic acid, we used an established dye transfer assay between coupled cells to assess gap junction function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. For wild type Cx26, gap junctions readily form between cells and allow rapid transfer of dye from a donor (filled via a patch pipette) to a coupled acceptor cell at a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 35 mmHg (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). Cx26<sup>K125E</sup> forms structures that resemble wild type gap junctions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>). However, these gap junctions appear to be shut and do not permit dye transfer at a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 35 mmHg (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b,c</xref>). As the action of an increase in PCO<sub>2</sub> is to close the wild type Cx26 gap junction, unsurprisingly Cx26<sup>K125E</sup> gap junctions remain closed at a PCO<sub>2</sub> of 55 mmHg.</p>

<title>The K125E mutation biases the conformational equilibrium to a more closed structure</title>
<p>Given that the K125E mutant resulted in constitutively closed channels, we set out to solve its structure. With respect to the wild-type construct, purification of this protein resulted in higher yields, consistent with a more stable protein. Cryo-EM data were collected from protein vitrified in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3-</sub> buffers corresponding to a PCO2 of 90mmHg with the pH maintained at pH 7.4 as was done previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.

Superposition of this map onto the equivalent map from the wild-type structure at the same PCO<sub>2</sub> (WT<sub>90</sub>; PDB ID 7QEQ) showed a clear change in the position of the cytoplasmic portion of TM2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-b</xref>, Supplementary Movie S1).</p>

</fig>
<p>Previously, when analysing the WT<sub>90</sub> data, we used a classification procedure involving particle expansion and signal subtraction to focus on just one of the two docked hemichannels of each gap junction. This resulted in two distinct conformations of the protein (WT<sub>90-Class1</sub> with 40% of particles, (PDB ID 7QEY) and WT<sub>90-Class2</sub> with 21% of particles (7QEW)) with the predominant difference between the two in the cytoplasmic portion of TM2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In WT<sub>90-Class2</sub>, compared to WT<sub>90-Class1</sub>, an anticlockwise rotation of TM2 correlated with more definition of the density for the N-terminus. The overall conformation of the K125E<sub>90</sub> reconstruction was very reminiscent of the WT<sub>90-Class2</sub> conformation, indicating a clear bias towards this conformation. To improve the clarity of the cytoplasmic portion of the maps we used the same classification procedure on the K125E<sub>90</sub> data. Reconstructions from the most populated class (43% of the particles (K125E<sub>90-1</sub>) have a nominal resolution of 2.5Å (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>) with a conformation that most resembles the WT<sub>90-Class2</sub>. In the density map deriving from this class, the position of the N-terminus is reasonably well-defined as being in the PCN conformation (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>) but, as we found in our previous WT<sub>90</sub> structures, the first three residues before Gly4 are difficult to position in the averaged density.</p>
<p>Relative to the WT<sub>90-Class2</sub> structure there are two main regions which have been modelled differently in the K125E<sub>90-1</sub> structure after refinement (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). This may be because a more optimal separation of the particles during classification has resulted in a clearer map. The first difference is at the cytoplasmic side of TM3. In all structures of connexins solved to date the cytoplasmic loop has been disordered. For Cx26 this region extends from approximately residue Arg104 at the C-terminus of TM2 to Glu129 at the N- terminus of TM3. In the crystal structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> residues 125 to 129 have been modelled as part of TM3, whereas in our previous structures solved by cryo-EM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> there was no evidence of the helix extending beyond Glu129. Instead, when analysing the previously reported cryo-EM maps it was noted that unassigned density protruded from near to the top of TM3 towards the loop between the N-terminus and TM1 in a manner that resembles models from Alphafold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In the K125E<sub>90-1</sub> map this density is much more clearly defined as the C- terminal end of the cytoplasmic loop as it joins onto TM3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>) and residues Gln124 to Ile128, overlapping with the K<sub>125</sub>VRIEG<sub>130</sub> motif were tentatively modelled into it. Though the density for the side chains is poor and there is no definitive interaction, Lys125 in this position is relatively close to the side chain of Arg104 of the neighbouring subunit, with which it had been proposed to form a salt bridge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>).</p>
<p>The second region that differs is in TM1. Previously we noted a difference between the Cx26 crystal structures and our cryo-EM structures in the position of the residues between Val37 and Glu42 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In the K125E<sub>90-1</sub> structure, the N-terminal region of TM1, comprising residues Gly21 to Phe31, is rotated with respect to that modelled in the WT structures, changing the position of the ρε-helix in TM1 from residues Ile20-Leu25 to residues Phe29-Val38. This results in the side-chain of Trp24 rotating by ∼90° between the two extreme positions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). At one of these extremes, it faces the exterior of the protein, and nestles a detergent or lipid tail. At the other extreme, it is within the core of the protein next to Arg143 and Ala88 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>). This conformation would not be possible with TM2 as modelled in the D6 averaged structure of the WT<sub>90</sub> data set (7QEQ) because Thr86 and Leu89 would clash with Phe31 and Ile30 on TM1.</p>
<p>The difference of the K125E<sub>90</sub> maps from the WT<sub>90</sub> maps indicated a clear bias towards a more closed conformation of the protein in the CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3-</sub> buffers. To understand the contribution of the K125E mutant, independently of any effect of CO<sub>2</sub> we also reanalysed data collected from both WT and K125E protein vitrified in HEPES buffer at pH 7.4. While the resolution of the maps was much lower for these reconstructions (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>) and better for the K125E mutant (4.2Å) than the WT protein (4.9Å) superposition of the respective maps again showed a movement of the cytoplasmic portion of TM2 together with a change in the N-terminus (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref> and Supplementary Movie S2). Thus, it appears that the K125E mutant is sufficient by itself to bias the conformation in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub>. However, CO<sub>2</sub> may have other effects on the protein, for example multiple carbamylation events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, to give the higher resolution and more defined conformation seen in the CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3-</sub> buffers.</p>
<p>In contrast to the K125E mutant, mutating the same lysine to an arginine, which would prevent it from being carbamylated, results in GJCs that do not close<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. We collected data from the protein with this mutation introduced under the same high PCO<sub>2</sub> conditions in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3-</sub> buffer.

<title>Molecule trapped under N-terminal helix likely to be lipid</title>
<p>In all the cryo-EM maps from both this study of mutant Cx26 and our previous study of the wild-type protein we observe density consistent with a hydrophobic molecule in the pore of the protein that could be a lipid or detergent (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.

As the artefactual presence of detergent could potentially interfere with the position of the N-terminus, we decided to solubilise the protein using lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG), a much larger detergent than the dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM) used previously. Thus, if the density was due to a detergent trapped during the solubilisation process it should not be able to bind. We also reasoned that, if the high PCO<sub>2</sub> buffers were biasing the protein to a more closed conformation, carrying out all steps in this buffering system would reduce the entry of any molecule into the pore. Data were collected from the wild type protein solubilised in LMNG at a PCO<sub>2</sub> corresponding to 90mmHg as before. Refinement with D6 symmetry imposed resulted in a map with a nominal resolution of 2.0Å as defined by gold standard Fourier Shell Correlations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Like the maps deriving from protein solubilised in DDM clear density was observed for a similar hydrophobic molecule in the pore of the protein. (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6b</xref>). Though the presence of the molecule may still be an artefact of either the solubilisation process or heterologous expression in insect cells, it strongly suggests that this molecule cannot be detergent and is more likely to be a lipid molecule.</p>

<title>The cytoplasmic side of the protein is much better defined in the presence of LMNG</title>
<p>After classification as above, two classes were selected for further refinement based on the two most extreme positions of TM2 in the POFN (LMNG<sub>90-class1</sub>) and PCN (LMNG<sub>90-class2</sub>) conformations, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>, <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>; Supplementary Movie S3). Though the nominal resolution of the LMNG<sub>90-class2</sub> map (2.3Å) where the protein is in the PCN conformation, is similar to the equivalent WT<sub>90-class2</sub> map, the cytoplasmic region of the protein is better defined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

As seen for the K125E<sub>90-1</sub> structure, however, neither the side-chains of Lys125 nor Arg104 are clearly defined. The density for the side-chains of the residues of the N-terminus and the following link is much clearer than seen in the other maps. His16 nestles up to Ala96 of TM2 and Val126 of the KVREIG motif is situated just above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). Again, though, it is difficult to place the first three residues of the N-terminus unambiguously.</p>

<p>In contrast, in the LMNG<sub>90-class1</sub> map (POFN conformation) neither the N-terminus nor the KVRIEG motif are well defined and the map is reminiscent of the map derived from particles vitrified under low PCO<sub>2</sub> conditions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>).

<title>Density for cytoplasmic loop compatible with models from Alphafold</title>
<p>Despite the LMNG<sub>90-class2</sub> map being much clearer for the cytoplasmic region of the protein residues from 107 to 123 were still missing. We, therefore, carried out further classification of the particles focussed on the cytoplasmic region of a single subunit (see methods). As above, this resulted in a range of maps showing varying positions of the transmembrane helices and clarity of the N-terminal helix (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). Importantly, in one case and where the N-terminus was clearly defined, extra density was also seen for the cytoplasmic loop, albeit at low resolution. Following reconstruction of the full dodecamer from the particles corresponding to this class (LMNG<sub>90-mon-pcn</sub> <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>), the structure was tentatively built into the density with the cytoplasmic loop of the classified subunit in a conformation resembling models from Alphafold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) and with a complete N-terminus. We note, however, density near to Lys125, between Ser19 in the TM1-N-term linker, Tyr212 of TM4 and Tyr97 on TM3 of the neighbouring subunit, which we have been unable to explain with our modelling. Overall, the conformation of the subunit is very similar to the LMNG<sub>90- class2</sub> (PCN) structure with an RMSD of 0.38Å for 198 Cα atoms. Rather surprisingly, only the subunit upon which the focussed classification had been carried out had this conformation, with the density from the other subunits appearing more like the map before focussed classification. When hexameric symmetry is applied to the subunit, though the conformation of the N-terminus causes the aperture of the pore to appear closed, steric clashes suggest a symmetric arrangement of this conformation would not be possible.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data show that there is a clear effect on the structure of Cx26 in changing K125 to a glutamate both in CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3-</sub> and in HEPES buffer. The biasing of the protein towards a conformation with a more ordered N-terminus with a narrow constriction is consistent with the closure of gap junctions that we observe in the dye transfer assays. It is also consistent with the hypothesis that the CO<sub>2</sub> mediated closure of the gap junctions is caused by the carbamylation of K125. Exactly why this happens however, is less clear. The hypothesis has been that the negative charge introduced onto the lysine side-chain would enable it to form a salt bridge with Arg104 from the neighbouring subunit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, in models from Alphafold, which differ in conformation from the structure upon which the hypothesis was based, the lysine is located next to the arginine (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>). In the K125E<sub>90-class1</sub> and LMNG<sub>90-class2</sub> structures (PCN conformation) the position of the K/E125 main chain is also near to Arg104. Though there is no clear interaction between them, with minor adjustments of the side-chains, the residues could be made to interact and the absence of a definite interaction may be due to distortions during the vitrification process or radiation damage to which acidic residues are more prone. On the other hand, TM2, on which Arg104 is located, moves away from, rather than towards the lysine in going from the LMNG<sub>90-class1</sub> structure (POFN conformation) to the constricted structures and we note there is unexplained density between the subunits. It is possible therefore that, though the negative charge is important, and the mutational data of the hemichannel would strongly indicate an interaction between the two residues, attributing the induction of the conformational change to a single salt-bridge may be an over-simplification. Nevertheless, it is clear that the conformations of TM2 and the KVRIEG motif are linked to those of TM1 and the N-terminus. The conformation of TM1 seen in the constricted structures, for instance, is not compatible with the conformation of TM2 in the open structure. Likewise, the position of the link between the N-terminus and TM1 in the open structure could not be adopted if the KVRIEG motif were to be as in the constricted structures.</p>
<p>The results are also consistent with our previous study investigating the effect of PCO<sub>2</sub> on the structure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. At low PCO<sub>2</sub>, where there should be little carbamylation, we see very little protein in the constricted conformation. The difference between the WT<sub>90</sub> samples and the K125E samples would suggest that the WT protein is not completely carbamylated during vitrification. This may also explain why the effects of the mutation of K125 to arginine, which cannot be carbamylated, are more subtle than might be expected. Our data would be consistent with a conformationally flexible protein, in which the introduction of a negative charge would stabilise one particular conformation, rather than causing a conformational change <italic>per se</italic>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the density we observe for the cytoplasmic loop in the focussed refinement of a single subunit is consistent with Alphafold models despite no other structure in the database having this conformation. Although the resolution of the density is poor in this region, the combination of our structure and the predicted models paves the way for further studies of the importance of particular interactions in the loop. Rather surprisingly given that we can isolate a symmetrical conformation of the protein using C6 symmetry, reconstructions of the full dodecamer following the focussed classifications of the single subunit do not show an influence of the conformation of that subunit on its neighbours. While this is consistent with structural studies on Cx43 gap junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> the stochastic nature of the subunit conformations contrasts with studies of Cx26 hemichannels in cell membranes where significant cooperativity has been observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. This may be due to the protein being in a non-native environment, but would also support the above hypothesis that introduction of negative charge (from carbamylation of K125 or the K125E mutation) would trap one particular conformation rather than inducing the conformational change.</p>
<p>Recently, structures of gap junction channels have been reported for the alpha connexins Cx43<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> and Cx36<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> in multiple conformations. As we have observed here, in these studies, ν to α transitions in the conformation of TM1, are coordinated with the position of the N-terminus. A consensus appears to be emerging in which the N-terminus being tucked back against the pore (pore lining) as first seen for Cx46/50<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> has been described as an open conformation and one in which the N-terminus is more lifted as initially described for the Cx31.3 hemichannel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> is the closed conformation. Due to the presence of lipids within the pores in these structures, it has also been inferred that lipids are important in the gating mechanism, sealing the pore where the N-terminus is in the raised position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In direct contrast to this consensus, the constricted state that we observe contains the N-terminus pointing into the pore with TM1 in a similar conformation to the alpha connexin structures with the N-terminus tucked back against the pore. The N-terminus in this position would not be possible with the presence of the lipid that we observe lining the pore. It is interesting to note that a lipid-like molecule in this position appears to be a constant feature of all the high resolution cryo-EM maps associated with the structures of connexins where the N-terminus is not tucked back against the pore, including both gap junction channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and hemichannels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. This is irrespective of the solubilisation method or whether the structure has been solved in the presence of detergent or nanodiscs.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, the pore lining position of the N-terminus seen in the alpha connexins would not be possible with the conformation of TM2 in the constricted structures, because Leu89, Ala92 and Ala96 on TM2 would push the N-terminal helix outwards. A comparison of all the connexin structures that have been published shows that the position of TM2 seen in the PCN conformation of Cx26 is an outlier, with an apparent anticlockwise rotation with respect to the pore (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The flexing of TM2 is near to Pro87. Mutation of Pro87, which is conserved in the connexins, causes a change in voltage gating, but not to the response to pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The conformation of the KVRIEG motif is interesting. In most structures TM3 has not been modelled before the equivalent of Gly130. It does, however, take a similar though shifted conformation in both the structures of Cx50 and in one of the hemichannel focussed classifications of Cx43 (7xqj) where the N-terminus is in the pore lining conformation. This shifted conformation, as seen for the Alphafold structures shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> would not be possible in the occluded structures here, due to the position of TM2. In the original low resolution crystal structure of Cx26<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, the KVRIEG motif is modelled as an extension of TM3. In this structure the conformation of TM1 is more similar to the LMNG<sub>90-class1</sub> (OPFN) structure. Although, the crystal structure contains the N-termini pointing into the pore the helices are pulled further back than seen for our constricted structures. Clearly, the position of the KVRIEG motif is linked to that of the N-terminus.</p>
<p>It must be asked whether the PCN structures represent the closed state as seen in the dye-transfer experiments. It is difficult to model the first three residues of the N-terminus unambiguously, presumably due to the breakdown in 6-fold symmetry at this point, but with minor changes to the side chains, the centre of the pore could be closed. Closure of the centre of the pore would leave a potential lateral passageway into the pore. This would be blocked, however, by the lipid that is common to all the connexin structures packing into the pore.</p>
<p>Mutations in Cx26 lead to both syndromic and non-syndromic deafness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. While these mutations have been mapped on the structure previously, the position of Ala88, mutation of which causes KIDS, is interesting with regard to the new conformations. The mutation of Ala88, which lies at the flexion point of TM2, to valine has been shown to prevent CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity either to the gap junctions, in closing the channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, or to the hemichannels in opening the protein <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In the constricted structures the C<sub>β</sub> of Ala88 lies within 4.2Å of Trp24, which moves during the conformational change of TM1. Replacement of the alanine with the bulkier valine would prevent this conformation being adopted. Interestingly the alanine and the tryptophan are located next to Arg143. Mutation of Arg143 to tryptophan is a very common mutation that leads to non-syndromic hearing loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Previously we showed that increasing PCO<sub>2</sub> biased the protein towards a conformation with a more ordered N-terminus. Our results, summarised in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, are consistent with this effect being mediated through K125. The movements of the transmembrane helices in response to the introduction of a negative charge provide a simple mechanism for closure through the modulation of the N-terminal helix. Though further studies are clearly required to establish the link between carbamylation and conformational change, the result is consistent with electrophysiological measurements.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Processing</title>
<p>Data were collected using a Titan Krios G3 on a Falcon 3 detector. Data processing was performed in Relion 3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Movies were motion corrected with MotionCor2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and the CTF parameters estimated with CTFfind-4.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, both implemented in Relion 3. Particles were picked from selected images using the Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) picker, and serial rounds of 2D classifications on binned particles were used to filter out junk and poor particles. An initial model was generated using stochastic gradient descent, and this was used for further cleaning of particles via 3D classifications. Exhaustive rounds of 3D refinement, CTF refinement and polishing were performed on unbinned particles until no further improvement of the resolution for the Coulomb shell was gained. The resolution was estimated based on the gold standard Fourier Shell Coefficient (FSC) criterion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> with a soft solvent mask. All masks for processing were prepared in Chimera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. All processing was carried out without imposed symmetry until the final stage, where tests with C2, C3, C6 and D6 for refinement were carried out to look for improvements in resolution.</p>

<p>Gap junction channels establish gated intercellular conduits that allow the diffusion of solutes between two cells. Hexameric connexin26 (Cx26) hemichannels are closed under basal conditions and open in response to CO2. In contrast, when forming a dodecameric gap-junction, channels are open under basal conditions and close with increased CO2 levels. Previous experiments have implicated Cx26 residue K125 in the gating mechanism by CO2, which is thought to become carbamylated by CO2. Carbamylation is a labile post-translational modification that confers negative charge to the K125 side chain. How the introduction of a negative charge at K125 causes a change in gating is unclear, but it has been proposed that carbamylated K125 forms a salt bridge with the side chain at R104, causing a conformational change in the channel. It is also unclear how overall gating is controlled by changes in CO2, since there is significant variability between structures of gap-junction channels and the cytoplasmic domain is generally poorly resolved. Structures of WT Cx26 gap-junction channels determined in the presence of various concentrations of CO2 have suggested that the cytoplasmatic N-terminus changes conformation depending on the concentration of the gas, occluding the pore when CO2 levels are high.</p>
<p>In the present manuscript, Deborah H. Brotherton and collaborators use an intercellular dye-transfer assay to show that Cx26 gap-junction channels containing the K125E mutation, which mimics carbamylation caused by CO2, is constitutively closed even at CO2 concentrations where WT channels are open. Several cryo-EM structures of WT and mutant Cx26 gap junction channels were determined at various conditions and using classification procedures that extracted more than one structural class from some of the datasets. Together, the features on each of the different structures are generally consistent with previously obtained structures at different CO2 concentrations and support the mechanism that is proposed in the manuscript. The most populated class for K125E channels determined at high CO2 shows a pore that is constricted by the N-terminus, and a cytoplasmic region that was better resolved than in WT channels, suggesting increased stability. The K125E structure closely resembles one of the two major classes obtained for WT channels at high CO2. These findings support the hypothesis that the K125E mutation biases channels towards the closed state, while WT channels are in an equilibrium between open and closed states even in the presence of high CO2. Consistently, a structure of K125E obtained in the absence of CO2 appeared to also represent a closed state but at lower resolution, suggesting that CO2 has other effects on the channel beyond carbamylation of K125 that also contribute to stabilizing the closed state. Structures determined for K125R channels, which are constitutively open because arginine cannot be carbamylated, and would be predicted to represent open states, yielded apparently inconclusive results.</p>
<p>A non-protein density was found to be trapped inside the pore in all structures obtained using both DDM and LMNG detergents, suggesting that the density represents a lipid rather than a detergent molecule. It is thought that the lipid could contribute to the process of gating, but this remains speculative. The cytoplasmic region in the tentatively closed structural class of the WT channel obtained using LMNG was better resolved. An additional portion of the cytoplasmic face could be resolved by focusing classification on a single subunit, which had a conformation that resembled the AlphaFold prediction. However, this single-subunit conformation was incompatible with a C6-symmetric arrangement. Together, the results suggest that the identified states of the channel represent open states and closed states resulting from interaction with CO2. Therefore, the observed conformational changes illuminate a possible structural mechanism for channel gating in response to CO2.</p>
<p>Some of the discussion involving comparisons with structures of other gap junction channels are relatively hard to follow as currently written, especially for a general readership. Also, no additional functional experiments are carried out to test any of the hypotheses arising from the data. However, structures were determined in multiple conditions, with results that were consistent with the main hypothesis of the manuscript. No discussion is provided, even if speculative, to explain the difference in behavior between hemichannels and gap junction channels. Also, no attempt was made to measure the dimensions of the pore, which is relevant because of the importance of identifying if the structures indeed represent open or closed states of the channel.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript by Brotherton et al. describes a structural study of connexin-26 (Cx26) gap junction channel mutant K125E, which is designed to mimic the CO2-inhibited form of the channel. In the wild-type Cx26, exposure to CO2 is presumed to close the channel through carbamylation of the residue K125. The authors mutated K125 to a negatively charged residue to mimic this effect, and they observed by cryo-EM analysis of the mutated channel that the pore of the channel is constricted. The authors were able to observe conformations of the channel with resolved density for the cytoplasmic loop (in which K125 is located). Based on the observed conformations and on the position of the N-terminal helix, which is involved in channel gating and in controlling the size of the pore, the authors propose the mechanisms of Cx26 regulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is a very interesting and timely study, and the observations provide a lot of new information on connexin channel regulation. The authors use the state of the art cryo-EM analysis and 3D classification approaches to tease out the conformations of the channel that can be interpreted as &quot;inhibited&quot;, with important implications for our understanding of how the conformations of the connexin channels controlled.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
My fundamental question to the premise of this study is: to what extent can K125 carbamylation by recapitulated by a simple K125E mutation? Lysine has a large side chain, and its carbamylation would make it even slightly larger. While the authors make a compelling case for E125-induced conformational changes focusing primarily on the negative charge, I wonder whether they considered the extent to which their observation with this mutant may translate to the carbamoylated lysine in the wild-type Cx26, considering not only the charge but also the size of the modified side-chain.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The mechanism underlying the well-documented CO2-regulated activity of connexin 26 (Cx26) remains poorly understood. This is largely due to the labile nature of CO2-mediated carbamylation, making it challenging to visualize the effects of this reversible posttranslational modification. This paper by Brotherton et al. aims to address this gap by providing structural insights through cryo-EM structures of a carbamylation-mimetic mutant of the gap junction protein.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The combination of the mutation, elevated PCO2, and the use of LMNG detergent resulted in high-resolution maps that revealed, for the first time, the structure of the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane helix (TM) 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The presented maps merely reinforce their previous findings, wherein wildtype Cx26 favored a closed conformation in the presence of high PCO2. While the structure of the TM2-TM3 loop may suggest a mechanism for stabilizing the closed conformation, no experimental data was provided to support this mechanism. Additionally, the cryo-EM maps were not effectively presented, making it difficult for readers to grasp the message.</p>
