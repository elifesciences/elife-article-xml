<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacterial cells are capable of positioning proteins at midcell and cell poles, and can form protein gradients without the support of specific membrane compartments or guidance by cytoskeleton elements, as found in eukaryotic cells. A well-known example is the formation of a MinCD protein gradient along the cell axis of rod-shaped <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells. The formation of these protein gradients is remarkable considering that the diffusion of proteins in cells is in the order of μm square per second, whereas these bacteria are only a few µm in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>).</p>
<p>The Min system of <italic>E. coli</italic> is the best studied gradient system, and comprises the membrane associated MinD and MinE proteins that form a reaction-diffusion couple resulting in a MinCD gradient that oscillates between cell poles in a matter of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This system has been reconstructed on artificial membranes resulting in dynamic wave patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), and extensively simulated to understand the reaction parameters (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>)). <italic>B. subtilis</italic> also forms a MinD gradient that decreases in concentration from cell poles and nascent cell division sites towards the middle of the cell. However, unlike <italic>E. coli</italic>, this gradient does not oscillate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). In this study, we investigated how the MinCD gradient is formed in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p>
<p>The core of the Min system consists of the protein couple MinC and MinD that prevent aberrant polymerization of the key cell division protein FtsZ close to newly formed septa or cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). MinC inhibits polymerization of FtsZ by direct protein-protein interactions and needs to bind to the Walker A-type ATPase MinD for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In case of <italic>E. coli</italic> MinD, ATP binding leads to dimerization of MinD, which induces a conformational change in the C-terminal region, thereby exposing an amphipathic helix that functions as a membrane binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The MinD dimer recruits MinC to the cell membrane and stimulates its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> Min system comprises a third protein, the peripheral membrane protein MinE, that interacts with MinD, thereby displacing MinC and stimulating the ATPase activity of MinD, which ultimately triggers the release of MinD from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The interaction with MinD causes a conformational change in MinE that stimulates its membrane affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). These reciprocal interactions of MinD and MinE represent a natural reaction-diffusion system, resulting in the oscillation of MinCD proteins between cell poles with a periodicity of approximately 50 seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Through this oscillation, the average concentration of MinC is higher close to cell poles and lower at midcell, thereby inhibiting polymerization of FtsZ close to cell poles and favoring Z-ring formation at midcell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>The MinCD proteins of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> are highly conserved. However, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> does not encode a MinE homologue and instead requires the proteins DivIVA and MinJ for the proper polar and septal localization of MinCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). DivIVA is a general scaffold protein conserved in Gram-positive bacteria that associates with strong negatively curved membrane areas at the base of division septa, resulting in polarly located DivIVA clusters after division is completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The integral membrane protein MinJ interacts with DivIVA and shows the same localization pattern. MinJ also interacts with MinD, and inactivation of MinJ eliminates a MinCD gradient, resulting in filamentous cells and minicell formation due to uncontrolled activity of MinC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Since DivIVA is recruited to midcell in the early stages of septum synthesis when a strong concave membrane area is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), the Min proteins are already present when septum synthesis is ongoing, and their primary activity it to inhibit Z-ring formation next to nascent division sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>The ATP-driven cycle between membrane association and dissociation of MinD is critical to the formation of the oscillating MinD gradient in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Mathematical modelling has shown that such an ATP-driven reversible membrane attachment cycle can also explain the formation of a MinD gradient in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, the C-terminal amphipathic alpha helix of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD has a much stronger affinity for the cell membrane compared to its <italic>E. coli</italic> counterpart, and when fused to GFP can recruit this protein to the cell membrane, which the <italic>E. coli</italic> MinD C-terminal membrane anchor is not capable of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In fact, a MinD point mutant that prevents binding of ATP and maintains the protein in its monomeric state is still recruited to the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). It is therefore unclear whether dimerization-dependent changes in the membrane affinity of the MinD are crucial for the formation of a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinCD gradient.</p>
<p>In this study, we analyzed and manipulated the membrane affinity of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD, and combined <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments with <italic>in silico</italic> Monte Carlo simulations to assess the role of membrane affinity in the formation of a MinCD gradient. These experiments demonstrate that, unlike in <italic>E. coli</italic>, a difference in membrane affinity between MinD monomer and dimer is not critical for the creation of a MinCD gradient. In addition, we examined how differences in MinD membrane affinity affect the recruitment of MinC to the membrane, a process that is critical for the FtsZ-regulating activity of the Min-system.</p>

<title>Effect of dimerization on the localization of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD</title>
<p>We began by examining how much the membrane affinity of monomeric <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD differs from the dimeric form by constructing MinD variants that are fixed in one of these conformations. Dimerization of MinD and other members of the MinD/ParA protein family requires binding of ATP. The conserved lysine in the Walker A-type ATPase domain, amino acid position 16 in the protein (Fig. S1), forms hydrogen bonds with the phosphate groups of the nucleotide, as revealed in the crystal structure of <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> MinD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Exchanging this residue into an alanine (K16A exchange) prevents ATP binding and formation of dimers in several Walker motif-containing proteins, including <italic>E. coli</italic> MinD and RecA, and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParA/Soj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The conserved glycine at position 12 makes contacts with the γ-phosphate of ATP across the dimer interface. It has been shown that changing this residue into a valine in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParA and <italic>E. coli</italic> MinD causes a steric clash in the active site, thereby preventing dimerization while retaining ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). These two monomer-forcing amino acid exchanges (K16A and G12V) were introduced into <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD, which was fused at the N-terminus with GFP to follow its localization in the cell. It has been shown that a GFP-MinD fusion retains its biological activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), and the fusion protein was expressed at levels that resulted in normal sized cells and the absence of minicells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To prevent possible localization artefacts due to the weak dimerization characteristics of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), we used a monomeric GFP (mGFP) variant. The different MinD fusion proteins were expressed from the ectopic <italic>amyE</italic> locus, under control of the xylose-inducible <italic>Pxyl</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), in a strain lacking wild type <italic>minD</italic> (Δ<italic>minD</italic>), as well as in a strain lacking <italic>minD</italic> and <italic>minC</italic> (Δ<italic>minCD</italic>). Western blot analysis showed that the different MinD-variants were stable and expressed at levels comparable to that of wild type MinD (Fig. S2). Induction of mGFP-MinD with 0.1 % xylose reduced minicell formation in a Δ<italic>minD</italic> background to wild type levels (from 14.7 % to 0.07 %, n &gt; 300). However, the mGFP-MinD-K16A and -G12V variants were unable to prevent formation of minicells (11.2 % and 9.5 %, respectively, n &gt; 600).</p>

<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> shows the effect of the K16A exchange on mGFP-MinD localization. In line with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), preventing the binding of ATP abolishes the mGFP-MinD concentration gradient, which becomes clearer in longitudinal fluorescence intensity profiles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, right panels). The fluorescence peaks visible at midcell are caused by the presence of two septal cell membranes layers, as indicated by the fluorescence intensity profiles of a wild type cell stained with the fluorescent membrane dye FM 5-95 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>The monomeric ATP binding G12V variant shows the same absence of a protein gradient as the K16A variant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast to <italic>E. coli</italic> MinD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), both monomeric <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD mutants still bind to the cell membrane. To measure the membrane association <italic>in vivo</italic>, transverse fluorescence intensity profiles were collected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, middle panels), and the membrane affinities were estimated based on the ratio between valley (cytoplasmic) and peak (membrane) signals. This confirmed that the different monomeric mutants have the same membrane affinity as wild type MinD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). As controls we used the fluorescence membrane dye FM5-95 and cells expressing cytosolic GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been shown that exchanging a conserved aspartic acid residue in the ATPase domains of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> ParA and <italic>E. coli</italic> MinD blocks ATP hydrolysis and traps the proteins in a dimeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). When this aspartic acid residue, located at amino acid position 40 in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD sequence (Fig. S1), was replaced by an alanine in the mGFP-MinD fusion, expression of this variant in a Δ<italic>minD</italic> strain resulted in highly filamentous cells with clusters of mGFP-MinD-D40A formed along the membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, left picture). Introduction of a <italic>minC</italic> deletion restored cell division (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, right picture), indicating that the locked MinD dimer causes hyper activation of MinC. Interestingly, in this Δ<italic>minCD</italic> background the clusters disappeared and mGFP-MinD-D40A showed a clear polar and septal accumulation, although the polar and septal signal intensities were approximately 60-70 % compared to that of wild type cells (Fig. S3B), and the longitudinal protein gradient was clearly reduced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Quantification of the membrane affinity showed that the membrane affinity of the D40A variant is only slightly higher compared to the monomeric mutants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Localization of trapped MinD dimer depends on MinJ</title>
<p>The polar and septal localization of the D40A trapped dimer-variant of MinD presumably relies on the interaction with MinJ. It has been reported that the absence of MinJ results in detachment of MinD from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, when we introduced the Δ<italic>minJ</italic> in our Δ<italic>minCD</italic> deletion strain background we found that all MinD-GFP variants remained attached to the membrane (Fig. S4), and the septal and polar localization of wild type and the trapped dimer MinD disappeared. These results show that while MinJ is not required for membrane attachment of MinD <italic>per se,</italic> it is required for polar and septal localization of MinD through interactions specifically with the dimeric form of MinD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Recruitment of MinC by the different MinD mutants</title>
<p>Several biochemical studies with different bacterial species, including <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, have shown that MinC and MinD dimers can assemble into long polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). However, the assembly of large MinCD multimers has not been observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and a genetic study indicated that the formation of such polymers are not necessary for the function of the Min system in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The D40A MinD variant showed a clustered membrane localization pattern that resolved into a smooth membrane pattern when <italic>minC</italic> was deleted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This change in localization pattern might be related to the formation of higher-order MinCD assemblies. To confirm this, we introduced an active mCherry-MinC fusion to see whether mGFP-MinD and mCherry-MinC would colocalize when the former is fixed in a dimeric state. First, we examined the localization of MinC in the presence of monomeric K16A and G12V MinD variants. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and C</xref>, the mCherry-MinC signal was dispersed throughout the cytosol in these strains, indicting a lack of interaction with monomeric MinD variants, in line with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). In case of the mGFP-MinD-D40A variant, the mCherry-MinC expression was only induced for 1 h to prevent excessive filamentation. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, the mCherry-MinC signal showed foci along the membrane that often colocalized with mGFP-MinD-D40A foci, confirming that MinD dimerization is crucial for MinC interaction, and that both proteins can indeed form large assemblies in the cell, presumably in the form of MinCD copolymers.</p>

<p>The colocalization of the MinD-D40A and MinC fluorescent fusion proteins enabled us to investigate whether MinD dimerization is sufficient for MinC activity or whether localization at the cell membrane is also required. To test this, the membrane binding capacity of MinD was impaired by replacing isoleucine 260, located in the C-terminal membrane targeting amphipathic alpha helix, with a glutamate residue (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Next, we introduced this mutation in the mGFP-MinD-D40A mutant to create a trapped MinD dimer that was no longer able to bind to the membrane. Expression of this cytosolic MinD variant did not result in cell filamentation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), indicating that interaction with MinD dimers alone is not sufficient to inhibit FtsZ polymerization. Rather, MinC needs to be localized and enriched to the membrane surface to be effective, which is not surprising since Z-ring formation occurs at the membrane periphery.</p>

<title>Weak membrane interaction is important for MinD gradient formation</title>
<p>The absence of a clear difference in membrane affinity between monomeric and dimeric MinD raised the question whether a reversable membrane binding is important for the formation a protein gradient. To examine this, we tried to increase the membrane affinity of MinD by adding an extra copy of its C-terminal membrane targeting amphipathic helix. The extra amphipathic helix was connected to the original helix by a short 11 amino acid long flexible linker (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). First, we tested whether such tandem amphipathic helix (2xAH) increases the membrane affinity by fusing it to mGFP. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, fusion of this tandem helix to mGFP increased the membrane association of the latter considerably when compared to a single MinD amphipathic helix.</p>

<p>To confirm that the tandem amphipathic helix increased the membrane affinity of MinD, we tested its sensitivity to membrane depolarization. Previously, it has been shown that binding of the MinD amphipathic helix to the cell membrane requires the presence of the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Dissipation of the proton motive force by the specific proton-ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) did not affect the membrane localization of the tandem amphipathic helix fusion, whereas CCCP quickly disturbed the membrane attachment of wild type MinD (Fig. S6).</p>
<p>We also tested what happens with the MinD gradient when its membrane affinity is reduced. For this, the well-studied membrane binding amphipathic helix 2 from the Hepatitis C virus protein NS4B was chosen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), which is hardly able to attach mGFP to the cell membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Replacing the wild type membrane targeting helix of MinD by the weak NS4B amphipathic helix reduced the membrane association of mGFP-MinD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), as well as its septal and polar localization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and Fig. S5). Interestingly, this mutant still displayed a longitudinal protein gradient. Together these data suggests that a reversible membrane association is important for the formation of a MinD gradient along the cell axis.</p>

<title>Effect of MinD membrane affinity on MinC recruitment and activity</title>
<p>The results shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> indicated that the attachment of the MinD dimer to the membrane is essential for the activity of MinC.

<p>Weakening the membrane affinity of mGFP-MinD, by replacing the wild type amphipathic helix with the NS4B amphipathic helix, also resulted in occasional minicell formation, but again not as numerous as in a <italic>minD</italic> deletion strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>Thus, a reversible association of MinD with the cell membrane seems to be critical to prevent misplacing the FtsZ inhibiting activity of MinC along the cell axis. Both the mGFP-MinD(2xAH) and mGFP-MinD(NS4B-AH) variants were, at least partially, able to prevent minicell formation, presumably because they are still recruited to cell poles and cell division sites through interaction with MinJ.</p>

<title>Membrane gradient formation in kinetic Monte Carlo simulations</title>
<p>The different experiments indicated that the formation of a MinCD gradient requires the dynamic switching between monomer and dimer states of MinD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), and a reversible MinD membrane interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). So far, <italic>in silico</italic> simulations of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Min gradient have assumed a strong difference in membrane interaction between the monomeric and dimeric state of MinD, which is based on properties of the <italic>E. coli</italic> Min system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, our data suggests that for <italic>B. subtilis</italic> these affinities do not differ much (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To investigate more closely whether a difference in membrane affinity between monomer and dimer is required for the formation of a MinD gradient in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, we resorted to kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations. The Monte-Carlo algorithm attempts to move one molecule at a time by a small amount in a three-dimensional space. The new interaction energy experienced by the particle is then calculated and compared with its old energy, and the move is subsequently accepted or rejected according to the standard Metropolis test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). This procedure is used to guide the system to the correct Boltzmann distribution in equilibrium. It has been shown that this Monte-Carlo dynamics corresponds well with Brownian or molecular dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), and can be used to examine mechanisms underlying spatiotemporal protein gradients in cells, provided that the moves are small enough and that the acceptance probability remains high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>MinD monomers were presented as spheres (hydrodynamic radius 2.5 nm) that diffuse within and along a spherocylindrical cell geometry. The following rules were implemented: (i) Diffusion along the membrane is 10-fold slower that through the cytoplasm, and (ii) the dimer, due to its larger diameter, diffuses 2-fold slower compared to the monomer in both environments, emanating from Stokes-Einstein law and a hydrodynamic radius for the dimer which is double that of the monomer. (iii) Based on the data from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, we started out with a 10 % stronger membrane affinity for the dimer. (iv) The membrane dwell time of monomers and dimers is 0.01 - 0.5 sec and during the simulations approximately 70 % of MinD molecules reside at the membrane, approaching the valley to peak values observed experimentally (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). (v) Dimerization and monomerization are modelled as chemical reactions between a monomer and a dimer state. Baseline rates are set such that the two states are in a 1:1 ratio, based on the longitudinal fluorescence intensity profile in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, and the assumption that dimers are located at the polar regions and monomers along the lateral wall. In our baseline model, dimerization at the pole, membrane and in the cytoplasm is equally likely, and is modelled in a simple way as a reaction turning a monomeric to a dimeric MinD at constant rate. (vi) The transition from dimer to monomer, stimulated by ATP hydrolysis, occurs stochastically with a half-life of approximately 1/sec, which is based on information from <italic>E. coli</italic> MinD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). (vii) MinD dimers that come in close proximity of MinJ, represented as the surface area at the polar caps, will remain attached to MinJ for some time, so that approximately 25 % of MinD dimers is associated with MinJ, reminiscent of the septal localization of the D40A variant (Fig. S3). Simulation details are described in the material and methods.</p>
<p>When we applied these rules and ran the simulation, a strong accumulation of MinD at the poles was observed, but no gradient (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). In this simulation, the chance that MinD can form a dimer is the same for monomers in the cytoplasm and those that are attached to the membrane. However, it is likely that dimer formation in the latter situation is more likely since monomers attached to the membrane by their C-terminal amphipathic helix will diffuse slower and therefore spend more time in close proximity and, importantly, they have the same spatial orientation, which will facilitate dimerization. However, when we repeated the simulation, and implemented that membrane attached monomers have a 2-fold higher chance of forming dimers than monomers in the cytoplasm, the localization pattern did not change (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>).</p>

<p>Since MinJ interacts with MinD dimers, there is the possibility that MinJ actually stimulates MinD dimerization. Interestingly, when this property was added to the simulation, a clear MinD gradient emerged along the cell length, together with a strong polar localization signal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>), a pattern that is in good agreement with the longitudinal fluorescence intensity profiles observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This pattern did not change when we included the condition that only membrane attached dimers are able to revert to monomers (not shown), as suggested by the stimulated ATPase activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> MinD in the presence of liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). When we performed the simulation of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> but now with the assumption that MinJ only stimulates dimerization and does not bind MinD dimers, a MinD gradient is still formed, although the strong accumulation at the polar caps was abolished (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Subsequently, we repeated the simulation of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> under conditions whereby there was no difference in the diffusion rate of monomer and dimer (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). In this case the MinD gradient was completely lost, showing that the differential diffusion of monomers and dimers is necessary to create a steady-state gradient.</p>
<p>Next, we tested the role of the membrane affinity in gradient formation. First, the simulation of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> was repeated without a difference between the membrane affinity of the MinD monomer and dimer (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). Interestingly, under these conditions the MinD protein gradient is still being formed. When we repeated the simulation of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> and kept the 10 % difference in membrane affinity between MinD monomer and dimer, but made their membrane affinities stronger, the gradient was reduced (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>), in good agreement with our <italic>in vivo</italic> observation with a MinD variant containing a tandem membrane anchor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Lastly, we tested what happens when the simulation of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref> was repeated with a weaker membrane affinity of MinD. As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H, a</xref> clear gradient is formed, again in line with what was found when the membrane targeting amphipathic helix of MinD was replaced with the weaker amphipathic helix 2 from Hepatitis C virus protein NS4B (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations suggests that the formation of a MinD gradient requires: (i) a reversible and not too strong interaction of MinD with the membrane, (ii) a clear difference between the diffusion rates of monomer and dimer, (iii) an ATPase driven dimer-monomer cycle, and (iv) the stimulation of dimerization at the cell poles and division sites. Importantly, a difference in membrane affinity between monomer and dimer is not required.</p>

<title>Protein gradients in bacteria</title>
<p>Due to their small size, proteins diffuse rapidly throughout bacterial cells, in a matter of seconds, yet stable protein gradients can be found in a large variety of bacteria. What these systems have in common, including the MinD gradient, is a considerably reduced diffusion rate of the proteins involved, which allows stable protein concentration gradients to form. The viscosity of the cell membrane is roughly 100 times larger compared to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), and the Min system uses attachment to the cell membrane to slow down diffusion. Another approach to reduce diffusion is to bind to DNA, which occurs in the ParABS system involved in chromosome segregation in the asymmetric bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). This system consists of the ParA ATPase, which belongs to the same ATPase family as MinD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) and ParB that binds to <italic>parS</italic> DNA binding sites. The ParA dimers associate with DNA nonspecifically whereby ParB stimulates ATP hydrolysis of ParA dimers, resulting in the dissociation from DNA. The localized dissociation and subsequent increased diffusion rate results in a ParA concentration gradient away from the <italic>parS</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). The cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> uses the ParA-like protein McdA to position carboxysomes along the longitudinal axis. In this system, the protein McdB, which interacts with carboxysomes, stimulates McdA ATPase activity and its release from DNA, resulting in an oscillation of McdA over the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Recently it was described that <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> trigger factor (TF) forms a gradient by interacting with the cell division protein FtsK, resulting in an increased TF concentration towards the septal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). How TF reduces its diffusion in <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells is still unclear but might be a consequence of the fact that the chaperone directly interacts with ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>), which diffuse much slower due to their size and association with mRNA and nascent polypeptide chains.</p>

<title>Previous MinD gradient modelling studies</title>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, there are many mathematical models describing the oscillating MinD gradient of <italic>E. coli</italic> but so far only two mathematical models focused on the MinD gradient of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Both models make use of the reversible interaction of MinD with the cell membrane. The first study, almost 20 years ago, modelled the localization of DivIVA and MinD by a reaction-diffusion system in one spatial dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). At that time neither MinJ nor the localization mechanism of DivIVA were known. In this early study both MinD and DivIVA were assumed to cycle between the membrane and the cytosol, and the membrane attachment of DivIVA would depend on MinD, whereas the membrane attachment of the latter would be stabilized at the cell poles by DivIVA. However, we now know that DivIVA binds to the membrane by itself, and there is no interaction between MinD and DivIVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>).</p>
<p>The ATPase stimulated monomer-dimer cycle of MinD was not included in this early model, but it was used in a recent study that employed a minimal reaction-diffusion system in three-dimensional cellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In this model <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD cycles between the cell membrane and cytosol, whereby the membrane detached MinD is in the ADP-bound state and can only rebind after exchanging ADP for ATP, like in <italic>E. coli</italic>. By assuming that the membrane recruitment rate is higher at the poles and septa due to the presence of MinJ or due to a kinetic increase of diffusional impacts with the membrane due to the curved geometry at poles, a steep MinD gradient could be simulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>New data on MinD localization</title>
<p>Here, we have shown that monomeric MinD, both in its ATP-bound and unbound state, has a membrane affinity that is comparable to that of the dimeric form of MinD. This shows a clear difference with the <italic>E. coli</italic> situation, where dimerization of MinD causes a conformational change of the C-terminal region enabling the amphipathic helix to insert into the lipid bilayer (Hu &amp; Lutkenhaus 2003). Apparently, the C-terminal amphipathic helix of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD is continuously exposed and capable to bind the membrane, thus increasing affinity only by an additive effect upon dimerization.</p>
<p>We have also shown that MinJ is not required for the membrane recruitment of MinD. We have no explanation for the differences between our findings and that of the previous studies in which it has been shown that MinJ is needed for the membrane localization of MinD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, since the membrane-targeting amphipathic alpha helix of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD is by itself sufficient to recruit GFP to the cell membrane, even in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which does not contain a MinJ homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), it is difficult to envision how the absence of MinJ would bring MinD to the cytosol.</p>
<p>In another study, it has been suggested that the C-terminal amphipathic helix of MinD by itself is sufficient to recruit GFP to cell division sites, even in the absence of either MinJ or DivIVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). However, as indicated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the presence of two perpendicular-observed membranes that are formed during septum synthesis gives a higher fluorescence membrane signal, which might have been mistakenly interpreted as septal localization. In addition, in our hands a GFP fusion with the C-terminal amphipathic helix of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD shows a clear fluorescence membrane stain but no accumulation at division sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<title>Kinetic Monte Carlo model</title>
<p>Our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings warranted a new mathematical model to study the formation of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD gradient. The kinetic Monte Carlo model showed that a membrane attachment-detachment cycle is not required to form a protein gradient, but that a dynamic ATP-driven cycle between monomer and dimer is crucial, coupled to the differences in diffusion rates. We have shown that the MinD dimer associates with MinJ, but this by itself, even when the interaction was reversible, was not enough to create a gradient. We ascribe this to the fact that both monomers and dimers bind to the membrane with small difference in affinities in our model, whereas in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) the monomer state is not membrane-associated. To establish a gradient in our simulations, we needed to include the requirement that MinJ stimulates and/or stabilizes MinD dimerization, but this MinJ activity remains speculative. It should be stressed that MinJ is not crucial for MinD dimerization, since a <italic>minJ</italic> mutant shows a strong filamentous phenotype that can be suppressed by a <italic>minC</italic> deletion, indicating that MinD dimerization, required for MinC activity, also occurs in the absence of MinJ.</p>
<p>Although a difference in membrane affinity between monomer and dimer is not necessary to establish a gradient, the modelling shows that a transient and reversible membrane binding of MinD is necessary. This was also confirmed by the reduced formation of a gradient when the membrane affinity of MinD was increased by using a tandem C-terminal amphipathic helix (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). This can be explained by considering the emergent length scale over which the gradient develops. As in reaction-diffusion models for morphogenesis, this length scale is given by the square root of a diffusion coefficient over a reaction rate. Our simulations suggest that a possible formula is given by, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="598461v1_inline1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> <italic>D<sub>d</sub></italic> and <italic>D<sub>m</sub></italic> the dimer and monomer diffusion (the relevant rate is that on the membrane), and <italic>k<sub>m</sub></italic> the rate of conversion between dimers and monomers. Increasing the interaction with the membrane leads to a decrease in diffusivity, and concomitantly a reduction in the length scale over which the gradient can be observed.</p>
<p>In our modelling, MinJ is simply represented by the polar cap area. FRAP studies have shown that the recruitment of MinJ to cell poles and division sites is quite dynamic with a fluorescence recovery rate close to a minute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). However, the fluorescence recovery rate of MinD is approximate 8-fold higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Because of this large difference in diffusion rates, we have ignored the diffusion of MinJ in our modelling. We do not foresee different results if we were to include MinJ diffusion in our Monte Carlo simulations, provided that in steady state MinJ is on average localized at the poles.</p>
<p>Another aspect that we have not included in the simulations is MinD polymerization. It has been shown that purified <italic>E. coli</italic> MinD can form large polymers in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), although this was not found for purified <italic>B. subtilis</italic> MinD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). FRAP experiments with <italic>B. subtilis</italic> shows a fluorescence recover rate of seconds for MinD at division sites, suggesting that if such polymers exist, they are not very stable. Nevertheless, any multimerization of MinD dimer will further increase the diffusion difference between monomer and dimer, thus contributing to the formation of a protein gradient.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown here that a dynamic cyclic change in membrane affinity of MinD is not required for the formation of a concentration gradient in the cell. Instead, our modelling suggests that stimulation of MinD-dimerization at cell poles and cell division sites is needed. It will be interesting to see whether future experiments proves this prediction right or wrong.</p>

<p>Luria-Bertani (LB) agar was used for the routine selection and maintenance of both <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. For <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, cells were grown in LB medium or Spizizen minimal salt medium supplemented with 0.05 % yeast extract (SMMY).

<title>Strain constructions</title>
<p>Molecular cloning, PCR and transformations were carried out by standard techniques. Plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Table S2 and S3, respectively. The <italic>minC</italic>, <italic>minD</italic>, <italic>minCD</italic> and <italic>minJ</italic> gene deletions were introduced from existing strains listed in Table S1 by standard natural transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). The <italic>aprE</italic>-integration vector containing mCherry under an IPTG-inducible promoter (P<italic>spac</italic>) was constructed as follows. The spectinomycin marker of pAPNC213 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>) was replaced with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (<italic>cat</italic>) using In-Fusion cloning (Clonetech). For this aim pAPNC123 was PCR-linearized with oligonucleotide pair HS05/HS06 and the <italic>cat</italic> cassette was amplified from pSG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>) with oligonucleotide pair HS07/HS08. These PCR products were fused together with In-</p>
<p>Fusion cloning, resulting in pAPNC<italic>cat,</italic> this plasmid was verified by sequencing. Next, the mCherry encoding gene was amplified using oligonucleotide pair HS437/HS438 and plasmid template pSS153 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) as template. SalI and BamHI restriction sites were inserted into the primers. The mCherry PCR product and the pAPNC<italic>cat</italic> were digested with SalI and BamHI and ligated. The resulting plasmid was verified by sequencing and named pHJS112.</p>
<p>The IPTG-inducible mCherry-<italic>minC</italic> fusion was constructed as follows. A PCR fragment containing <italic>minC</italic> was amplified with oligonucleotide pair LB1/LB2 and genomic DNA of the wild type strain 168 as template. BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were inserted into the primers. The PCR product and the <italic>aprE</italic>-integration vector pHJS112 were digested with BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzymes and ligated. The resulting plasmid pLB11 was verified by sequencing and transformed into <italic>B. subtilis</italic> competent cells, resulting in strain LB31. The <italic>aprE</italic> integration was verified by PCR, amplifying the genomic DNA with oligonucleotide pair HS508/HS509 and sequencing.</p>
<p>The <italic>amyE</italic>-integration vector pSG1730 containing GFP fused to <italic>minD</italic> under a xylose-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>) was used to exchange the <italic>minD</italic> residue glycine 12 to valine (G12V) and aspartic acid 40 to alanine (D40A), by incorporation of the corresponding mutation using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis reaction (Stratagene) and the oligonucleotide pairs HS320/HS321 and HS322/HS323, respectively. The resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing and named pHJS115 and pHJS116, respectively. The plasmid pHJS113 containing GFP fused to <italic>B. subtilis minD</italic> coding sequence with the lysine 16 to alanine (K16A) exchange under a xylose-inducible promoter was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>).</p>
<p>Plasmid pSG1729 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), containing GFP under a xylose-inducible promoter, was used to generate a construct with GFP fused to the native <italic>minD</italic> membrane targeting amphipathic helix (KGMMAKIKSFFG). This domain was amplified from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> wild type strain 168 with oligonucleotide pair FB136/FB149. EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites were inserted into the primers. The PCR product and the plasmid pSG1729 were digested with EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes and ligated. The new plasmid was verified by sequencing and named pHJS117. Plasmid pHJS117 was used to generate a construct with GFP fused to two <italic>minD</italic> amphipathic helices in tandem with a short linker of glycines in between (2xAH). This tandem membrane targeting sequence was created by amplification with oligonucleotides FB138/FB149 and pHJS117 as template. The primer FB138 carries a long overhang that generates an extra MinD membrane targeting amphipathic helix fused to the existing membrane targeting domain (KGMMAKIKSFFGVRS<bold>GG</bold>VLEEQNKGMMAKIKSFFG). EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites were inserted into the primers. The PCR product and the plasmid pSG1729 were digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction enzymes and ligated. The new plasmid was verified by sequencing and named pHJS119.</p>
<p>Another construct with GFP fused to the NS4B amphipathic helix 2 from Hepatitis C virus (NS4B-AH) was generated as follows. Plasmid pSG1729 was amplified with oligonucleotides FB141/FB149. The primer FB141 carries a long overhang that generates the NS4B-AH anchor (TVTQLLRRLHQWI). EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites were inserted into the primers. The PCR product and the plasmid pSG1729 were digested with EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzymes and ligated. The new plasmid was verified by sequencing and named pHJS121.</p>
<p>We constructed two different <italic>amyE</italic>-integration plasmids with GFP fused to <italic>minD</italic> with different membrane targeting sequences. The native <italic>minD</italic> amphipathic helix was either replaced with two <italic>minD</italic> amphipathic helices in tandem with a short linker of glycines in between (MinD2xAH) or with the Hepatitis C virus NS4B amphipathic helix 2 (MinDNS4B-AH). The <italic>minD</italic> gene was amplified from the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome (strain 168) with oligonucleotides pairs FB135/FB138 and FB135/FB141, respectively. BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites were inserted into the primers. The primers FB138 and FB141 carry a long overhang that generates the 2xAH and the NS4B-AH, respectively. The digested PCR fragments were ligated with BamHI/EcoRI-linearized pSG1729, containing GFP under a xylose-inducible promoter. The new plasmids were verified by sequencing and named pHJS123 and pHJS125, respectively.</p>
<p>Plasmids pSG1730, pHJS113, pHJS115, pHJS116, pHJS123 and pHJS125 were used as template for the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis reaction (Stratagene) with oligonucleotide pair HS410/HS411 to introduce the A206K exchange in the GFP coding sequence to reduce protein dimerization (mGFP). The resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing and named pLB21, pLB22, pLB23, pLB24, pLB49 and pLB50 respectively. Plasmids pLB21 and pLB24 were used to further exchange the <italic>minD</italic> isoleucine 260 to glutamic acid (I260E) by QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis reaction (Stratagene) with oligonucleotide pair HS205/HS206.

<title>Western blot analysis</title>
<p>To detect the cellular levels of the different GFP-MinD variants the strains were induced with 0.1 % xylose for three doublings. 2 ml of cultures, with comparable ODs were centrifuged and the cell pellets flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The pellets were then resuspended in 200 µl of buffer containing 10 mM Tris-Hcl pH 8, 100 mM NaCl and 1 % TritonX-100. The cells were lysed with 100 µg/ml lysozyme during 15 min incubation at room temperature. Cell debris were spun down (20 min Eppendorf centrifuge, 14000 rpm, 4°C) and 10 μl of samples were loaded onto a 10 % SDS-PAGE followed by separation by electrophoresis at 150 V for 60 min. The proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Thermo Scientific) with transfer buffer (14.4 g/l glycine, 3 g/l Tris base and 15 % methanol) using mini-wet electroblotting system (Bio-Rad) at 55 V for 130 min. The transferred membrane was then blocked in blocking buffer (1 % skimmed milk powder in TBST buffer 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05 % Tween-20) overnight and rinsed twice for 5 min in TBST. The proteins were probed with a 1:2000 dilution of rabbit anti-GFP primary antibody (Invitrogen) in 10 ml TBST incubated 1 h, the membrane was washed 3x in TBST and incubated in a 1:20 000 dilution of secondary antibody goat anti rabbit IR dye (Li-cor Biosciences) in 10 ml TBST during 1 h. The immunoblot was developed by using an Odyssey® imaging system (Li-cor Biosciences).</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>Microscopy was performed on an inverted fluorescence Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with a CFI Plan Apochromat DM 100x oil objective, an Intensilight HG 130bW lamp and C11440-22CU Hamamatsu ORCA camera. Images were analysed using ImageJ v.1.48d5 (National Institutes of Health) software and the plugin ObjectJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). To measure the transverse fluorescence intensity profiles (FIP), line-scans perpendicular to the cell axis were marked. The polar gradient areas, marked in red in figures, were manually assigned by means of visual inspection of the fluorescence gradient of the FIPs. The membrane affinity was estimated as the ratio valley/peaks of the transverse FIP, using an average of at least 30 cells per data set.</p>
<p>For microscopy, cells were grown to exponential phase by diluting 1:100 a starter culture grown overnight in liquid medium (SMMY) into fresh medium, and allowing at least three doublings before mounting on microscopy slides covered with a thin film of 1 % agarose. 0.1 % xylose and 0.01 mM IPTG were used for the induction since these concentrations complemented a Δ<italic>minCD</italic> deletion strain, preventing minicell formation. Membranes were stained with the fluorescent membrane dye FM-95 (0.5 µg/ml final concentration), incubated for 5 min prior to mounting onto microscope slides covered with a thin film of 1 % agarose. Dissipation of the proton motive force (pmf) was carried out by the addition of 100 μM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) for 10 min. CCCP was dissolved in DMSO (0.1 % final concentration of DMSO). As control, cells were incubated with 0.1 % DMSO.</p>

<title>Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations</title>
<p>To model the formation of a steady state gradient in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> wild-type cells and mutants, kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation were performed. Kinetic Monte Carlo is a stochastic algorithm which is known to be equivalent to molecular dynamics for sufficiently small local moves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). The system simulated consisted in a collection of 1000 MinD proteins enclosed inside a spherocylinder (aspect ratio 4, sizes 80 by 20 in simulation units) modelling a <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cell. MinD proteins can be in one of two states, either monomeric (M) or dimeric (D). The M and D states have both affinities for the membrane (the surface of the spherocylinder). To model this, we introduce an attractive potential, a square well with range 1 and strength e<sub>M</sub> and e<sub>D</sub> for the M and D state respectively. Given our experimental results that the dimer is only weakly stickier than the monomer, we ran our simulations with e<sub>D</sub> = 1.1e<sub>M</sub>=1 k<sub>B</sub>T. Additionally, the D state, but not the M state, may interact with the caps (poles) in the spherocylinders, with an extra interaction again represented by a square well, with range 1 and strength e<sub>C</sub>. This interaction simulates binding between dimeric MinD and MinJ. Various cases were considered but results are reported, for simplicity for two cases only: e<sub>C</sub>=0 (no additional polar interaction), or e<sub>C</sub> = 0.7 e<sub>M</sub>. A third parameter which varies between M and D is the diffusion coefficient: for simplicity, unless otherwise stated, we assume this to scale inversely with molecular weight, so that the diffusivity of the dimer, D, is half that of the monomer, M. Key to the formation of the gradient is the fact that the reaction between the M and D states of MinD is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, as it is linked to ATP hydrolysis. In our model, D turns into M, due to ATP hydrolysis, at a constant rate k<sub>ATP</sub>, in all cases. We consider instead three cases for the dimerization reaction. In our baseline model the conversion of M into D also occurred at the same rate in the cytoplasm, at the membrane and at the pole. We have set this rate such that the M and D state are on average comparable in steady state, as suggested by our experiments. We also considered the case where dimerization at the membrane occurs 2-fold more often at the membrane, and a third case where polar localization (through MinJ interaction) strongly stimulates dimerization, so that the M to D transition occurs at a rate k<sub>pole</sub> &gt;&gt; k<sub>ATP</sub> at poles. When considering polar stimulation, dimerization occurs at a rate k<sub>ATP</sub>/10 in the cytosol; otherwise, rates of dimerization and monomerization in the cytoplasm are equal. The diffusion of monomeric MinD in the cytosol was set to 0.0017 in simulation units (corresponding to approximately 1 micron square per second, see below), where the hydrolysis rate k<sub>ATP</sub> was set to 10<sup>-5</sup> (corresponding to 1/s). When considering polar stimulation, we set k such that dimerization at the pole occurs with unit probability during a timestep (we have verified though that the results are qualitatively similar down to at least a value of k<sub>pole</sub> equal to 100 k<sub>ATP</sub>). More details on the parameters used in the model are given in the caption of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>.</p>
<p>To simulate the monomer (K16A) and dimer (D40A) mutants, we used another version of the same model, in which all particles were of type M or D respectively, and the rate of interconversion between the two was set to 0.</p>
<p>Simulation units may be mapped to physical units by noting that 1 space and time units in simulations can be made to correspond to 0.08 microns and 10 microseconds, respectively.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides <bold>solid</bold> mechanistic and modeling data suggesting that the polar localization of MinCD in Bacillus subtilis is largely due to differences in diffusion rates between monomeric and dimeric MinD. This finding is exciting as it negates the necessity for a third, localization determinant, in this system as has been previously proposed. The work is generally strong but is <bold>incomplete</bold> without some additional quantitative analysis, as well as clarification of the underlying assumptions and details used for the modeling experiments.</p>

<p>The authors used fluorescence microscopy, image analysis, and mathematical modeling to study the effects of membrane affinity and diffusion rates of MinD monomer and dimer states on MinD gradient formation in B. subtilis. To test these effects, the authors experimentally examined MinD mutants that lock the protein in specific states, including Apo monomer (K16A), ATP-bound monomer (G12V), and ATP-bound dimer (D40A, hydrolysis defective), and compared to wild-type MinD. Overall, the experimental results support the conclusion that reversible membrane binding of MinD is critical for the formation of the MinD gradient, but that the binding affinities between monomers and dimers are similar.</p>
<p>The modeling part is a new attempt to use the Monte Carlo method to test the conditions for the formation of the MinD gradient in B. subtilis. The modeling results provide good support for the observations and find that the MinD gradient is sensitive to different diffusion rates between monomers and dimers. This simulation is based on several assumptions and predictions, which raises new questions that need to be addressed experimentally in the future. However, the current story is sufficient without testing these assumptions or predictions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bohorquez et al. investigate the molecular determinants of intracellular gradient formation in the B. subtilis Min system. To this end, they generate B. subtilis strains that express MinD mutants that are locked in the monomeric or dimeric states, and also MinD mutants with amphipathic helices of varying membrane affinity. They then assess the mutants' ability to bind to the membrane and form gradients using fluorescence microscopy in different genetic backgrounds. They find that, unlike in the E. coli Min system, the monomeric form of MinD is already capable of membrane binding. They also show that MinJ is not required for MinD membrane binding and only interacts with the dimeric form of MinD. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, the authors then test different models for gradient formation, and find that a MinD gradient along the cell axis is only formed when the polarly localized protein MinJ stimulates dimerization of MinD, and when the diffusion rate of monomeric and dimeric MinD differs. They also show that differences in the membrane affinity of MinD monomers and dimers are not required for gradient formation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper offers a comprehensive collection of the subcellular localization and gradient formation of various MinD mutants in different genetic backgrounds. In particular, the comparison of the localization of these mutants in a delta MinC and MinJ background offers valuable additional insights. For example, they find that only dimeric MinD can interact with MinJ. They also provide evidence that MinD locked in a dimer state may co-polymerize with MinC, resulting in a speckled appearance.</p>
<p>The authors introduce and verify a useful measure of membrane affinity in vivo.</p>
<p>The modulation of the membrane affinity by using distinct amphipathic helices highlights the robustness of the B. subtilis MinD system, which can form gradients even when the membrane affinity of MinD is increased or decreased.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main claim of the paper, that differences in the membrane affinity between MinD monomers and dimers are not required for gradient formation, does not seem to be supported by the data. The only measure of membrane affinity presented is extracted from the transverse fluorescence intensity profile of cells expressing the mGFP-tagged MinD mutants. The authors measure the valley-to-peak ratio of the profile, which is lower than 1 for proteins binding to the membrane and higher than 1 for cytosolic proteins. To verify this measure of membrane affinity, they use a membrane dye and a soluble GFP, which results in values of ~0.75 and ~1.25, respectively. They then show that all MinD mutants have a value - roughly in the range of 0.8-0.9 - and they use this to claim that there are no differences in membrane affinity between monomeric and dimeric versions.</p>
<p>While this way to measure membrane affinity is useful to distinguish between binders and non-binders, it is unclear how sensitive this assay is, and whether it can resolve more subtle differences in membrane affinity, beyond the classification into binders and non-binders. A dimer with two amphipathic helices should have a higher membrane affinity than a monomer with only one such copy. Thus, the data does not seem to support the claim that &quot;the different monomeric mutants have the same membrane affinity as the wildtype MinD&quot;. The data only supports the claim that B. subtilis MinD monomers already have a measurable membrane affinity, which is indeed a difference from the E. coli Min system.</p>
<p>While their data does show that a stark difference between monomer and dimer membrane affinity may not be required for gradient formation in the B. subtilis case, it is also not prevented if the monomer is unable to bind to the membrane. They show this by replacing the native MinD amphipathic helix with the weak amphipathic helix NS4AB-AH. According to their membrane affinity assay, NS4AB-AH does not bind to the membrane as a monomer (Figure 4D), but when this helix is fused to MinD, MinD is still capable of forming a gradient (albeit a weaker one). Since the authors make a direct comparison to the E. coli MinDE systems, they could have used the E. coli MinD MTS instead or in addition to the NS4AB-AH amphipathic helix. The reviewer suspects that a fusion of the E. coli MinD MTS to B. subtilis MinD may also support gradient formation.</p>
<p>The paper contains insufficient data to support the many claims about cell filamentation and minicell formation. In many cases, statements like &quot;did not result in cell filamentation&quot; or &quot;restored cell division&quot; are only supported by a single fluorescence image instead of a quantitative analysis of cell length distribution and minicell frequency, as the one reported for a subset of the data in Figure 5.</p>
<p>The paper would also benefit from a quantitative measure of gradient formation of the distinct MinD mutants, instead of relying on individual fluorescent intensity profiles.</p>
<p>The authors compare their experimental results with the oscillating E. coli MinDE system and use it to define some of the rules of their Monte Carlo simulation. However, the description of the E. coli Min system is sometimes misleading or based on outdated findings.</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo simulation of the gradient formation in B. subtilis could benefit from a more comprehensive approach:</p>
<p>(1) While most of the initial rules underlying the simulation are well justified, the authors do not implement or test two key conditions:</p>
<p>
(a) Cooperative membrane binding, which is a key component of mathematical models for the oscillating E. coli Min system. This cooperative membrane binding has recently been attributed to MinD or MinCD oligomerization on the membrane and has been experimentally observed in various instances; in fact, the authors themselves show data supporting the formation of MinCD copolymers.</p>
<p>(2) Local stimulation of the ATPase activity of MinD which triggers the dimer-to-monomer transition; E. coli MinD ATP hydrolysis is stimulated by the membrane and by MinE, so B. subtilis MinD may also be stimulated by the membrane and/or other components like MinJ. Instead, the authors claim that (a) would only increase differences in diffusion between the monomer and different oligomeric species, and that a 2-fold increase in dimerization on the membrane could not induce gradient formation in their simulation, in the absence of MinJ stimulating gradient formation. However, a 2-fold increase in dimerization is likely way too low to explain any cooperative membrane binding observed for the E. coli Min system. Regarding (b), they also claim that implementing stimulation of ATP hydrolysis on the membrane (dimer-to-monomer transition) would not change the outcome, but no simulation result for this condition is actually shown.</p>
<p>(3) To generate any gradient formation, the authors claim that they would need to implement stimulation of dimer formation by MinJ, but they themselves acknowledge the lack of any experimental evidence for this assertion. They then test all other conditions (e.g., differences in membrane affinity, diffusion, etc.) in addition to the requirement that MinJ stimulates dimer formation. It is unclear whether the authors tested all other conditions independently of the &quot;MinJ induces dimerization&quot; condition, and whether either of those alone or in combination could also lead to gradient formation. This would be an important test to establish the validity of their claims.</p>

<p>This important study by Bohorquez et al examines the determinants necessary for concentrating the spatial modulator of cell division, MinD, at the future site of division and the cell poles. Proper localization of MinD is necessary to bring the division inhibitor, MinC, in proximity to the cell membrane and cell poles where it prevents aberrant assembly of the division machinery. In contrast to E. coli, in which MinD oscillates from pole to pole courtesy of a third protein MinE, how MinD localization is achieved in B. subtilis - which does not encode a MinE analog - has remained largely a mystery. The authors present compelling data indicating that MinD dimerization is dispensable for membrane localization but required for concentration at the cell poles. Dimerization is also important for interactions between MinD and MinC, leading to the formation of large protein complexes. Computational modeling, specifically a Monte Carlo simulation, supports a model in which differences in diffusion rates between MinD monomers and dimers lead to the concentration of MinD at cell poles. Once there, interaction with MinC increases the size of the complex, further reinforcing diffusion differences. Notably, interactions with MinJ-which has previously been implicated in MinCD localization, are dispensable for concentrating MinD at cell poles although MinJ may help stabilize the MinCD complex at those locations.</p>
