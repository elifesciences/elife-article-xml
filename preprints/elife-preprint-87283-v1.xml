<title>Abstract</title><p>N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation of RNA by the methyltransferase complex (MTC), with core components including METTL3-METTL14 heterodimers and <italic>Wilms’ tumor 1-associated protein</italic> (WTAP), contributes to breast tumorigenesis, but the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identify a novel cleaved form METTL3a (residues 239-580 of METTL3). We find that METTL3a is required for the METTL3-WTAP interaction, RNA m<sup>6</sup>A deposition, as well as cancer cell proliferation. Mechanistically, we find that METTL3a is essential for the METTL3-METTL3 interaction, which is a prerequisite step for recruitment of WTAP in MTC. Analysis of m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing data shows that depletion of METTL3a globally disrupts m<sup>6</sup>A deposition, and METTL3a mediates mTOR activation via m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated suppression of TMEM127 expression. Moreover, we find that METTL3 cleavage is mediated by proteasome in an mTOR-dependent manner, revealing positive regulatory feedback between METTL3a and mTOR signaling. Our findings reveal METTL3a as an important component of MTC, and suggest the METTL3a-mTOR axis as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) methylation is the most abundant and evolutionarily conserved internal mRNA modification in eukaryotes, and is involved in numerous aspects of mRNA metabolism including RNA splicing, localization, stability, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">KD et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA modification participates in numerous physiological processes, such as neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Li et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Livneh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>), embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Batista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Li et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mendel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and reproductive system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Haussmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ivanova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kasowitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Xia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). Dysregulation of m<sup>6</sup>A deposition is associated with various diseases including cancer pathogenesis and drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), such as the core m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase (METTL3) promotes the progression of breast cancer through elevating expression of mammalian hepatitis BX-interacting protein and inhibiting tumor suppressor <italic>let-7g</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cai et al., 2018</xref>), inhibits tumor immune surveillance by upregulating PD-L1 mRNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wan et al., 2022</xref>), and contributes to breast cancer tamoxifen resistance by upregulation of AK4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The m<sup>6</sup>A mRNA modification is deposited by a methyltransferase complex (MTC), the METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex serves as the core of MTC, METTL3 is the core catalytic component, METTL14 contributes to substrate RNA recognition, triggering METTL3 methylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and WTAP has been recognized as an essential adaptor responsible for recruitment of METTL3-METTL14 heterodimer to nuclear speckles. The m<sup>6</sup>A modifications are globally reduced in the absence of WTAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ping et al., 2014</xref>). The underlying regulatory mechanisms of m<sup>6</sup>A machinery have recently begun to emerge. In particular, ERK was found to phosphorylate METTL3 and WTAP, resulting in stabilization of the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sun et al., 2020a</xref>). Three other studies reported that mTORC1 promotes WTAP translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cho et al., 2021</xref>), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Villa et al., 2021</xref>), and activation of chaperonin CCT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tang et al., 2021</xref>), leading to the global increase in m<sup>6</sup>A modifications. In this study, we have identified a cleaved form of METTL3, METTL3a (residues 239-580), that is essential for the METTL3-WTAP interaction, RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylation, and breast cancer progression.</p>

<title>Identification of two novel C-terminal short forms METTL3a (residues 239-580) and METTL3b (residues 197-580)</title>
<p>METTL3 is well-known to promote breast tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). We obtained breast cancer patient tumor tissues and found that METTL3 was upregulated in tumor samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, we observed two short bands, which were all elevated synchronously with the full-length (FL) of METTL3. To determine whether these bands were derived from METTL3, we constructed METTL3 knockdown in human T47D breast cancer cell lines by METTL3 shRNA and found that the amount of these two short bands was abolished (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Reconstitution of exogenous METTL3 by no tagged pMSCV-METTL3 construct in these cells rescued the expression levels of these two bands (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that the two short bands were recognized by antibody against the C-terminal, but not N-terminal of METTL3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that these short forms are derived from the C-terminal of METTL3. Furthermore, we constructed T47D cell line stably expressing exogenous METTL3 by using C-terminal Flag-tagged pMSCV-METTL3 plasmid and also observed these short bands by Flag antibody (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that these short bands are METTL3 C-terminal short forms, and we designated these two short forms as METTL3a and METTL3b as indicated in the Figures.</p>

</fig>
<p>Since both endogenous and exogenous METTL3 expression in cells could generate METTL3a and METTL3b, we hypothesized that they are most likely generated from post-translational regulation. To test this possibility, we purified recombinant protein of METTL3 and incubated it with T47D cell lysates, and found that the purified METTL3-His could generate these short forms upon incubation with T47D cell lysates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). This result indicates that these short forms are derived from post-translational products of METTL3. To determine the specific METTL3 regions contained in these short forms, we separated each clean short form through SDS-PAGE and <italic>Ponceau S</italic> staining of the purified recombinant METTL3-Flag followed by edman sequencing of their respective first five N-terminal amino acids. The sequencing results showed that the METTL3a N-terminal sequence was 239SKKVS243, while that of METTL3b was 197GLNSS201, revealing that residues 239-580 and 197-580 comprise METTL3a and METTL3b, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We therefore identified two C-terminal short forms METTL3a (residues 239-580) and METTL3b (residues 197-580).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>METTL3a and METTL3b are post-translational products through highly conserved residues</title>
<p>We next generated point mutations or deletions in those conserved terminal residues, which further revealed that deletion of METTL3 Q238 (Δ238) or Q239 (Δ239) could most significantly reduce the expression of METTL3a in 293T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Similarly, deletion of L198 (Δ198) or L199 (Δ199) resulted in the strongest suppression of METTL3b expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Notably, endogenous deletion of either L198 or Q238 (METTL3-Δ238 or METTL3-Δ198) by CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in (KI) could lead to decreased expression of both short forms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed these post-translationally generated short forms by incubation of purified recombinant METTL3 with cell lysates of T47D, and found that METTL3-WT-His, but not METTL3-(Δ198+Δ238)-His, could generate these short forms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that METTL3a and METTL3b are post-translationally generated through the highly conserved residues.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="528944v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Through immunofluorescence assays, we found that METTL3a, METTL3b, METTL3-Δ198 and METTL3-Δ238 were mainly localized to nucleus, similar to METTL3 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure supplement 1</xref>). And, <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation assays showed that METTL3a, METTL3b, METTL3-Δ198 and METTL3-Δ238, similar to METTL3-WT, showed m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H, I</xref>). These data suggest that these METTL3 variants have no effect on METTL3 localization or <italic>in vitro</italic> m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase activity.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned that the strong promoter CMV-driven pHAGE-METTL3-Flag construct used for purification of recombinant METTL3-Flag showed another highly expressed short form, named as METTL3c, which was very close in size to b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure supplement 2A</xref>). Therefore, we had to exclude METTL3c expression for purification of METTL3b. We thus performed domain mapping for METTL3 with various mutations as indicated to identify conserved residues responsible for the expression of METTL3c, and finally found that point mutations in the M156 and M157 residues to convert these highly conserved amino acids into alanines (2MA) could lead to disappearance of METTL3c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure supplement 2B-F</xref>). We then used this METTL3-2MA-Flag construct for edman sequencing as described in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. METTL3c, which is disappear upon depletion of both M156 and M157, could be a product of an alternative open reading frame rather than a cleavage product, as deletion of the start codon leads to its loss. Since METTL3c was largely absent within endogenous METTL3, combined with data from m<sup>6</sup>A dot blots and tumor cell growth assays showing that METTL3-2MA functioned similarly to METTL3-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure supplement 2G-K</xref>), we did not investigate METTL3c in the following study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Both METTL3a and full-length METTL3 are required for cell proliferation and breast cancer progression</title>
<p>Since our above data have showed that METTL3a, METTL3b, METTL3-Δ198 and METTL3-Δ238 display the similar distributions with METTL3 WT and also harbor intact m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, we wondered whether these two short forms, which are upregulated in breast cancer, are functionally important. We therefore reconstituted METTL3-WT, METTL3-Δ238, METTL3-Δ198, METTL3a, or METTL3b respectively in METTL3 knockout (KO) T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, C</xref>). Cell proliferation assays showed that reconstitution with METTL3-WT or METTL3-Δ198, but not METTL3-Δ238, METTL3a or METTL3b, could rescue the defects in cell proliferation caused by METTL3 KO in T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, D</xref>). These findings suggest that the short form METTL3a and full-length of METTL3 are required for tumor cell proliferation, since depletion of either one of them failed to rescue the cell growth defect caused by METTL3 KO. In line with these results, METTL3-Δ238 KI 293T cells displayed decrease in cell proliferation compared to METTL3 WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>), and reconstitution of METTL3a, but not METTL3b, could rescue the reduced cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G, H</xref>). These data suggest that METTL3a is required for METTL3-mediated regulation of cell proliferation.</p>

<title>METTL3a is required for the interaction between METTL3 and WTAP</title>
<p>METTL3-mediated tumor cell growth is known to rely on MTC for its methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lan et al., 2019</xref>). Here, our data showed that either METTL3 with loss of METTL3a (METTL3-Δ238) or METTL3a alone failed to rescue cell proliferation defects coursed by METTL3 KO, although both of them have intact catalytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, we wondered whether METTL3a participates in the m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase complex, among which METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP are core components required for intracellular RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ping et al., 2014</xref>). To this end, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) assays in T47D and 293T cell lines and observed that METTL3-Δ238 had much weaker interaction with WTAP, but retained its interaction with METTL14, whereas METTL3-Δ198 could interact with both WTAP and METTL14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>), consistent with the phenotypic study showing that METTL3-Δ238, but not METTL3-Δ198, affected tumor cell proliferation. Previous reports have shown that WTAP interacts with the METTL3 N-terminal leader helix domain (LH, 1-34aa), and that METTL14 can heterodimerize with METTL3 through their individual C-terminal methyltransferase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schöller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). In line with these findings, our results showed that both METTL3a and METTL3b, which lack the METTL3 N-terminal domain, failed to interact with WTAP, but could bind with METTL14 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). IP assays in METTL3 knockdown (KD) 293T cells further confirmed the decreased interaction between METTL3-Δ238 and WTAP, and reconstitution with exogenous METTL3a could rescue their interaction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>), indicating that METTL3a is required for the METTL3-WTAP interaction.</p>

<title>METTL3a mediates the METTL3-METTL3 interaction, a prerequisite step for WTAP recruitment in MTC complex</title>
<p>Since METTL3a showed no interaction with WTAP, we next sought to determine how reduced expression of METTL3a decreased the METTL3-WTAP interaction. Recent study has shown that METTL3 is capable of self-interaction and undergoes phase separation in nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Han et al., 2022</xref>). Consistently, we also found that the METTL3-METTL3 interaction could occur in both 293T cell line and <italic>in vitro</italic> recombinant protein purification-IP systems (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>). And, the METTL3-METTL3 interaction is independent of DNA or RNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). We further constructed METTL3 N-terminal (1-238) and C-terminal (239-580) truncation plasmids. And, IP assays showed that the METTL3-METTL3 interaction was through its C-terminal domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-E</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3A-C</xref>). We therefore wondered whether METTL3a could mediate the METTL3-METTL3 interaction, then affects further recruitment of WTAP. Indeed, we found that the interaction between METTL3-Δ238 and METTL3-Δ238 was barely detectable, but restored under exogenous expression of METTL3a, as was its interaction with WTAP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that METTL3a is required for the METTL3-METTL3 interaction, that is a prerequisite step for the METTL3-WTAP interaction. Our finding is in line with previous study showing that WTAP only interacts with METTL3 in dense phase, which is formed by METTL3-METTL3 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Han et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<p>We next examined the intracellular assembly process of MTC. Since METTL3 is the key which functions as methyltransferase, we first determined the effect of METTL3 on the formation of MTC. Through Co-IP assays with 293T cells, we found that METTL3 depletion decreased the METTL14-METTL14 and METTL14-WTAP interactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), suggesting that the intracellular METTL14-METTL14 and METTL14-WTAP interactions take place at least partially through METTL3. While METTL14 depletion did not reduce, but rather increase the METTL3-METTL3 and METTL3-WTAP interactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Recent cryo-EM data demonstrate that WTAP can form dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Su et al., 2022</xref>). As expected, we observed the WTAP-WTAP interaction in 293T cells, and it was unaffected by depletion of METTL3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). Conversely, WTAP depletion had no effect on the METTL3-METTL3 and METTL3-METTL14 interactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J, K</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that the METTL3-METTL3 interaction acts as a core initiating the formation of METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex. These data demonstrate that METTL3a mediates the METTL3-METTL3 interactions, thereby forming larger complexes for efficient recruitment of WTAP in MTC.</p>
<p>WTAP is essential for m<sup>6</sup>A deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ping et al., 2014</xref>), our current data suggest that METTL3a is required for METTL3-WTAP interaction. We therefore hypothesized that METTL3a may play a role in intracellular RNA m<sup>6</sup>A deposition. Through m<sup>6</sup>A dot blot assays, we observed that reconstitution of METTL3-Δ238 could not rescue the decreased RNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification caused by METTL3 depletion in 293T cells, while reconstitution of METTL3-Δ198 or METTL3-WT in these cells restored the m<sup>6</sup>A deposition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L, M</xref>). Consistently, METTL3-Δ238 KI cells showed reduced m<sup>6</sup>A level compared to METTL3-WT cells, and reconstitution of exogenous METTL3a in METTL3-Δ238 KI cells rescued this decrease (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5N, O</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that METTL3a is required for the formation of METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex and m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modification.</p>

<title>METTL3a is essential for the METTL3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A deposition and mTOR activation</title>
<p>In light of our above data showing that METTL3a is required for m<sup>6</sup>A RNA methylation, we further examined how METTL3a affects m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modification across the whole genome in T47D cells. To this end, we expressed METTL3-WT, METTL3-Δ198, or METTL3-Δ238 to complement endogenous METTL3 KO T47D cells, then conducted m<sup>6</sup>A-seq to identify their differentially modified transcripts. Mapping of transcripts with m<sup>6</sup>A modification revealed that m<sup>6</sup>A methylation was globally decreased from the transcriptome of METTL3 KO cells expressing empty vector (Vec) or METTL3-Δ238, while the total number of methylation marks was similar among METTL3-Δ198-, METTL3-WT-expressing METTL3 KO cells and the control (sgCtrl+Vec) cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Whereas motif analyses of the m<sup>6</sup>A peaks showed that the most enriched motif of the transcripts across all groups was the canonical GGAC motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure supplement 4A</xref>), and also the distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A methylation sites across the full transcriptome were similar among all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure supplement 4B</xref>). To identify their differentially regulated m<sup>6</sup>A methylation sites, we first normalized their m<sup>6</sup>A peaks with that of METTL3 KO cells expressing vector (sgMETTL3+Vec) to eliminate those peaks not affected by METTL3 KO, we then found that METTL3 KO cells expressing either METTL3-WT or METTL3-Δ198 shared the most of their m<sup>6</sup>A peaks (&gt;80%), while those cells expressing METTL3-Δ238 lost 90% of peaks observed in METTL3-WT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). These analyses suggest that downregulation of METTL3a inhibits the METTL3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A deposition.</p>

<p>To explore the potential targets regulated by METTL3a, we analyzed mRNAs associated with differentially regulated m<sup>6</sup>A peaks in METTL3-WT-versus METTL3-Δ238-complemented METTL3 KO cells and found that the differentially modified gene transcripts were enriched in several signal transduction pathways, and most highly in the mTOR pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Previous studies have found that METTL3 promotes mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Qin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sun et al., 2020b</xref>), although the underlying mechanism has remained unclear.</p>
<p>In order to verify how METTL3a affects mTOR pathway, we analyzed the m<sup>6</sup>A methylome and found that some regulators in the mTOR pathway were methylated in METTL3-WT, but not in METTL3-Δ238 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Immunoblot analysis of those well-established regulators for mTOR activation showed that TMEM127, a suppressor of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Qin et al., 2010</xref>), was significantly upregulated in METTL3 KO T47D cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). From m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing data, we observed that METTL3 KO led to a significant decrease in m<sup>6</sup>A peaks at the 3’UTR of <italic>TMEM127</italic> transcript compared to that in cells reconstituted with METTL3-WT or METTL3-Δ198, but not METTL3-Δ238 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>), which was further verified by m<sup>6</sup>A RIP assays in T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">figuer supplement 4C</xref>). Subsequent immunoblot assays showed that TMEM127 was negatively regulated by METTL3, and a similar trend with the m<sup>6</sup>A-seq data was also observed that METTL3-WT, but not METTL3-Δ238 expression could rescue TMEM127 expression in METTL3 KO T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">figure supplement 4D</xref>). Accordingly, METTL3 KO-mediated decrease in S6K phosphorylation could be rescued by METTL3 WT or METTL3-Δ198, but not by METTL3-Δ238 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">figure supplement 4D</xref>). And, knockdown of TMEM127 in the METTL3 depleted T47D cells could restore S6K phosphorylation and cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I, J</xref>). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that METTL3a is required for mTOR activation at least partially through m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated suppression of TMEM127 expression, and this modulation contributes to tumor cell proliferation.</p>

<title>Proteasome mediates METTL3 cleavage in an mTOR-dependent manner</title>
<p>In light of our above data showing that the short forms of METTL3 originated through post-translational regulation, we next investigated the mechanism and conditions responsible for processing full-length METTL3 into short forms. It is well known that proteolytic cleavage mediates post-translational process of protein into small pieces, to identify the potential protease responsible for this process, we screened a series of inhibitors targeting different proteases and found that the proteasomal inhibitors MG132 and Ixazomib could largely block the generation of these short forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>-figure supplement 5A). Proteasome is multi-catalytic protease complex that regulates cellular protein homeostasis through targeted degradation of proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bochtler et al., 1999</xref>), and previous work has described the endoproteolytic activity underlying proteasomal function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baugh and Pilipenko, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sorokin et al., 2005</xref>).

<p>Co-immunoprecipitation assays in 293T cells followed by LC-MS/MS showed that METTL3 interacted with the proteasome components PSMC3, PSMC5, and PSMD10 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>), which was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays targeting METTL3-Flag in T47D cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). In addition, knockdown of PSMC3, PSMC5 or PSMD10 abrogated the cleavage of METTL3 in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H-J</xref>). As PSMC3, PSMC5 and PSMD10 are all regulatory subunits of 26S proteasome, we hypothesized that 26S proteasome may be responsible for METTL3 cleavage. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> proteasomal cleavage assay by incubation of purified recombinant METTL3 with 26S proteasome showed that 26S proteasome could directly cleave METTL3 WT to METTL3a and METTL3b, while deletion of both L198 and Q238 inhibited this process (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that proteasome is responsible for the cleavage of METTL3 into METTL3a and METTL3b.</p>
<p>mTORC1 promotes the expression of proteasomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore investigated whether mTOR regulates the above proteasome components, and affects METTL3 cleavage. Western blot analysis showed that silence of mTOR in MDA-MB-231 cells inhibited the expression of PSMC3, PSMC5 and PSMD10 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7L</xref>), and also led to decreased accumulation of the METTL3 short forms (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7M</xref>). Consistent with this finding, treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines led to decreased expression of these short forms (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7N</xref>). In addition, depletion of either Raptor or Rictor, which are key components of mTOR complex 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and mTORC2), respectively, also reduced the expression of the METTL3 short forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure supplement 5B, C</xref>). We also found that cells with constitutively active mTOR signaling due to knockout of <italic>Tsc2,</italic> a negative regulator of mTOR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Crino et al., 2006</xref>), led to upregulation of these short forms, and proteasome inhibitor MG132 treatment could inhibit this upregulation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7O</xref>), suggesting that mTOR upregulates the METTL3 short forms via proteasome. These cumulative results suggest that proteasome is responsible for METTL3 cleavage, and the mTOR pathway positively regulates this process.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we describe a cleaved form of METTL3, METTL3a, that is essential for the METTL3-WTAP interaction and m<sup>6</sup>A deposition, resulting in the promotion of breast tumor progression. Specifically, the cleaved form METTL3a mediates the METTL3-METTL3 interaction, which is a prerequisite step for WTAP binding with METTL3. Analyses of the RNA m<sup>6</sup>A methylome reveal that METTL3a is required for the global METTL3-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification and mTOR activation. Further, we find that the mTOR pathway positively regulates the expression of proteasome components that mediate proteasomal cleavage of METTL3 into METTL3a. These findings reveal a positive feedback between METTL3a and the mTOR signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7P</xref>).</p>
<p>The methyltransferase complex (MTC) mediates m<sup>6</sup>A deposition. It is well-established that the core components of the MTC include heterodimers of the METTL3-METTL14 methyltransferases with an adaptor protein WTAP. Here, we found that METTL3 undergoes METTL3-METTL3 interaction which is required for recruitment of WTAP in MTC. Downregulation of METTL3a leads to decrease in both METTL3-METTL3 interaction and the METTL3-WTAP interaction, and consequently attenuates m<sup>6</sup>A modification. Based on this work, we propose that METTL3a acts as a bridge between the METTL3-METTL14 heterodimers through mediating the METTL3-METTL3 interaction, thereby resulting in the formation of larger complexes which can efficiently recruit WTAP in MTC. Our finding is in line with previous report showing that METTL3 undergoes self-interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Han et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast to the constitutive binding of METTL14 to METTL3 in both the diffuse and the dense phase, WTAP only interacts with METTL3 in dense phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Han et al., 2022</xref>), it means that WTAP tends to bind to larger METTL3-METTL14 complexes, which supports our conclusion. It is also noteworthy that METTL3b contains the region of residues 239-580 but is not required for the METTL3-WTAP interaction. Based on our findings, we are inclined to speculate that the cleavage product METTL3a is a structurally appropriate (i.e., small enough) component involved in MTC complex, whereas the METTL3b is not.</p>
<p>Screening of a proteasome inhibitor library in conjunction with LS-MS/MS, we found that the proteasome is responsible for METTL3 cleavage, and deletion of the proteasome components PSMC3, PSMC5 or PSMD10 attenuates the accumulation of cleaved forms of METTL3. Furthermore, we showed that the mTOR pathway promotes this process through positive regulation of proteasomal components. The proteasome is essential for degradation of intracellular proteins, including misfolded mutant and damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bochtler et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, proteasome also exhibits endoproteolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu et al., 2003</xref>), such as proteasome-mediated cleavage of translation initiation factors eIF4G and eIF3a differentially affects the assembly of ribosomal preinitiation complexes and thus inhibits the translation of viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baugh and Pilipenko, 2004</xref>), and proteasomal cleavage of the Y-box-binding protein 1 splits off the C-terminal fragment which can translocate into nucleus and participate in cellular adaptation to DNA damage stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sorokin et al., 2005</xref>), which are similar to METTL3 cleavage identified in this work. Our data indicate that deletion of METTL3 residues L198 or Q238 does not completely block the formation of their respective short forms, leading us to speculate that the proteasome may recognize a conserved motif that likely contains multiple amino acids.</p>
<p>Other recent studies have demonstrated that mTOR increases global m<sup>6</sup>A modification by promoting WTAP translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cho et al., 2021</xref>), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Villa et al., 2021</xref>), and by activating the chaperonin CCT complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tang et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we reveal a new mechanism by which mTOR promotes the cleavage of METTL3 through positive regulation of proteasome components, thereby enhancing global m<sup>6</sup>A deposition. METTL3-mediated tumorigenesis largely relies on its methyltransferase activity. The recent identification of a selective inhibitor of METTL3 catalytic activity that dramatically decreases tumor growth in mouse AML models suggests that m<sup>6</sup>A methylation by METTL3 could serve as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Yankova et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show that the cleaved form METTL3a plays a key role in m<sup>6</sup>A methylation activity, thus providing another potential anti-cancer therapeutic approach through blockade of METTL3 cleavage. Several studies have demonstrated that proteasomal activity is upregulated in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arlt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen and Madura, 2005</xref>), and several proteasome inhibitors have received regulatory approval and are routinely used in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Manasanch and Orlowski, 2017</xref>). Our study expands the rationale for targeting the mTOR-proteasome axis in breast cancer therapies.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that METTL3 activates mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Qin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sun et al., 2020b</xref>), although the underlying mechanism has remained poorly defined. KEGG analysis of transcriptome-wide m<sup>6</sup>A sequencing data showed that the mTOR pathway is the most highly enriched signal transduction pathway affected by METTL3a depletion. Furthermore, we show that <italic>TMEM127</italic> is the primary target of METTL3 among those genes involved in the mTOR pathway, and depletion of METTL3a decreases m<sup>6</sup>A modification of the <italic>TMEM127</italic> 3’UTR, leading to elevated TMEM127 expression. TMEM127 serves as a suppressor of the mTOR pathway by interfering with mTOR accessibility for its regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Qin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, mechanistically, METTL3a functions as a positive regulatory feedback for activation of the mTOR pathway.</p>
<p>In summary, this study represents the first description to our knowledge of cleaved forms of METTL3, with METTL3a in particular serving as an essential component of the MTC complex, and elucidates the intracellular assembly process of the METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex. These findings also uncover a positive regulatory feedback between METTL3a and the mTOR pathway which may serve as the basis for development of therapeutic strategies for breast cancer.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings on a cleaved form of METTL3 that may play an essential role in regulating the assembly of the METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, but the model and assays can be improved. The work will be of interest to biologists working on RNA epigenetics and cancer biology.</p>

<p>This study presents an important finding on human m6A methyltransferase complex (including METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP). The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is convincing, although the model and assays need to be further modified. The work will be of interest to biologists working on RNA epigenetics and cancer biology.</p>
<p>In mammals, a large methyltransferase complex (including METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP) deposits m6A across the transcriptome, and METTL3 serves as its catalytic core component. In this manuscript, the authors identified two cleaved forms of METTL3 and described the function of METTL3a (residues 239-580) in breast tumorigenesis. METTL3a mediates the assembly of METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex, the global m6A deposition and breast cancer progression. Furthermore, the METTL3a-mTOR axis was uncovered to mediate the METTL3 cleavage, providing potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. This study is properly performed and the findings are very interesting; however, some problems with the model and assays need to be modified. It is widely known that METTL3 and METTL14 form a stable heterodimer with the stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 (Wang X et al. Nature 534, 575-578 (2016), Su S et al. Cell Res 32(11), 982-994 (2022), Yan X et al. Cell Res 32(12), 1124-1127 (2022)), the numbers of METTL3 and METTL14 in the model of Fig 7P are not equivalent and need to be modified.</p>

<p>In this study, Yan et al. report that a cleaved form of METTL3 (termed METTL3a) plays an essential role in regulating the assembly of the METTL3-METTL14-WTAP complex. Depletion of METTL3a leads to reduced m6A level on TMEM127, an mTOR repressor, and subsequently decreased breast cancer cell proliferation. Mechanistically, METTL3a is generated via 26S proteasome in an mTOR-dependent manner.</p>
<p>The manuscript follows a smooth, logical flow from one result to the next, and most of the results are clearly presented. Specifically, the molecular interaction assays are well-designed. If true, this model represents a significant addition to the current understanding of m6A-methyltransferase complex formation.</p>
<p>A few minor issues detailed below should be addressed to make the paper even more robust. The specific comments are contained below.</p>
<p>1. The existence of METTL3a and METTL3b.</p>
<p>
In this study, the author found the cleaved form of METTL3 in breast cancer patient tissues and breast cancer cell lines. Is it a specific event that only occurs in breast cancer? The author may examine the METTL3a in other cell lines if it is a common rule.</p>
<p>
2. Generation of METTL3a and METTL3b.</p>
<p>1. Figure 1 shows that METTL3a and METTL3b were generated from the C-terminal of full-length METTL3. Because the sequence of METTL3a is involved in the sequences of METTL3b, can METTL3b be further cleaved to produce METTL3a?</p>
<p>2. Based on current data, the generation of METTL3a and METTL3b are separated. Are there any factors that affect the cleavage ratio between METTL3a and METTL3b?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for point this out. We discovered the cleaved form of METTL3 in breast cancer, and we also observed this cleaved METTL3 in other cell lines such as lung cancer cell lines, renal cancer cell lines, HCT116 and MEF, suggesting that it is a common rule. We will add these results in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Generation of METTL3a and METTL3b.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>1. Figure 1 shows that METTL3a and METTL3b were generated from the C-terminal of full-length METTL3. Because the sequence of METTL3a is involved in the sequences of METTL3b, can METTL3b be further cleaved to produce METTL3a?</p>
<p>Although the sequence of METTL3a is involved in the sequences of METTL3b, overexpression of METTL3b in T47D, MDA-MB-231 and 293T cells did not show METTL3a expression (please see Figures 3A, 3C, 3G), suggesting that METTL3b can not be further cleaved to produce METTL3a, and the METTL3 cleavage may require its N-terminal region. We will add this in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Based on current data, the generation of METTL3a and METTL3b are separated. Are there any factors that affect the cleavage ratio between METTL3a and METTL3b?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank for reviewer’s excellent question. In this study, we show that both METTL3a and METTLb are produced through proteasomal cleavage, and both of them are positively regulated by the mTOR pathway. On the other hand, we indeed observed the differential cleavage ratios between METTL3a and METTL3b across different cell lines. For example, METTL3a/METTLb ratio was greater than 1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (see Figure 7C), less than 1 in T47D and 293T cell lines (see Figure 7A and 7B), and equal to 1 in MEF cells (see Figure 7O). Based on these results, we speculate that there may be some factors that control the cleavage ratio between METTL3a and METTL3b, which warrants further investigation. We will add this in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 2G, the author shows the result that incubation of the Δ198+Δ238 METTL3 protein with T47D cell lysates cannot produce the METTL3a and METTL3b variants. The author may also show the results that Δ198 METTL3 protein or Δ238 METTL3 protein incubates with T47D cell lysates, respectively.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we will perform in vitro cleavage assays by incubation of METTL3-Δ238 or METTL3-Δ198 with T47D cell lysates, and will incorporate this result in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. As well as many results published in previous studies, the in vitro methylation assay shows that WT METTL3 is capable of methylating RNA probe (figure 2H). The main point of this study is that METTL3a is required for the METTL3-METTL14 assembly. However, the absence of METTL3a in the in vitro system did not inhibit METTL3-METTL14 methylation activity. Moreover, the presence of METTL3a even resulted in a weak m6A level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The main point of this study is that METTL3a is required for the METTL3-WTAP interaction, but dispensable for the METTL3-METTL14 assembly (see Figure 4A-4B). In this in vitro methylation assays, METTL3 and METTL14 is capable of methylating RNA probe in the absent of WTAP. In this condition, we found that METTL3 WT as well as its different variants (METTL3-Δ238, METTL3-Δ198, METTL3b and METTL3a) except the catalytically dead mutant METTL3 APPA showed methylation activity in vitro.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. In Figure 4A, the author suggests that WTAP cannot be immunoprecipitated with METTL3a and 3b because WTAP interacted with the N-terminal of METTL3. If this assay is performed in WT cells, the endogenous full-length METTL3 may help to form the complex. In this case, WTAP is supposed to be co-immunoprecipitated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for point this out. METTL3 interacts with WTAP through its N-terminal (1-33aa) (1). Consistently, we find that the two cleaved forms METTL3a and METTL3b which lack the N-terminal region are not able to bind with WTAP. In Figure 4A, we overexpressed METTL3 WT as well as its different variants METTL3-Δ238, METTL3-Δ198, METTL3b and METTL3a respectively in WT cells, and compared their binding abilities with WTAP or METTL14 among these overexpressed METTL3 variants. We acknowledge that the exogenous METTL3a and METTL3b interact with endogenous full-length METTL3, and the endogenous full-length METTL3 may help them to form the complex with WTAP. But it is also noteworthy that the exogenous expression levels of METTL3a and METTL3b are much higher than that of endogenous full-length METTL3 (see Figure 3A and 3C). In this case, METTL3a or METTL3b predominantly interacts with itself, METTL3, METTL14 or other potential interacting proteins through its C-terminal region, this may greatly dilute the condition for the interaction between WTAP and endogenous full-length METTL3. Moreover, in Figure 4A, the comparison is among overexpressed METTL3 variants, this week indirect interaction through much lower expression levels of endogenous protein is not comparable to the direct interaction between the overexpressed METTL3 variant and WTAP.</p>
