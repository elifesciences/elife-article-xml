<abstract>
<p>Recent studies show that, even in constant environments, the tuning of single neurons changes over time in a variety of brain regions. This representational drift has been suggested to be a consequence of continuous learning under noise, but its properties are still not fully understood. To uncover the underlying mechanism, we trained an artificial network on a simplified navigational task, inspired by the predictive coding literature. The network quickly reached a state of high performance, and many neurons exhibited spatial tuning. We then continued training the network and noticed that the activity became sparser with time. We observed vastly different time scales between the initial learning and the ensuing sparsification. We verified the generality of this phenomenon across tasks, learning algorithms, and parameters. This sparseness is a manifestation of the movement within the solution space - the networks drift until they reach a flat loss landscape. This is consistent with recent experimental results demonstrating that CA1 neurons increase sparseness with exposure to the same environment and become more spatially informative. We conclude that learning is divided into three overlapping phases: Fast familiarity with the environment, slow implicit regularization, and a steady state of null drift. The variability in drift dynamics opens the possibility of inferring learning algorithms from observations of drift statistics.</p>

<p>What do we mean when we say that the brain represents the external world? One interpretation is the existence of neurons whose activity is tuned to world variables. Such neurons have been observed in many contexts: place cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] – which are tuned to position in a specific context, visual cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] – which are tuned to specific visual cues, neurons that are tuned to the execution of actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] and more. This tight link between the external world and neural activity might suggest that, in the absence of environmental or behavioral changes, neural activity is constant. In contrast, recent studies show that, even in constant environments, the tuning of single neurons to outside world variables gradually changes over time in a variety of brain regions, even long after good representations of the stimuli were achieved. This phenomenon has been termed <italic>representational drift</italic>, and has changed the way we think about the stability of memory and perception, but its driving forces and properties are still unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] for an alternative account).</p>
<p>There are at least two immediate theoretical questions arising from the observation of drift – why does it happen, and whether and how behavior is resistant to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]? One mechanistic explanation is that the underlying anatomical substrates are themselves undergoing constant change, such that drift is a direct manifestation of this structural morphing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. A normative interpretation posits that drift is a solution to a computational demand, such as temporal encoding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], ‘drop-out’ regularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], exploration of the solution space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], or re-encoding during continual learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Several studies also address the resistance question, providing possible explanations on how behavior can be robust to such phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we focus on the mechanistic question, and leverage analyses of drift statistics for this purpose. Specifically, recent studies showed that representational drift in the CA1 is driven by active experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Namely, rate maps decorrelate more when mice are active for a longer time in a given context. This implies that drift is not just a passive process, but rather an active learning one. As drift seems to occur after an adequate representation has formed, it seems fitting to model it as a form of a continuous learning process.</p>
<p>This approach has been recently explored by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. They considered continuous learning in noisy, overparameterized neural networks. Because the system is overparameterized, a manifold of zero-loss solutions exists. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] showed that for feedforward neural networks (FNNs) trained using Hebbian learning with added parameter noise, neurons change their tuning over time. This was due to an <italic>undirected</italic> random walk within the manifold of solutions. The coordinated drift of neighboring place fields was used as evidence to support this view. The phenomenon of undirected motion within the space of solutions seems plausible, as all members of this space achieve equally good performance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> left). However, there may be other properties of the solutions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) that vary along this manifold, which could potentially bias drift in a certain direction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> right). It is likely that the drift observed in experiments is a combination of both an undirected and directed movement. We will now introduce theoretical results from machine learning that support the possibility of directed drift.</p>

<p>Recent work provided a tractable analytical framework for the learning dynamics of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with added noise and an overparameterized regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. These studies showed that, after the network has converged to the zero-loss manifold, a second-order effect biases the random walk along a specific direction within this manifold. This direction reduces an implicit regularizer, determined by the type of noise the network is exposed to. The regularizer is related to the Hessian of the loss – a measure of the flatness of the loss landscape in the vicinity of the solutions. Since this directed movement is a second-order effect, its timescale is orders of magnitude larger than that of the initial convergence.</p>
<p>Consider a biological neural network performing a task. The ML implicit regularization mentioned above requires three components: an overparameterized regime, noise, and SGD. Both biological and artificial networks possess a large number of synapses, or parameters, and hence can reasonably be expected to be overparameterized. Noise can emerge from the external environment or from internal biological elements. It is not reasonable to assume that a precise form of gradient descent is implemented in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], thereby casting doubt on the third element. Nevertheless, biologically plausible rules could be considered as noisy versions of gradient descent, as long as there is a coherent improvement in performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Motivated by this analogy, we explore representational drift in models and experimental data.</p>
<p>Because drift is commonly observed in spatially-selective cells, we base our analysis on a model which has been shown to contain such cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Specifically, we trained artificial neural networks on a predictive coding task in the presence of noise. In this task, an agent moves along a linear track while receiving visual input from the walls, such that the goal is to predict the subsequent input. We observed that neurons became tuned to the latent variable, which is position, in accordance with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. We continued training and found that in addition to the gradual change of tuning curves, similar to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], we witnessed that the number of active neurons decreased slowly while their tuning specificity increased. These results align with recent experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Finally, we demonstrated the connection between this sparsificiation effect and changes to the Hessian, in accordance with ML theory.</p>

<title>Spontaneous sparsification in a predictive coding network</title>
<p>To model representational drift in the CA1 area, we chose a simple model that could give rise to spatially-tuned cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. In this model, an agent traverses a corridor while slightly modulating its angle with respect to the main axis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). The walls are textured by a fixed smooth noisy signal, and the agent receives this as input according to its current field of view. The model itself is a single hidden layer feedforward network, with the velocity and visual field as inputs. The desired output is the predicted visual input in the next time step. The model equations are given by:</p>

<p>Gaussian noise. We let the network converge to a good solution, demonstrated by a loss plateau, and continue training for an additional period. Note that this additional period can be orders of magnitude longer than the initial training period. The network quickly converged to a low loss and stayed at the same loss during the additional training period (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Surprisingly, when looking at the activity within the hidden layer, we noticed that it slowly became sparse. This sparsification did not hurt performance, because individual units became more informative, as quantified by the average mutual information between unit activity and the position of the agent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). When looking at the rate maps of neurons, i.e. their tuning to position, one can observe an image similar to representational drift observed in experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] – namely that neurons changed their tuning over time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Additionally, their tuning specificity increased in accordance with the information increase. By observing the correlation matrix of the rate maps over time, it is apparent that there was a gradual change that slowed down (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). To summarize, we observed a spontaneous sparsification over a timescale much longer than the initial convergence, without introducing any explicit regularization. This is comparable to experimental data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], where indeed drift was characterized by a decrease in the fraction of active place cells, and an increase in cells’ information while the decoding error for the position of the mouse stayed relatively constant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] also reported a decrease in CA1 neural activity and rise in specificity with environment familiarity. Another recent study further demonstrated an increase in information over days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>

<title>Generality of the phenomenon</title>
<p>To explore the sensitivity of our results to specific modeling choices, we systematically varied many of them (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Specifically, we replaced the task with either a simplified predictive coding, random mappings or smoothed random mappings. Noise was introduced to the outputs (label noise), instead of the update noise. We simulated different activation functions. Perhaps most important, we varied the learning rules, as SGD is not a biologically plausible one. We used both Adam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] and RMSprop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], from the ML literature. We also used Stochastic Error-Descent (SED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], which does not require gradient calculation and is more biologically plausible (5). All cases demonstrated an initial, fast, phase of convergence to low loss, followed by a much slower phase of directed random motion within the low-loss space.</p>

</fig>
<p>The results of the simulations supported our main conclusion, though several qualitative phe-nomenons could be observed. First of all, sparsification dynamics were not sensitive to most of the parameters. The main qualitative difference observed was that the timescales could vary by orders of magnitude as a function of the noise scale (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> bottom). Note that we calculate the timescale of sparsification by fitting an exponential curve to the fraction of active units over time, and take the time constant of the fitted exponential. Additionally, apart from simulations that did not converge due to too big timescales, the final sparsity was the same for all networks of the same size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> top), in accordance with results from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. In a sense, once noise is introduced the network is driven to maximal sparsification. For Adam, RMSprop and SED sparsification ensued in the absence of any added noise. For SED the explanation is straightforward, as the parameter updates are driven by noise. For Adam and RMSprop, we suggest that in the vicinity of the zero-loss manifold, the second moment acts as noise.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>For label noise, the dynamics were qualitatively different, the fraction of active units did not reduce, but the activity of the units did sparsify. In some cases, the networks quickly collapsed to a sparse solution, most likely as a result of the learning rate being too high, in relation to the input statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Importantly, for GD without noise, there was no change after the initial convergence.</p>
<p>As a further test of the generality of this phenomenon, we consider the recent simulation from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The learning rule used in this work was very different from the ones we applied. We, therefore, simulated that network using the published code. We found the same type of dynamics as shown above, namely that the network initially converged to a good solution followed by a longer period of sparsification (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Note that in The original publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>] the focus was on the stage following this sparsification, in which the network indeed maintained a constant fraction of active cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we see that noisy learning leads to three phases under rather general conditions. First, fast learning of the task and convergence to the manifold of low-loss solutions. The second phase is directed movement on this manifold driven by a second-order effect of implicit regularization. The third phase is an undirected random walk within the sub-manifold of low loss and maximum regularization.</p>

<sec id="s1c">
<title>Mechanism of sparsification</title>
<p>What are the mechanisms that give rise to sparsification? As illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, different solutions in the zero-loss manifold might vary in some of their properties. The specific property suggested from theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] is the flatness of the loss landscape in the vicinity of the solution. This can be demonstrated with a simple example. Consider a two-dimensional loss function. The function is shaped like a valley with a continuous one-dimensional zero-loss manifold at it’s bottom (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Crucially, the loss on the entire manifold is exactly zero, while the vicinity of the manifold becomes systematically flatter in one direction. We simulated gradient descent with added noise on this function from a random starting point (red dot). The trajectory quickly converged to the zero-loss manifold, and began a random walk on it. This walk was clearly biased towards the flatter area of the manifold, as can be seen by the spread of the trajectory. This bias could be comprehended by noting that the gradient was orthogonal to the contour lines of the loss, and therefore had a component directed towards the flat region.</p>
<fig id="fig4" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 4:</label>
<caption><title>Noisy learning leads to a flat landscape.</title>

(B) Fraction of active units as a function of the number of non-zero eigenvalues. (C) Log of non-zero eigenvalues at two consecutive time points. Note that eigenvalues do not correspond to one another when calculated at two different time points, and this plot demonstrates the change in their distribution rather than changes in eigenvalues corresponding to specific directions. The distribution of larger eigenvalues hardly changes, while the distribution of smaller eigenvalues is pushed to smaller values. (D) Sum of the Hessian’s eigenvalues as a function of time for learning with label noise.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="539512v3_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In higher dimensions, flatness is captured by the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the loss. Because these eigenvalues are a collection of numbers, different scenarios could lead to minimizing different aspects of this collection. Specifically, according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], update noise should regularize the sum of the log of the non-zero eigenvalues while label noise should do the same for the sum of eigenvalues. In our predictive coding example, where update noise was added, each inactivated unit translates into a set of zero-rows in the Hessian, and thus also into a set of zero-eigenvalues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). The slope of the regularizer approaches infinity as the eigenvalue approaches zero, and thus small eigenvalues are driven to zero much faster than large eigenvalues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). So in this case, update noise leads to an increase in the number of zero eigenvalues, which are manifested as a sparse solution. Another, perhaps more intuitive, way to understand these results is that units below the activation threshold are insensitive to noise perturbations. In other scenarios, in which we simulated with label noise, we indeed observed a gradual decrease in the sum of eigenvalues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>We showed that representational drift could arise from ongoing learning in the presence of noise, after a network has already reached good performance. We suggest that learning is divided into three overlapping phases: a fast initial phase, where good performance is achieved, a second slower phase in which <italic>directed</italic> drift along the low-loss manifold leads to an implicit regularization and finally, a third <italic>undirected</italic> phase ensues once the regularizer is minimized. In our results, the directed component was associated with sparsification of the neural code, a phenomenon we also observed in experimental data.</p>
<p>Interpreting drift as a learning process has recently been suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Both studies focused on the final phase in which the statistics of the representations were constant. Experimentally, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] reported a decrease in activity at the beginning of the experiment, which they suggested was correlated with some behavioral change, but we believe it could also be a result of the directed drift phase. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] also reported a slow directed change in representation long after familiarity with the stimuli. There is another consequence of the timescale separation. Unlike in the setting of drift experiments, natural environments are never truly constant. Thus, it is possible that the second phase of learning never stops because the task is slowly changing. This would imply that the second, directed, phase may be the natural regime in which neural networks reside.</p>
<p>Here, we reported directed drift in the space of solutions of neural networks. This drift could be observed by examining changes to the representation of external world variables, and hence is related to the phenomenon of representational drift. Note, however, that representations are not a full description of a network’s behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The statistics of representational changes can be used as a window into changes of network dynamics and function.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of directed drift is very robust to various modeling choices, and also consistent with recent theoretical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] The details of the direction of the drift, however, are dependent on specific choices. Specifically, which aspects of the Hessian are minimized during the second phase of learning, as well as the timescale of this phase, depend on the specifics of the learning rule and the noise in the system. This suggests an exciting opportunity – inferring the learning rule of a network from the statistics of representational drift.</p>
<p>Our explanation of drift invoked the concept of a low-loss manifold – a family of network configurations that have identical performance on a task. The definition of low-loss, however, depends on the specific task and context analyzed. Challenging a system with new inputs could dissociate two configurations that otherwise appear identical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. It will be interesting to explore whether various environmental perturbations could uncover the motion along the low-loss manifold in the CA1 population. For instance, remapping was interpreted as an indicator of the detection of a context switch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. One can therefore speculate that the probability for remapping given the same environmental change will systematically vary as the network moves to flatter areas of the loss landscape.</p>
<p>Machine learning has been suggested as a model tool for neuroscience research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. However, the implicit regularization in ML has not been studied to explain representational drift in neuroscience, and may have been done without awareness of this phenomenon. It’s worth noting that this isn’t a phenomenon specific to neural networks, but rather a general property of overparameterized systems that optimize a cost function. Importing insights from this domain into neuroscience shows the utility of studying general phenomena in systems that learn. For example, another complex learning system in which a similar idea has been proposed is evolution – “survival of the flattest” suggests that, under a high mutation rate, the fittest replicators are not just the ones with the highest fitness, but also with a flat fitness function which is more robust to mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. One can hope that more such insights will arise as we open our eyes.</p>

<title>Tuning properties of units</title>
<p>For each unit we calculated a tuning curve. We divided the arena into 100 equal bins and computed the number of time steps in each bin and the mean unit activation. We then obtained the tuning curve by dividing the mean activity for each bin by the occupancy. We treated movement in each direction as a separate location. We calculated the spatial information (SI) of the tuning curves for each unit:

<title>Gradient descent dynamics around the zero-loss manifold</title>
<p>The function we used for the two-dimensional example was given by:
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
which has zero loss on the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> axes. For small enough update noise, GD will converge to the vicinity of this manifold (the axes). We consider a point on the <italic>x</italic> axis: (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, 0), and calculate the direction of the gradient near that point. Because we are interested in motion along the zero-loss manifold, we consider a small perturbation in the orthogonal direction (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, 0 + Δ<italic>y</italic>) where <italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> &gt;&gt; 1 and |Δ<italic>y</italic>| &lt;&lt; 1. Any component of the gradient in the <italic>x</italic> direction will lead to motion along the manifold. The update step at this point is given by:
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
One can observe that the step has a large component in the <italic>y</italic> direction, quickly returning to the manifold. There is also a smaller component in the <italic>x</italic> direction, reducing the value of <italic>x</italic>. Reducing <italic>x</italic> also reduces the Hessian’s eigenvalues:
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Thus, it becomes clear that the trajectory will have a bias that reduces the curvature in the <italic>y</italic> direction.</p>
<p>For general loss functions and various noise models, rigorous proofs can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], and a different approach can be found in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Here, we will briefly outline the intuition for the general case. Consider again the update rule for GD:
<disp-formula id="eqn11">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
In order to understand the dynamics close to the zero-loss manifold, we consider a point <italic>θ</italic>, for which <italic>L</italic>(<italic>θ</italic>) = 0 expand the loss around it:
<disp-formula id="eqn12">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
We can then take the gradient of this expansion with respect to <italic>θ</italic>:
<disp-formula id="eqn13">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn14">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
The first term is zero, because the gradient is zero on the manifold. The second term is the largest one, as it linear in <italic>δθ</italic>. Note that the Hessian matrix has zero eigenvalues in directions on the zero-loss manifold, and non-zero eigenvalues in other directions. Thus, the second term corresponds to projecting <italic>δθ</italic> in a direction that is orthogonal to the zero-loss manifold. The third term can be interpreted as the gradient of some auxiliary loss function. Thus, we expect gradient descent to minimize this new loss, which corresponds to a quadratic form with the Hessian. This is the reason for the implicit regularization along the manifold. Note that the auxiliary loss function is defined by <italic>δθ</italic>, and thus different noise statistics will correspond, on average, to different implicit regularizations. In conclusion, the update step will have a large component that moves the parameter vector towards the zero-loss manifold, and a small component that moves the parameter vector on the manifold in a direction that minimizes some measure of the Hessian.</p>

<title>Hessian and sparseness</title>
<p>In the main text, we show that the implicit regularization of the Hessian leads to sparse representations. Here, we show this relationship for a single-hidden layer feed-forward neural network with ReLU activation and Mean Squared Error loss:

<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>

The gradient and Hessian at the zero-loss manifold are given by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]:
<disp-formula id="eqn16">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn17">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="539512v3_eqn17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where 𝕝(<bold>x</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>; <italic>θ</italic>) is an indicator vector denoting whether each unit is active for some input <bold>x</bold><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. Sparseness means that a unit has become inactive for all inputs. All the partial derivatives of input, output and bias weights associated with such a unit are zero, and thus the relevant rows of the Hessian are zero as well. Thus, every inactive unit leads to several zero eigenvalues.</p>

<p>The authors start from the premise that neural circuits exhibit &quot;representational drift&quot; -- i.e., slow and spontaneous changes in neural tuning despite constant network performance. While the extent to which biological systems exhibit drift is an active area of study and debate (as the authors acknowledge), there is enough interest in this topic to justify the development of theoretical models of drift.</p>
<p>The contribution of this paper is to claim that drift can reflect a mixture of &quot;directed random motion&quot; as well as &quot;steady state null drift.&quot; Thus far, most work within the computational neuroscience literature has focused on the latter. That is, drift is often viewed to be a harmless byproduct of continual learning under noise. In this view, drift does not affect the performance of the circuit nor does it change the nature of the network's solution or representation of the environment. The authors aim to challenge the latter viewpoint by showing that the statistics of neural representations can change (e.g. increase in sparsity) during early stages of drift. Further, they interpret this directed form of drift as &quot;implicit regularization&quot; on the network.</p>
<p>The evidence presented in favor of these claims is concise. Nevertheless, on balance, I find their evidence persuasive on a theoretical level -- i.e., I am convinced that implicit regularization of noisy learning rules is a feature of most artificial network models. This paper does not seem to make strong claims about real biological systems. The authors do cite circumstantial experimental evidence in line with the expectations of their model (Khatib et al. 2022), but those experimental data are not carefully and quantitatively related to the authors' model.</p>
<p>To establish the possibility of implicit regularization in artificial networks, the authors cite convincing work from the machine-learning community (Blanc et al. 2020, Li et al., 2021). Here the authors make an important contribution by translating these findings into more biologically plausible models and showing that their core assumptions remain plausible. The authors also develop helpful intuition in Figure 4 by showing a minimal model that captures the essence of their result.</p>
<p>In Figure 2, the authors show a convincing example of the gradual sparsification of tuning curves during the early stages of drift in a model of 1D navigation. However, the evidence presented in Figure 3 could be improved. In particular, 3A shows a histogram displaying the fraction of active units over 1117 simulations. Although there is a spike near zero, a sizeable portion of simulations have greater than 60% active units at the end of the training, and critically the authors do not characterize the time course of the active fraction for every network, so it is difficult to evaluate their claim that &quot;all [networks] demonstrated... [a] phase of directed random motion with the low-loss space.&quot; It would be useful to revise the manuscript to unpack these results more carefully. For example, a histogram of log(tau) computed in panel B on a subset of simulations may be more informative than the current histogram in panel A.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript &quot;Representational drift as a result of implicit regularization&quot; the authors study the phenomenon of representational drift (RD) in the context of an artificial network that is trained in a predictive coding framework. When trained on a task for spatial navigation on a linear track, they found that a stochastic gradient descent algorithm led to a fast initial convergence to spatially tuned units, but then to a second very slow, yet directed drift which sparsified the representation while increasing the spatial information. They finally show that this separation of timescales is a robust phenomenon and occurs for a number of distinct learning rules.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a very clearly written and insightful paper, and I think people in the community will benefit from understanding how RD can emerge in such artificial networks. The mechanism underlying RD in these models is clearly laid out and the explanation given is convincing.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It is unclear how this mechanism may account for the learning of multiple environments. The process of RD through this mechanism also appears highly non-stationary, in contrast to what is seen in familiar environments in the hippocampus, for example.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Single-unit neural activity tuned to environmental or behavioral variables gradually changes over time. This phenomenon, called representational drift, occurs even when all external variables remain constant, and challenges the idea that stable neural activity supports the performance of well-learned behaviors. While a number of studies have described representational drift across multiple brain regions, our understanding of the underlying mechanism driving drift is limited. Ratzon et al. propose that implicit regularization - which occurs when machine learning networks continue to reconfigure after reaching an optimal solution - could provide insights into why and how drift occurs in neurons. To test this theory, Ratzon et al. trained a Feedforward Network to perform the oft-utilized linear track behavioral paradigm and compare the changes in hidden layer units to those observed in hippocampal place cells recorded in awake, behaving animals.</p>
<p>Ratzon et al. clearly demonstrate that hidden layer units in their model undergo consistent changes even after the task is well-learned, mirroring representational drift observed in real hippocampal neurons. They show that the drift occurs across three separate measures: the active proportion of units (referred to as sparsification), spatial information of units, and correlation of spatial activity. They continue to address the conditions and parameters under which drift occurs in their model to assess the generalizability of their findings. However, the generalizability results are presented primarily in written form: additional figures are warranted to aid in reproducibility. Last, they investigate the mechanism through which sparsification occurs, showing that the flatness of the manifold near the solution can influence how the network reconfigures. The authors suggest that their findings indicate a three-stage learning process: 1) fast initial learning followed by 2) directed motion along a manifold which transitions to 3) undirected motion along a manifold.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors' results support the main conclusion that implicit regularization in machine learning networks mirrors representational drift observed in hippocampal place cells. However, additional figures/analyses are needed to clearly demonstrate how different parameters used in their model qualitatively and quantitatively influence drift. Finally, the authors need to clearly identify how their data supports the three-stage learning model they suggest. Their findings promise to open new fields of inquiry into the connection between machine learning and representational drift and generate testable predictions for neural data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. Ratzon et al. make an insightful connection between well-known phenomena in two separate fields: implicit regularization in machine learning and representational drift in the brain. They demonstrate that changes in a Feedforward Network mirror those observed in the brain, which opens a number of interesting questions for future investigation.</p>
<p>2. The authors do an admirable job of writing to a large audience and make efforts to provide examples to make machine learning ideas accessible to a neuroscience audience and vice versa. This is no small feat and aids in broadening the impact of their work.</p>
<p>3. This paper promises to generate testable hypotheses to examine in real neural data, e.g., that drift rate should plateau over long timescales (now testable with the ability to track single-unit neural activity across long time scales with calcium imaging and flexible silicon probes). Additionally, it provides another set of tools for the neuroscience community at large to use when analyzing the increasingly high-dimensional data sets collected today.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Neural representational drift and directed/undirected random walks along a manifold in ML are well described. However, outside of the first section of the main text, the analysis focuses primarily on the connection between manifold exploration and sparsification without addressing the other two drift metrics: spatial information and place field correlations. It is therefore unclear if the results from Figures 3 and 4 are specific to sparseness or extend to the other two metrics. For example, are these other metrics of drift also insensitive to most of the parameters as shown in Figure 3 and the related text? These concerns could be addressed with panels analogous to Figures 3a-c and 4b for the other metrics and will increase the reproducibility of this work.</p>
<p>2. Many caveats/exceptions to the generality of findings are mentioned only in the main text without any supporting figures, e.g., &quot;For label noise, the dynamics were qualitatively different, the fraction of active units did not reduce, but the activity of the units did sparsify&quot; (lines 116-117). Supporting figures are warranted to illustrate which findings are &quot;qualitatively different&quot; from the main model, which are not different from the main model, and which of the many parameters mentioned are important for reproducing the findings.</p>
<p>3. Key details of the model used by the authors are not listed in the methods. While they are mentioned in reference 30 (Recanatesi et al., 2021), they need to be explicitly defined in the methods section to ensure future reproducibility.</p>
<p>4. How different states of drift correspond to the three learning stages outlined by the authors is unclear. Specifically, it is not clear where the second stage ends, and the third stage begins, either in real neural data or in the figures. This is compounded by the fact that the third stage - of undirected, random manifold exploration - is only discussed in relation to the introductory Figure 1 and is never connected to the neural network data or actual brain data presented by the authors. Are both stages meant to represent drift? Or is only the second stage meant to mirror drift, while undirected random motion along a manifold is a prediction that could be tested in real neural data? Identifying where each stage occurs in Figures 2C and E, for example, would clearly illustrate which attributes of drift in hidden layer neurons and real hippocampal neurons correspond to each stage.</p>
