<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Vertebrates have evolved great diversity in the number of segments dividing the trunk body, however the developmental origin of the evolvability of this trait is poorly understood. The number of segments is thought to be determined in embryogenesis as a product of morphogenesis of the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) and the periodicity of a molecular oscillator active within the PSM known as the segmentation clock. Here we explore whether the clock and PSM morphogenesis exhibit developmental modularity, as independent evolution of these two processes may explain the high evolvability of segment number. Using a computational model of the clock and PSM parameterised for zebrafish, we find that the clock is broadly robust to variation in morphogenetic processes such as cell ingression, motility, compaction, and cell division. We show that this robustness is in part determined by the length of the PSM and the strength of phase coupling in the clock. As previous studies report no changes to morphogenesis upon perturbing the clock, we suggest that the clock and morphogenesis of the PSM exhibit developmental modularity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vertebrates exhibit great diversity in the number of segments that divide the skeleton, musculature, and nervous system of the body, along the rostral-caudal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Richardson et al. (1998)</xref>). However, the developmental basis for this evolvability remains poorly understood. Segmentation of the body is established by paired blocks of mesodermal tissue, known as somites, that form periodically on either side of the developing embryo as it elongates posteriorly, in a process known as somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morin-Kensicki et al. (2002)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gomez and Pourquié (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Oates et al. (2012)</xref>). The total number of segments corresponds to the number of somites formed in the embryo, which is thought to be an emergent property of the morphogenesis of the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM) and the dynamics of a molecular oscillator known as the segmentation clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Morin-Kensicki et al. (2002)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cooke and Zeeman (1976)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gomez et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gomez and Pourquié (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Harima et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schröter and Oates (2010)</xref>). Here, we hypothesise that the evolvability of vertebrate segment number may be underpinned by developmental modularity of the segmentation clock and morphogenesis of the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Raff (1996)</xref>), and that the potential of these two processes to evolve independently from one another may explain the diversity observed in vertebrate segment number.</p>
<p>The segmentation clock is a complex gene regulatory network thought to be driven by cell-autonomous oscillations of transcription factors in the Hes/Her family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Palmeirim et al. (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lewis (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Harima et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Schröter et al. (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Webb et al. (2016)</xref>). Noisy oscillations are synchronised across cells by delta-notch signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Horikawa et al. (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Lewis (2003)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Venzin and Oates (2020)</xref>), creating synchronous travelling waves of gene expression that pulse from the PSM posterior to the anterior. In the anterior PSM somite boundaries are patterned by the interaction of clock oscillations with a posterior-anterior decreasing gradient of FGF signalling that is thought to act as a ‘wavefront’, reading-out the phase of the clock to create a spatially periodic pattern of somite boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cooke and Zeeman (1976)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Soroldoni et al. (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Simsek and Özbudak (2018)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Simsek et al. (2023)</xref>). The clock synchronises the differentiation of PSM cells as they adopt somite fates at the anterior of the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cooke and Zeeman (1976)</xref>), and so controls both the tempo at which somites are formed, and the anterior-posterior polarity of the somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Simsek et al. (2023)</xref>). Thus, clock synchrony controls the accuracy of somite patterning, and the frequency of clock oscillations determines the frequency of somite formation, which (together with the total duration of somitogenesis), determines the total number of somites formed.</p>
<p>Concurrent with somitogenesis, the PSM undergoes elongation. Comparative studies have shown that a diverse range of mechanisms are responsible for elongation of the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gomez et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bénazéraf et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Steventon et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mongera et al. (2018)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Michaut et al. (2022)</xref>). Importantly, the elongation dynamics of the PSM are thought to control the total duration of somitogenesis which terminates once the PSM becomes sufficiently short in the AP direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gomez et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gomez and Pourquié (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Steventon et al. (2016)</xref>). Therefore, the total number of segments formed in the developing vertebrate is thought to be the product of both the dynamics of the clock (which controls the rate of somite formation), and the morphogenesis of the PSM, via its control on the total duration of somitogenesis.</p>
<p>Developmental modularity is a property of two or more developmental processes where their uncoupling in space or time permits their evolution independently of one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Raff (1996)</xref>). This property is thought to give rise to increased phenotypic diversity by enhancing the evolvability of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Raff (1996)</xref>). In species examined thus far, such as the Corn Snake <italic>Pantherophis guttatus</italic>, it appears that the evolution of segment number is driven by changes in both the dynamics of the clock and the elongation of the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gomez et al. (2008)</xref>), and it is possible that independent evolution of these two processes is responsible for the high degree of diversity observed in vertebrate segment number. However, it is not obvious whether the two processes are modular, and if so, to what degree. Perturbing the clock’s periodicity and function does not appear to affect elongation of the body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schröter and Oates (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Forero et al. (2018)</xref>), so morphogenesis of the PSM is likely to be robust to changes in the segmentation clock through evolution. However, it is possible that many of the cellular- and tissue-level processes which drive PSM elongation could exert an effect on the dynamics of the clock.</p>
<p>For instance, cell rearrangements thought to drive elongation of the PSM in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lawton et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mongera et al. (2018)</xref>), and in chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bénazéraf et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Michaut et al. (2022)</xref>), promote synchronisation of the segmentation clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Uriu et al. (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">2013</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Uriu and Morelli (2014)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Uriu et al. (2017)</xref>). Additionally arrest of transcription during chromatin condensation is known to cause PSM cells to lag their clock expression relative to neighbours after cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Horikawa et al. (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Delaune et al. (2012)</xref>), causing defects in clock synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Murray et al. (2013)</xref>) and suggesting clock synchrony may depend on the degree of proliferative growth in the PSM. The ingression of PSM progenitor cells from dorso-posterior and lateral donor tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kanki and Ho (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Steventon et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Xiong et al. (2020)</xref>) can also create clock asynchrony, as incoming progenitor cells do not appear to show clock gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Mara et al. (2007)</xref>) and thus may be asynchronous with their neighbours when they enter the PSM. Finally, tissue convergence movements associated with the elongation of the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>) have been proposed to negate the effect of random cell mixing and be deleterious for clock synchronisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Uriu and Morelli (2014)</xref>). It is thus non-trivial to determine whether the duration and rate of somitogenesis are modular since, in order to do so, one must examine the effect of varying morphogenesis on the dynamics of the clock.</p>
<p>To do this, we use a computational approach to simulate clock dynamics and cell movements within the PSM, and study how the clock responds to changes in morphogenesis. We use this approach as it is much quicker and more flexible than experimentally manipulating morphogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic>. As we are constrained by computational complexity and cannot simulate all possible means by which the PSM can elongate (this would require simulation of the growth and dynamics of cells in surrounding tissues which exert forces on the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Xiong et al. (2020)</xref>)), we limit our study to simulating regimes of cell movement and growth within the PSM that are known to be associated with, or causal in, PSM growth and elongation across vertebrates.</p>
<p>We use a previously established three-dimensional model of cell movements and clock dynamics within the zebrafish PSM (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Uriu et al. (2021)</xref>), and adapt this model to simulate various regimes of cell movement and growth. Briefly (a more detailed description of the model can be found in the methods), the model assumes the PSM is in an inertial frame of reference, with elongation being encoded by the advection of cells towards the anterior PSM (the anterior limit of which is denoted <italic>x</italic> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). Besides advection, cells are subject to random cell mixing, cell-cell repulsion, and a boundary force confining the cells within a hollow horseshoe-shaped domain. This model uses a phase-oscillator approach to describe segmentation clock dynamics and each cell is assigned a clock phase which is frozen when the cell exits the PSM at <italic>x</italic> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>, crossing the wavefront and patterning a segment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1A</xref>). To replenish cells lost at the anterior, new cells are added with random phase and position to keep the tissue at a constant density (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>This model is appealing for several reasons, the first being that the model is three-dimensional and so can quantitatively recapture the rates of cell mixing that we observe within the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Uriu et al. (2017)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2021</xref>). The second is that the segmentation clock is described by an abstract phase-oscillator, broadly agnostic to the molecular details which are known to vary between vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Krol et al. (2011)</xref>). Finally, the model makes extensive use of experimentally-derived parameters for cell movements, tissue dimension, and the phase-oscillator model of the clock in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Uriu et al. (2021)</xref>). This allows us to make quantitative predictions as to how the zebrafish segmentation clock would react to changes in PSM morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Using this model we test the clock’s response to changes in the position of cell ingression into the PSM, changes in the anterior-posterior profile of random cell motility, changes in the length and density of the PSM, and to mitosis. We find that the clock’s synchrony and frequency are robust to these changes except when mitosis is introduced, where we find that synchrony is negatively impacted except where mitosis is confined to the posterior PSM. We find that this robustness is underpinned by the tissue length and cell density in the model, as well as the rate of cell mixing and strength of clock phase coupling. Together, these results suggest that segmentation clock dynamics and PSM morphogenesis are modular components of somitogenesis that can evolve independently from one another, conferring evolvability and helping to explain the diversity in segment number across the vertebrates.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Varying the position of cell ingression has minimal effect on clock dynamics</title>
<p>During somitogenesis new cells enter the PSM posteriorly via ingression from dorsal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kanki and Ho (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banavar et al. (2021)</xref>). In the early stages of zebrafish somitogenesis, there is also a contribution of cells from lateral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Steventon et al. (2016)</xref>). As ingressing cells do not appear to express segmentation clock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Mara et al. (2007)</xref>), the position at which cells ingress into the PSM can create challenges for clock patterning, as only in the ‘off’ phase of the clock will ingressing cells be synchronous with their neighbours. Therefore continuous ingression of PSM progenitor cells is likely to create local asynchrony of oscillations where it occurs, and so varying the position of cell ingression may have an effect on clock dynamics at the wavefront.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we alter how cells are added to the tissue in the model. To model the ingression of cells from dorsal tissues into the posterior tailbud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kanki and Ho (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banavar et al. (2021)</xref>), we define a density-dependent cell addition process where cells are added onto the dorsal surface of the posterior half-toroid domain (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figures 2A 8</xref>) if the average density in this domain falls below <italic>ρ</italic><sub>0</sub>, with a constant initial phase <italic>θ</italic> = 0. To maintain equal density across the PSM, we found it necessary to add cells in the two cylindrical PSM domains as well, as when cells were only added to the posterior half-toroid domain we observed a loss in density in the two cylindrical domains (data not shown). To avoid bias we add cells at random positions if the average density falls below <italic>ρ</italic><sub>0</sub>. These cells are initialised with a random phase drawn from the uniform distribution [0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref><italic>π</italic>). To model the early stages of zebrafish somitogenesis where, concurrent with dorso-posterior ingression of cells, the PSM also experiences a contribution of cells from lateral tissues, we modify the above simulation so that cell density in the lateral cylindrical domains is maintained by addition of cells with constant phase (<italic>θ</italic> = 0) on the ventral surface of these two lateral domains (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figures 2A</xref> 8). These two ingression scenarios are termed ‘Dorso-Posterior’ (‘DP’) and ‘Dorso-Posterior + Lateral-Ventral’ (‘DP+LV’) ingression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>), respectively, and for brevity we refer to them as ‘DP’ and ‘DP+LV’ in the rest of the text. We compare the effect of these scenarios of cell ingression with ‘Random’ ingression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>), where cell density is maintained by addition of cells at random positions within the tissue with random phase (<italic>θ</italic> ∈ [0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref><italic>π</italic>)).</p>

<p>We test these scenarios by initialising each simulation with a synchronous initial condition for the clock and simulating cell movements and clock dynamics in the presence of each cell ingression scenario for 1000 mins (see methods for further justification). After 1000 mins we measure the synchrony (<italic>r</italic>) and mean frequency (d<italic>θ</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>) of a cylindrical region of tissue at the left-hand PSM anterior, one cell diameter (<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>) in length (see methods). We restrict our measurement to the PSM anterior as it is here that the clock patterns somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Simsek and Özbudak (2018)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Simsek et al. (2023)</xref>), and thus dynamics elsewhere in the tissue are unlikely to present a phenotype in the animal. Using this method, we find that DP ingression has no effect on synchrony at the PSM anterior after 1000 mins when compared to Random ingression, but that DP+LV ingression creates a minor decrease in anterior synchrony (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2B</xref>). However, in neither scenario is the anterior frequency changed when compared to Random ingression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2C</xref>). Kymographs of synchrony along the anterior-posterior axis reveal that cell addition onto the tissue surface creates asynchronous populations of cells that travel towards the tissue anterior with cell advection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2D</xref>, black arrowheads). These are more frequent than in the DP case, likely explaining the lower anterior synchrony observed in the DP+LV simulations.</p>

<title>The clock is robust to changes in mode of cell ingression regardless of the cell motility profile</title>
<p>As cell mixing promotes clock synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Uriu et al. (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Uriu and Morelli (2014)</xref>), and an anterior-posterior profile of increasing cell mixing is present in the PSM of zebrafish and chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kanki and Ho (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bénazéraf et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lawton et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mongera et al. (2018)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Michaut et al. (2022)</xref>) (and presumably most vertebrate taxa), we speculated that the shape of this gradient may confer robustness to clock dynamics against cell ingression. For instance, a steep profile (e.g. as reported from the early somitogenesis stages of zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mongera et al. (2018)</xref>)) might confer robustness to lateral ingression as mixing is higher along a greater length of the PSM than a more graded profile (e.g. as reported from chicken embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bénazéraf et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Michaut et al. (2022)</xref>)). Therefore the shape of the cell motility profile in the PSM may constrain the evolution of cell ingression position, and vice versa.</p>
<p>To test this, we systematically enumerated the steepness (<italic>h</italic>) and inflexion point (<italic>X</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub>) of the function <italic>v</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>x</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3B</xref>), which controls the speed of random cell movement in the PSM (see methods, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3A</xref>). For each parameter pair we performed <italic>N</italic> = 100 simulations and recorded the median anterior synchrony and median anterior mean frequency (d<italic>θ</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>, see methods) after 1000 mins. The results for each ingression scenario are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>. We find no trend in median anterior synchrony and frequency across different parameter pairs for Random ingression, DP ingression, or DP+LV ingression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>). Similar to before, results for DP ingression are indistinguishable from Random ingression. For DP+LV ingression, anterior synchrony is lower across all parameter sets than DP ingression or Random ingression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3C</xref>) but the effect is still very minor in this case. We therefore predict that, at least with respect to effects on the zebrafish segmentation clock, the evolution of the motility profile and the position of cell ingression are not constrained by one another.</p>

<title>Length and density of the PSM confer robustness to the clock</title>
<p>The PSM is a transient tissue that shrinks in length over time. While this feature is conserved across vertebrate species, the absolute length and rate of shrinkage are known to vary between taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gomez et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Steventon et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>). We postulate that PSM length is an important factor in determining the clock’s response to different morphogenetic modes; for example, intuitively cells will have more time to synchronise oscillations with their neighbours before reaching the PSM anterior in a longer PSM, or if cell ingression is spread out along a longer tissue the degree of asynchrony imparted by ingression will be lessened. Similarly, we predict that the density of the tissue confers robustness to clock dynamics as increasing the average number of neighbours for each cell may act to ‘correct’ against clock noise. Overall, tissue density has been observed to increase over time in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>), and has been observed to vary in space in chicken, with density decreasing towards the PSM posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bénazéraf et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Michaut et al. (2022)</xref>).</p>
<p>We thus sought to explore whether the length and density of the PSM confer robustness to changing morphogenesis. We test this by co-varying the position of cell ingression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref>) with either tissue density or length. When varying the average tissue density <italic>ρ</italic><sub>0</sub> and studying model dynamics after 1000 mins we see that increasing cell density marginally increases anterior synchrony (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>), and decreases the variability in frequency at the PSM anterior (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4C</xref>). However the increase in density does not appear to be sufficient to ‘correct’ the decrease in synchrony in the DP+LV case (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B</xref>). Increasing the length of the tissue does however appear to ‘correct’ this decrease (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4E</xref>). Here the PSM length <italic>L</italic> is increased but the anterior limit of cell addition <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> is held constant at <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 100 µm. Anterior synchrony after 1000 mins positively correlates with <italic>L</italic>, and decreasing <italic>L</italic> reveals a decrease in anterior synchrony for DP ingression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4E</xref>). No obvious trend for mean anterior frequency is observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4F</xref>). Note that the results for the DP and DP+LV cases are exactly equal for <italic>L</italic> = 185 µm, as for <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = 100 µm cell addition is confined to the dorsal-posterior domain and the two ingression methods are numerically equivalent in the model (see methods). While much of this recovery in synchrony may be due to cell addition occurring along a longer domain (and in so doing ‘diluting’ the effect of cell ingression), we observe similar results when cell addition can only occur along a fixed length of the tissue and the total length of the tissue varies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref> supplementary figure 1). Here, the anterior limit of cell addition <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> is fixed in relation to the length of the PSM, by <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> = <italic>L</italic> − <italic>R</italic> − <italic>r</italic> − 100 (where <italic>R</italic> represents the major radius of the half-toroid domain and <italic>r</italic> the radius of the PSM tube, see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">figure 8</xref>), and we observe a recovery in synchrony across all three cell ingression scenarios as the total length of the tissue increases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref> supplementary figure 1).</p>

<p>However in zebrafish density and length are known to co-vary after the 16-somite stage (ss), with the PSM increasing in density as it shrinks in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>). We would expect decreasing the length of the PSM to decrease the clock’s robustness to noise, but it is possible that the concurrent increase in density is sufficient to counteract this and preserve clock dynamics. As the dynamics of somitogenesis are consistent across individuals at these late stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Schröter et al. (2008)</xref>), the dynamics of the zebrafish segmentation clock are likely unaffected by compaction-extension of the PSM. It is not clear however if this can be explained by the concurrent changes in PSM length and density that occur during compaction-extension or if clock properties such as phase-coupling need to vary in order to maintain robust clock dynamics.</p>
<p>Here we simulate compaction-extension by shrinking the PSM radius <italic>r</italic> and length <italic>L</italic>, while increasing its density <italic>ρ</italic>, over time, using published rates and initial conditions for these values (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5A-B</xref>, methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al.

<p>As these changes are dynamic, we depart from previous methodology for measuring clock dynamics and plot the anterior synchrony and frequency over time for N=100 simulations. For small PSM lengths and widths the model generates voids in the tissue as cells do not exit the toroid domain at a sufficient rate to maintain tissue homogeneity, which we deem to be biologically inaccurate. To exclude such cases we only plot synchrony and frequency up until the time at which one of the N=100 replicate simulations encounters such a gap. Thus it is important to note that the simulations presented here do not cover the whole timespan of zebrafish somitogenesis, and we cannot examine dynamics towards the end of the process.</p>
<p>The anterior synchrony and mean anterior frequency over time for N = 100 simulations of compaction-extension are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figures 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>, respectively. They are compared with simulations that do not shrink the PSM and maintain constant <italic>L, r, d</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, and <italic>ρ</italic>. We find that towards the end of these simulations the clock experiences more noise and fluctuations in synchrony and frequency (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5C-D</xref>) than the non-shrinking equivalent simulations, however for the majority of the simulation the dynamics of the compacting tissue are broadly comparable with those of the non-compacting tissue, but with synchrony minorly decreasing and frequency becoming noisier towards the end of the simulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5C-D</xref>). We treat the effects observed towards the end of the simulation with caution in light of the irregularities in tissue structure mentioned above. In addition, other model parameters that are fixed throughout the simulation, such as advection velocity or intrinsic frequency, are thought to change towards the end of somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Schröter et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Uriu et al. (2021)</xref>), and therefore for the latter stages of somito-genesis the results of our simulations may be inaccurate. However, data for the final stages of zebrafish somitogenesis is extremely limited and we cannot make estimates for model parameters at this stage. Therefore we conclude that for much of somitogenesis in zebrafish the clock is not majorly impacted by the compaction-extension of the tissue, but that there may be effects at the terminal stages of somitogenesis undetected by this model.</p>
<p>Beyond dynamic changes in density, we also attempted to encode a spatial gradient of decreasing cell density towards the posterior, as reported from chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bénazéraf et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Michaut et al. (2022)</xref>). However, we could not generate a gradient that quantitatively recaptures that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bénazéraf et al. (2010)</xref> (data not shown). Based on our results for changing average cell density <italic>ρ</italic><sub>0</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4B-C</xref>) it is highly probable that this gradient would affect clock dynamics. We suggest that another model, such as one encoding cell-cell adhesion, may be a more powerful tool for exploring the effect of this gradient, and dynamics at the terminal stages of somitogenesis.</p>

<title>Clock arrest during cell division creates asynchrony</title>
<p>During M phase of the cell cycle, segmentation clock gene expression in zebrafish is known to arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Horikawa et al. (2006)</xref>), causing a lag in nascent daughter cells relative to their neighbours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Delaune et al. (2012)</xref>). If cell divisions are asynchronous, as appears to be the case in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kanki and Ho (1997)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Steventon et al. (2016)</xref>), then such lags can create asynchrony of oscillations in the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Murray et al. (2013)</xref>).</p>
<p>As previous models of mitosis and the segmentation clock have been two-dimensional and therefore may not quantitatively recapture the cell mixing and geometry present in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Murray et al. (2013)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2019</xref>), we sought to investigate the effect of mitosis in the presence of the more accurate three-dimensional geometry and cell mixing. To do so, we simulated cell division by assigning each cell a cell cycle phase <italic>τ</italic> that increases at a constant rate of 1 min<sup>−1</sup>, and spawning a new cell adjacent to that cell once that its <italic>τ</italic> ≥ <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> + <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>, where <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> denotes the total time in minutes to complete G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle, and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> denotes the time spent in M phase, in minutes. Once a daughter cell is generated, the <italic>τ</italic> for both cells is reset to zero. As daughter cells share the same clock phase after division <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Delaune et al. (2012)</xref>), the daughter cell shares the same clock phase <italic>θ</italic> as its sibling. To simulate the arrest of the clock during M phase, if <italic>τ</italic> ∈ [<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> + <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>) oscillations cease, i.e. d<italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>/d<italic>t</italic> = 0. For further details, we refer the reader to the methods section below.</p>
<p>To avoid measuring trivial changes in frequency and synchrony due to arrest of the clock, we measure synchrony and frequency of the clock only in cells where <italic>τ</italic> &lt; <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub>. Therefore our results represent a lower bound on the effect of mitosis on the clock. Using the estimated values of <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> for zebrafish (see methods for calculation), we find that the presence of cell division creates asynchrony as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Murray et al.

<p>In previous simulations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6</xref>), cell division occurs up to the wavefront where segments are pre-patterned (<italic>x</italic> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>). However if division is confined to the posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bouldin et al. (2014)</xref>) cells may have time to re-synchronise before reaching the wavefront. To test whether this is possible within the timescales of zebrafish cell movement, division, and clock dynamics, we define a point in space <italic>x</italic> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> + <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub> anterior to which (i.e. for <italic>x</italic> &lt; <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> +<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub>) we halt cell cycle progression by fixing <italic>τ</italic> = 0 mins in all cells. Performing simulations with <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub> = 25µm, 175µm, 325µm, we see that while for <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub> = 25µm we observe defects in synchrony, for <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub> = 175µm, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub> = 325µm, synchrony is rescued (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6D</xref>). This suggests that there exists some point along the PSM’s AP axis posterior to which cell division can occur without affecting the anterior dynamics of the clock. To try and resolve the value of this point and how it depends on the length of M-phase <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>, we systematically enumerated values of <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub> from the tissue anterior to the tissue posterior, and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> across the values tested in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6E</xref>. We find that for <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> &lt; 15 mins division can occur up to the tissue anterior without a major defect in synchrony (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6</xref> supp 2A). For <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> &gt; 15 mins simulations with division show high synchrony at the anterior although not so high as those with <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> &lt; 15 mins, where the value of <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub> such that clock synchrony is preserved is displaced to the posterior (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6</xref> supp 2A). However, only for <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> = 15 mins is this value majorly displaced to the posterior, with <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub> ≈ 150µm being the anterior-most value of <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>div</italic></sub> such that synchrony is preserved (<italic>r</italic> ≈ 1) (figure supp 2A). This result is perhaps intuitive, as the parameters in the model set the clock period to 2<italic>π</italic>/<italic>ω</italic><sub>0</sub> = 30 mins, and a clock arrest lasting <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> = 15 mins would be sufficient to move a cell into antiphase relative to its neighbours. Indeed we see that mitosis is most deleterious to synchrony when M-phase lasts approximately half the length of a clock cycle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6</xref> supp 2B), however for long clock cycles this relationship becomes nonlinear and the most deleterious values of <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> lie between the length of one or two clock cycles (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6</xref> supp 2B).</p>

<title>Zebrafish clock coupling and cell mixing confers robustness to changes in cell ingression</title>
<p>Across many of the morphogenetic scenarios tested here, we have observed a high degree of robustness in clock dynamics with respect to changing cell movements and processes. As shown above, some of this robustness can be attributed to the choice of tissue length <italic>L</italic> in simulations, and choices of the parameters <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> governing the advection velocity of cells. However we also expect that the rate of cell mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Uriu et al. (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">2017)</xref>), and the strength of clock coupling, confer robustness too. Within the present model, the global rate of cell mixing is controlled by the parameter <italic>υ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> and the clock coupling strength is denoted by <italic>k</italic>. Notably, the values taken for these parameters have been experimentally measured in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Riedel-Kruse et al. (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Herrgen et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Uriu et al. (2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2021)</xref>). Therefore we were interested in where these parameters lie within the space of parameter pairs that generate clock dynamics robust to changes in morphogenesis - do these results reflect something unique about the zebrafish parameters or can many (<italic>κ, υ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) pairs confer robustness?</p>
<p>To determine this, we take changing cell ingression as an example of varying morphogenesis and for each ingression scenario, systematically enumerate the parameters <italic>υ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> and <italic>k</italic>, studying the anterior synchrony after 1000 mins with N=100 replicates per parameter pair. This reveals a threshold curve of (<italic>κ, υ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) pairs below which the clock begins to exhibit asynchrony (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">figure 7</xref>). Comparing across the three scenarios of cell ingression we see that the position of this curve changes with the cell ingression scenario (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">figure 7</xref>), indicating that the space of (<italic>k, v</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) pairs that achieve clock synchrony is constrained by the cell ingression mode present within the tissue. Notably the experimentally-derived parameter pair (<italic>κ
</italic> = 0.07 min<sup>−1</sup>, <italic>υ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = 1 µm · min<sup>−1</sup>) lies very close to the threshold for the DP+LV case of cell ingression in the <italic>k</italic> direction, suggesting that the robustness we have observed in response to changes in cell ingression is sensitive to the choice of <italic>κ</italic>. However in each case our experimental choices for <italic>κ</italic> and <italic>υ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> lie above the threshold, implying that at least part of the robustness we observed with respect to cell ingression is due to the experimental values for zebrafish being sufficient to confer this robustness.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we investigated whether morphogenesis of the PSM and the segmentation clock exhibit developmental modularity, as this could explain the high degree of evolvability observed in vertebrate segment number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Raff (1996)</xref>). We tested a broad range of PSM cellular behaviours and mechanisms that are associated with the elongation of the PSM across vertebrate species, to see if they had an effect on the dynamics of the segmentation clock. We predict that the dynamics of the zebrafish segmentation clock, specifically synchrony and frequency, are generally robust to changes in these mechanisms such as cell ingression, motility, and (under certain conditions) division. As PSM morphogenesis is independent of the clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Schröter et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Forero et al. (2018)</xref>, our results suggest that the clock and morphogenesis of the PSM exhibit developmental modularity.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that a major determinant of this robustness is the clock coupling <italic>κ</italic>, which in zebrafish appears to be sufficiently strong to confer robustness to changes in cell ingression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">figure 7</xref>). While synchrony of the clock shows a dependence on cell mixing rate (<italic>υ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) and tissue length (<italic>L</italic>), the dependence of synchrony on these parameters is weak compared to its dependence on coupling strength (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">figure 7</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref> supp 1), suggesting that this robustness may be more dependent on properties of the segmentation clock than those of the tissue. Due to a lack of quantitative understanding of PSM morphogenesis, it is difficult to predict whether the requirements for robustness imposed on cell mixing or tissue length and density constrain the space of possible morphogenetic processes that can be altered without perturbing the clock. However, our results highlight that these requirements are themselves constrained by the strength of clock phase-coupling, so it is equally possible that vertebrate segmentation clocks have sufficiently strong phase-coupling generally, and these requirements on morphogenesis are sufficiently relaxed to not constrain the evolution of PSM elongation. Further work, investigating the evolution of phase-coupling strength in vertebrates, and developing accurate quantitative models of PSM morphogenesis, will be necessary to determine this.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that while in the model formulation <italic>κ</italic> represents the strength of delta-notch signalling between cells, the experimental value for this parameter is measured at a tissue level, incorporating coupling effects from other pathways e.g. cell mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Riedel-Kruse et al. (2007)</xref>). It is therefore possible that our choice of <italic>κ</italic> represents an over-estimate of the strength of delta-notch signalling and, when we combine this with cell mixing in the model, our results present an over-estimate of robustness. However, the precise value of <italic>r</italic> at which a somite is correctly patterned is unknown, and indeed there exist processes independent of the segmentation clock that can act to correct against inaccuracies in somite length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Naganathan et al. (2022)</xref>), so it is plausible that somitogenesis may be more tolerant of clock asynchrony than we suppose here and that somites are correctly patterned for <italic>r</italic> &lt; 1. As our results appear less sensitive to cell mixing (<italic>υ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) than <italic>κ</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">figure 7</xref>), we suggest that the contribution of cell mixing to an experimental estimate of <italic>κ</italic> may be minor. Therefore, combined with a tolerance of somitogenesis for values of <italic>r</italic> &lt; 1, we suggest that our findings are robust to any overestimates of <italic>κ</italic> incorporating cell mixing.</p>
<p>Our analysis is restricted to the modes of PSM morphogenesis that are known to occur in vertebrates, and we cannot rule out the possibility that the robustness we observe merely reflects evolution of mechanisms of PSM elongation under selective pressure to minimise their effect on the clock, and that the clock may not be robust to all possible modes of PSM elongation. Nevertheless, we argue that our results demonstrate there exists a qualitatively distinct set of processes (cell ingression, division, motility, and compaction-extension) that underpin PSM elongation and do not affect clock dynamics. As vertebrate species appear to employ a combination of these processes to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bénazéraf et al. (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Steventon et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mongera et al. (2018)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Xiong et al. (2020)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>), it is possible that evolution alters each of these processes independently to generate diversity in the elongation dynamics of the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gomez et al. (2008)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Steventon et al. (2016)</xref>). Therefore this relatively small set of processes may be sufficient to explain the high degree of evolvability in vertebrate segment number.</p>
<p>As clock dynamics appear to be robust to changes in morphogenesis, we suggest that the clock and morphogenesis of the PSM comprise two developmental modules within zebrafish, and that this is true more generally whenever the phase coupling of the clock is sufficiently strong, cell mixing sufficiently rapid, or the PSM sufficiently dense and long. We suggest that this may have contributed to the evolution of broad diversity in vertebrate segment number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Richardson et al. (1998)</xref>, and be a present source of evolvability in vertebrates. We note that the evolution of modularity is an active area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wagner and Altenberg (1996)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Wagner et al. (2007)</xref>), and suggest that studying the evolution of delta-notch signalling in vertebrates, and the evolutionary origin of the PSM and somitogenesis, may be an illuminating model paradigm for this field. We predict that the modularity of the clock and morphogenesis of the PSM permits a synergy between these two processes that heightens the evolvability of segment number in vertebrates, and that this may be responsible for the high diversity we observe in this trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Richardson et al. (1998)</xref>).</p>

<title>Computational model of the segmentation clock and PSM</title>
<p>To simulate the movements of cells within the PSM and the dynamics of the segmentation clock, we used the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Uriu et al. (2021)</xref>, who sought to explain defective somite patterning after loss of Notch-Delta signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Uriu et al. (2021)</xref>). Here an abstract phase oscillator Kuramoto model is used to describe intracellular clock oscillations and cell-cell phase coupling. Cells are confined within a three-dimensional tissue domain whose geometry approximates that of the PSM.</p>
<p>This model is suitable for our purposes because it provides a three-dimensional model of cell movements within the PSM, allowing us to alter morphogenesis in order to test hypotheses. Additionally, as the segmentation clock here is described as an abstract phase oscillator, the model has broad applicability to different vertebrate species which are known to differ in the structure and regulation of their segmentation clock gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Krol et al. (2011)</xref>). Finally, the validity of the model has been shown in several ways via comparison with data for zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Webb et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Liao et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Uriu et al.

<title>Cell addition</title>
<p>As cells are removed from the tissue by advection, new cells must be added to replenish the PSM. Loss of cells is monitored by comparing the total density of cells in each of the subdomains with a target density, <italic>ρ</italic><sub>0</sub>. If the density in any of these subdomains falls below <italic>ρ</italic><sub>0</sub>, a new cell is added to that domain. If the density of more than one of the domains falls below <italic>ρ</italic><sub>0</sub> then a cell is only added to the subdomain with the lowest density. The position and phase of the nascent cell both vary across different simulations discussed here. Below is a description of how these quantities vary.</p>
<p>In simulations where cell addition is ‘Random’, cells are added with a random position within each domain, with a random phase, i.e. if a cell is added within one of the cylindrical domains, it is given a random <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ [<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> + <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>, <italic>X</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>], a random <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ [0, <italic>r</italic>], and <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ [0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref><italic>π</italic>). Alternatively, if the cell is added within the half-toroid domain, it is given a random <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ [−<italic>π</italic>/2, <italic>π</italic>/2], and random <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, defined as above. The cell is also assigned a random phase <italic>θ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ [0, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref><italic>π</italic>). This method of cell addition is unbiased in terms of its effect on the model but is a biologically implausible scenario of cell ingression, so we use it here as a negative control.</p>
<p>In simulations where we seek to more accurately model cell ingression, cells are added on the cell surface, i.e. <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = <italic>r</italic>. Additionally, the surface domain on which cells can be added is restricted. For the half-toroid domain, we restrict cell addition to the dorsal quarter of the domain, i.e. <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ [<italic>π</italic>/4, 3<italic>π</italic>/4], <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ [−<italic>π</italic>/2, <italic>π</italic>/2]. For the cylindrical domains we restrict addition to the bottom quarter of the surface, i.e. <italic>q</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ∈ [5<italic>π</italic>/4, 7<italic>π</italic>/4]. To more accurately model conditions of cell ingression combinations of these three modes of cell addition are employed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>).</p>
<p>In newly added cells the direction vector <bold>n</bold> is initialised with a random vector of unit length. For simulations where cell division is present, cells are added with a random cell cycle phase <italic>τ</italic> ∈ 0, <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>G</italic></sub> + <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>.</p>

<title>Modelling compaction-extension</title>
<p>To model the compaction-extension of the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>), we shrink the PSM radius <italic>r</italic>, and length <italic>L</italic> over time, concurrent with an increase in density <italic>ρ</italic><sub>0</sub> and a step-wise decrease in cell diameter <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> (see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>). This is derived from the observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref> who observed changes in the PSM height, width, length, density, and cell diameter, during the latter stages of zebrafish somitogenesis. We sought to model this process using the rates of change in these parameters described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>, however as their published rates are in units of change per somite stage, and the rate of somitogenesis is nonlinear in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Schröter et al. (2008)</xref>), we needed an interpolation of somite number over time in order to describe the according change in rate over time.</p>
<p>To this, we extracted the data for somite number over time from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Schröter et al. (2008)</xref> using the web app WebPlotDigitizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rohatgi (2022)</xref>), and fitted a function of the form
<disp-formula id="eqn22">
<graphic xlink:href="574679v2_eqn22.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
for unknown parameters <italic>a, b</italic>, using the Julia package LsqFit.jl. We obtained values of <italic>a</italic> = 0.5001 and <italic>b</italic> = 0.0049 using this process. Using this interpolation of somite number over time, we then could change the tissue radius, length, cell diameter, and density, using the values published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>. As this only occurs in the latter stages of somitogenesis (measured only from 16ss onwards), we hold these variables constant before the time at which 16 somites are formed in zebrafish.</p>
<p>The equations describing change in tissue length (<italic>L</italic>), wavefront position (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>), and anterior limit of cell addition therefore become:

where <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> denotes the rate at which the PSM shrinks in radius, and <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> the initial value for <italic>r</italic> before shrinking. In their work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref> reported that the PSM shrinks in height more rapidly at the PSM posterior than at the anterior, however the rate of shrinkage of the PSM in width (along the medio-lateral axis) was the same across the anterior and posterior halves of the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al. (2021)</xref>). As our model assumes the tissue is as wide as it is tall, we take only the rate of shrinkage in the medio-lateral axis in our value for <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub>, and calculate <italic>m</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> by taking the mean of the two (similar) rates published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomson et al.

<title>Analysis and metrics</title>
<p>Here we measure clock dynamics using two metrics. The first is the synchrony of the segmentation clock across cells, denoted <italic>r</italic>, calculated by
<disp-formula id="eqn30">
<graphic xlink:href="574679v2_eqn30.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
which is sometimes referred to as the Kuramoto phase order parameter. When <italic>r</italic> ≈ 0, oscillations are asynchronous, and when <italic>r</italic> ≈ 1, oscillations are synchronous.</p>
<p>The second metric is the average (mean) frequency of cells in a given domain, where the frequency d<italic>θ</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> is simply the value of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn17">equation 17</xref>. In cases where we are interested in changes in frequency upon varying model parameters, we find it convenient to define
<disp-formula id="eqn31">
<graphic xlink:href="574679v2_eqn31.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
in order to highlight changes in frequency.</p>
<p>In order to analyse the output of a simulation in terms of one value, for many analyses we calculate <italic>r</italic>, d<italic>θ</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>, or Δd<italic>θ</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>, for the cells within one cell’s diameter of the anterior (i.e. <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> ≤ <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> ≤ <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> +<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>). We do this because at the wavefront oscillations arrest and pre-pattern somites, and therefore the frequency and synchrony of oscillations immediately adjacent to the PSM anterior will determine the somite length and precision of pre-patterning. We thus regard the values of <italic>r</italic>, d<italic>θ</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>, and Δd<italic>θ</italic>/d<italic>t</italic> as proxies for phenotype exhibited by the simulation. As discussed above, unless stated otherwise we measure clock dynamics after 1000 mins, as we find this sufficient to ensure that the dynamics of the clock have reached a steady state that we deem would be reached in vivo (see <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Hammond et al. study robustness of the vertebrate segmentation clock against morphogenetic processes such as cell ingression, cell movement and cell division to ask whether the segmentation clock and morphogenesis are modular or not. The modularity of these two would be important for evolvability of the segmenting system. The authors adopt a previously proposed 3D model of the presomitic mesoderm (Uriu et al. 2021 eLife) and include new elements; different types of cell ingression, tissue compaction and cell cycles. Based on the results of numerical simulations that synchrony of the segmentation clock is robust, the authors conclude that there is a modularity in the segmentation clock and morphogenetic processes.</p>
<p>The presented results support the conclusion. The manuscript is clearly written.</p>
<p>Major comments from the original round of review:</p>
<p>[Optional] In both the current model and Uriu et al. 2021, coupling delay in phase oscillator model is not considered. Given that several previous studies (e.g. Lewis 2003, Herrgen et al. 2010, Yoshioka-Kobayashi et al. 2020) suggested the presence of coupling delays in Delta-Notch signaling, could the authors analyze the effect of coupling delay on robustness of the segmentation clock against morphogenetic processes?</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>Synchronization of the segmentation clock has been studied by mathematical modeling, but most previous studies considered cells in a static tissue without morphogenesis. In the previous study by Uriu et al. 2021, morphogenetic processes such as cell advection due to tissue elongation, tissue shortening, and cell mobility were considered in synchronization. The current manuscript provides methodological advances in this aspect by newly including cell ingression, tissue compaction and cell cycle. In addition, the authors bring a concept of modularity and evolvability to the field of the vertebrate segmentation clock, which is new. On the other hand, the manuscript confirms that the synchronization of the segmentation clock is robust by careful simulations, but it does not propose or reveal new mechanisms for making it robust or modular. The main targets of the manuscript will be researchers working on somitogenesis and evolutionary biologists who are interested in evolution of developmental systems. The manuscript will also be interested by broader audiences, like developmental biologists, biophysicists, and physicists and computer scientists who are working on dynamical systems.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from Hammond et al., investigates the modularity of the segmentation clock and morphogenesis in early vertebrate development, focusing on how these processes might independently evolve to influence the diversity of segment numbers across vertebrates.</p>
<p>Methodology: The study uses a previously published computational model, parameterized for zebrafish, to simulate and analyse the interactions between the segmentation clock and the morphogenesis of the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM). Their model integrates cell advection, motility, compaction, cell division, and the synchronization of the embryo clock. Three alternative scenarios of PSM morphogenesis were modeled to examine how these changes affect the segmentation clock.</p>
<p>Model System: The computational model system combines a representation of cell movements and the phase oscillator dynamics of the segmentation clock within a three-dimensional horseshoe-shaped domain mimicking the geometry of the vertebrate embryo PSM. The parameters used for the mathematical model are mostly estimated from previously published experimental findings.</p>
<p>Key Findings and Conclusions: (1) The segmentation clock was found to be broadly robust against variations in morphogenetic processes such as cell ingression and motility; (2) Changes in the length of the PSM and the strength of phase coupling within the clock significantly influenced the system's robustness; (3) The authors conclude that the segmentation clock and PSM morphogenesis exhibited developmental modularity (i.e. relative independence), allowing these two phenomena to evolve independently, and therefore possibly contributing to the diverse segment numbers observed in vertebrates.</p>
<p>Major comments from the original round of review:</p>
<p>(1) The key conclusion drawn by the authors (that there is robustness, and therefore modularity, between the morphogenetic cellular processes modeled and the embryo clock synchronization) stems directly from the modeling results appropriately presented and discussed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>The model comprises some strong assumptions, however all have been clearly explained and the parameterization choices are supported by experimental findings, providing biological meaning to the model. Estimated parameters are well explained, and seem reasonable assumptions (from the embryology perspective).</p>
<p>(2) This study, as is, achieves its proposed goal of evaluating the potential robustness of the embryo clock to changes in (some) morphogenetic processes. The authors do not claim that the model used is complete, and they properly identify some limitations, including the lack of cell-cell interactions. Given the recognized importance of cellular physical interactions for successful embryo development, including them in the model would be a significant addition in future studies.</p>
<p>(3) The authors have deposited all the code used for analysis in a public GitHub repository that is updated and available for the research community.</p>
<p>(4) In page 6, the authors justify their choice of clock parameters for cells ingressing the PSM: &quot;As ingressing cells do not appear to express segmentation clock genes (Mara et al. (2007)), the position at which cells ingress into the PSM can create challenges for clock patterning, as only in the 'off' phase of the clock will ingressing cells be in-phase with their neighbors.&quot;</p>
<p>However, there are several lines of evidence (in chick and mouse), that some oscillatory clock genes are already being expressed as early as in the gastrulation phase (so prior to PSM ingression) (Feitas et al, 2001 [10.1242/dev.128.24.5139]; Jouve et al, 2002 [10.1242/dev.129.5.1107]; Maia-Fernandes at al, 2024 [10.1371/journal.pone.0297853]).</p>
<p>Question: Is this also true in zebrafish? (I.e. is there any recent experimental evidence that the clock genes are not expressed at ingression, since the paper cited to support this assumption is from 2007).</p>
<p>If they are expressed in zebrafish (as they are in mouse and chick), then the cell addition should have random clock gene periods when they enter the PSM and not start all with a constant initial phase of zero. Probably this will not impact the results since the cells will also be out of phase with their neighbors when they &quot;ingress&quot;, however, it will model more closely the biological scenario (and avoid such criticism).</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>GENERAL ASSESSMENT</p>
<p>This study uses a previously published model to simulate alternative scenarios of morphogenetic parameters to infer the potential independence (termed here modularity) between the segmentation clock and a set of morphogenetic processes, arguing that such modularity could allow the evolution of more flexible body plans, therefore partially explaining the variability in the number of segments observed in the vertebrates. This question is fundamental and relevant, yet still poorly researched. This work provides a comprehensive simulation with a model that tries to simplify the many morphogenetic processes described in the literature, reducing it to a few core fundamental processes that allow drawing the conclusions sought. It provides theoretical insight to support a conceptual advance in the field of evolutionary vertebrate embryology.</p>
<p>ADVANCE</p>
<p>This study builds on a model recently published by Uriu et al. (eLife, 2021) that incorporates quantitative experimental data within a modeling framework including cell and tissue-level parameters, allowing the study of multiscale phenomena active during zebrafish embryo segmentation. Uriu's publication reports many relevant and often non-intuitive insights uncovered by the model, most notably the description of phase vortices formed by the synchronizing genetic oscillators interfering with the traveling-wave front pattern.</p>
<p>However, this model can be further explored to ask additional questions beyond those described in the original paper. A good example is the present study, which uses this mathematical framework to investigate the potential independence between two of the modeled processes, thereby extracting extra knowledge from it. Accordingly, the present study represents a step forward in the direction of using relevant theoretical frameworks to quantitatively explore the landscape of complex molecular hypotheses in silico, and with it shed some light on fundamental open questions or inform the design of future experiments in the lab.</p>
<p>The study incorporates a wide range of existing literature on the developmental biology of vertebrates. It comprehensively cites prior work, such as the foundational studies by Cooke and Zeeman on the segmentation clock and the role of FGF signaling in PSM development as discussed by Gomez et al. The literature properly covers the breadth of knowledge in this field.</p>
<p>AUDIENCE</p>
<p>Target audience: This study is relevant for fundamental research in developmental biology, specifically targeting researchers who focus on early embryo development and morphogenesis from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. It is also relevant for evolutionary biologists investigating the genetic factors that influence vertebrate evolution, as well as to computational biologists and bioinformatics researchers studying developmental processes and embryology.</p>
<p>Developmental researchers studying the segmentation clock in other vertebrate model organisms (namely mouse and chick), will find this publication especially valuable since it provides insights that can help them formulate new hypotheses to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the clock (for example finding a set of evolutionarily divergent genes that might interfere with PSM length).</p>
<p>
Additionally, this study provides a set of cellular parameters that have yet to be measured in mouse and chick, therefore guiding the design of future experiments to measure them, allowing the simulation of the same model with sets of parameters from different vertebrate model organisms, therefore testing the robustness of the findings reported for zebrafish.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Verd and colleagues explored how various biologically relevant factors influence the robustness of clock dynamics synchronization among neighboring cells within the context of somatogenesis, adapting a mathematical model presented by Urio et. al in 2021 in a similar context. Specifically they show that clock dynamics is robust to different biological mechanisms such as cell infusion, cellular motility, compaction-extension and cell-division. On the other hand , the length of Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM) and density of cells in it has a significant role in the robustness of clock dynamics. While the manuscript is well-written and provides clear descriptions of methods and technical details, it tends to be somewhat lengthy.</p>
<p>Major comments from original round of review:</p>
<p>(1) The authors mention that &quot;...the model is three dimensional and so can quantitatively recapture the rates of cell mixing that we observe in the PSM&quot;. I am not convinced with this justification of using a 3D model. None of the effects the authors explore in this manuscript requires a three dimensional model or full physical description of the cellular mechanics such as excluded volume interaction etc. A one-dimensional model characterized by cell position along the arclength of PSM and somatic region and segmentation clock phase θ can incorporate all the physics authors described in this manuscript as well as significantly computationally cheap allowing the authors to explore the effect of different parameters in greater detail.</p>
<p>(2) I am not sure about the justification for limiting the quantification of phase synchrony in a very limited (one cell diameter wide) region at one end of the somatic part (Page 33 below Fig. 9). From my understanding of the manuscript, the segments appear in significant length anterior to this region. Wouldn't an ensemble average of multiple such one cell diameter wide regions in the somatic region be a more accurate metric for quantifying synchrony?</p>
<p>(3) While studying the effect of cellular ingression, the authors study three discrete modes-random, DP and DP+LV and show that in the DP+LV mode the clock synchrony becomes affected. I would like the authors to explore this in a continuous fashion from a pure DP ingression to Pure LV ingression and intermediates.</p>
<p>(4) While studying the effect of length and density of cells in PSM on cellular synchrony, the authors restrict to 3 values of density and 6 values of PSM length keeping the other parameter constant. I would be interested to see a phase diagram similar to Fig. 7 in the two dimensional parameter space of L and ρ0. I am curious if a scaling relation exists for the parameter values that partition the parameter space with and without synchrony.</p>
<p>(5) Both in the abstract and introduction, the authors discuss at a great length about the variability in the number of segments. I am curious how the number and width of the segments observed depend on different parameters related to cellular mechanics and the segmentation clock ?</p>
<p>(6) The authors assume that the phase dynamics of the chemical network may be described by an oscillator with constant frequency. For the completeness of the manuscript, the author should discuss in detail, for which chemical networks this is a good assumption.</p>
<p>(7) Figure 3 and the associated text shows no effect of the cellular motility profile in the synchrony of the segmentation clock. This may be moved to the supplementary considering the length of this manuscript.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>The manuscript answers some important questions in the synchrony of segmentation clock in the vertebrates utilizing a model published earlier. However, the presented result is incomplete in some aspects (points 2 to 5 of section A) and that could be overcome by a more detailed analysis using a simpler one dimensional (point 1 of section A). I believe this manuscript could be of interest to an intersecting audience of developmental biologists, systems biologists, and physicists/engineers interested in dynamical systems.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Hammond et al. study robustness of the vertebrate segmentation clock against morphogenetic processes such as cell ingression, cell movement and cell division to ask whether the segmentation clock and morphogenesis are modular or not. The modularity of these two would be important for evolvability of the segmenting system. The authors adopt a previously proposed 3D model of the presomitic mesoderm (Uriu et al. 2021 eLife) and include new elements; different types of cell ingression, tissue compaction and cell cycles. Based on the results of numerical simulations that synchrony of the segmentation clock is robust, the authors conclude that there is a modularity in the segmentation clock and morphogenetic processes. The presented results support the conclusion. The manuscript is clearly written. I have several comments that could help the authors further strengthen their arguments.</p>
<p>Major comment:</p>
<p>[Optional] In both the current model and Uriu et al. 2021, coupling delay in phase oscillator model is not considered. Given that several previous studies (e.g. Lewis 2003, Herrgen et al. 2010, Yoshioka-Kobayashi et al. 2020) suggested the presence of coupling delays in DeltaNotch signaling, could the authors analyze the effect of coupling delay on robustness of the segmentation clock against morphogenetic processes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Owing to the computational demands of including such a delay in the model, we cannot feasibly repeat every simulation analysed here in the presence of delay, and would like to note that the increased computational demand that delays put on the simulations is also the reason why Uriu et al 2021 did not include it, as stated in their published exchange with reviewers. However, analogous to our analysis in figure 7, we can analyse how varying the position of progenitor cell ingression affects synchrony in the presence of the coupling delay measured in zebrafish by Herrgen et al. (2010). We show this analysis in a new figure 8 (8B, specifically), on page 21, and discuss its implications in the text on pages 2022. Our analysis reveals that the model cannot recover synchrony using the default parameters used by Uriu et al. (2021) and reveal a much stronger dependence on the rate of cell mixing (vs) than shown in the instantaneous coupling case (cf. figure 7). However, by systematically varying the value of the delay we find that a relatively minor increase in the delay is sufficient to recover synchrony using the parameter set of Uriu et al. (see figure 8C). Repeating this across the three scenarios of cell ingression we see that the combination of coupling strength and delay determine the robustness of synchrony to varying position of cell ingression. This suggests that the combination of these two parameters constrain the evolution of morphogenesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>-  PSM radius and oscillation synchrony are both denoted by the same alphabet r. The authors should use different alphabets for these two to avoid confusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this. This has now been changed throughout to rT, as shorthand for ‘radius of tissue’.</p>

<p>-  Figure 3C: Description of black crosses in the panels is required in the figure legend.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for spotting this. The legend has now been corrected.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  Figure 3C another comment: In this panel, synchrony r at the anterior PSM is shown. It is true that synchrony at anterior PSM is most relevant for normal segment formation. However, in this case, the mobility profile is changed, so it may be appropriate to show how synchrony at mid and posterior PSM would depend on changes in mobility profile. Is synchrony improved by cell mobility at the region where cell ingression happens?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now plotted the synchrony along the AP axis for varying motility profiles, and this can be seen in figure 3 supplement 1, and is briefly discussed in the text on page 11. We show that while the synchrony varies with x-position (as already expected, see figure 2), there is no trend associated with the shape of the motility profile.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  In page 12, the authors state that &quot;the results for the DP and DP+LV cases are exactly equal for L = 185 um, as .... and the two ingression methods are numerically equivalent in the model&quot;. I understood that in this case two ingression methods are equivalent, but I do not understand why the results are &quot;exactly&quot; equal, given the presence of stochasticity in the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These results can be exactly equal despite the simulations being stochastic because they were both initialised using the same ‘seed’ in the source code. However, we now see that this might be confusing to the reader, and we have re-generated this figure but this time initialising the simulations for each ingression scenario using a different seed value. This is now reflected in the text on page 12 and in figure 4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  The authors analyze the effect of cell density on oscillation synchrony in Fig. 4 and they mention that higher density increases robustness of the clock by increasing the average number of interacting neighbours. I think it would be helpful to plot the average number of neighbouring cells in simulations as a function of density to quantitatively support the claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. Distributions of neighbour numbers for exemplar simulations with varying density can now be found in  figure 4 supplementary figure 1 and are referred to in the text on page 11.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  The authors analyze the effect of PSM length on synchrony in Fig. 4. I think kymographs of synchrony r as shown in Fig. 2D would also be helpful to show that indeed cells get synchronized while advecting through a longer PSM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and agree that visualising the data in this way is an excellent idea. We have generated the suggested kymographs and added them to figure 4 as supplements 2 and 4, and discussed these results in the text on page 12.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>-  I understand that cells in M phase can interact with neighboring cells with the same coupling strength kappa in the model, although their clocks are arrested. If so, this aspect should be also mentioned in the main text in page 16, as this coupling can be another noise source for synchrony.</p>

<p>We agree this is an important clarification. We explicitly state this, and briefly justify our choice, in the text on page 16.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Significance):</bold></p>
<p>Synchronization of the segmentation clock has been studied by mathematical modeling, but most previous studies considered cells in a static tissue without morphogenesis. In the previous study by Uriu et al. 2021, morphogenetic processes such as cell advection due to tissue elongation, tissue shortening, and cell mobility were considered in synchronization. The current manuscript provides methodological advances in this aspect by newly including cell ingression, tissue compaction and cell cycle. In addition, the authors bring a concept of modularity and evolvability to the field of the vertebrate segmentation clock, which is new. On the other hand, the manuscript confirms that the synchronization of the segmentation clock is robust by careful simulations, but it does not propose or reveal new mechanisms for making it robust or modular. The main targets of the manuscript will be researchers working on somitogenesis and evolutionary biologists who are interested in evolution of developmental systems. The manuscript will also be interested by broader audiences, like developmental biologists, biophysicists, and physicists and computer scientists who are working on dynamical systems.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their interest in our manuscript and for acknowledging us as one of the first to address the modularity and evolvability of somitogenesis. We hope that this work will encourage others to think about these concepts in this system too.</p>
<p>In the original submission, we identified a high enough coupling strength as the main mechanism underlying the identified modularity in somitogenesis. Since, we have included an analysis of the coupling delay and find that it is the interplay between coupling strength and coupling delay that mediate the identified modularity, allowing PSM morphogenesis and the segmentation clock to evolve independently in regions of parameter space that are constrained and determined by the interplay between these two parameters. We have now added an extra figure (figure 8) where we explore this interplay and have discussed it at length in the last section of the results and in the discussion. We again thank the reviewer for encouraging us to include delays in our analysis.</p>

<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>The manuscript from Hammond et al., investigates the modularity of the segmentation clock and morphogenesis in early vertebrate development, focusing on how these processes might independently evolve to influence the diversity of segment numbers across vertebrates.</p>
<p>Methodology: The study uses a previously published computational model, parameterized for zebrafish, to simulate and analyse the interactions between the segmentation clock and the morphogenesis of the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM). Their model integrates cell advection, motility, compaction, cell division, and the synchronization of the embryo clock. Three alternative scenarios of PSM morphogenesis were modeled to examine how these changes affect the segmentation clock.</p>
<p>Model System: The computational model system combines a representation of cell movements and the phase oscillator dynamics of the segmentation clock within a three-dimensional horseshoe-shaped domain mimicking the geometry of the vertebrate embryo PSM. The parameters used for the mathematical model are mostly estimated from previously published experimental findings.</p>
<p>Key Findings and Conclusions: (1) The segmentation clock was found to be broadly robust against variations in morphogenetic processes such as cell ingression and motility; (2) Changes in the length of the PSM and the strength of phase coupling within the clock significantly influenced the system's robustness; (3) The authors conclude that the segmentation clock and PSM morphogenesis exhibited developmental modularity (i.e. relative independence), allowing these two phenomena to evolve independently, and therefore possibly contributing to the diverse segment numbers observed in vertebrates.</p>
<p>MAJOR COMMENTS</p>
<p>(1) The key conclusion drawn by the authors (that there is robustness, and therefore modularity, between the morphogenetic cellular processes modeled and the embryo clock synchronization) stems directly from the modeling results appropriately presented and discussed in the manuscript. The model comprises some strong assumptions, however all have been clearly explained and the parameterization choices are supported by experimental findings, providing biological meaning to the model. Estimated parameters are well explained and seem reasonable assumptions (from the embryology perspective).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments about our work</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) This study, as is, achieves its proposed goal of evaluating the potential robustness of the embryo clock to changes in (some) morphogenetic processes. The authors do not claim that the model used is complete, and they properly identify some limitations, including the lack of cellcell interactions. Given the recognized importance of cellular physical interactions for successful embryo development, including them in the model would be a significant addition in future studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that the model does include cell-cell interactions as cells interact with their neighbours’ clock phase to synchronise and to avoid occupying the same physical space.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors have deposited all the code used for analysis in a public GitHub repository that is updated and available for the research community.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We support open source coding practices.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In page 6, the authors justify their choice of clock parameters for cells ingressing the PSM: &quot;As ingressing cells do not appear to express segmentation clock genes (Mara et al. (2007)), the position at which cells ingress into the PSM can create challenges for clock patterning, as only in the 'off' phase of the clock will ingressing cells be in-phase with their neighbours.&quot;  However, there are several lines of evidence (in chick and mouse), that some oscillatory clock genes are already being expressed as early as in the gastrulation phase (so prior to PSM ingression) (Feitas et al, 2001 [10.1242/dev.128.24.5139]; Jouve et al, 2002 [10.1242/dev.129.5.1107]; Maia-Fernandes at al, 2024 [10.1371/journal.pone.0297853]) Question: Is this also true in zebrafish? (I.e. is there any recent experimental evidence that the clock genes are not expressed at ingression, since the paper cited to support this assumption is from 2007). If they are expressed in zebrafish (as they are in mouse and chick), then the cell addition should have random clock gene periods when they enter the PSM and not start all with a constant initial phase of zero. Probably this will not impact the results since the cells will also be out of phase with their neighbours when they &quot;ingress&quot;, however, it will model more closely the biological scenario (and avoid such criticism).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. While it is known that in zebrafish the clock begins oscillating during epiboly and before the onset of segmentation (Riedel-Kruse et al., 2007), to our knowledge no-one has examined whether posteriorly or laterally ingressing progenitor cells express clock genes prior to their ingression into the PSM, which occurs later in development than the first oscillations which give rise to the first somites. We have not found any published evidence of her/hes gene expression in the dorsal donor tissues or lateral tissues surrounding the PSM, however we acknowledge that this has not been actively studied before and our assumption relies on an absence of evidence, rather than evidence of absence.</p>
<p>However, we agree with the reviewer that one should include such an analysis for completeness, and we have now generated additional simulations where progenitor cells ingress with a random clock phase. This data is presented in figure 2 supplement 1 and mentioned in the main text on page 9.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>MINOR COMMENTS</p>
<p>(1) The citations are appropriate and cover the major labs that have published work related to this study (although with some overrepresentation of the lab that published the model used).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have cited the vast literature on somitogenesis to the best of our ability and do recognise that the work of the Oates lab appears prominently, but this is probably because their experimental data were originally used to parametrise the model in Uriu et al. 2021.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The text is clear, carefully written, and both the methods and the reasoning behind them are clearly explained and supported by proper citations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are very glad to see that the reviewer found that the manuscript was clearly presented.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The figures are comprehensive, properly annotated, with explanatory self-contained legends. I have no comments regarding the presentation of the results.</p>

<p>(4) Minor suggestions:</p>
<p>a. Page 26: In the Cell addition sub-section of the Methods section, correct all instances where the word domain is used, but subdomain should be used (for clarity and coherence with the description of the model, stated as having a single domain comprising 3 subdomains).</p>

<p>GENERAL ASSESSMENT</p>
<p>This study uses a previously published model to simulate alternative scenarios of morphogenetic parameters to infer the potential independence (termed here modularity) between the segmentation clock and a set of morphogenetic processes, arguing that such modularity could allow the evolution of more flexible body plans, therefore partially explaining the variability in the number of segments observed in the vertebrates. This question is fundamental and relevant, yet still poorly researched. This work provides a comprehensive simulation with a model that tries to simplify the many morphogenetic processes described in the literature, reducing it to a few core fundamental processes that allow drawing the conclusions seeked. It provides theoretical insight to support a conceptual advance in the field of evolutionary vertebrate embryology.</p>
<p>ADVANCE</p>
<p>This study builds on a model recently published by Uriu et al. (eLife, 2021) that incorporates quantitative experimental data within a modeling framework including cell and tissue-level parameters, allowing the study of multiscale phenomena active during zebrafish embryo segmentation. Uriu's publication reports many relevant and often non-intuitive insights uncovered by the model, most notably the description of phase vortices formed by the synchronizing genetic oscillators interfering with the traveling-wave front pattern.  However, this model can be further explored to ask additional questions beyond those described in the original paper. A good example is the present study, which uses this mathematical framework to investigate the potential independence between two of the modeled processes, thereby extracting extra knowledge from it. Accordingly, the present study represents a step forward in the direction of using relevant theoretical frameworks to quantitatively explore the landscape of complex molecular hypotheses in silico, and with it shed some light on fundamental open questions or inform the design of future experiments in the lab.</p>
<p>The study incorporates a wide range of existing literature on the developmental biology of vertebrates. It comprehensively cites prior work, such as the foundational studies by Cooke and Zeeman on the segmentation clock and the role of FGF signaling in PSM development as discussed by Gomez et al. The literature properly covers the breadth of knowledge in this field.</p>
<p>AUDIENCE</p>
<p>Target audience | This study is relevant for fundamental research in developmental biology, specifically targeting researchers who focus on early embryo development and morphogenesis from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. It is also relevant for evolutionary biologists investigating the genetic factors that influence vertebrate evolution, as well as to computational biologists and bioinformatics researchers studying developmental processes and embryology.</p>
<p>Developmental researchers studying the segmentation clock in other vertebrate model organisms (namely mouse and chick), will find this publication especially valuable since it provides insights that can help them formulate new hypotheses to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the clock (for example finding a set of evolutionarily divergent genes that might interfere with PSM length). Additionally, this study provides a set of cellular parameters that have yet to be measured in mouse and chick, therefore guiding the design of future experiments to measure them, allowing the simulation of the same model with sets of parameters from different vertebrate model organisms, therefore testing the robustness of the findings reported for zebrafish.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, Verd and colleagues explored how various biologically relevant factors influence the robustness of clock dynamics synchronization among neighboring cells within the context of somatogenesis, adapting a mathematical model presented by Urio et. al in 2021 in a similar context. Specifically they show that clock dynamics is robust to different biological mechanisms such as cell infusion, cellular motility, compaction-extension and cell-division. On the other hand , the length of Presomitic Mesoderm (PSM) and density of cells in it has a significant role in the robustness of clock dynamics. While the manuscript is well-written and provides clear descriptions of methods and technical details, it tends to be somewhat lengthy.</p>
<p>Below are the comments I would like the authors to address:</p>
<p>(1) The authors mention that &quot;...the model is three dimensional and so can quantitatively recapture the rates of cell mixing that we observe in the PSM&quot;. I am not convinced with this justification of using a 3D model. None of the effects the authors explore in this manuscript requires a three dimensional model or full physical description of the cellular mechanics such as excluded volume interaction etc. A one-dimensional model characterized by cell position along the arclength of PSM and somatic region and segmentation clock phase θ can incorporate all the physics authors described in this manuscript as well as significantly computationally cheap allowing the authors to explore the effect of different parameters in greater detail.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One of the main objectives of the work we present in this manuscript is to assess how the evolution of PSM morphogenesis affects, or does not affect, segment patterning. The PSM is a three-dimensional tissue with differing cell rearrangement dynamics along its anterior-posterior axis. In addition, PSM dimension, density, the rearrangement rate, and patterns of cell ingression all vary across vertebrate species, and they are functional, especially cell mixing as it promotes synchronisation and drives elongation. In order to answer questions on the modularity of somitogenesis we therefore consider it absolutely necessary to include a three-dimensional representation of the PSM that captures single cells and their movements. In addition, this will allow us, as Reviewer #2 also pointed out, to reparametrize our model using species-specific data as it becomes available.</p>
<p>While the reviewer is right in that lower dimensional representations would be computationally more efficient, and are generally more tractable, it would not be possible to represent cell mixing in one dimension, as this happens in three dimensions. One could perhaps encode the synchrony-promoting effect of cell mixing via some coupling function κ(x) that increases towards the posterior, however it is unclear what existing biological data one could use to parameterise this function or determine its form. Cell mixing can be modelled in a two-dimensional framework, however this cannot quantitatively recapture the rate of cell mixing observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is an advantage of this model.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is unclear how one would simulate processes such as compactionextension using a one-dimensional model. The two different scenarios of cell ingression which we consider can also not be replicated in a one-dimensional model, as having a population of cells re-acquiring synchrony on the dorsal surface of the tissue while new material is added to the ventral side, creating asynchrony, is qualitatively different than a one-dimensional scenario where cells are introduced continuously along the spatial axis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I am not sure about the justification for limiting the quantification of phase synchrony in a very limited (one cell diameter wide) region at one end of the somatic part (Page 33 below Fig. 9). From my understanding of the manuscript, the segments appear in significant length anterior to this region. Wouldn't an ensemble average of multiple such one cell diameter wide regions in the somatic region be a more accurate metric for quantifying synchrony?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, such a metric (e.g. as that used by Uriu et al. to quantify synchrony along the xaxis) would be more accurate for determining synchrony within the PSM. However, as per the clock and wavefront model of somitogenesis, only synchrony at the very anterior of the PSM (or at the wavefront, equivalently) is functional for somitogenesis and thus evolution. Therefore, we restrict our analysis to the anterior-most region of the PSM. We now further justify this in the main text on page 9.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) While studying the effect of cellular ingression, the authors study three discrete modes- random, DP and DP+LV and show that in the DP+LV mode the clock synchrony becomes affected. I would like the authors to explore this in a continuous fashion from a pure DP ingression to Pure LV ingression and intermediates.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion; this is a very interesting question. We are currently working on a related computational and experimental project to address the question of how PSM morphogenesis can change over evolutionary time to evolve the different modes that we see across species. As part of this work, we are running precisely the simulations suggested by the reviewer to find regions of parameter space in which all the relevant morphogenetic processes can freely evolve.  While interesting, this work is however outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) While studying the effect of length and density of cells in PSM on cellular synchrony, the authors restrict to 3 values of density and 6 values of PSM length keeping the other parameter constant. I would be interested to see a phase diagram similar to Fig. 7 in the two-dimensional parameter space of L and ρ0. I am curious if a scaling relation exists for the parameter values that partition the parameter space with and without synchrony.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and agree that this would constitute an interesting addition to the manuscript. We have now generated these data, which are shown in figure 4 supplement 5 and mentioned on page 13. We see no clear relationship between these two variables when co-varying in the presence of random ingression.</p>

<p>(5) Both in the abstract and introduction, the authors discuss at a great length about the variability in the number of segments. I am curious how the number and width of the segments observed depend on different parameters related to cellular mechanics and the segmentation clock ?</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this question. It was not clear to us if this was something the reviewer wants us to address in the study’s background and introduction, or an analysis we should include in the results. Therefore, we have responded to both comprehensively below:</p>
<p>The prevailing conceptual framework for understanding this is the clock and wavefront model (Cooke and Zeeman, 1976), which posits that the somite length is inversely proportional to the frequency of the clock relative to the speed of the wavefront, and that the total number of segments is the relative frequency multiplied by the total duration of somitogenesis.</p>
<p>Experimentally we know that the frequency is determined in part by the coupling strength (Liao, Jorg, and Oates, 2016), and from comparative embryological studies (Gomez et al., 2008; Steventon et al., 2016) we know that changes in the elongation dynamics of the PSM correlate with changes in somite number, presumably by altering the total duration of somitogenesis (Gomez et al., 2009). These changes in elongation are thought to be driven by the changes in cell and tissue mechanics we test in our manuscript.</p>
<p>Within our model, we cannot in general predict how the number of segments responds to changes in either clock parameters or cell mechanical parameters, as we lack understanding of what causes somitogenesis to cease; this is thus not encoded in our model and segmentation can in principle proceed indefinitely. Therefore, we have not performed this analysis.</p>
<p>Similarly, we have not included an analysis of somite length. This is for two reasons: 1) as per the clock and wavefront model, the frequency at the PSM anterior (which we analyse) is equivalent to this measurement, as we assume (in general) the wavefront ($x = x_{a}$) is inertial. 2) the length of the nascent somite is not thought to be of much relevance to the adult phenotype, and by extension evolution. Somites undergo cell division and growth soon after their patterning by the segmentation clock, therefore their final size does not majorly depend on the dynamics of the segmentation clock. Rather, the main function of the clock is to control their number (and polarity).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The authors assume that the phase dynamics of the chemical network may be described by an oscillator with constant frequency. For the completeness of the manuscript, the author should discuss in detail, for which chemical networks this is a good assumption.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and now justify this assumption in the methods on page 31.</p>
<p>Such an assumption is appropriate for the segmentation clock, as the clock in the posterior of the PSM is thought to oscillate with a constant frequency, at least for the majority of somitogenesis although the frequency of somite formation slows towards the end of this process in zebrafish (Giudicelli et al., 2007, PLoS Biol.). In addition, PSM cells isolated and cultured in the presence of FGF (thus replicating the signalling environment of the posterior PSM) will continue to exhibit her1 oscillations with an apparently constant frequency (Webb et al., 2016).</p>
<p>We note that such formulations are widely used within the segmentation clock literature (e.g. Riedel-Kruse et al., 2007, Morelli et al., 2009).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 3 and the associated text shows no effect of the cellular motility profile in the synchrony of the segmentation clock. This may be moved to the supplementary considering the length of this manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. However, we would argue that the lack of effect is a crucial result when discussing modularity. Reviewer #2 agrees with this assessment.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Significance):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript answers some important questions in the synchrony of segmentation clock in the vertebrates utilizing a model published earlier. However, the presented result is incomplete in some aspects (points 2 to 5 of section A) and that could be overcome by a more detailed analysis using a simpler one dimensional (point 1 of section A). I believe this manuscript could be of interest to an intersecting audience of developmental biologists, systems biologists, and physicists/engineers interested in dynamical systems.</p>
