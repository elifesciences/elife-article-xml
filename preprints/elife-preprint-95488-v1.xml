<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), autoimmune disorders and multiple sclerosis. Since the approval of the first BTK inhibitor (BTKi), Ibrutinib, several other inhibitors including Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib have been clinically approved. All are covalent active site inhibitors, with the exception of the reversible active site inhibitor Pirtobrutinib. The large number of available inhibitors for the BTK target creates challenges in choosing the most appropriate BTKi for treatment. Side-by-side comparisons in CLL have shown that different inhibitors may differ in their treatment efficacy. Moreover, the nature of the resistance mutations that arise in patients appears to depend on the specific BTKi administered. We have previously shown that Ibrutinib binding to the kinase active site causes unanticipated long-range effects on the global conformation of BTK (Joseph, R.E., et al., 2020, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60470">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60470</ext-link>). Here we show that binding of each of the five approved BTKi to the kinase active site brings about distinct allosteric changes that alter the conformational equilibrium of full-length BTK. Additionally, we provide an explanation for the resistance mutation bias observed in CLL patients treated with different BTKi and characterize the mechanism of action of two common resistance mutations: BTK T474I and L528W.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA<sup>®</sup>), has revolutionized the treatment of the B cell malignancy, CLL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Ibrutinib is a covalent active site inhibitor of the multi-domain B-cell kinase, BTK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), that was first approved by the FDA in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Inhibition of BTK disrupts signaling downstream of the B-cell receptor (BCR), a pathway on which the survival of CLL cells are dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The success of Ibrutinib has spurred the development of other BTKi including the now clinically approved BTK inhibitors: Acalabrutinib (CALQUENCE<sup>®</sup>), Zanubrutinib (BRUKINSA<sup>®</sup>), Tirabrutinib/ONO-4059 (VELEXBRU<sup>®</sup>), Pirtobrutinib/LOXO-405 (JAYPIRCA<sup>®</sup>) and Orelabrutinib (HIBRUKA<sup>®</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. All of the clinically approved BTKi (with the exception of Pirtobrutinib) are covalent active site inhibitors that bind to BTK C481 residue within the kinase active site. Pirtobrutinib is currently the first and only clinically approved non-covalent BTK active site inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>

</fig>
<p>While BTKi are highly effective in the treatment of CLL, they are also being used to treat other B-cell malignancies such as Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and are being evaluated in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The plethora of clinically approved BTKi along with several other promising candidates currently in clinical trials pose a new challenge with respect to patient treatment. We now need a way to assess the suitability of a given BTKi for a given patient or disease state. Indeed, recent clinical trial data comparing one BTKi to another indicate that BTKi differ in their effectiveness in treating various conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. While toxicity, specificity and other criteria are used in these clinical comparisons, a molecular level characterization of the interaction of the inhibitor with full-length BTK is lacking and could be key to understanding these differences. In our previous work, using high resolution structural biology techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Hydrogen Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS), we have shown that some inhibitors (Ibrutinib) exert unanticipated allosteric effects upon binding to BTK while others (Fenebrutinib) do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Ibrutinib binding to the BTK kinase active site leads to a shift in the conformational ensemble of full-length BTK towards an open conformation where the regulatory SRC homology (SH3 and SH2) domains are released from the ‘back’ surface of the kinase domain, disrupting the closed autoinhibited conformation of the full-length protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]). Allosteric conformational changes upon drug binding have been shown to alter protein-ligand interactions in other systems with functional consequences <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. The full impact of the panel of currently approved BTKi on the conformation of full-length BTK is not known.</p>
<p>Despite the success of BTKi in CLL, a recurring problem is the development of BTKi resistance. Resistance typically develops in patients ∼2 years after the start of BTK inhibitor treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Analysis of CLL patients that stop responding to BTKi has revealed that most develop mutations within <italic>Btk</italic> or in the substrate of BTK: Phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, the specific resistance mutations that develop in <italic>Btk</italic> seem to be dependent on the specific BTKi used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. While data available so far for the BTKi inhibitors Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib are low in number, there is an emerging trend (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>). Perhaps not surprisingly, patients treated with the reversible inhibitor Pirtobrutinib do not develop mutations in C481 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Instead, they develop other kinase active site mutations including BTK T474I and L528W (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,d</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In contrast, 90% or more of CLL patients treated with Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib develop mutations in BTK C481 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supp. Table 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]). Substitution of C481 with serine is the most common resistance mutation found in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. While mutation of BTK C481 to residues other than serine have also been reported (C481F/Y/R), they occur at a much lower frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Additionally, other sites within BTK such as T474 and L528 are rarely (if ever) mutated in Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib-treated CLL patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supp. Table 1</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]). Surprisingly, BTK T474 and L528 are frequently mutated in CLL patients treated with the covalent inhibitors Zanubrutinib and Tirabrutinib (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]). BTK T474I and L528W are found at almost equal or higher frequency compared to C481S in these patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supp. Table 1</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]). Moreover, in Zanubrutinib-treated patients, the L528W mutation was often present together with C481S mutation (on different alleles), and with the L528W mutation present at a higher allelic frequency compared to C481S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. This mutational bias with respect to covalent BTKi is unexpected given the shared mode of action across the panel of covalent inhibitors, and the reasons for these differences are unclear. Additionally, the mechanism of action of the BTK T474I and L528W mutations is not known. Given the development of T474I and L528W mutations in multiple CLL patients treated with both covalent (Zanubrutinib and Tirabrutinib) and non-covalent (Pirtobrutinib) BTK inhibitors, we focused on these BTK mutations and explore their mechanisms of action.</p>
<p>Here, we probe the impact of four clinically-approved BTKi: Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib on the conformation of full-length BTK. We find that each of these BTKi brings about a unique combination of changes in full-length BTK. Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib and Tirabrutinib disrupted the autoinhibited conformation of full-length BTK similarly to Ibrutinib but did so to varying degrees. Interestingly, Acalabrutinib and Tirabrutinib altered the dynamics of the kinase G-helix, a region that has been previously characterized as the PLCγ substrate docking site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Pirtobrutinib on the other hand stabilized the compact autoinhibited conformation of full-length BTK and is the first BTK inhibitor observed to do so. Additionally, we probed the mechanism of action of the BTK resistance mutations T474I and L528W. We show that the catalytically inactive BTK L528W mutant activated the SRC kinase HCK and that this activation is dependent on the proline-rich region within BTK. The BTK T474I mutation disrupted binding to Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib and likely evades the action of these drugs due to reduced binding to these inhibitors. Furthermore, we provide an explanation for the mutational bias observed in patients treated with different covalent BTKi. The development of the C481S resistance mutation is dependent on the half-life of the inhibitor which likely explains the low prevalence of the C481S resistance mutation in patients treated with the covalent inhibitors Tirabrutinib and Zanubrutinib (which have a long half-life) as compared to Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib (which have a short half-life). Characterization of the interaction of BTKi with full-length BTK allows us to better interpret clinical trial results and will help guide the choice of BTKi to be used for treatment. Furthermore, understanding the mechanism of action of resistance mutations allows us to develop treatment strategies that either prevent or delay development of resistance mutations and ways to treat them when they arise.</p>

<title>Assessing the impact of inhibitor binding on the isolated BTK linker kinase domain by NMR</title>
<p>To evaluate the impact of inhibitor binding on BTK, we first monitored its effect on the conformation of the linker kinase domain (LKD) fragment of BTK (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The catalytic kinase domain of BTK can adopt an active or inactive conformation in solution and previous studies have shown that inhibitor binding can stabilize one or more of these conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The switch from an inactive to an active kinase conformation involves changes in key structural elements within the kinase domain. These changes include the inward movement of the C-helix from an inactive ‘αC out’ to the active ‘αC in’ position, changes in the side chain rotamer conformation of BTK W395, formation of a conserved BTK K430:E445 salt bridge and unfurling of the collapsed activation loop, leading to the exposure of the conserved Y551 on the activation loop for phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]).</p>

</fig>
<p>Crystal structures of the BTK kinase domain in complex with Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib or Pirtobrutinib are available and show that each of these BTK inhibitors stabilize the kinase domain in an inactive conformation similar to that of Ibrutinib-bound BTK (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-f</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]). In all the inhibitor bound structures the C-helix is in the ‘αC out’ position and the activation loop is collapsed into the kinase active site, burying the conserved BTK Y551 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-f</xref>). Moreover, superposition of these BTK/inhibitor complexes shows that the structures of the kinase domain remains largely the same regardless of which inhibitor is bound (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>). The structure of the Tirabrutinib bound BTK is the only structure that shows a difference; the activation loop in that complex adopts an alternative inactive loop conformation compared to the other inhibitor bound structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e,g</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous NMR and HDX-MS analysis of the interaction of BTK with a different panel of active site inhibitors has shown that there are differences between the solution and crystal behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. To test whether the BTK inhibitors Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib can stabilize an inactive BTK kinase conformation in solution as predicted by the crystal structures, we evaluated the BTK inhibitor bound complexes by NMR. The LKD fragment of BTK was isotopically labeled with <sup>15</sup>N and a <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectrum was obtained in the presence or absence of the inhibitor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We have previously shown that BTK W395 within the linker region (L) that precedes the kinase domain provides a useful probe to monitor the conformational state adopted by the kinase domain in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Assignments for the apo BTK linker kinase domain, which adopts the active (αC in) conformation, show that the W395 indole <sup>1</sup>H resonates at 10.21 ppm in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectrum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, top panel, black spectrum). An upfield shift in the BTK W395 side chain indole NH resonance is observed upon Ibrutinib binding and is consistent with the outward movement of the C-helix (αC out), and stabilization of the inactive kinase domain conformation by Ibrutinib (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3</xref>, top panel, cyan spectrum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]).</p>

Multiple peaks corresponding to W395 are seen in the Tirabrutinib bound spectrum suggesting that the kinase adopts multiple conformations in solution. The downfield shift observed in W395 in the Pirtobrutinib bound structure is likely due to local changes in the chemical environment due to the distinct chemical structure of Pirtobrutinib.

<p>In contrast to the covalent inhibitors, Pirtobrutinib causes a downfield shift in W395, which might suggest that this inhibitor is stabilizing an active conformation of BTK (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, bottom panel). However, the fluorinated benzene ring in Pirtobrutinib, which is adjacent to the C-helix and W395 in the Pirtobrutinib bound structure, may cause changes in the local environment of W395 and thereby give rise to the unusual chemical shift change. Indeed, HDX-MS data (see below) confirms the stabilization of the inactive kinase conformation by Pirtobrutinib.

<title>Probing the effects of inhibitor binding on full-length BTK by HDX-MS</title>
<p>We next evaluated the impact of inhibitor binding on the conformation of full-length BTK by HDX-MS. We have previously shown that HDX-MS can be used to probe conformational changes in full-length BTK that are brought about by inhibitor binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. The structure of the full-length BTK protein in the autoinhibited conformation was recently solved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. However, electron density for both the N-terminal PHTH domain and proline rich region is missing in this structure, suggesting that the N-terminal region of BTK is dynamic. Indeed, CryoEM, SAXS and solution data all indicate that the PHTH domain is highly dynamic and likely transiently contacts multiple sites on the core SH3-SH2-kinase domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]). Changes in deuterium incorporation must therefore be mapped on the crystal structure of the SH3-SH2-kinase fragment of BTK, which adopts a compact inactive autoinhibited conformation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]). Additionally, our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] has shown that for the majority of the inhibitor complexes studied changes in deuterium incorporation are rarely observed in the PHTH domain suggesting that the PHTH domain dynamics are not affected by active site occupancy. Inhibitor binding typically leads to decreased deuterium incorporation in peptides derived from the kinase active site due to stabilization of this region in the presence of the bound inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Additionally, inhibitors such as Ibrutinib that have allosteric effects lead to an increase in deuterium incorporation in peptides derived from the BTK SH3 and SH2 domains as well as the SH2-kinase linker, indicating a shift away from the autoinhibited conformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Full-length BTK was mixed with Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib or Pirtobrutinib and subjected to HDX-MS analysis. Peptides that could be followed in each of the six experimental conditions (apo, and inhibitor bound) were used for comparison (see Supplemental Datafile). Intact mass analysis supports a single binding site on BTK for the covalent inhibitors similar to what has been observed previously with Ibrutinib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]).</p>

<p>Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib show decreased deuterium incorporation in peptides derived from the kinase N-lobe and kinase activation loop similar to that observed previously with Ibrutinib (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-e</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]). This is consistent with the binding of these inhibitors in the kinase active site and stabilization of the inactive kinase conformation observed by NMR as well as in the crystal structures. Furthermore, we note that each of these inhibitors induce allosteric effects. Binding of Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib and Tirabrutinib to BTK causes increased deuterium incorporation in peptides derived from the SH3 domain suggesting that the autoinhibited conformation of full-length BTK is destabilized (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b-d</xref>). This is similar to what has been previously observed with Ibrutinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Additionally, Acalabrutinib and Tirabrutinib showed increased deuterium incorporation in peptides derived from the G-helix of the kinase domain, a region that has been previously identified as the PLCγ substrate docking site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b-d</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]). Taken together, Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib and Tirabrutinib binding to BTK leads to hybrid conformations of full-length BTK, where the kinase domain is stabilized in an inactive conformation and the regulatory domains are disrupted from their autoinhibitory conformation. In stark contrast, Pirtobrutinib binding to BTK shows decreased deuterium incorporation in peptides derived from the SH3 and SH2 domains, suggesting that Pirtobrutinib stabilizes the compact, autoinhibited conformation of full-length BTK (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,c</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). To date, Pirtobrutinib is the only inhibitor that we have tested that uniformly stabilizes both the kinase domain as well as the regulatory domains in the inactive autoinhibited conformation. Thus, each BTK inhibitor causes unique changes in the overall conformation of full-length BTK that is not readily predicted from crystal structures. We next turn our attention to the distinct resistance mutations that arise upon treatment with the different BTK inhibitors.</p>

<title>Probing the intrinsic effects of the BTK T474I and L528W mutations</title>
<p>BTK resistance mutations can potentially confer a selective advantage to cells in several ways: by increasing the activity of the kinase, by changing the conformation/stability of the kinase which in turn can alter protein-protein interactions, or by disrupting drug binding. To probe the mechanism by which the BTK T474I and L528W mutations confer resistance to Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib we first tested the impact of each mutation on the catalytic activity of the kinase and then investigated the impact on the overall conformation of the protein by HDX-MS and NMR.</p>
<p>To test the catalytic activity of the BTK mutants we set up <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays using purified full-length WT and mutant BTK proteins. Kinase activity was monitored by following phosphorylation on the activation loop Y551 by western blotting. The BTK T474I mutant shows phosphorylation on Y551, however it is lower than that of the WT protein (Fig.6a,b) suggesting that the T474I mutation reduces the activity of the kinase. In contrast, the BTK L528W mutant is completely inactive with no detectable phosphorylation on Y551 throughout the time course (Fig.6c,d). These results are consistent with previous activity reports on both the BTK T474I and L528W mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Given that neither the BTK T474I or the L528W mutant had increased catalytic activity, augmenting kinase activity is not the mechanism by which these mutations confer resistance.</p>
<p>Resistance mutations can change the conformation of the protein which in turn can alter protein-protein interactions. To test whether the BTK T474I and L528W mutations alter the overall conformation of the protein, we carried out HDX-MS analysis on the apo mutant proteins. Comparing the BTK T474I mutant to WT BTK, the BTK T474I mutant shows increased deuterium incorporation within the kinase domain N-lobe β2-β3 strands and the activation loop, but no changes elsewhere on the protein (Fig.6e,f,h). These increased dynamics within the N-lobe of the BTK T474I mutant could potentially alter drug binding to the active site. The BTK L528W mutant on the other hand shows a slight decrease in deuterium incorporation in the kinase domain and the SH3 domain suggesting that the L528W mutation has a slight stabilizing effect on the full-length autoinhibited conformation of BTK (Fig.6e,g,h).</p>
<p>Additionally, we tested the BTK T474I and L528W mutants by NMR. An overlay of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of apo BTK LKD T474I with that of apo WT BTK LKD shows some changes in the mutant spectrum (Fig.6i). The resonance corresponding to BTK A524 located close (∼18 Å) to T474 in the kinase active site shows line broadening in the BTK T474I mutant spectrum suggesting increased dynamics in the mutant. This is consistent with the increased deuterium incorporation observed in the kinase domain for this mutant by HDX-MS. The BTK W395 resonance in the BTK T474I mutant spectrum overlaps with that of the WT suggesting that the mutant kinase domain adopts an active conformation similar to that of the WT protein. The BTK L528W mutant on the other hand shows a small upfield shift in the W395 resonance, suggesting that the BTK L528W mutant kinase domain is shifted slightly towards an inactive conformation compared to the WT protein. This change in the BTK L528W mutant is consistent with the HDX-MS changes for this protein which suggest that the mutation has a slight stabilizing effect on the compact autoinhibited conformation. Additionally, a new peak is observed as expected in the BTK L528W mutant spectrum consistent with the introduction of an additional tryptophan due to the mutation. Overall, as the BTK T474I and L528W mutations by themselves cause only minor conformational changes, such changes are unlikely to constitute the mechanism by which these mutations confer resistance.</p>

<title>BTK L528W mutant activates the SRC family kinase HCK</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that the BTK L528W mutant propagates BCR signaling despite being catalytically dead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. PLCγ phosphorylation and calcium signaling are maintained in cells carrying this BTK mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. This suggests that the BTK L528W mutant might recruit other kinases to compensate for its lack of activity. The mechanism of action of another catalytically inactive BTK resistant mutation: BTK C481F/Y, which arises in Ibrutinib treated CLL patients, has been recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. In that work the BTK C481F/Y resistance mutant was shown to bind and activate the SRC family kinase HCK, thereby propagating signals from the BCR signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. This activation of HCK by BTK C481F/Y requires phosphorylation on the BTK kinase activation loop, Y551. The phosphorylated Y551 is suggested to bind to the HCK SH2 domain, displacing the autoinhibited conformation of HCK, thereby activating the HCK catalytic function. To determine if a similar mechanism is at work for the catalytically dead BTK L528W mutant, we tested the ability of the BTK L528W mutant to activate HCK in a western blot assay by monitoring the phosphorylation levels on two substrates: PLCγ1 (pY783 phosphorylation) and HCK itself (pY levels). In addition, we also included BTK WT that had been pre-incubated with Zanubrutinib as a control. As shown in Fig.7a,b, phosphorylation increased on both PLCγ and HCK in the presence of full-length BTK L528W, suggesting that the catalytically dead BTK mutant is able to activate HCK. Interestingly, Zanubrutinib bound WT BTK also promoted increased phosphorylation levels on both PLCγ1 and HCK suggesting that drug-inactivated BTK also activates HCK. This is distinct from what has been previously observed for the BTK C481Y/F resistant mutation where, compared to WT BTK, the C481Y/F mutant BTK preferentially engages HCK. Nevertheless, since the BTK L528W mutant activates HCK, we next designed experiments to probe the requirements for this activation.</p>
<p>We first tested whether the regulatory domains of BTK were required for HCK activation by the BTK L528W mutant by using the isolated linker kinase domain of BTK (a construct in which the BTK regulatory domains have been deleted). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c,d</xref>, the isolated linker kinase domain of BTK L528W does not activate HCK. This suggests that the regulatory domain/s of BTK are required for the activation of HCK and that the isolated linker kinase domain of BTK alone is insufficient for HCK activation. This again is different from what has been previously reported; the BTK C481Y/F resistant mutant requires the kinase domain for HCK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. We therefore turned our focus onto the BTK regulatory domains to isolate the specific region/s required for HCK activation by the BTK L528W resistance mutation.</p>

<p>Displacement of the SH3 domain from its autoinhibitory conformation upon binding of a proline-rich ligand is a classic mechanism by which SRC family kinases such as HCK are activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. BTK contains such a proline-rich ligand sequence within its regulatory region and so we tested HCK activation by a BTK mutant lacking the proline-rich sequence (BTK L528W/Pro: BTK L528W/ P189A/P192A/P203A/P206A). As shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e,f</xref>, the BTK L528W proline-depleted mutant does not activate HCK. This data again emphasizes the difference between the mechanism of action of the BTK L528W mutant from the previously characterized BTK C481Y/F mutant. Additionally, this data is consistent with the observation that WT BTK can also activate HCK, as the proline-rich region is present in both WT and mutant L528W BTK. The ability of both WT and L528W mutant BTK to activate HCK, however, suggests that there must be additional reasons for the selection of the BTK L528W resistance mutation in patients.</p>

<p>Changes in protein levels have been shown to cause resistance in several cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].

To test whether the BTK L528W mutation has a stabilizing effect on BTK, we measured the melting temperature (Tm) of the BTK L528W mutant and compared it to that of the WT protein in a thermal shift assay. As shown in Fig.7g, the BTK L528W mutant is more stable than the WT protein (a one degree increase in Tm compared to the WT). The increased stability of the L528W mutant, albeit small, could result in increased protein levels, an increase in the lifetime of the protein or altered protein trafficking <italic>in vivo</italic>, all of which would drive the interaction of the mutant protein with HCK unlike the WT protein.</p>

<title>HDX-MS reveals that the BTK T474I and L528W mutants show reduced binding to BTK inhibitors</title>
<p>Disruption of inhibitor binding due to mutations is a classic mechanism by which resistance arises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. While loss of inhibitor binding is likely irrelevant to the catalytically dead BTK L528W mutant, we nevertheless evaluated it along with the BTK T474I mutant using HDX-MS and NMR. HDX-MS data show that Tirabrutinib, Zanubrutinib and Pirtobrutinib induce overall changes in deuterium incorporation for both WT BTK and the T474I mutant (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a,b,c</xref>) These data suggest that the inhibitors are still capable of binding to the T474I mutant. However, in the presence of Tirabrutinib, Zanubrutinib or Pirtobrutinib, the magnitude of the protection in the kinase domain (N-lobe β2-β3 strands and activation loop) is consistently reduced in drug bound T474I mutant as compared to the WT protein (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a,b,c,e</xref>). The differences in deuterium exchange for drug binding to WT and mutant BTK suggest that the T474I mutation either causes a reduction in inhibitor binding or otherwise alters the mode of drug interaction in the active site. Specifically, the peptides derived from the kinase activation loop in particular do not show as much protection in the mutant relative to the WT suggesting that the inhibitors do not stabilize the activation loop in the inactive conformation upon binding to the T474I mutant. Interestingly, the changes observed in the BTK regulatory domains (SH3 and SH2 domains) upon Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib or Pirtobrutinib binding to WT BTK as well as increased deuterium incorporation in the G-helix of the kinase domain upon Tirabrutinib binding to WT BTK are maintained or reduced slightly in the drug bound BTK T474I mutant. In stark contrast to the BTK T474I mutant, the BTK L528W mutant does not show any change in deuterium incorporation in the presence of Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib or Pirtobrutinib, providing strong evidence that the BTK L528W mutant does not bind the inhibitors (Fig.8d). Taken together, both the BTK T474I and the BTK L528W mutation impact inhibitor binding. Indeed, these results are consistent with previous studies that show that the BTK T474I and the BTK L528W mutations disrupt binding to Zanubrutinib and Pirtobrutinib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].

The W395 resonance shows little to no chemical shift change upon addition of Zanubrutinib to the BTK T474I mutant, suggesting that this drug does not stabilize the inactive conformation of the mutant kinase (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref>, middle panel). These results are consistent with HDX-MS changes in the T474I mutant upon Zanubrutinib binding (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>).</p>

<p>Spectral comparison of Tirabrutinib bound to WT and BTK T474I (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9b</xref>, left and middle panels) shows drug induced chemical shift changes for both complexes, supporting the conclusion from the HDX-MS data (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref>) that the drug binds to both WT and mutant BTK. However, the spectral changes observed in the spectrum of Tirabrutinib bound to BTK T474I are different from that of the WT/Tirabrutinib bound spectrum (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9b</xref>). Although BTK W395 gives rise to multiple peaks in the spectra of Tirabrutinib bound to both WT and T474I, the W395 resonances in the BTK T474I/Tirabrutinib complex are shifted upfield to a lesser extent compared to the same resonance in the WT/Tirabrutinib spectrum. This suggests that the BTK T474I mutation alters the binding to Tirabrutinib and the inactive kinase domain conformation (αC out) is less populated in the drug bound mutant protein compared to WT BTK bound to Tirabrutinib. These results are consistent with the HDX-MS results that show reduced protection in peptides corresponding to the kinase activation loop in the mutant compared to WT due to the lack of stabilization of the kinase inactive conformation upon Tirabrutinib binding.</p>
<p>Spectral overlay of the Pirtobrutinib bound BTK T474I with the apo T474I protein shows pronounced chemical shift changes in the presence of the inhibitor, providing evidence consistent with the HDX-MS data (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8c</xref>), that Pirtobrutinib binds the BTK T474I mutant (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9c</xref>, middle). However, unlike Pirtobrutinib bound to WT BTK, multiple W395 peaks are visible in the spectrum of Pirtobrutinib bound to BTK T474I. The resonance frequencies of the additional peaks are shifted toward that of the apo protein suggesting the possibility of fast exchange between inhibitor bound and unbound states. These observations suggest that the T474I mutation reduces affinity towards Pirtobrutinib and are consistent with previously published SPR binding data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>].</p>
<p>BTK inhibitors that retain binding to the BTK T474I mutant could serve as potential alternate treatment option for patients with this mutation. Additionally, the lack of or low frequency of the BTK T474I mutation in patients treated with Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib could be due to the inability of this mutation to disrupt inhibitor binding. We therefore tested the ability of the BTK T474I mutant to bind Ibrutinib, Acalabrutinib and Fenebrutinib (GDC-0853). The NMR data suggest that the BTK T474I mutation does not impact Ibrutinib or Fenebrutinib binding (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9d,f</xref>), but Acalabrutinib binding is reduced (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9e</xref>). Taken together, the T474I mutation significantly reduces binding to Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib, retains binding to Ibrutinib and Fenebrutinib, and may have an adverse effect on Acalabrutinib binding. Given that the BTK T474I mutant retains activity (albeit reduced activity), disruption of drug binding is a possible mechanism by which this mutation escapes inhibition.</p>
<p>Spectral overlays of the BTK L528W mutant with and without Zanubrutinib show no chemical shift changes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref>, right panel) suggesting that the mutation completely disrupts inhibitor binding in complete agreement with the HDX-MS data (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>). Tirabrutinib does show chemical shift changes, but the changes are markedly different from that observed in the WT protein (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9b</xref>, right). In the L528W spectrum in the presence of Tirabrutinib, W395 shifts in the opposite downfield direction compared to the WT spectrum suggesting that Tirabrutinib could be binding to the BTK L528W in a different orientation. Alternatively, the distinct chemical shift change could be due to the mutated L528W residue altering the local chemical environment within the kinase.</p>
<p>The Pirtobrutinib-bound BTK L528W spectrum (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9c</xref>) shows two resonance positions, one of which overlaps with the W395 resonance in the apo protein and the other that corresponds to that of the mutant protein bound to Pirtobrutinib. This data suggests a mixture of inhibitor bound and unbound BTK kinase domain in solution, likely due to a reduction in Pirtobrutinib affinity caused by the L528W mutation. Although the L528W mutation alters binding to both Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib, the NMR data suggests that it retains partial binding unlike the HDX-MS data that suggests complete disruption of binding. The higher inhibitor concentrations used in the NMR experiments compared to the HDX-MS experiments likely explain this discrepancy. Interestingly, we note similarities between the BTK L528W Pirtobrutinib bound spectrum and that of Tirabrutinib bound spectrum, suggesting that the BTK kinase domain adopts similar conformations in solution when bound to these different drugs. Additionally, the BTK L528W mutant retains binding to Fenebrutinib, however Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib binding are disrupted (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9d-f</xref>, right). Taken together, the BTK L528W mutation significantly disrupts Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib binding. However, drugs based on Fenebrutinib could be developed to treat patients carrying this mutation (see discussion below).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Binding of BTK active site inhibitors can have long-range effects on the protein. Here, we build on earlier work to show that three of the clinically approved BTKi (Acalabrutinib, Zanubrutinib and Tirabrutinib) shift the conformational ensemble of full-length BTK, destabilizing the autoinhibited conformation of the SH3 and SH2 domains to varying degrees (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In marked contrast, Pirtobrutinib led to the stabilization of the compact autoinhibited conformation of full-length BTK. The exposure or stabilization of the regulatory domains of BTK by active site BTK inhibitors can alter the interaction of BTK with ligands <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, BTK inhibitors have been shown to differ in their effectiveness at terminating signals downstream of the Fc receptor <italic>versus</italic> the B cell receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. As more BTKi become available, a molecular-level understanding of the interaction of the inhibitor with full-length BTK will aid the interpretation of the efficacy of different BTK inhibitors in treating disease states driven by different signaling pathways.</p>
<p>The development of specific resistance mutations in patients treated with different BTKi is intriguing. Covalent BTKi rely on BTK C481 within the kinase active site. The C481S mutation prevents the covalent attachment of these inhibitors to BTK and converts the mode of binding of these drugs to that of a reversible inhibitor. Importantly, we and others have shown that the BTK C481S mutation does not prevent binding of Ibrutinib to the BTK kinase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In fact, the BTK C481S mutant binds to Ibrutinib just as well as the WT protein <italic>in vitro</italic> under equilibrium conditions where drug concentrations do not vary over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. However, <italic>in vivo</italic>, drug concentrations change with time; inhibitor concentrations peak rapidly after intake followed by a decrease as the drug is cleared (represented by the half-life of the drug). The occupancy of BTK C481S protein by these covalent inhibitors in patients is therefore dictated by the availability of these covalent inhibitors over time. Interestingly, Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib have short half-lives compared to Zanubrutinib and Tirabrutinib (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The short half-lives of Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib suggests that the BTK C481S mutant is likely to be unoccupied when inhibitor concentrations fall, thereby allowing the BTK C481S mutant to escape from inhibition. Conversely, the longer half-life of Zanubrutinib and Tirabrutinib in patients suggests that the BTK C481S mutant is likely to remain occupied (inhibited) for a longer period of time. The C481S mutation therefore does not offer a selective advantage as a resistance mutation in Zanubrutinib and Tirabrutinib treated patients and likely explains the lower frequency of occurrence of this mutation in these patients compared to Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib treated patients. Taken together, the BTK C481S mutant can escape covalent inhibition at low drug concentrations <italic>in vivo</italic> and is therefore predicted to arise in patients treated with BTK covalent inhibitors that have short half-lives.</p>

<p>The T474I mutation arises frequently in Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib treated CLL patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Our HDX-MS and NMR binding studies show that the T474I mutation disrupts binding to both inhibitors. Reduced binding of BTK T474I mutant to Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib, along with the partial catalytic activity retained by this mutant, would allow BTK T474I mutant to escape inhibition and maintain BCR signaling. This gives a selective advantage to the cells that carry this mutation. Additionally, our NMR binding studies show that the BTK T474I mutation does not disrupt binding of Ibrutinib. This is consistent with the low occurrence of this mutation in Ibrutinib-treated CLL patients. While the BTK T474I mutation does seem to disrupt binding to Acalabrutinib, the lower activity of the T474I mutant (compared to the BTK C481S mutant) may explain the higher prevalence of the BTK C481S mutation (compared to T474I) in Acalabrutinib treated patients.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Ideas and Speculation</title>
<p>Successful treatment of CLL has relied on the inhibition of BTK catalytic activity to curb BCR signaling. Inhibitor-bound, catalytically-inactive BTK is incapable of propagating BCR signaling. Paradoxically, the catalytically inactive BTK L528W mutant is able to propagate BCR signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. A similar catalytically inactive BTK mutant, the BTK C481Y/F resistance mutation also arises in Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib treated patients, albeit at a low frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Since these BTK mutants are catalytically dead, other kinases must compensate for the absence of BTK activity to account for the intact BCR signaling in these patients. Exogenous kinases do not appear to compensate for WT BTK that is inactivated by BTK inhibitors, and so there must be additional differences between the catalytically dead (BTK L528W and BTK C481Y/F) mutant kinases and inhibitor bound WT BTK that is rendered catalytically inactive by virtue of drug binding. Our HDX-MS and NMR data show that BTK L528W mutation does not drastically change the conformation of BTK. However, this mutation does increase the stability of BTK compared to the WT protein. This increased stability could alter protein levels or change the trafficking/localization of the mutant protein <italic>in vivo</italic> which in turn could alter protein-protein interactions that drive activation of an alternate kinase such as HCK <italic>in vivo</italic>. Comparison of BTK protein levels in patients pre- and post-development of resistance will be needed to test this hypothesis. Alternatively, the BTK L528W mutation may require an additional change/s in the cell that allow for this dead kinase to recruit other kinases such as HCK to propagate BCR signaling. This requirement for additional changes may explain the low frequency of the L528W mutation in Ibrutinib and Acalabrutinib treated patients; the single amino acid change, C481S, combined with the rapid clearance of drug seems sufficient to drive resistance. Finally, the absence of the BTK L528W resistance mutation in Ibrutinib treated CLL patients could be due to the promiscuity of Ibrutinib; candidate compensatory kinases may be inactivated by the drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. The increased specificity of Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib and Pirtobrutinib on the other hand could allow for the utilization of compensatory kinases such as HCK by BTK L528W in order to propagate BCR signaling.</p>
<p>Understanding the mechanism/s by which resistance mutations evade inhibition allows for counter strategies to be devised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. The reversible BTK inhibitor Pirtobrutinib is able to inhibit the BTK C481S mutant due to its long serum half-life and has been suggested as a treatment option for patients that develop this mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Alternatively, drug occupancy in the context of the BTK C481S resistance mutant could be increased by administering a twice daily dose of the inhibitor as opposed to the single daily dose possibly circumventing their short half-lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. This increased exposure time to the covalent inhibitor could cause increased side effects and so such risks should be considered before altering the dosage regimen. Alternatively, Tirabrutinib, which exhibits the longest half-life among the available covalent BTK inhibitors, could be used to slow progression of disease in patients that develop the C481S resistance mutation.</p>
<p>The BTK T474I mutation disrupts binding to Zanubrutinib, Tirabrutinib, Pirtobrutinib and Acalabrutinib (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig.8</xref>, 9) but retains binding to Ibrutinib and Fenebrutinib creating possible options for patients that develop the BTK T474I resistance mutation. The BTK L528W mutant is catalytically inactive, hence treatment with any BTK active site inhibitor is futile. Previous studies have shown that the similarly inactive BTK C481Y/F mutant can be suppressed by the use of PROTACS to induce degradation of the full-length protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Importantly, our data indicate that although the BTK L528W mutation disrupted binding to most BTK inhibitors it retains binding to Fenebrutinib (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig.9</xref>), suggesting that PROTACS based on Fenebrutinib or similar backbones could be developed to treat this resistance mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Alternate treatment approaches such as targeting HCK or other BCR signaling proteins such as BCL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] could also be used to counter this resistance mutation. As additional patient data becomes available, the patterns of resistance mutations for different inhibitors will become clearer and strategies to circumvent resistance using existing inhibitors should improve. As for many areas of medicine, the treatment landscape should benefit from the ongoing era of personalized medicine.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work by Joseph et al &quot;Impact of the clinically approved BTK inhibitors on the conformation of full-length BTK and analysis of the development of BTK resistance mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot; seeks to comparatively analyze the effect of a range of covalent and noncovalent clinical BTK inhibitors upon BTK conformation. The novel aspect of this manuscript is that it seeks to evaluate the differential resistance mutations that arise distinctly from each of the inhibitors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an exciting study that builds upon the fundamental notion of ensemble behavior in solutions for enzymes such as BTK. The HDX-MS and NMR experiments are adequately and comprehensively presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While I commend the novelty of the study, the absence of important controls greatly tempers my enthusiasm for this work. As stated in the abstract, there are no broad takeaways for how resistance mutation bias operated from this study, although the mechanism of action of 2 common resistance mutations is useful. How these 2 resistance mutations connect to ensemble behavior, is not obvious. This is partly because BTK does not populate just binary &quot;open&quot;/&quot;closed&quot; conformations, but there are likely multiple intermediate conformations. Each inhibitor appears to preferentially &quot;select&quot; conformations by the authors' own assessment (line 236) and this carries implications for the emergence of resistance mutations. The most important control that would help is to use ADP or nonhydrolyzable and ATP as a baseline to establish the &quot;inactive&quot; and &quot;active&quot; conformations. All of the HDX-MS and NMR studies use protein that has no nucleotide present. A major question that remains is whether each of the inhibitors preferentially favors/blocks ADP or ATP binding. This then means it is not equivalent to correlate functional kinase assay conditions with either HDX-MS or NMR experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Previous NMR and HDX-MS studies on full-length (FL) BTK showed that the covalent BTKi, ibrutinib, causes long-range effects on the conformation of BTK consistent with disruption of the autoinhibited conformation, based on HDX deuterium uptake patterns and NMR chemical shift perturbations. This study extends the analyses to four new covalent BTKi, acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib, tirabrutinib/ONO4059, and a noncovalent ATP competitive BTKi, pirtobrutinib/LOXO405.</p>
<p>The results show distinct conformational changes that occur upon binding each BTKi. The findings show consistent NMR and HDX changes with covalent inhibitors, which move helix aC to an 'out' position and disrupt SH3-kinase interactions, in agreement with X-ray structures of the BTKi complexed with the BTK kinase domain. In contrast, the solution measurements show that pirtobrutinib maintains and even stabilizes the helix aC-in and autoinhibited conformation, even though the BTK:pritobrutinib crystallizes with helix aC-out. This and unexpected variations in NMR and HDX behavior between inhibitors highlight the need for solution measurements to understand drug interactions with the full-length BTK. Overall the findings present good evidence for allosteric effects by each BTKi that induce distal conformational changes which are sensitive to differences in inhibitor structure.</p>
<p>The study goes on to examine BTK mutants T474I and L528W, which are known to confer resistance to pirtobrutinib, zanubritinib, and tirabrutinib. T474I reduces and L528W eliminates BTK autophosphorylation at pY551, while both FL-BTK-WT and FL-BTK-L528W increase HCK autophosphorylation and PLCg phosphorylation. These show that mutants partially or completely inactivate BTK and that inactive FL-BTK can activate HCK, potentially by direct BTK-HCK interactions. But they do not explain drug resistance. However, HDX and NMR show that each mutant alters the effects of BTKi binding compared to WT. In particular, T474I alters the effects of all three inhibitors around W395 and the activation loop, while L528W alters interactions around W395 with tirabrutinib and pirtobrutinib, and does not appear to bind zanubrutinib at all. The study concludes that the mutations might block drug efficacy by reducing affinity or altering binding mode.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work presents convincing evidence that BTK inhibitors alter the conformation of regions distal to their binding sites, including those involved in the SH3-kinase interface, the activation loop, and a substrate binding surface between helix aF and helix aG. The findings add to the growing understanding of allosteric effects of kinase inhibitors, and their potential regulation of interactions between kinase and binding proteins.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The interpretation of HDX, NMR, and kinase assays is confusing in some places, due to ambiguity in quantifying how much kinase is bound to the inhibitor. It would be helpful to confirm binding occupancy, in order to clarify if mutants lower the amount of BTK complexed with BTKi as implied in certain places, or if they instead alter the binding mode. In addition, the interpretation of the mutant effects might benefit from a more detailed examination of how each inhibitor occupies the ATP pocket and how substitutions of T474 and L528 with Ile and Trp respectively might change the contacts with each inhibitor.</p>
