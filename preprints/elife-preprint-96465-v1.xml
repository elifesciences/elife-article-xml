<title>Abstract</title><p>Paralogs CDK8 and CDK19 are regulatory kinases associated with the transcriptional Mediator complex. We have for the first time generated mice with the systemic inducible <italic>Cdk8</italic> knockout on the background of <italic>Cdk19</italic> constitutive knockout. <italic>Cdk8/19</italic> double knockout (DKO) males, but not single <italic>Cdk8</italic> and <italic>Cdk19</italic> KO, had an atrophic reproductive system and were infertile. The DKO males lacked postmeiotic spermatids and spermatocytes after meiosis I pachytene. Testosterone levels were decreased whereas the amounts of the luteinizing hormone were unchanged. Single cell RNA sequencing showed marked differences in the expression of steroidogenic genes (such as <italic>Cyp17a1, Star</italic> and <italic>Fads</italic>) in Leydig cells concomitant with alterations in Sertoli cells and spermatocytes likely associated with impaired synthesis of steroids. <italic>Star</italic> and <italic>Fads</italic> were also downregulated in cultivated Leydig cells after DKO. The treatment of primary Leydig cells culture with a CDK8/19 inhibitor did not induce the same changes in gene expression as DKO, and prolonged treatment of mice with a CDK8/19 inhibitor did not affect the size of testes. DKO, in contrast to single knockouts or treatment with a CDK8/19 kinase inhibitor, led to depletion of cyclin C (CcnC), the binding partner of CDK8/19 that has been implicated in CDK8/19-independent functions. This suggests that the observed phenotype was likely mediated through kinase-independent activities of CDK8/19, such as CcnC stabilization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple protein complexes regulate transcription, in response to developmental cues, changes in environment, damage and other factors, allowing for precise control of gene expression. Among such complexes the multiprotein Mediator complex is especially important for controlling transcription, regulated by a multitude of signaling pathways through their transcription factors (TFs). The Mediator complex bridges the regulatory enhancer regions with promoters thereby recruiting RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and the preinitiation complex. The Mediator possesses its own regulatory subpart – the cyclin dependent kinase module (CKM), containing either the CDK8 or the CDK19 protein kinases, in complex with their binding partner cyclin C (CcnC), as well as proteins MED12 and MED13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Luyties and Taatjes, 2022</xref>). While CKM is a nuclear complex that regulates transcription, both CcnC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ježek et al., 2019</xref>) and MED12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) were shown to have CKM-independent cytoplasmic activities. CDK8/19 kinase activity positively regulates transcription induced by different signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">2017</xref>), at least in part by mediating the RNA Pol II release from pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Steinparzer et al., 2019</xref>). Besides, CDK8 and CDK19 directly phosphorylate a number of transcription factors such as STATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Martinez-Fabregas et al., 2020</xref>), SMADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alarcón et al., 2009</xref>) and others, thereby modulating transcription of cognate genes. CDK8/19 kinase activity also negatively regulates transcription, at least, in part through downregulating the protein levels of all the components of the Mediator and CKM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite important CDK8/19 functions discovered in primary cell culture and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Luyties and Taatjes, 2022</xref>), the insights gained from <italic>in vivo</italic> models are limited. Mice with constitutively knocked out <italic>Cdk19</italic> (CDK19KO) were generated as a part of the COMP project and are basically asymptomatic, fertile, and have normal lifespan. It has been shown recently that <italic>Cdk19</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Lin<sup>-</sup> hematopoietic stem cells divide slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), however the blood cell count was unaffected. Heterozygous mice with constitutive <italic>Cdk8</italic> knockout were asymptomatic but, when crossed, no homozygous pups were born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Postlmayr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Westerling et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, conditional <italic>Cdk8</italic> KO is almost asymptomatic in adult mice. Minor differences were observed in colon epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dannappel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Prieto et al., 2023</xref>) and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McCleland et al., 2015</xref>) as well as in osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yamada et al., 2022</xref>) after tissue specific <italic>Cdk8</italic> knockout. Although two CDK8/19 inhibitors were reported to have systemic toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Clarke et al., 2016</xref>), this toxicity was subsequently found to be due to off-target effects of these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), and several CDK8/19 inhibitors have reached clinical trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> NCT03065010, NCT04021368, NCT05052255, NCT05300438). Several studies reported the existence of kinase-independent phenotypic activities for both CDK8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kapoor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Menzl et al., 2019b</xref>) and CDK19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Audetat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Steinparzer et al., 2019</xref>), but the only known biochemical activity of both Cdk8 and Cdk19 that is kinase-independent is the stabilization of their binding partner CcnC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barette et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Targeted degradation or knockout of both CDK8 and CDK19 dramatically reduces the cellular levels of CcnC, whereas the knockout of either <italic>Cdk8</italic> or <italic>Cdk19</italic> alone has little effect on CcnC levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). The effects of double knockout of both <italic>Cdk8</italic> and <italic>Cdk19</italic> on CcnC should therefore be considered in interpreting the effect of the double knockout.</p>
<p>We have, for the first time, generated mice with a conditional knockout of the <italic>Cdk8</italic> gene on the constitutive <italic>Cdk19</italic> KO background (CDK8/19 double knockout, DKO). We have found that DKO males were completely infertile, had an undersized and dedifferentiated reproductive system. In DKO males, spermatogenesis was blocked after pachytene of meiosis I. DKO showed down-regulation of key steroid pathway genes, such as <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>, <italic>Star</italic> and <italic>Lcn2</italic>, <italic>Sc5d</italic>, <italic>Fads2</italic> and reduced production of testosterone. Expression of key meiotic genes was also deregulated in meiosis I spermatocytes, and the progression of meiosis was halted. These results indicated a key role of the CDK8/19-CcnC complex in the maintenance of male reproductive system.</p>

<title>Cdk8/19 DKO mice are viable and lack Cyclin C</title>
<p>Previously we have crossed <italic>Cdk8</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice with Rosa-Cre/ER<sup>T2</sup> with tamoxifen-inducible Cre activity and demonstrated effective KO in all tissues except for ovaries and uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ilchuk et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, the CDK8 inactivation in the male reproductive system (testes) was efficient at the protein and DNA levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S1A). To investigate the effects of the double knockout of <italic>Cdk8</italic> and <italic>Cdk19</italic>, we crossed <italic>Cdk8<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Rosa-Cre/ER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mice with <italic>Cdk19<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) [MGI:5607862, Cdk19<sup>em1(IMPC)J</sup>], which are asymptomatic and are maintained as homozygotes. We injected tamoxifen into 2 months old <italic>Cdk8<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cdk19<sup>-/-</sup>/Rosa-Cre/ER<sup>T2</sup></italic> male mice. The DKO mice appeared to be viable. Age matched tamoxifen-treated wild-type mice served as a control.</p>

<p>We have also analyzed the levels of the CDK8/19 binding partner CcnC after single and double KOs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in mouse testes after DKO. In agreement with previous observations in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), CcnC was undetectable in DKO embryonic fibroblasts as well as in DKO testes, but not in the single CDK19KO (Supplementary Fig. S1B, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Hence, the stabilization of CcnC by CDK8 and CDK19 occurs not only in human but also in mouse cells and tissues.</p>

<title>Spermatogenesis is blocked in DKO males</title>
<p>To investigate DKO effects we performed necropsy with subsequent H&amp;E staining 8 weeks post tamoxifen treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The most striking results were observed in the urogenital system. The prostate, testes and the epididymis were significantly smaller compared to single KO and tamoxifen-treated wild-type mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>), the diameter of testicular tubules was diminished (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). The germinal epithelium of the tubules was presented by Sertoli cells with typical large light nuclei and some spermatogonia or spermatocytes. Cells at the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis were completely absent. Among the spermatocytes there were only early prophase cells. In contrast, we detected cells with colchicine-like apoptotic bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F,G</xref>, yellow arrows). Thus, in these mice the spermatogenesis progenitor cells were present but their differentiation and/or meiosis was blocked. In Sertoli cells the vacuoles are the sign of the loss of contact between these cells and spermatogenic elements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F,G</xref>). Leydig cells were significantly smaller and were almost depleted of secretory vacuoles suggesting the lack of hormonal activity. The epididymis contained empty tubules; the epithelium appeared undifferentiated, that is, neither typical borders between epithelial cells nor clear Golgi zone were visible. The prostate and the epididymis were also atrophic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). These changes were detectable from 2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment and persistent for at least 6 months (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). However, they were not observed in single KOs (Supplementary Fig. S1C).</p>

<title>DKO and CDK8KO mice are infertile</title>
<p>To prove the DKO infertility we assessed their sexual behavior and number of pups they fathered. As tamoxifen has an impact on the male reproductive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Willems et al., 2011</xref>), the experiments were performed at least 6 weeks post injection and we used tamoxifen-treated C57BL/6 mice as a control.

Three males in each group were kept separately with two outbred CD1 females each for 3 months. Copulative plugs and the number of pups were checked 5 days a week (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Tamoxifen-treated wild-type mice demonstrated normal fertility: 10 plugs were detected and 86 pups were born. The CDK19KO group showed slightly reduced fertility: 32 pups along with an increased number of the plugs (16) probably caused by the lower rate of pregnancy onset. Surprisingly, only two plugs and no pups were observed in the CDK8KO group despite normal appearance and behavior of males, and no microscopic abnormalities in the urogenital system (Supplementary Fig S1). Neither plugs nor pups were detectable in the DKO cohort (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). These experiments showed that both CDK8KO and DKO are infertile, and the cause of CDK8KO infertility is likely to be the lack of sexual behavior.</p>

<title>Spermatogenic cells of DKO mice are unable to advance through meiosis I prophase</title>
<p>To obtain a quantitative spermatogenesis pattern we performed cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. We examined wild-type, single KOs and DKO animals sacrificed two months after tamoxifen treatment. Cell cycle analysis revealed striking differences in DKO mice, with disappearance of elongated spermatids, almost all round spermatids and massive cell death (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A,B</xref>).

<p>Noticeably, the 4n population and cells in the S-phase were not impaired by DKO indicating that DKO spermatogonia successfully entered meiosis but could not produce haploid spermatids. This ongoing “meiotic catastrophe” led to almost full depopulation of the testes in DKO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>С). Due to fast transition from meiosis I to meiosis II it is difficult to detect secondary spermatocytes by flow cytometry. To specify the stage of CDK8/19-dependent spermatogenesis failure we performed phospho-γH2A.X and SYCP3 immunofluorescent staining of seminiferous tubules. Phospho-γH2A.X is a DNA damage marker which marks double-strand breaks in leptotene, zygotene and in sex chromosomes during the pachytene. SYCP3 is a component of the synaptonemal complex, expressed during meiosis I prophase, which forms distinct patterns in the late zygotene/pachytene. In the wild-type tubules all the meiosis stages were visible (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). At the same time almost all meiotic cells in DKO were blocked in the pachytene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), indicating that DKO cells enter meiosis but cannot traverse through meiosis I prophase and subsequently undergo cell death.</p>

<title>Leydig cells</title>
<p>Leydig cells are the primary source for testosterone in the testes, a hormone required for spermatogenesis. scRNAseq analysis showed significant transcriptomic changes in Leydig cells. Among 126 genes that were differentially expressed (|log2FC|&gt;0.4; p&lt;0.01) in WT <italic>vs</italic> DKO Leydig cells, 30 were down-regulated, however among 14 strongly affected genes with |log<sub>2</sub>FC|&gt;1 11 were down-regulated. Strikingly, 9 of 14 strongly downregulated genes were associated with lipid (specifically steroid) metabolism (Supplementary table S1) and 3 of these 9 genes were linked to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aherrahrou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Song, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stoffel et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the GO analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, Supplementary table S2), the most prominent changes were downregulation of lipid metabolism and the steroid hormone biosynthesis. The most significantly down-regulated gene was <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>, showing 10-fold decrease (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> gene in male mice is mainly expressed in Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Missaghian et al., 2009</xref>). The product of this gene catalyzes the key reaction of the steroidogenic pathway. Mice with constitutive <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> KO are phenotypically female (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aherrahrou et al., 2020</xref>). Downregulated <italic>Lcn2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) specifically expressed in Leydig cells codes for a protein of the lipocalin family that transports small hydrophobic molecules including steroids and is affected by fertility manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yanai et al., 2021</xref>). Another downregulated gene, <italic>Fads2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>), is a key enzyme for biosynthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids. Its KO causes infertility in males by arresting the spermatogonial cycle at the stage of the round spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Stroud et al., 2009</xref>). The <italic>Sult1e1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) gene encodes sulfotransferase which inactivates estrogens and its deficiency leads to hyperplasia of Leydig cells and atrophy of seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Song, 2007</xref>). The <italic>Star, Sc5d</italic>, <italic>Pld3</italic> and <italic>Apoc1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) genes, also involved in lipid metabolism, were down-regulated more than 2-fold. Interestingly, the <italic>Hsd3b6</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) is a surprisingly upregulated gene associated with steroid metabolism in Leydig cells.</p>
<p>Not only testosterone production was decreased in double knockouts. Expression of <italic>Insl3</italic> gene, coding for an important peptide hormone secreted by Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Esteban-Lopez and Agoulnik, 2020</xref>), was also reduced (Supplementary table S3).</p>
<p>Among up-regulated genes, were several transcription factors governing steroidogenesis in Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">de Mattos et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ye et al., 2017</xref>). One of them, <italic>Nr2f2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>) encodes COUP-TFII which regulates genes immediately involved in steroidogenesis (<italic>Cyp17a1, Hsd3b1, Cyp11a1</italic> and <italic>Akr1c14</italic>) alongside several other Leydig-specific genes (<italic>Insl3, Amhr2</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Another gene, <italic>Cebpb</italic>, encodes TF C/EBPβ which activates <italic>Star</italic> transcription and stimulates expression of <italic>Nr4a1</italic> (also known as <italic>Nur77</italic>) which is itself a key regulator of steroidogenesis in Leydig cells.</p>
<p>The <italic>Kit</italic> gene (down-regulated), encoding a tyrosine kinase receptor, and <italic>Kitl</italic> gene (up-regulated), encoding its ligand, were also present among differentially expressed genes. Both of these genes play an important role in spermatogenesis (knockouts and mutants are infertile), Leydig cell maturation and steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ye et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<p>According to downregulation of the steroid hormone biosynthesis in Leydig cells we expected to see in Sertoli cells patterns similar to those in mice with Sertoli cell specific KOs of androgen receptor (AR) – SCARKO (Sertoli Cells Androgen Receptor KnockOut) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">De Gendt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Larose et al., 2020</xref>) and luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor – LURKO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Griffin et al., 2010</xref>). However, it must be noted that these mice have constitutive receptor KOs and do not fully develop their reproductive system, whereas our KO model mice develop normally and become fertile before the knockout induction.</p>
<p>Among DEGs we identified a number of upregulated and downregulated genes consistent with their changes in SCARKO (<italic>Defb45</italic>, <italic>Myl6</italic>, <italic>Tmsb4x</italic>, <italic>Espn</italic>, <italic>Ldhb</italic> among top DEGs). At the same time, we compared our DEG set with those published earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">De Gendt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Larose et al., 2020</xref>) and observed little overlap between our data and published results as well as between the two published papers themselves (Supplementary Fig. S3).</p>
<p>However, a much better agreement was found between our data and the study by deGendt et.al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">De Gendt et al., 2014</xref>) at the level of GO Molecular Function and Cellular Compartment categories.</p>
<p>According to the GO Cellular Compartment (Supplementary table S2), both up- and down-regulated genes are associated with cytoskeleton (<italic>Vim</italic>, <italic>Actb</italic>, <italic>Actg1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Show et al., 2003</xref>), apical-basal axis (<italic>Cdc42</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Heinrich et al., 2021</xref>), cellular membrane (<italic>Atp1a1</italic>, <italic>Gja1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rajamanickam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sridharan et al., 2007</xref>) and intercellular contacts (<italic>Espn</italic>, <italic>Anxa2</italic>, <italic>S100a10</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chojnacka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Willems et al., 2010</xref>). These closely related structures play an important role in Sertoli cell functioning: formation of the blood-testicular barrier (BTB) and intercommunication with developing germ cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wong and Cheng, 2009</xref>). Therefore, our findings on differential gene expression in Sertoli cells are in agreement with data obtained in mice with impaired AR signaling. Among the top enriched biological processes several up-regulated stress response pathways were also found, indicating deterioration of the Sertoli cells in the absence of testosterone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>This molecular evidence of Sertoli cell spatial organization disturbance and disruption of cell contacts is in good agreement with the patterns observed during histological examination.</p>

<title>Germ cells</title>
<p>As primary spermatocytes of double knockout mice stop their differentiation in pachytene, we compared gene expression in two groups of germ cells: undifferentiated spermatogonia and meiosis-entry (leptotene-zygotene-pachytene) spermatocytes. 1107 DEGs were identified for undifferentiated cells, 1650 for spermatocytes, and 874 of these genes were common. Almost all the DEGs were up-regulated (99.2%). This overlap may be explained by the fact that undifferentiated and differentiated spermatogonia represent a continuous spectrum with gradually changing transcription patterns. Unique genes for the Early Spermatogonia cluster were attributed by GO as genes related to RNA processing and biosynthesis and ribosome biogenesis, whereas no stem cell specific pathways were found. We conclude that <italic>Cdk8/19</italic> knockout and disruption of steroid biosynthesis and testosterone production have no significant impact specifically on early spermatogonia.</p>
<p>Most cells in knockout testes do not progress to stages after pachytene. Accordingly, apoptosis-related pathways, stress response pathways and the autophagy pathway were upregulated (Supplementary table S2, Supplementary Fig. S4). More specifically, a set of meiosis-specific genes was also up-regulated. These genes were related to chromosome pairing, DNA recombination and histone modification, which are known to be involved in meiosis. We hypothesize that this effect might be caused by compensatory mechanisms triggered by inability to proceed through meiosis.</p>

<p>CYP17A1 catalyzes several key reactions leading to transformation of pregnenolone into testosterone. We measured the concentration of the key androgen hormone - testosterone in the blood of wild-type mice, single KOs and DKO. Only DKO showed significantly lower levels of testosterone, consistent with only this genotype presenting abnormal spermatogenesis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in steroid synthesis in Leydig cells can be caused by several mechanisms – specifically CDK8/19/Cyclin C can regulate CYP17A1 expression in Leydig cells themselves, or CDK8/19/Cyclin C may be involved in regulation of brain hormonal signals, which control testosterone production. To test the latter hypothesis we measured the concentration of luteinizing hormone in blood serum. The results showed no difference in LH level through all the genotypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). This means that CDK8/19/Cyclin C acts directly in Leydig cells to regulate steroidogenesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Mediator complex is a key part of transcriptional regulation through signaling pathways. The enzymatic component of the Mediator-associated CKM module – CDK8 and its paralog CDK19, have emerged as co-regulators in several signal-activated transcriptional pathways, such as Wnt, TGF-beta, androgen and estrogen signaling, STATs, response to serum growth factors and others (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Menzl et al., 2019a</xref>)). Despite that, the knockout of <italic>Cdk8</italic> is only critical in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Westerling et al., 2007</xref>), with no phenotype in adult organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McCleland et al., 2015</xref>), while <italic>Cdk19</italic> is wholly dispensable. The same tendency is observed for the knockout of MED subunits and other CKM proteins: constitutive KOs are often embryonically lethal (except for paralog of MED12 - MED12L), while tissue-specific knockouts in adult animals rarely have a severe phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ilchuk et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Hypothetically CDK8 and CDK19 can compensate for each other in KO animals and mitigate the phenotype in single KOs. To confirm this we produced the first ubiquitous knockout of <italic>Cdk8/19</italic> in 2 months old animals. Previously described animals with conditional knockout of <italic>Cdk8</italic> in the intestine on <italic>Cdk19</italic>-/- background presented with a mild phenotype, moderately affecting the number of specialized secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dannappel et al., 2022</xref>). Our DKO mice had a phenotype evident at the histological level: they lacked haploid spermatids and mature spermatozoa (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), with primary spermatocytes blocked in pachytene of meiosis I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Surprisingly, <italic>Cdk8</italic>-/- males previously described as asymptomatic revealed their infertility due to the lack of sexual behavior, despite the absence of morphological changes in the urogenital system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Mice with Med1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Vasa-Cre tissue specific KO had an opposite phenotype to the one described here: prophase I passage was accelerated in these mice and spermatocytes entered zygotene/pachytene stage prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huszar et al., 2015</xref>). The difference between these effects is quite interesting in the context of the concept that association with CKM attenuates Mediator-dependent transcription either by sterically preventing TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Freitas et al., 2022</xref>), or by post-transcriptional regulation of Mediator complex subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Poss et al., 2016</xref>). As far as we know, besides the current work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huszar et al., 2015</xref> is the only paper establishing a connection between any components of the Mediator complex and spermatogenesis.</p>
<p>We demonstrated a disruption of steroid biosynthesis in Leydig cells which could play the key role for the observed phenotype. A number of works (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ilchuk et al., 2023</xref>)) affirm a significant role of Mediator complex in lipid metabolism and biosynthesis as one of the main cofactors for main adipogenic TFs such as C/EBPα, PPARγ and SREBP.</p>
<p>We detected a decrease in steroidogenic gene expression by scRNAseq (primarily <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>), and then confirmed this finding by WB, immunofluorescence, and direct testosterone measurement. This corresponds well with perturbed Leydig cells morphology (reduced size and secretory vacuoles depletion) and explains observed atrophy of prostate and epididymis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). It is worth mentioning that constitutive <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> knockout in mice leads to female phenotype in XY mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aherrahrou et al., 2020</xref>). Besides <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>, several other steroid metabolism related genes were downregulated (<italic>Lcn</italic>, <italic>Fads</italic>, <italic>Star</italic>, <italic>Sc5d</italic>, <italic>Sult1e1</italic>). Interestingly, the main feature of <italic>Fads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stoffel et al., 2008</xref>)</italic> and <italic>Sult1e1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Song, 2007</xref>) KOs is male infertility, caused by spermatogenesis arrest.</p>
<p>There is much evidence that meiosis in spermatocytes depends on AR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Several papers established a connection between AR signaling, and the Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Russo et al., 2019</xref>). MED1 and MED19 directly interact with the AR and regulate its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Weber et al., 2021</xref>). Additional evidence of the role of the Mediator complex and CDK8/19 in the urogenital system comes from studies of their role in prostate cancer, where CDK19 is elevated together with the AR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Becker et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The DKO has also dramatically impacted Sertoli cells. The SCARKO mice were engineered two decades ago and show morphological abnormalities (i.e, reduced testes, epididymis and prostate, meiotic arrest during meiosis I prophase) similar to DKO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">De Gendt et al., 2004</xref>). The scRNAseq technique used to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the meiotic arrest revealed a number of similarities with DKO data for Sertoli cells, especially in terms of pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, genes associated with cytoskeleton, cellular membrane and cell-cell contacts were enriched among the DEGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Nevertheless, the overlap of genes affected in the SCARKO and DKO mice was low (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, an important difference between our model and SCARKO is that <italic>Cdk8</italic> knockout is induced after puberty. Another important consideration is that Sertoli cells are not the only cell type impacting spermatogenesis through AR signaling. AR signaling in peritubular myoid cells is also essential for successful spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Welsh et al., 2009</xref>). In this regard, probably a more relevant model for comparison with our results is described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Stanton et al., 2012</xref>) where androgen signaling was suppressed in grown-up rats by low dose testosterone, or its combination with an AR antagonist. In this paper the group with the most complete inhibition of AR signaling displayed increased apoptosis in spermatocytes and full blockage of second meiotic division.</p>
<p>Just as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Stanton et al., 2012</xref>), genes differentially expressed in spermatocytes blocked in prophase I can be divided in the following groups: (1) genes with known roles in meiosis, especially DNA synapse, homologous recombination and DNA repair, (2) genes associated with cellular stress and apoptosis, and (3) genes with roles in RNA processing and splicing. Changes in the first group can be explained by the compensatory mechanisms and changes in the second group correlate well with the observed extensive cell death of spermatocytes, changes in the third group remain enigmatic.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, 99.2% of spermatocyte DEGs with |logFc|&gt;0.4 were upregulated genes, which is very similar to the findings of Pelish et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>) and agrees with the negative regulation of the Mediator complex by CDK8/19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these results we can conclude that DKO causes perturbance in different testicular cell types: Leydig cells, Sertoli cells and spermatocytes. We hypothesize that all these changes are caused by disruption of testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells. Data for other cell types are consistent with this hypothesis, however there is still a possibility that CDK8/19 have distinct roles in other testicular cell types which are not visible against the background of the testosterone reduction. However, our data are not sufficient to make the conclusion about the role of CDK8/19/Cyclin C directly in meiosis, besides its hormonal regulation. To answer this question, definitive mouse strains with cell-type specific KO in Sertoli cells and meiotic spermatocytes would be needed.</p>
<p>The effects of DKO on spermatogenesis were maximal at 1-2 months after tamoxifen administration. At later time points we detected partial restoration of spermatogenesis, and signs of re-differentiation of the epididymis and activity of secreting cells in the prostate. This restoration did not lead to the production of mature sperm, and the total number of haploid cells increased insignificantly. There are several possible explanations for such an effect. It is unlikely that restoration happened in cells, which did not activate Cre-Lox, as the absence of CDK8 has been confirmed by us through PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Additionally, no restoration of CYP17A1 was found in 5-month-old animals. There is a possibility that transcription of genes previously regulated by CDK8/19/Cyclin C was rewired through other transcriptional regulators. An intriguing possibility is activation of a compensatory AR-independent pathway that was recently shown in a zebrafish model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Zhai et al., 2022</xref>). An argument against such hypothesis would be the absence of such compensation in <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> KO animals or SCARKO mice, but in the former animals the male reproductive system does not develop at all, and in the latter, non-canonical AR signaling through Src kinase may lead to progression to round spermatid stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cooke and Walker, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The luteinizing hormone produced in the pituitary gland is a major regulator of steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. It was shown that LH regulates expression level of <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> and several other steroidogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ma et al., 2004</xref>). As CDK8KO in our model is ubiquitous, infertility could be caused by decrease of LH level due to improper regulation in the brain. However, we measured LH level in the serum and found it unaffected by single or double KOs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). That means that CDK8/19/Cyclin C are required for steroidogenic genes’ transcription in Leydig cells. And indeed, in our ex vivo experiment with Leydig primary cell culture, even without addition of LH, expression of <italic>Star</italic> and <italic>Fads</italic> was downregulated upon in vitro induction of CDK8KO by hydroxytamoxifen on the CDK19KO background.</p>
<p>The results of the present study reveal for the first time the role of CDK8/19/Cyclin C in the function of the male reproductive system. The key question regarding the results described here is whether the phenotypic effects are due to the inhibition of CDK8/19 kinase activity or to the loss of Cyclin C, which is protected by CDK8 and CDK19 from proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), or other kinase-independent functions of CDK8/19. Here we show that Cyclin C essentially disappears both from the embryo fibroblasts and from the testes of the DKO mice. Given the known CDK8/19-independent functions of Cyclin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ježek et al., 2019</xref>), and the effect of Cyclin C knockout on lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Song et al., 2022</xref>), the likelihood of Cyclin C rather than CDK8/19 mediating the observed effects should be investigated. As we have shown, 30-day treatment of 11 weeks old mice with a potent CDK8/19 kinase inhibitor produced no anatomical changes in the testes. Furthermore, <italic>ex vivo</italic> treatment of Leydig cells with a CDK8/19 inhibitor did not reproduce the DKO effect on gene expression, suggesting that the effects of DKO were kinase-independent and possibly mediated by Cyclin C. A definitive answer to the role of Cyclin C <italic>vs</italic> CDK8/19 kinase activity will require a phenotypic comparison of DKO mice with mice expressing kinase-inactive mutants of CDK8/19 or inducible Cyclin C knockout.</p>

<p>Raw fastq files generation, alignment and read filtering were done by 10x Genomics Cell Ranger 6.1.1 with default settings. Read quality was additionally assessed with FastQC. Reads were aligned to the GRCm38 genome, with an average 95% alignment rate. Raw counts, generated by Cell Ranger 6.1.1, were piped to Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hao et al., 2021</xref>), where additional filtering was applied. Cells with aberrant UMI vs. genes relations were filtered with pagoda2 genes vs. molecule filter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kharchenkolab/pagoda2">https://github.com/kharchenkolab/pagoda2</ext-link>), where minimal counts were set as 1000 and minimal genes as 500. Next, cells with high percentages of mitochondrial genes expressions per cell were excluded, threshold for filtering set as 25%. After that Scrublet doublet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>) score was calculated, cells with scores higher than 0.20 were marked as doublets and excluded. Each sample had more than 5000 high quality cells remaining after filtering. These cells were normalized with the default Seurat method and piped to further filtering and analysis.</p>
<p>To account for ambient gene expression, DecontX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yang et al., 2020</xref>) was used, for which cluster-assigned data is required. For stable cluster assignment, a reference dataset was formed of WT samples, which were integrated via Harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Korsunsky et al., 2018</xref>) and then clustered with Seurat. Clustering was checked against testis cell type markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>) to ensure selection of true clusters that would reiterate across samples. Cluster of cells belonging to the IGB_2 WT sample only, which did not correspond to any cell type and was missing essential housekeeping genes, was discarded as a cluster of low quality cells with no biological relevance. This reference dataset was used for automatic cluster mapping with Seurat for all samples, and received labels were used with DecontX to lessen share of ambient gene expression in data.</p>

<p>Corrected counts for all cells were piped back to Seurat.

Differential expression tests (negative binomial Seurat implementation) were conducted for each chosen cell cluster with WT compared against double knockout, batch effect between samples accounted for with the linear model. All mitochondria, ribosomal and high ambient genes (by DecontX) were excluded from testing. Genes with absolute logFC &lt; 0.4 and genes expressed in less than 20% cells in class were excluded either. Additionally, after testing, all genes with no or almost no expression in double knockout, high expressions in WT, and high expression in WT spermatids were excluded as their differential expression might be caused by different ambient composition in WT, heavily influenced by larger spermatid cell proportion. For Sertoli cells, a small subcluster, potentially caused by technical effects, was excluded before testing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Bruter and colleagues report the effects of inducible deletion of the genes encoding the two paralogous kinases of the Mediator complex in adult mice. The physiological roles of these two kinases, CDK8 and CDK19, are currently rather poorly understood; although conserved in all eukaryotes, and among the most highly conserved kinases in vertebrates, individual knockouts of genes encoding CDK8 homologues in different species have revealed generally rather mild and specific effects, in contrast to Mediator itself. Here, the authors provide evidence that neither CDK8 nor CDK19 are required for adult homeostasis but they are functionally redundant for maintenance of reproductive tissue morphology and fertility in males.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The morphological data on the atrophy of the male reproductive system and the arrest of spermatocyte meiosis are solid and are reinforced by single-cell transcriptomics data, which is a challenging technique to implement in vivo. The main findings are important and will be of interest to scientists in the fields of transcription and developmental biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several major weaknesses.</p>
<p>The first is that data on the general health of mice with single and double knockouts is not shown, nor is there any data on effects in any other tissues. This gives the impression that the only phenotype is in the male reproductive system, which would be misleading if there were phenotypes in other tissues that are not reported. Furthermore, data for the genitourinary system in single knockouts are very sparse; data are described for fertility in Figure 1H, ploidy, and cell number in Figures 2B and C, plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels in Figures 5C and 5D, and morphology of testis and prostate tissue for single Cdk8 knockout in Supplementary Figure 1C (although in this case the images do not appear very comparable between control and CDK8 KO, thus perhaps wider fields should be shown), but, for example, there is no analysis of different meiotic stages or of gene expression in single knockouts. It is worth mentioning that single knockouts seem to show a corresponding upregulation of the level of the paralogue kinase, indicating that any lack of phenotypes might be due to feedback compensation, which would be an interesting finding if confirmed; this has not been mentioned.</p>
<p>The second major weakness is that the correlation between double knockout and reduced expression of genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis is portrayed as a causal mechanism for the phenotypes observed. While this is a possibility, there are no experiments performed to provide evidence that this is the case. Furthermore, there is no evidence showing that CDK8 and/or CDK19 are directly responsible for the transcription of the genes concerned.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors propose that the phenotypes are independent of the kinase activity of CDK8 or CDK19 because treatment of mice for a month with an inhibitor does not recapitulate the effects of the knockout, and nor does expression of two steroidogenic genes change in cultured Leydig cells upon treatment with an inhibitor. However, there are no controls for effective target inhibition shown.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors tried to test the hypothesis that Cdk8 and Cdk19 stabilize the cytoplasmic CcNC protein, the partner protein of the Mediator complex including CDK8/19 and Mediator protein via a kinase-independent function by generating induced double knockout of Cdk8/19. However, the evidence presented suffers from a lack of focus and rigor and does not support their claims.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is the first comprehensive report on the effect of a double knockout of CDK8 and CDK19 in mice on male fertility, hormones, and single-cell testicular cellular expression. The inducible knockout mice led to male sterility with severe spermatogenic defects, and the authors attempted to use this animal model to test the kinase-independent function of CDK8/19, previously reported for humans. Single-cell RNA-seq of knockout testis presented a high resolution of molecular defects of all the major cell types in the testes of the inducible double knockout mice. The authors also have several interesting findings such as reentry into cell cycles by Sertoli cells, and loss of Testosterone in induced dko that could be investigated further.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The claim of reproductive defects in the induced double knockout of CDK8/19 resulted from the loss of CCNC via a kinase-independent mechanism is interesting but was not supported by the data presented. While the construction and analysis of the systemic induced knockout model of Cdk8 in Cdk19KO mice is not trivial, the analysis and data are weakened by the systemic effect of Cdk8 loss, making it difficult to separate the systemic effect from the local testis effect.</p>
<p>The analysis of male sterile phenotype is also inadequate with poor image quality, especially testis HE sections. The male reproductive tract picture is also small and difficult to evaluate. The mice crossing scheme is unusual as you have three mice to cross to produce genotypes, while we could understand that it is possible to produce pups of desired genotypes with different mating schemes, such a vague crossing scheme is not desirable and of poor genetics practice. Also using TAM-treated wild type as control is ok, but a better control will be TAM-treated ERT2-cre; CDK8f/f or TAM-treated ERT2 Cre CDK19/19 KO, so as to minimize the impact from the well-recognized effect of TAM.</p>
<p>While the authors proposed that the inducible loss of CDK8 in the CDK19 knockout background is responsible for spermatogenic defects, it was not clear in which cells CDK8/19 genes are interested and which cell types might have a major role in spermatogenesis. The authors also put forward the evidence that reduction/loss of Testosterone might be the main cause of spermatogenic defects, which is consistent with the expression change in genes involved in steroigenesis pathway in Leydig cells of inducible double knockout. However it is not clear how the loss of Testosterone contributed to the loss of CcnC protein.</p>
<p>The authors should clarify or present the data on where CDK8 and CDK19 as well as CcnC are expressed so as to help the readers understand which tissues both CDK might be functioning in and cause the loss of CcnC. It should be easier to test the hypothesis of CDK8/19 stabilizing CcnC protein using double knock-out primary cells, instead of the whole testis.</p>
<p>Since CDK8KO and CDK19KO both have significantly reduced fertility in comparison with wildtype, it might be important to measure the sperm quantity and motility among CDK8 KO, CDK19KO, and induced DKO to evaluate spermatogenesis based on their sperm production.</p>
<p>Some data for the inducible knockout efficiency of Cdk8 were presented in Supplemental Figure 1, but there is no legend for the supplemental figures, it was not clear which band represented the deletion band, and which tissues were examined. Tail or testis? It seems that two months after the injection of Tam, all the Cdk8 were completely deleted, indicating extremely efficient deletion of Tam induction by two months post administration. Were the complete deletion of Cdk8 happening even earlier? An examination of time points of induced loss would be useful and instructional as to when is the best time to examine phenotypes.</p>
<p>The authors found that Sertoli cells re-entered the cell cycle in the inducible double knockout but stopped short of careful characterization other than increased expression of cell cycle genes.</p>
<p>Overall this work suffered from a lack of focus and rigor in the analysis and lack of sufficient evidence to support their main conclusions.</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>Dko should be appropriately named iDKO (induced dKO).</p>
<p>&quot;suppress spermatogenesis and male fertility&quot; in the title does not fit the evidence presented.</p>
<p>&quot;DKO males, had an understized and dedifferentiated reproductive system?&quot; what is the evidence for &quot;undifferentiated&quot;?</p>
<p>We performed necropsy ? not the right wording here.</p>
<p>Colchicine-lke apoptotic bodies ? what does this mean? Not clear.</p>
<p>Images throughout the manuscript suffer from poor resolution and are often blurry and hard to evaluate.</p>
<p>To pinpoint the meiotic stage defect of iDKO, it is better to use the meiotic chromosome spread approach.</p>

<p>The first is that data on the general health of mice with single and double knockouts is not shown, nor is there any data on effects in any other tissues.

<p>We thank the reviewer for helpful and constructive suggestions that we plan to implement in the revision. We agree with this point and we will add a statement that the effect on the urogenital system was not the only observed phenotype, although it was the most striking histological feature that we found. We did notice some other physiological differences that we are examining in detail and determining their mechanisms, for future publications.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, data for the genitourinary system in single knockouts are very sparse; data are described for fertility in Figure 1H, ploidy, and cell number in Figures 2B and C, plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels in Figures 5C and 5D, and morphology of testis and prostate tissue for single Cdk8 knockout in Supplementary Figure 1C (although in this case the images do not appear very comparable between control and CDK8 KO, thus perhaps wider fields should be shown), but, for example, there is no analysis of different meiotic stages or of gene expression in single knockouts.

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a description of the single KO could be beneficial, but we expect no big differences with the WT or Cre-Ert. We found neither histological differences nor changes in cell counts or ratios of cell types. Our ethical committee also has concerns about sacrificing mice without major phenotypic changes, without a well formulated hypothesis about the observed effects. We plan to add histological pictures to the next version of the article.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising an important point about the paralog upregulation. Indeed, our data on primary cells (supplementary 1B) suggests the upregulation of CDK19 in CDK8KO and vice versa. We will point this out in disc We plan to examine the data for the testis as soon as more tissues are available.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the effects on CDK8/CDK19/CCNC could lead to the observed transcriptional changes in multiple indirect steps. There are, however, major technical challenges in examining the binding of transcription factors in the tissue, especially in Leydig cells which are a relatively minor population.  We will clarify it in the revision, and strengthen this point in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Finally, the authors propose that the phenotypes are independent of the kinase activity of CDK8 or CDK19 because treatment of mice for a month with an inhibitor does not recapitulate the effects of the knockout, and nor does expression of two steroidogenic genes change in cultured Leydig cells upon treatment with an inhibitor. However, there are no controls for effective target inhibition shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern, which we will address in the revision. This study used the same CDK8/19 inhibitor (SNX631-6) as in the recently published study on prostate cancer (doi: 10.1172/JCI176709). That study describes the inhibitor, its target engagement in cell-free and cell-based assays, its anticancer potency, and its transcriptomic effects in vivo, the same dosage strength as in the present study, which phenocopy the effects of CDK8/19 knockdown. Additional data will be included in the revision.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that the effects on the testis could be due to the systemic loss of CDK8 rather than specifically in the testis, and we will clarify it in the revision. We will also clarify that although our results are suggestive that the effects of CDK8/19 knockout are kinase-independent, and that the loss of Cyclin C is a likely explanation for the kinase independence but we do not claim that it is <italic>the</italic> mechanism.</p>

<p>The mice crossing scheme is unusual as you have three mice to cross to produce genotypes, while we could understand that it is possible to produce pups of desired genotypes with different mating schemes, such a vague crossing scheme is not desirable and of poor genetics practice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Indeed, our scheme is not a representation of the actual breeding scheme but just a brief explanation of lineages used for the acquisition of the triple transgenic mice. We will include the full crossing scheme into the revision.</p>

<p>Also using TAM-treated wild type as control is ok, but a better control will be TAM-treated ERT2-cre; CDK8f/f or TAM-treated ERT2 Cre CDK19/19 KO, so as to minimize the impact from the well-recognized effect of TAM.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used TAM-treated ERT2-cre for most of the experiments, and did not observe any major histological or physiological differences with the WT+TAM. We will make sure to present them in the revision.</p>

<p>While the authors proposed that the inducible loss of CDK8 in the CDK19 knockout background is responsible for spermatogenic defects, it was not clear in which cells CDK8/19 genes are interested and which cell types might have a major role in spermatogenesis. The authors also put forward the evidence that reduction/loss of Testosterone might be the main cause of spermatogenic defects, which is consistent with the expression change in genes involved in steroigenesis pathway in Leydig cells of inducible double knockout. However it is not clear how the loss of Testosterone contributed to the loss of CcnC protein.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the spermatogenic defects could be caused by the effects on gene expression in tissues other than Leydig cells. Nevertheless, this is our primary hypothesis since these changes resemble the effects of chemical castration in rats (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3408499/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3408499/</ext-link>), and in SCARKO mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3968405/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3968405/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is actually the reversed scenario proposed by the reviewer. We think that the loss of steroidogenic gene expression is caused by the loss of CDK8/19 and Cyclin C in Leydig cells. This, in turn, leads to a drop of testosterone levels. We will expand this explanation for clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors should clarify or present the data on where CDK8 and CDK19 as well as CcnC are expressed so as to help the readers understand which tissues both CDK might be functioning in and cause the loss of CcnC. It should be easier to test the hypothesis of CDK8/19 stabilizing CcnC protein using double knock-out primary cells, instead of the whole testis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The stabilizing effect of Cdk8/19 on CcnC has been previously discovered and reported in cell culture (doi: 10.1093/nar/gkad538.), and here we have confirmed it at the level of whole tissue.  Due to a limited sensitivity of single cell sequencing (only ~5,000 transcripts are sequenced from total of average 500,000 transcripts per cell, so the low expressed transcripts are not sequenced in all cells) it is challenging to firmly establish CDK8/19 positive and -negative tissues from single cell data because both transcripts are minor. This image will be included in the next version. We plan to resolve this matter using two approaches. First, we will try immunohistochemistry. If this method is not sufficiently sensitive we will analyze published single cell sequencing data from mouse databases and re-analyze our data. So far the former approach was challenging for us due to the absence of anti-mouse antibodies which are specific for CDK8 and CDK19 and work on tissue sections. We and others could not produce a tissue-specific staining, with the currently available commercially available antibodies. The only published specific antibody is currently not available.</p>

<p>Since CDK8KO and CDK19KO have significantly reduced fertility compared to the wild type, it might be important to measure the sperm quantity and motility among CDK8 KO, CDK19KO, and induced DKO to evaluate spermatogenesis based on their sperm production.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this is an interesting question. We did not do spermograms for single KOs but we don’t think that a decreased sperm count would explain CDK8KO infertility as the vasectomized males are able to produce copulative plugs in females whereas CDK8KO males do not, suggesting the absence of mating behavior as a reason for low fertility in the latter genotype.</p>

<p>Some data for the inducible knockout efficiency of Cdk8 were presented in Supplemental Figure 1, but there is no legend for the supplemental figures, it was not clear which band represented the deletion band, and which tissues were examined. Tail or testis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the accidental loss of supplementary figure legends, which will be presented in the next version. The efficiency of CDK8 KO in different tissues was previously examined by us in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/264064">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/264064</ext-link>. The western blot in the MS represents deletion data for the testis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It seems that two months after the injection of Tam, all the Cdk8 were completely deleted, indicating extremely efficient deletion of Tam induction by two months post administration. Were the complete deletion of Cdk8 happening even earlier?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The complete deletion of CDK8 occurs within a week or even as early as 2-3 days in culture, and at least after at two weeks in vivo. We chose the two mo. period to prevent the effect of tamoxifen on gene expression. We examined other time points (Figure 6) and registered the beginning of effects at 2 weeks and maximum effect by one mo.</p>

<p>The authors found that Sertoli cells re-entered the cell cycle in the inducible double knockout but stopped short of careful characterization other than increased expression of cell cycle genes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer, and we will add Ki67 (or equivalent) staining along with Sertoli cell markers.</p>

<p>Dko should be appropriately named iDKO (induced dKO).</p>

<p>We will make the corresponding change.</p>

<p>We performed necropsy ? not the right wording here.
Colchicine-lke apoptotic bodies ? what does this mean? Not clear.</p>

<p>We will amend the next version to address these minor points, and we thank the reviewer for careful reading of the manuscript.</p>

<p>To pinpoint the meiotic stage defect of iDKO, it is better to use the meiotic chromosome spread approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, meiotic spreads would not be feasible or informative, due to a low number of surviving cells in iDKO and the fact that there were evidently no cells in stages after SYCP3+.</p>
