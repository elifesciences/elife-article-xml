<title>Abstract</title><p>The central complex (CX) plays a key role in many higher-order functions of the insect brain including navigation and activity regulation. Genetic tools for manipulating individual cell types, and knowledge of what neurotransmitters and neuromodulators they express, will be required to gain mechanistic understanding of how these functions are implemented. We generated and characterized split-GAL4 driver lines that express in individual or small subsets of about half of CX cell types. We surveyed neuropeptide and neuropeptide receptor expression in the central brain using fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. About half of the neuropeptides we examined were expressed in only a few cells, while the rest were expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells. Neuropeptide receptors were expressed more broadly and at lower levels. Using our GAL4 drivers to mark individual cell types, we found that 51 of the 85 CX cell types we examined expressed at least one neuropeptide and 21 expressed multiple neuropeptides. Surprisingly, all co-expressed a small neurotransmitter. Finally, we used our driver lines to identify CX cell types whose activation affects sleep, and identified other central brain cell types that link the circadian clock to the CX. The well-characterized genetic tools and information on neuropeptide and neurotransmitter expression we provide should enhance studies of the CX.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The central complex (CX) of the adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> brain consists of approximately 2,800 cells that have been divided into 257 cell types based on morphology and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hulse et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wolff et al., 2015</xref>). These cell types are themselves organized into a set of highly structured neuropils (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The CX plays a key role in the flow of information between sensory inputs and motor outputs. It is particularly important in orientation and navigation, and much progress has been made in defining the cell types and circuits involved in these behaviors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fisher 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Green and Maimon 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Keram 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Turner-Evans and Jayaraman 2016</xref>). The CX also appears to participate in sleep and/or activity regulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dubowy and Sehgal 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shafer and Keene 2021</xref>). But these are unlikely to be the only functions performed by the CX.</p>

Redrawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hulse et al. (2021)</xref>.In this paper, we present the results of our efforts to develop and characterize genetic driver lines for CX cell types. We also provide a survey of neuropeptide gene expression in the adult central brain as well as determine neurotransmitter (NT) and neuropeptide (NP) gene expression in over 80 CX cell types. Many CX neurons express NPs, with some cell types expressing multiple NPs as well as a fast-acting neurotransmitter. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our collection of driver lines to screen for cell types that influence activity/sleep when activated. In doing so, we uncovered cell types not previously known to play a role in these processes as well as new pathways of communication between the circadian clock and the CX.</p></caption>

<p>The connectome has provided a detailed wiring diagram of the CX, information that will be critical for understanding how it performs its functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>). However, the functions of most cell types in the CX remain unknown. Gaining this knowledge will likely require measuring and manipulating the activity of individual cell types. Such experiments are greatly facilitated by the availability of cell type-specific genetic driver lines. Such lines also allow biochemical approaches for determining the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides used by individual cells. This is particularly relevant for the CX, which is one of the most peptidergic brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kahsai C Winther, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">NÃ¤ssel and Zandawala, 2019</xref>). The roles of neuropeptide signaling in the CX are largely unexplored.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Generation and analysis of split-GAL4 lines for CX cell types</title>
<p>We generated cell type-specific split-GAL4 lines for CX cell types using the same general approach that we previously applied to the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; Rubin and Aso, 2023) and the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tuthill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Nern et al., 2024</xref>); see methods for details. In a previous report, we described the generation of split-GAL4 lines for cell types innervating the protocerebral bridge (PB), noduli (NO) and asymmetrical body (AB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wolff and Rubin 2018</xref>). Here we extend this work to the rest of the CX and include some improved lines for the PB, NO and AB.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig2S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig2S4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> show the expression of 52 new split-GAL4 lines with strong GAL4 expression that is largely limited to the cell type of interest. Together with the other lines generated in this study and our previous work, we generated high-quality lines for nearly one-third of CX cell types that were defined by analysis of the connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>). We also generated lines of lesser quality for other cell types that in total bring overall coverage to more than three-quarters of CX cell types. These additional lines often show some combination of expression in more than one CX cell type, unwanted expression in other brain areas, or weak or stochastic expression. Supplementary File 1 lists the two best split-GAL4 lines we generated for each CX cell type with comments about their specificity as well as the enhancers used to construct them. Additional split-GAL4 lines used in the sleep and NP/NT studies are also included in this file. Images of all lines are shown at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.janelia.org/split-GAL4">www.janelia.org/split-GAL4</ext-link> and the original confocal stacks of key imaging data can be downloaded from that site. For a subset of lines, images revealing the morphology of individual cells using MCFO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Nern et al., 2015</xref>), and higher resolution images, are also available (see for examples, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig3S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> for examples).

<title>Neurotransmitter expression in CX cell types</title>
<p>To determine what neurotransmitters are used by the CX cell types, we carried out fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using EASI-FISH (Eddison and Irkhe, 2022; Close et al., 2024) on brains that also expressed GFP driven from a cell-type-specific split GAL4 line. In this way, we could determine what neurotransmitters were expressed in over 100 different CX cell types based on which members of a panel of diagnostic synthetic enzymes and transporters they expressed: for acetylcholine, ChAT (choline O-acetyltransferase; acetylcholine synthesis) and, in most cases, VAChT (vesicular acetylcholine transporter); for GABA, GAD1 (glutamate decarboxylase; GABA synthesis); for glutamate, vGlut (vesicular glutamate transporter); for dopamine, ple (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase; dopamine synthesis); for serotonin, SerT (serotonin transporter); for octopamine, Tbh (Tyramine Î²-hydroxylase; converts tyramine to octopamine); and for tyramine, Tdc2 (Tyrosine decarboxylase 2; converts tyrosine to tyramine) accompanied by lack of Tbh.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows two examples of this approach. In panels A-D we provide evidence that the PFGs use the less common neurotransmitter, tyramine. Panels E-H show an example of apparent co-transmission. Here, the FB tangential neuron FB4K expresses RNAs suggesting it can release both acetylcholine and glutamate. Cases of co-transmission using two fast acting neurotransmitters have been described in many organisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Svensson et al., 2019</xref>) including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but are rare and may be post-transcriptionally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Our full results are summarized below, together with our analysis of neuropeptide expression in the same cell types.</p>

PFG neurons were marked by the split-GAL4 line SS52547 together with UAS-myr-GFP and visualized by anti-GFP antibody staining. Brains were treated with DNAse1 and counterstained with high concentrations of DAPI to reveal total RNA in the cytoplasm. PFG cell bodies show expression of Tdc2 but not Tbh indicating that the PFGs use tyramine as a neurotransmitter. Maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of substacks are shown.

<p>Methods for using machine learning to predict neurotransmitter from EM images show great promise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eckstein et al., 2024</xref>). However, they are unlikely to fully replace the need for experimental determination and validation for two reasons. First, rarely used transmitters such as tyramine are problematic due to limited training data. Second, accurate prediction of co-transmission is challenging for current computational approaches.</p>

<title>Survey of neuropeptide and neuropeptide receptor expression in the adult central brain</title>
<p>Neuropeptides provide a parallel mode of communication to wired connections and can act over larger distances using volume transmission (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40"><underline>NÃ¤ssel</underline> 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>). Neuropeptides are widely expressed in the CX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kahsai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">NÃ¤ssel and Zandawala, 2019</xref>) and are likely to play important roles in its function. However, information on the expression of neuropeptides and their receptors is not provided by the connectome. To look for expression of neuropeptides in the CX, we took a curated list of 51 neuropeptide-encoding genes from FlyBase (FB2024_02, released April 23, 2024; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">ÃztÃ¼rk-Ãolak et al., 2024</xref>) and eliminated 12 genes based on their not having been detected in RNA profiling studies of the adult brain. Trissin and Natalisin were added to the FlyBase list based on evidence summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">NÃ¤ssel and Zandawala (2019)</xref>. We only examined a small subset of neuropeptide receptors, selecting those whose cognate neuropeptides we thought might play a role in the CX. We used EASI-FISH to determine the expression patterns of these genes in the adult central brain of females (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The list of 41 neuropeptides and 18 neuropeptide receptors we explored is presented in <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The neuropeptide expression patterns we observed fell into two broad categories. Some neuropeptides, like those whose expression patterns are shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, appeared to be highly expressed in only a few relatively larger cells. Several of these neuropeptidesâfor example, SIFa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Terhzaz et al., 2007</xref>) and Dsk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wu et al., 2020</xref>)âare expressed in broadly arborizing neurons that appear to deliver them to large areas of the brain and ventral nerve cord. In contrast, neuropeptides like those shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> appear to be expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells and appear poised to function by local volume transmission in multiple distinct circuits. NPF and SIFa appear to act in both these modes. As we show below, most of the neuropeptides shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> are expressed in the CX, each in distinct subsets of cell types.</p>
<fig id="fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">

Samples were counterstained with DAPI to visualize the outline of brain tissue. Images are MIPs. We included spab and Nplp1 in our screening although it is unclear whether these are indeed neuropeptides (M. Zandawala, pers. comm.). A higher magnification view of a region of the brain showing NPF expression (indicated by dashed box in J) is shown in K.

<p>Neuropeptide receptors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>) are more broadly, but not uniformly, expressed. In cases where more than one receptor has been identified for a given neuropeptide, such as Dh44 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lee et al., 2023</xref>) and Tk (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7T</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wohl et al., 2023</xref>), the different receptors have distinct expression pattens.</p>

<title>Neuropeptide expression in CX cell types</title>
<p>We selected 17 neuropeptides whose transcripts were observed in cell bodies located in the same general brain areas as those of the intrinsic cells of the CX (see <xref rid="fig5S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We used probes for these 17 genes to perform EASI-FISH on brains that also expressed GFP in a specific cell type.

<caption><p>Summary of neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression as determined by EASI-FISH performed on adult brains in which selected cell types were marked by a split-GAL4 lines driving GFP expression. About half of all CX cell types were examined using probes for the following 15 NPs: AstA, AstC, CCAP, CCHa1, CCHa2, Dh31, Dh44, FMRFa, Mip, Ms, NPF, Proc, SIFA, sNPF and Tk. All NPs except CCAP, CCHa1, and CCHa2 showed expression in at least one cell type. We excluded <italic>s</italic>pab and Nplp1 from the genes in this Figure, as it is unclear whether these are indeed neuropeptides (M. Zandawala, pers. comm.); however, data on their expression in the listed cell types is given in Supplemental File 1. See <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> for examples of the experimental data supporting these conclusions. The specific split-GAL4 driver(s) used for each cell type and other information are given in Supplemental File 1. Results are coded for signal strength by typeface as indicated. The color shading used for neurotransmitters indicates what we believe to be the most likely transmitter used by each cell type. âNone detectedâ indicates that an experiment was performed, whereas a âââ indicates no experimental data. To determine neurotransmitter expression various combinations of probe sets were used as indicated: 1, ChAT and VAChT (choline O-acetyltransferase, and vesicular acetylcholine transporter; GAD1 (glutamate decarboxylase), vGlut (vesicular glutamate transporter); 2, ple (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase), SerT (serotonin transporter), Tbh (Tyramine Î² hydroxylase); 3, Tdc2 (Tyrosine decarboxylase 2), Tbh; 4, Tdc2; and 5, SerT, ple, Tdc2. In general, all lines were first probed with probe set 1 which reveals expression of genes involved in transmission by acetylcholine (ChAT), GABA (GAD) and glutamate (vGlut). Then a subset of lines was probed for genes involved in transmission by dopamine (ple), serotonin (SerT), octopamine (Tbh and Tdc2) and tyramine (Tdc2).</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="619448v1_fig9.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>A few general features emerge from these data. First, more than half of the cell types assayed express a neuropeptide. This frequency is perhaps not surprising given that the CX is considered one of the most peptidergic regions of the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kahsai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">NÃ¤ssel and Zandawala, 2019</xref>); nevertheless, the fraction of cells expressing an NP appears to be several fold higher in the CX than observed in the adult brain as a whole, as judged by single cell RNA profiling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Davies et al., 2018</xref>). Second, in every case cell types expressing a neuropeptide also express a small molecule neurotransmitter (see Nassel 2018 for a discussion of other cases of co-expression). This co-transmitter is most often acetylcholine or glutamate, but we observed cases of GABA, dopamine, tyramine, octopamine, and serotonin. Third, co-transmission of two small molecule, fast-acting transmitters does occur but is rare. Conversely, co-transmission of a fast-acting transmitter and a modulatory transmitter such as serotonin is common: nine of ten cell types expressing the serotonin transporter also appear to express another small transmitter, most often glutamate or acetylcholine. Octopamine is often, but not always, co-expressed with glutamate (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sherer et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Screen for cell types whose activation modifies sleep</title>
<p>Sleep is a complex behavior that has been widely studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dubowy and Sehgal 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shafer and Keene 2021</xref>). The phenotypic description of sleep and its relationship to activity, as well as the cell types that play a role in sleep regulation are under active study in many labs. The CX has been documented to be a significant brain region for sleep regulation. But many cell types in the CX have never been assayed for a role in sleep due to the lack of suitable genetic reagents. Therefore, we used our genetic drivers for CX cell types to screen for those whose activation by thermogenetics or optogenetics strongly influenced sleep or activity. As described in methods, we used three metrics: sleep duration; P(Doze), the probability that an active fly will stop moving; and P(Wake), the probability that a stationary fly will start moving. These assays were carried out over several years in parallel with our building the collection of lines, so many of the lines we assayed did not make it into our final collection of selected lines. Conversely, we did not assay all our best lines as many only became available after our behavior experiments were completed.</p>
<p>Our screen identified several cell types not previously associated with sleep and/or activity regulation. For example, hDeltaF was found to be strongly wake promoting (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>). We also identified PEN_b (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1), PFGs (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2), EL (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3) and hDeltaK (Figure 1âfigure supplement 4) as likely to play a role. In most of these cases, we were able to assay multiple independent driver lines for the cell type. We also assayed several lines that each contained a mixture of dorsal FB cell types (Figure 1âfigure supplement 5) but were otherwise free of contaminating brain or VNC expression. In addition to intrinsic components of the CX, we evaluated several cell types that, based on the connectome, we thought likely to convey information from the circadian clock to the CX. <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref> (SMP368) and <xref rid="fig11S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 11âfigure supplement 1</xref> (SMP531) present two such cases of strongly wake promoting cell types.</p>

(A) Thermogenetic activation and DAM based monitoring using the split-GAL4 lines SS54903, SS53683 and SS63959 produced decreased sleep duration and increased P(Wake) in all three lines as compared to the control (empty-GAL4). The sleep profile indicated a stronger suppression of sleep during nighttime in males and reduced sleep during both day and nighttime in females. (B) Optogenetic activation and video-based tracking showed that two split-GAL4 lines (SS54903 and SS53683) have decreased sleep duration, and all three tested lines have increased P(Wake) in male flies during optogenetic activation. All three lines showed decreased sleep and increased P(Wake) in female flies. As observed with thermogenetic activation, these phenotypes were more pronounced for nighttime sleep in males. In addition to sleep duration and P(Wake) we also measured activity by beam counts/waking minute in the DAM assays and pixel movements/waking minute in video tracking. We found that activation of hDeltaF does not increase these measures, showing that observed changes are not attributable to hyperactivity (see Supplementary Files 3-6).

<p>Results for lines not discussed in detail in the main paper are provided as Supplementary Files. Supplementary Files 3 and 4 give results for 600 split-GAL4 lines assayed by thermogenetic activation with TRPA1 in both males and females, respectively. Supplementary Files 5 (males) and 6 (females) present results on over 200 lines, selected based on the results of thermogenetic activation, that were also assayed by optogenetic activation with CsChrimson. Images of the expression patterns of these lines and their genotypes can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flylight-raw.janelia.org/">https://flylight-raw.janelia.org/</ext-link>. The set of lines is anatomically biased with the dorsal FB overrepresented, and many lines contain multiple cell types and non-CX expression. Nevertheless, we believe these data might be useful as a starting point for further exploration.</p>
<p>The goal of our screen was to identify candidate cell types that warranted further study. While we identified several new potential sleep regulating cell types within CX, we did not perform the additional characterization needed to elucidate the roles of these cell types. For example, we did not examine the effects of inhibiting their function. Nor did we examine parameters such as arousal thresholds or recovery from sleep deprivation. Finally, by using only a 24-hour activation protocol we might have missed features only observable in shorter activation protocols. On the other hand, we assayed all lines in both males and females with identical genetic and environmental manipulations and many lines were evaluated by both optogenetic and thermogenetic activation. We observed that many lines showed phenotypes that differed between sexes, even though the expression patterns of the split-GAL4 lines did not obviously differ across sexes. Lines that showed strong effects generally did so with both activation modes and with both beam crossing-based activity measures and video-based locomotion tracking.</p>

<title>Connections between the CX and the circadian clock</title>
<p>Not surprisingly, the connectome reveals that many of the intrinsic CX cell types with sleep phenotypes are connected by wired pathways (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> and <xref rid="fig12S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 12âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The connectome also suggested pathways from the circadian clock to the CX. Some of these have been previously noted. Links between clock output DN1 neurons to the ExR1 have been described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lamaze et al. (2018)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Guo et al. (2018)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liang et al. (2019)</xref> described a connection from the clock to ExR2 (PPM3) dopaminergic neurons. We found two SMP cell types, SMP368 and SMP531, that were very strongly wake-promoting when activated suggesting they might be components of previously undescribed wired pathways from the clock to the CX.</p>

<caption><p>Circuit diagram of CX cells implicated in regulating sleep. Selected CX cell types, plus non-CX cell types SMP368, LNd and OA-VPM3, are shown. The number within each circle denotes the number of cells in that cell type. The neurotransmitters used by each cell type are indicated by color coding, and the number of synapses between cell types is represented by arrow width. Cell types that have been shown to promote sleep or wake when activated are indicated. Experimental evidence for the wake promoting effects of OA-VPM3 is from Reyes, M and Sitaraman D (in preparation). In cases where we have experimentally determined expression of neuropeptides or neuropeptide receptor genes by either EASI-FISH or RNA profiling, this information is indicated in the boxes next to the relevant cell type. Cell type names are from the hemibrain release 1.2.1 except for the LNd neurons whose names have been modified based on morphology and connectivity; they have been grouped into two types: LNd (E1) corresponds to hemibrain body IDs 5813056917 + 5813021192 and LNd (E2) corresponds to hemibrain body IDs 511051477 (5<sup>th</sup> LNv) + 5813069648 (LNd6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shafer et al., 2022</xref>). Because the CX is a central body and the inputs from CX cells that have their soma in right or left hemisphere appear to be comingled on their downstream targets, the synaptic strengths shown represent the combined number of cells of each type, regardless of soma position. For example, the arrow thickness between FB6F and hDeltaF reflects the total number of synapses (368) from FB6F_R and FB6F_L to all hDeltaF cells; the individual synapse number between each of the two FB6F cells to each of the eight hDeltaF cells, which ranges from 7 to 39, can be found in neuPrint. The sole exception is the LNd cells where the synaptic strength represents only the output of LNds in the right hemisphere. See Figure 53 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hulse et al.

<p>In addition to these wired pathways, our work supports the possibility of signaling from the clock over considerable distances to the CX using neuropeptides. Our RNA profiling of ER5 cells (<xref rid="fig9S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 9â figure supplement 1</xref>), which are known to be regulators of sleep and sleep homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), revealed expression of receptors for both PDF and Dh44. The presence of the PDF receptor in ER5 cells was suggested by prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Im C Taghert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Parisky et al., 2008</xref>; Pirez et al., 2013). We confirmed these observations and showed that ER5 cells make Dh31 (<xref rid="d1e1118" ref-type="fig">video 1</xref>). Dh44 has been implicated as a clock output that regulates locomotor activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cavanaugh et al., 2014</xref>) and the DH44R1 receptor has been shown to function in sleep regulation in non-CX cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">King et al., 2017</xref>). However, the presence of the Dh44R2 receptor in the EB was unexpected. Dh31 is expressed by many cells in the fly brain (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>) including DN1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kunst et al., 2014</xref>) and has been shown to play a role in sleep regulation; the cellular targets of Dh31 released from ER5 are unknown, however previous work (Goda et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mertens et al., 2005</xref>) has shown that Dh31 can activate the PDF receptor raising the possibility of autocrine signaling. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andreani et al. (2022)</xref> also showed a functional link between the clock and ER5 cells, but the circuit mechanism was not elucidated.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>We provide a greatly enhanced set of genetic reagents for manipulating the intrinsic cell types of the CX that will be instrumental in fully elucidating the many functions of the CX. We illustrate their use in discovering cell types involved in activity regulation, and uncovered new potential wired and peptidergic connections between the circadian clock and the CX. We surveyed neuropeptide and neuropeptide receptor gene expression in the adult central brain. Neuropeptides fell into two broad categories, those at are expressed in only a few cells and those that are expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells. We observed that neuropeptide receptor genes were much more broadly expressed than those of their cognate neuropeptides. Finally, we generated the largest available dataset of co-expression of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters in identified cell types. Unexpectedly, we found that all neuropeptide-expressing cell types also expressed a small neurotransmitter. Our data reveal the pervasive potential for peptidergic communication within the CXâmore than half of the cell types we examined expressed a neuropeptide and one-third of those expressed multiple neuropeptides.</p>

<title>Generation of split-GAL4 lines</title>
<p>Split-GAL4 lines were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dionne et al. 2018</xref>). Databases of expression patterns generated in the adult brain by single genomic fragments cloned upstream of GAL4 (Jennet et al., 2012; Tirian et al., 2012) were manually or computationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meissner et al., 2023</xref>) screened. Individual enhancers that showed expression in the desired cell type were then cloned into vectors that contained either the DNA-binding or activation domain of GAL4 (Luan et al, 2008; Pfeiffer et al., 2012). These constructs were combined in the same individual and screened for expression in the desired cell type by confocal imaging. Over 15,000 such screening crosses were performed to generate the new split-GAL4 lines reported here. Successful constructs were made into stable lines.</p>

Split-GAL4 images are shown as MIPs after alignment to JRC2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bogovic et al., 2020</xref>).

<p>Determining the correspondence between the cell-types present in each split-GAL4 line and those described in the connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hulse et al., 2021</xref>) was based solely on morphology. Even when assigning correspondence between cells in two different connectomes, where information on connectivity can also be employed, the process is not always straightforward (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schlegel et al. 2024</xref>). Because of the similarity in morphology of many of the CX cell types it was often challenging to assign correspondence to the cell types defined by connectome analysis. For this reason, we rated our confidence in our assignments as Confident, Probable or Candidate and include this information for each line at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://janelia.org">janelia.org</ext-link>/split-GAL4. To be considered confident, we judged our opinion had a &gt;95% chance of being correct. Such assignments were generally only possible for cell types which had morphological features clearly distinct from those in other cell types. Most assignments were rated as Probable indicating 70-95% confidence. Lines whose cell type assignments are listed as Probable have been rigorously examined and the assignments are the most accurate that the available data allow. In the absence of single-cell data available in MCFO brains (the case for many lines) or additional data (for example, physiological data on connectivity), cell types that are morphologically very similar cannot be distinguished with complete confidence. Lines whose cell type assignments are listed as Candidate are even less certain (30-70% confidence).</p>

The 96-well plates with flies were placed in holders, constantly illuminated from below using an 850 nm LED board (Smart Vision Lights Inc) and imaged from top using a FLIR Flea 3 camera (Edmund Optics Inc). 635 nm red light (for optogentic activation) was provided using an additional backlight, low levels of white light (to provide a light-dark cycle) were supplied from above. Optogenetic activation was for a 24 h period (starting in the morning at the same time as the white light was turned on for the day) and was delivered in pulses of 25 ms duration at 2 Hz frequency. Each experiment also included at least one full day without the red light preceding and following the activation day (matching the general design of the thermogenetic experiments).</p>
<p>Fly movement was tracked using single fly position tracker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cgoina/pysolo-tools">GitHub - cgoina/pysolo-tools</ext-link>) and processed for sleep duration and other sleep parameters using SCAMP. In addition to the 5 min criteria, used to define total duration of sleep, P(Doze), the probability that an active fly will stop moving, and P(Wake), the probability that a stationary fly will start moving provide key additional measures of inactivity and activity and were included in our analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wiggin et al., 2020</xref>). These sleep measures are presented in <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref> and <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> (and supplements) and supplementary files 3,4,5, and 6.</p>

<title>Supplemental Files for sleep phenotypes</title>
<p>The supplemental files present data on day1 (baseline) and day 2 (activation). Given the large effects of environmental conditions on activity, we calculated p values between experimental and control group within the same environmental conditions. However, we also present mean differences between the days as a complementary way to identify lines that modified sleep when activated.</p>

Effects on activity of thermogenetic (A) and optogenetic (B) activation of PEN_b using split-GAL4 lines SS02232 and SS54295 is shown. Specifically, thermogenetic activation of these split-GAL4 lines decreases sleep duration and increases P(Wake) in males but only SS02232 is wake promoting in females. Optogenetic activation of SS02232 suppresses sleep and increases P(Wake) in both males and females supporting the general function of these neurons as wake-promoting. While both lines show high cell type specificity and minimal VNC expression, SS54295 has stochastic expression that might explain the weaker wake promoting effect seen with this line.

<caption><p>Activation phenotype of PFGs. Thermogenetic (A) and optogenetic (B) activation of PFGs reveals sexually dimorphic sleep behavior. We tested four different split-GAL4 lines for this cell type. All four lines display expression in the VNC complicating interpretation of the results. To mitigate this issue, we used lines with different hemidriver parents and visually distinct VNC expression patterns (C-F). The brain and VNC are outlined in red. Optogenetic activation (Day 2) in female flies showed increased sleep in all four driver lines and a mild increase in sleep duration in one of lines for male flies (SS52547). However, P(Doze) was consistently higher in male and female flies for all tested PFGs lines. Thermogenetic activation (Day 2) also shows sex specific phenotypes and two of the four lines (SS62596 and SS52590) have increased sleep. SS20046 has decreased sleep in females and male flies with dTRPA1 based activation but shows increased sleep with CsChrimson in females. Despite these inconsistencies, the data suggest a sex specific sleep promoting effect for this cell type. (G-H) Higher resolution images of the relevant brain area of SS62596 and SS52547.

<caption><p>Activation phenotype of hDeltaK. This group of intrinsic columnar neurons is highly peptidergic and has been implicated in chronic social isolation-induced sleep loss (Li et al., 2021). We tested four split-GAL4 lines (SS59455, SS63089, SS54676 and SS59410). Our results do not give a consistent view of the role of this cell type in sleep regulation. (A) Thermogenetic activation of one of the four lines (SS59410) was wake-promoting in both sexes, while two (SS59455 and SS63089) were sleep-promoting in males, but not females. (B) Consistent to what was observed with thermogenetic activation, optogenetic activation of SS59410 also suppressed sleep in males and females, while SS59410 and SS59455 were sleep promoting in males, but not in females. (C-F) MIP images of GFP-driven expression in the brain and VNC of the four spilt-GAL4 lines. The brain and VNC are outlined in red. (G) Higher resolution images of the relevant brain area of in SS54676 (H) Same as panel G, but with neuropil reference. (I) Morphology of individual neurons revealed by stochastic labelling. We do not have any insight into the differences in behaviors between lines and cannot make an overall conclusion of their role in sleep regulation. Such line-to-line inconsistencies argue for caution in the interpretation of results, especially when only one line for a cell type has been assayed.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work is meant to help create a foundation for future studies of the Central Complex, which is a critical integrative center in the fly brain. The authors present a systematic description of cellular elements, cell type classifications, behavioral evaluations and genetic resources available to the Drosophila neuroscience community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work contributes new, useful and systematic technical information in compelling fashion to support future studies of the fly brain. It also continues to set a high and transparent standard by which large-scale resources can be defined and shared.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>manuscript p. 1</p>
<p>
&quot;The central complex (CX) of the adult Drosophila melanogaster brain consists of approximately 2,800 cells that have been divided into 257 cell types based on morphology and connectivity (Scheer et al., 2020; Hulse et al. 2021; Wolff et al., 2015).&quot;</p>
<p>
The 257 accumulated cell types have informational names (e.g., PBG2â9.sâFBl2.bâNO3A.b) in addition to their associations with specific Gal4 lines and specific EM Body IDs. All this is very useful. I have one suggestion to help a reader trying to get a &quot;bird's eye view&quot; of such a large amount of detailed and multi-layered information. Give each of the 257 CX cell types an arbitrary number: 1 to 257. In fact, Supplemental File 2 lists ~277 cell types each with a number in sequence, so perhaps in principle, it is there. This could expedite the search function when a reader is trying to cross-reference CX cell type information from the text, to the Figures and/or to the Supplemental Figures. Also, the use of (arbitrary) cell type numbers could expedite the explanation of which cell types are included in any compilation of information (e.g., which ones were tested for specific NT expression).</p>
<p>manuscript p 2</p>
<p>
&quot;Figure 2 and Figure 2-figure supplements 1-4 show the expression of 52 new split-GAL4 lines with strong GAL4 expression that is largely limited to the cell type of interest. .... We also generated lines of lesser quality for other cell types that in total bring overall coverage to more than three quarters of CX cell types.&quot;</p>
<p>
This section describes the generation and identification of specific split Gal4 lines, and the presentation is generally excellent. It represents an outstanding compendium of information. My reading of the text suggests ~200 cell types have Gal4 lines that are of immediate use (having high specificity or v close-to-high). Use of an arbitrary number system (mentioned above) could augment that description for the reasons stated. For example, which of the 257 cell types are represented by split Gal4 lines that constitute the ~1/3 representing &quot;high-quality lines &quot;? A second comment relates to this study 's functional analysis of the contributions of CX cell types to sleep physiology. The recent literature contains renewed interest in the specific expression patterns of Gal4 lines that can promote sleep-like behaviors. In particular Gal4 line expression outside the brain (in the VNC and outside the CNS) have been raised as important elements that need be included for interpretation interpretation of sleep regulation. This present study offers useful information about a large number of expression patterns, as well as a basis with which to seek additional information., including mention of VNC expression in many cases However, perhaps I missed it, but I could not find a short description of the over-all strategy used to describe the expression patterns and feel that could be helpful. Were all Gal4 lines studied for expression in the VNC? and in the peripheral NS? It is probably published elsewhere, but even a short reprise would still be useful.</p>
<p>manuscript p 9</p>
<p>
Neurotransmitter expression in CX cell types</p>
<p>
&quot;To determine what neurotransmitters are used by the CX cell types, we carried out fluorescent in situ hybridization using EASI-FISH (Eddison and Irkhe, 2022; Close et al., 2024) on brains that also expressed GFP driven from a cell-type-specific split GAL4 line. In this way, we could determine what neurotransmitters were expressed in over 100 different CX cell types based on ....&quot;</p>

Reading this description, I was uncertain whether the &gt;100 cell types mentioned were tested with all the NT markers by EASI-FISH? Also, assigning arbitrary numbers to the cell types (same suggestion as above) could help the reader more readily ascertain which were the ~100 cell types classified in this context.</p>
<p>manuscript p 10</p>
<p>
&quot;Our full results are summarized below, together with our analysis of neuropeptide expression in the same cell types.&quot;</p>
<p>
I recommend specifying which Figures and Tables contain the &quot;full results&quot; indicated.</p>
<p>NP expression in CX cell types</p>
<p>
Similar to the comments regarding studies of NT expression: were all ~100 cell types tested with each of the 17 selected NPs? Arbitrary numerical identifies could be useful for the reader to determine which cell types/ lines were tested and which were not yet tested</p>
<p>manuscript p. 11</p>
<p>
&quot;The neuropeptide expression patterns we observed fell into two broad categories.&quot;</p>
<p>
This section presents information that is extensive and extremely useful. It supports consideration of peptidergic cell signaling at a circuits level and in a systematic fashion that will promote future progress in this field. I have two comments. First, regarding the categorization of two NP expression patterns, discernible by differences in cell number: this idea mirrors one present in prior literature. Recently the classification of the transcription factor DIMM summarizes this same two-way categorization (e.g., doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0001896). That included the fact that a single NP can be utilized by cell of either category.</p>
<p>Second, regarding this comment:</p>
<p>
&quot;In contrast, neuropeptides like those shown in Figure 6 appear to be expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells and appear poised to function by local volume transmission in multiple distinct circuits.&quot;</p>
<p>
Signaling by NPs in this second category (many small cells) suggests more local diffusion, a smaller geographic expanse compared to &quot;volume&quot; signaling by the sparser larger peptidergic cells. Given this, I suggest re-consideration in using the term &quot;volume&quot; in this instance, perhaps in favor of &quot;local&quot; or &quot;paracrine&quot;. This is only a suggestion and in fact rests almost entirely on speculation/ interpretation, as the field lacks a strong empirical basis to say how far NPs diffuse and act. A recent study in the fly brain of peptide co-transmitters (doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2020.04.025) provides an instructive example in which differences between the spatial extents of long-range (peptide 1) versus short-range (peptide 2) NP signaling may be inferred in vivo.</p>
<p>Spab was mentioned (Figure 6 legend) but discarded as a candidate NP to include based on a personal communication, as was Nplp1. The manuscript did not include reasons to do so, nor include a reference to spab peptide. I suggest including explicit reasons to discard candidate NPs.</p>
<p>In Fig 9-supplement 1, neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes were measured by RNA-seq for given CX cell types to augment the cell type classification. The same methods could be used to support cell type classification regarding putative peptidergic character (in Figure 9 supplement 2) by measuring expression levels of critical, canonical neuropeptide biosynthetic enzymes. These include the proprotein convertase dPC2 (amon); the carboxypeptidase dCPD/E (silver); and the amidating enzymes dPHM; dPal1; dPal2. PHM is most related to DBM (dopamine beta monooxygenase), the rate limiting enzyme for DA production, and greater than 90% of Drosophila neuropeptides are amidated. If the authors are correct in surmising widespread use of NPs by CX cell types (and I expect they are), there could be diagnostic value to report expression levels of this enzyme set across many/most CX cell types.</p>
<p>Comment #6</p>
<p>
Screen of effects on Sleep behavior</p>
<p>
This work is large in scope and as suggested likely presents excellent starting points for many follow-up studies. I again suggest assigning stable number identities to the elements described. In this case, not cell types, but split Gal4 lines. This would expedite the cross-referencing of results across the four Supplemental Files 3-6. For example, line SS00273 is entry line #27 in S Files 3 and 4, but line entry #18 in S Files 5 and 6.</p>
<p>manuscript p 26</p>
<p>
Clock to CX</p>
<p>
&quot;Not surprisingly, the connectome reveals that many of the intrinsic CX cell types with sleep phenotypes are connected by wired pathways (Figure 12 and Figure 12-figure supplement 1).&quot;</p>
<p>
Do intrinsic CX cells with sleep phenotypes also connect by wired pathways to CX cells that do not have sleep phenotypes?</p>
<p>&quot;The connectome also suggested pathways from the circadian clock to the CX. Links between clock output DN1 neurons to the ExR1 have been described in Lamaze et al. (2018) and Guo et al. (2018), and Liang et al. (2019) described a connection from the clock to ExR2 (PPM3) dopaminergic neurons.&quot;</p>
<p>
The introduction to this section indicates a focus on connectome-defined synaptic contacts. Whereas the first two studies cited featured both physiological and anatomic evidence to support connectivity from clock cells to CX, the third did not describe any anatomical connections, and that connection may in fact be due to diffuse not synaptic signaling</p>
<p>I could not easily discern the difference between Figs 12 and 12-S1? These appear to be highly-related circuit models, wherein the second features more elements. Perhaps spell out the basis for the differences between the two models to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<p>&quot;...the cellular targets of Dh31 released from ER5 are unknown, however previous work (Goda et al., 2017; Mertens et al., 2005) has shown that Dh31 can activate the PDF receptor raising the possibility of autocrine signaling.&quot;</p>
<p>
Regarding pharmacological evidence for Dh31 activation of Pdfr: strong in vivo evidence was developed in doi: 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.02.018: a strong pdfr mutation greatly reduces response to synthetic dh31 in neurons that normally express Pdfr</p>
<p>manuscript p 30</p>
<p>
&quot;Unexpectedly, we found that all neuropeptide-expressing cell types also expressed a small neurotransmitter.&quot;</p>
<p>
Did this conclusion apply only to CX cell types? - or was it also true for large peptidergic neurons? Prior evidence suggests the latter may not express small transmitters (doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2009.11.065). The question pertains to the broader biology of peptidergic neurons, and is therefore outside the strict scope of the main focus area - the CX. However, the text did initially consider peptidergic neurons outside the CX, so the information may be pertinent to many readers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Wolff et al. describe an impressive collection of newly created split-GAL4 lines targeting specific cell types within the central complex (CX) of Drosophila. The CX is an important area in the brain that has been involved in the regulation of many behaviors including navigation and sleep/wake. The authors advocate that to fully understand how the CX functions, cell-specific driver lines need to be created. In that respect, this manuscript will be of very important value to all neuroscientists trying to elucidate complex behaviors using the fly model. In addition, and providing a further very important finding, the authors went on to assess neurotransmitter/neuropeptides and their receptors expression in different cells of the CX. These findings will also be of great interest to many and will help further studies aimed at understanding the CX circuitries. The authors then investigated how different CX cell types influence sleep and wake. While the description of the new lines and their neurochemical identity is excellent, the behavioral screen seems to be limited.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The description of dozens of cell-specific split-GAL4 lines is extremely valuable to the fly community. The strength of the fly system relies on the ability to manipulate specific neurons to investigate their involvement in a specific behavior. Recently, the need to use extremely specific tools has been highlighted by the identification of sleep-promoting neurons located in the VNC of the fly as part of the expression pattern of the most widely used dorsal-Fan Shaped Body (dFB) GAL4 driver. These findings should serve as a warning to every neurobiologist, make sure that your tool is clean. In that respect, the novel lines described in this manuscript are fantastic tools that will help the fly community.</p>
<p>
(2) The description of neurotransmitter/neuropeptides expression pattern in the CX is of remarkable importance and will help design experiments aimed at understanding how the CX functions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) I find the behavioral (sleep) screen of this manuscript to be limited. It appears to me that this part of the paper is not as developed as it could be. The authors have performed neuronal activation using thermogenetic and/or optogenetic approaches. For some cell types, only thermogenetic activation is shown. There is no silencing data and/or assessment of sleep homeostasis or arousal threshold. The authors find that many CX cell types modulate sleep and wake but it's difficult to understand how these findings fit one with the other. It seems that each CX cell type is worthy of its own independent study and paper. I am fully aware that a thorough investigation of every CX neuronal type in sleep and wake regulation is a herculean task. So, altogether I think that this manuscript will pave the way for further studies on the role of CX neurons in sleep regulation.</p>
<p>
(2) Linked to point 1, it is possible that the activation protocols used in this study are insufficient for some neuronal types. The authors have used 29{degree sign} for thermogenetic activation (instead of the most widely used 31{degree sign}) and a 2Hz optogenetic activation protocol. The authors should comment on the fact that they may have missed some phenotypes by using these mild activation protocols.</p>
<p>
(3) There are multiple spelling errors in the manuscript that need to be addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors created and characterized genetic tools that allow for precise manipulation of individual or small subsets of central complex (CX) cell types in the Drosophila brain. They developed split-GAL4 driver lines and integrated this with a detailed survey of neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression and receptor localization in the central brain. The manuscript also explores the functional relevance of CX cell types by evaluating their roles in sleep regulation and linking circadian clock signals to the CX. This work represents an ambitious and comprehensive effort to provide both molecular and functional insights into the CX, offering tools and data that will serve as a critical resource for researchers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The extensive collection of split-GAL4 lines targeting specific CX cell types fills a critical gap in the genetic toolkit for the Drosophila neuroscience community.</p>
<p>
(2) By combining anatomical, molecular, and functional analyses, the authors provide a holistic view of CX cell types that is both informative and immediately useful for researchers across diverse disciplines.</p>
<p>
(3) The identification of CX cell types involved in sleep regulation and their connection to circadian clock mechanisms highlights the functional importance of the CX and its integrative role in regulating behavior and physiological states.</p>
<p>
(4) The authors' decision to present this work as a single, comprehensive manuscript rather than fragmenting it into smaller publications each focusing on separate central complex components is commendable. This decision prioritizes accessibility and utility for the broader neuroscience community, which will enable researchers to approach CX-related questions with a ready-made toolkit.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the manuscript is an outstanding resource, it leaves room for more detailed mechanistic exploration in some areas. Nonetheless, this does not diminish the immediate value of the tools and data provided.</p>
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>The authors have succeeded in achieving their aims of creating well-characterized genetic tools and providing a detailed survey of neurochemical and functional properties in the CX. The results strongly support their conclusions and open numerous avenues for future research. The work effectively bridges the gap between genetic manipulation, molecular characterization, and functional assessment, enabling a deeper understanding of the CX's diverse roles.</p>
<p>Impact and Utility</p>
<p>This manuscript will have a significant and lasting impact on the field, providing tools and data that facilitate new discoveries in the study of the CX, sleep regulation, circadian biology, and beyond. The genetic tools developed here are likely to become a standard resource for Drosophila researchers, and the comprehensive dataset on neurotransmitter and neuropeptide expression will inspire investigations into the interplay between neuromodulation and classical neurotransmission.</p>
<p>Additional Context</p>
<p>By delivering an integrated dataset that spans anatomy, molecular properties, and functional relevance, the authors have created a resource that will serve the neuroscience community for years to come.</p>
