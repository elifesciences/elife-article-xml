<title>Abstract</title><p>An “induced PARP inhibitor (PARPi) sensitivity by epigenetic modulation” strategy is being evaluated in the clinic to sensitize homologous recombination (HR)-proficient tumors to PARPi treatments. To expand its clinical applications and identify more efficient combinations, we performed a drug screen by combining PARPi with 74 well-characterized epigenetic modulators that target five major classes of epigenetic enzymes. Both type I PRMT inhibitor and PRMT5 inhibitor exhibit high combination and clinical priority scores in our screen. PRMT inhibition significantly enhances PARPi treatment-induced DNA damage in HR-proficient ovarian and breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, PRMTs maintain the expression of genes associated with DNA damage repair and BRCAness and regulate intrinsic innate immune pathways in cancer cells. Analyzing large-scale genomic and functional profiles from TCGA and DepMap further confirms that PRMT1, PRMT4, and PRMT5 are potential therapeutic targets in oncology. Finally, PRMT1 and PRMT5 inhibition act synergistically to enhance PARPi sensitivity. Our studies provide a strong rationale for the clinical application of a combination of PRMT and PARP inhibitors in patients with HR-proficient ovarian or breast cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) share clinical and genomic characteristics, such as poor prognosis, homologous recombination (HR) deficiencies and potential immunoreactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. There is an urgent unmet medical need to develop effective therapeutic strategies for these two diseases. Recently, limited targeted-therapy options, such as the Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis), have been approved to treat HGSOC and TNBC in a frontline setting as maintenance therapies or in a recurrent/metastatic setting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, the greatest clinical benefit from PARPi monotherapy has been mainly observed in HR-deficient tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, only representing a minority of patients (less than 50% of patients even in HGSOC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>). Due to frequent defection of one or more DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways, increased replication stress, and higher endogenous DNA damage levels, cancer cells highly rely on the DDR pathways for survival compared with normal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. During tumorigenesis, to solve these crises, certain DDR-related genes are pathologically upregulated in cancer cells. Epigenetic mechanisms represent a major strategy used by cancer cells to maintain or restore their abnormal need for DDR gene expression, resulting in a targetable vulnerability (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This “Achilles’ heel” can be targeted by epigenetic modulators (e.g., BETi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, CDK7/12i<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, DNMTi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and HDACi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>) or small molecules that indirectly modulate DDR gene transcription (e.g., PI3KCAi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, AKTi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, mTORi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and MEKi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Several groups, including our own<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, have developed an “induced PARPi sensitivity by epigenetic modulation” strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> to preferentially impair the transcription of certain DDR genes, thereby sensitizing PARPi intrinsic and acquired resistant tumors to PARPi treatment. For example, our previous discovery on the combination of BETi and PARPi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> is being evaluated in a Phase 1b/2 trial and achieving promising clinical results (NCT03901469)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Excitingly, due to cancer cells being extremely sensitive to the epigenetic repression of DDR genes compared with normal cells, a therapeutic window for these combinations has been observed during early clinical development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Although promising results have been reported in the clinic, the following two key questions still need to be addressed: First, among the clinically applicable epigenetic modulators, which epi-drug(s) can provide the strongest synergistic effects with PARPi? Second, can a BRCA-independent strategy be developed, given that most current strategies are mediated by repressing the expression of BRCA, which has been genomically mutated in acquired HR-proficient HGSOC/TNBC patients. Therefore, a highly effective and BRCA-independent strategy needs to be designed and evaluated.</p>

<p>Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets in oncology owing to their crucial functions during tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Arginine methylation is a common post-translational modification of proteins, playing crucial functions in the regulation of transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, DDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, and immune responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. By transferring a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine, PRMTs catalyze the formation of arginine residues with monomethylarginine (MMA), asymmetrical dimethylarginine (aDMA), and symmetrical dimethylarginine (sDMA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Each such methylation state affects protein function and interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids in different ways, leading to distinct functional consequences. Based on catalytic activities, nine PRMTs in mammalians are divided into three groups. Type I (PRMT1/2/3/4/6/8) and type II (PRMT5/9) enzymes catalyze the formation of MMA as an intermediate before the establishment of aDMA and sDMA, respectively. PRMT7 is a type III enzyme that catalyzes only the formation of MMA. The activities of PRMT1 and PRMT5 are responsible for generating most cellular aDMA and sDMA, respectively; therefore, they serve as the major type I and type II enzymes in cells, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Type I and II PRMTs share common substrates, with preferences for histones (such as H3R2 and H4R3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> and proteins with RG/RGG motifs (such as RNA-binding proteins and splicing complex proteins)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. This substrate overlaps and competitive behavior leads to the phenomenon of substrate scavenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. For example, PRMT1 and PRMT5 scavenge each other’s substrates in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recently, potent and selective PRMT inhibitors (PRMTis) have been successfully developed, and more than ten PRMTis have been rapidly advanced into early clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Although relatively rare genomic alterations in the genes encoding PRMTs are observed in cancer, expression levels of PRMTs are remarkably upregulated in solid tumors, and elevated PRMT expression is significantly associated with poor clinical outcome. Therefore, PRMTs have been considered as attractive drug targets in oncology. Preclinical studies suggest that PRMT-targeting therapies may benefit tumors with MTAP deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup> or splicing dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Although PRMTis provide a new avenue for cancer treatment, translational challenges need to be addressed for their clinical application. The PRMTi targetable “Achilles’ heels” (MTAP deletion and splicing dysfunction) are only observed in a small fraction of cancers, which restricts the application of a PRMTi as a clinical monotherapy. Therefore, the development of a novel treatment strategy to expand the potential clinical applications is a key challenge for PRMTis in oncology. Most importantly, because recent clinical trial results indicated that PRMTi activity alone may be insufficient to manage patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, even in MTAP deletion setting, pharmaceutical companies have had to terminate these trials and “re-think” how to administer these drugs to patients. Therefore, combination approaches of low-dose PRMTi with other existing therapeutic drugs urgently need to be designed and evaluated in the clinic. Excitingly, recent studies have revealed promising synergistic effects between PRMTis and chemotherapy, as well as DDR targeting drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Identification of synergistic actions between PRMTis and PARPi using a drug combination screen</title>
<p>To expand clinical applications and identify more efficient combinations for the “induced PARPi sensitivity by epigenetic modulation” strategy, we performed a drug screen by combining PARPi with a set of epigenetic modifying enzyme inhibitors, which contain 74 well-characterized epigenetic modulators that target 5 major classes of epigenetic enzymatic actions, histone acetylation, histone methylation, histone phosphorylation (only kinases and phosphatases that modify histone were included), histone de-ADP-ribosylation, and DNA methylation. Among these inhibitors, 7 are FDA-approved drugs in oncology, and 14 and 54 are in clinical trials and preclinical development, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref> and Table S1). The BET inhibitor I-BET762, a previously identified epigenetic modulator that synergistically acts with PARPi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, was used as a positive control. Two cancer cell lines that harbor wild type BRCA1/2 and modestly respond to PARPi (OVCAR8, HGSOC; and MDA-MB-231, TNBC) were used for screening. After the IC50s of each drug were estimated in these two lines, five gradient doses (serially constant two-fold ratio dilutions) were used for the drug combination screen. The combination index (CI) value of olaparib with each epigenetic inhibitor was calculated to evaluate the synergy of the combinations. In summary, synergistic effects with olaparib (medium CI value &lt;0.83) were identified in 33 and 21 epigenetic inhibitors in OVCAR8 and MDA-MB-231, respectively, including 10 that were shared by the two lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and Table S1). Next, to prioritize the clinical application potentials, we estimated a priority score for each combination by considering the CI and four additional features of each epigenetic inhibitor (single agent treatment efficacy, cancer dependency defined by genetic screen from the DepMap project, and expression dysregulation and genomic alterations from the TCGA project, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). As expected, candidates previously identified by us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and other groups, such as BETi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, DNMTi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and HDACi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, were ranked at the top of the list (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and Table S1). Notably, a group of PRMT inhibitors (type I PRMTs targeting GSK3368715, and PRMT5 targeting GSK3203591 and GSK3235025) exhibited high priority scores in our analysis. This observation was further confirmed in an expanded panel of HGSOC/TNBC cell lines that were treated with each of these PRMTis in combination with two FDA-approved PARPis, olaparib and rucaparib, independently (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, 1I, and Figure S1).</p>

<title>PRMT1, PRMT4/CARM1, and PRMT5 are potential therapeutic targets in oncology</title>
<p>To comprehensively characterize PRMTs in cancers, we analyzed the expressions and genomic alterations of all the PRMT family members across the TCGA cohort from 33 cancer types (Table S2). An RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicated that although all the PRMT family members were detectable in cancers, five PRMTs (PRMT1/2/4/5/7) exhibited remarkably high expression levels (average FPKM &gt;10, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Figure S2A and Table S3). We also characterized expressional differences between tumors and their corresponding normal adjacent tissues. A meta-analysis across 21 cancer types, which had sufficient numbers of normal controls (n ≥ 3), revealed that the mRNA levels of most PRMTs, except for PRMT2/9, were significantly upregulated in tumor specimens compared with corresponding controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and Figure S2B). This observation was further validated at protein levels in an independent sample cohort from the CPTAC project as assessed by a mass spectrometry analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and Figure S2C). Most importantly, a meta-analysis across 33 cancer types from the TCGA cohort demonstrated that higher expressional levels of PRMT1/3/4/5 were positively correlated with shorter patient survival times (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Next, we analyzed recurrent genomic alterations (focal somatic copy number alteration, recurrent mutation, and recurrent transcript fusion) of the PRMT family across the TCGA cohort, and no significantly recurrent events were identified at either the individual or pan cancer levels (Table S4). Finally, cancer cell-growth dependencies of PRMTs were analyzed in a large-scale CRISPR screening dataset generated by the DepMap project. Consistence with their increased expression levels and associations with poor clinical outcomes, PRMT1/4/5 showed cancer cell-growth dependencies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and Table S5). The analyses of these five features indicated that two type I PRMTs (PRMT1 and PRMT4/CARM1) and one type II PRMT (PRMT5) may serve as potential therapeutic targets in oncology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Because a PRMT4-specific inhibitor, CARM1-IN-1, did not show significantly synergistic effects with PARPi (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and Table S1), we hypothesized that the synergistic function of type 1 PRMT inhibitor GSK3368715 may be mediated by inhibiting PRMT1, which is the predominant enzyme among type I PRMTs (responsible for &gt;90% activity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Consequently, we used CRISPR/Cas9 as a genetic tool to specifically knock out PRMT1 and PRMT5 independently in OVCAR8 and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Colony formation assays demonstrated that an acute knock out of PRMT1 or PRMT5 significantly increased the sensitivity levels of cancer cells to PARPi treatment, thereby phenocopying the results obtained using chemical PRMT inhibitors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>).</p>

<title>PRMT inhibition enhances PARPi treatment-induced DNA damage in cancer cells</title>
<p>To determine whether PRMTis influence DNA damage responses induced by PARPi treatments, a comet assay was used to measure DNA damage in a panel of HR-proficient cancer cells that had been treated with olaparib alone or in combination with PRMTis. Although the olaparib treatment alone induced DNA damage in all four HR-proficient cancer cell lines, the extent of the DNA damage increased significantly when cells were treated with a combination of PRMTis (GSK3368715 or GSK3235025) and olaparib (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref> and Figure S3A). This observation was further confirmed by a western blot assay to detect the DNA double-strand break marker, the phosphorylation of H2AX (γH2AX [S139]), among different treatment conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistence with the enhanced DNA damage, the combination treatment significantly induced apoptosis, as measured by caspase-3/7 activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), compared with the olaparib treatment alone. To exclude the potential off-target effects of PRMT chemical inhibitors, PRMT1 and PRMT5 were knocked out independently using CRISPR/Cas9 in OVCAR8 and MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). The specific knockout of PRMT1 or PRMT5 significantly enhanced the DNA damage induced by the PARPi treatment, thereby increasing apoptosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>–<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref> and Figure S3B). These observations suggested that the increased expressions of PRMT1 and PRMT5 in cancer may prevent cell death by enhancing DNA damage repair when tumor cells are exposed to endogenous or exogenous DNA damage-causing conditions. Consequently, we analyzed the correlations between the expression levels of PRMT1/5 and “50 hallmark” molecular signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup> in a large collection of cancer cell lines from the DepMap project (n = 1,200). Consistently, “DNA-repair” was a significant signature that positively corrected with both PRMT1 and PRMT5 expression levels in cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Similar results were found in the primary tumor specimens across the TCGA cohort at individual cancer type and pan cancer levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>, 3J and Table S6). Supporting previous reports that the Myc-PRMT loop plays critical roles during tumorigenesis, “Myc-targets” signatures were the most significant signatures correlated with the expression of PRMT1/5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H–J</xref>).</p>

<title>PRMTs maintain expression of the genes associated with DDR and BRCAness</title>
<p>Given that PRMTs act as key epigenetic regulators through the modification of histone methylation, we investigated gene expression changes induced by PRMTi treatments. An RNA-seq analysis revealed that GSK3368715 and GSK3235025 treatments reduced protein-coding gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells by approximately 12.7% and 6.9%, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistent with correlation analyses in cancer cell lines and primary tumors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref> to <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3J</xref>), a gene set enrichment analysis found that the downregulated genes in both the GSK3368715 and GSK3235025 treatment groups were significantly enriched in the DDR-associated pathways compared with controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The epigenetically repression of certain DDR genes induces the BRCAness phenotype, sensitizing cancer cells to PARPi treatments. Therefore, we collected the genes in the homologous recombination (HR) and Fanconi anemia (FA) pathways (two major DDR pathways affecting PARPi sensitivity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref></sup>, as well as the genes that were previously reported to be associated with PARPi sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. A total of 247 genes potentially implicated in PARP inhibitor sensitivity (i.e., BRCAness genes) were identified in a whole genome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and Table S7). As expected, many were downregulated by GSK3368715 (n = 29) and GSK3235025 (n = 31) treatments, with nine being significantly repressed by both of the PRMTis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and Table S8). This result was further validated by a qRT-PCR analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Beyond epigenetic regulation, PRMTs play functional roles in RNA splicing through the methylation of RG/RGG motif-containing proteins in the splicing complexes. Consequently, we analyzed global RNA splicing changes between PRMTi treatments and controls. Consistent with previous reports, both the GSK3368715 and GSK3235025 treatments affected RNA splicing genome wide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). However, genes undergoing splicing changes were not significantly enriched in most DDR pathways (except for base excision repair in the GSK3235025 treatment) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>), although splicing alterations were identified in certain BRCAness genes, such as ERCC1, after PRMTi treatments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that a PARPi treatment alone also induced modest but significant splicing alterations compared with the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Combination treatments with GSK3235025, but not GSK3368715, significantly further enhanced splicing alterations compared with an olaparib or GSK3235025 treatment alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, both PRMT1i and PRMT5i treatments repressed mRNA expression of a large number of BRCAness genes in cancer cells. Although some genes were inhibited by both inhibitors, PRMT1i and PRMT5i repressed distinct BRCAness genes. Splicing alterations in certain BRCAness genes were identified after a PRMTi treatment, and the PARPi-treatment-induced splicing susceptibility may also serve as a mechanism for the synergistic action of PRMTi and PARPi.</p>

<title>Repression of ERCC1 is a common mechanism by which PRMTis sensitize cells to PARPi treatment</title>
<p>To evaluate whether the BRCAness genes, which were repressed by PRMTis, play functional roles in synergistic action between PRMTis and PARPi, a customer-designed siRNA screen was performed in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), and an impact score for each candidate was estimated based on 1) expressional repression effects of PRMTis and 2) functional effects on PARPi sensitivity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Among the candidates examined, ERCC1 had the highest impact score and was repressed by both GSK3368715 and GSK3235025 treatments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In lung cancer, knocking out ERCC1 sensitizes cells to PARPi treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, and its expression serves as a predictive biomarker for the platinum response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. Therefore, we used ERCC1 as an example to evaluate whether transcriptional repression can serve as a mechanism. We found that, similar to PRMTs, ERCC1 expression was significantly upregulated across cancer samples compared with their corresponding control specimens (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with the association between PRMT1/5 and the DDR signature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), significant positive correlations between PRMT1/5 and ERCC1 mRNA expression levels were observed in primary tumor specimens from the TCGA cohort (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results suggest that elevated PRMT expression in cancer may serve as a mechanism to epigenetically maintain ERCC1 expression, which is critical to the survival of cancer cells that are subjected to high levels of endogenous DNA damage and increased replication-related stress. Using western blots, we demonstrated that PRMTi treatments repressed ERCC1 expression at the protein level in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). As expected, under these treatment conditions, GSK3368715 and GSK3235025 reduced global aDMA and sDMA levels, respectively. Notably, in consistence with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>, the GSK3368715 treatment also increased global sDMA levels (Figure S4), suggesting that PRMT1 and PRMT5 share a substrate (i.e., MMA), and/or their functions may be compensatory in certain cellular contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. These observations were also validated by genetically knocking out PRMT1 and PRMT5 independently using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and Figure S4B). To determine whether the repression of ERCC1 by PRMTis was mediated by an epigenetic (transcriptional) mechanism, we cloned the ERCC1 promoter region (−1,500 to +120) and inserted it into a reporter vector (pGL3-basic). Both the chemical PRMTi treatment and genetic knockout of PRMT1/5 significantly reduced ERCC1 promoter activities in cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Next, we determined whether the PRMTi treatment was able to reduce the ERCC1 function. ERCC1 and XPF form a structure-specific nuclease that is required for the removal of ultraviolet (UV) radiation-generated cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). Thus, measuring the rate of UV-induced CPD removal serves as a semi-quantitative assay to monitor ERCC1 activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). The OVCAR8 cells were pretreated with GSK3368715 (2.5 µM) and GSK3235025 (5 µM) independently for 48 h, then CPDs were induced by exposure to UV radiation (15 J/m<sup>2</sup>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). Using a specific CPD antibody (Kamiya Biomedical Company, MC-062)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>, immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that PRMTi treatments significantly decreased the CPD removal rates compared with controls after UV exposure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). This observation was validated by genetically knocking out PRMT1 or PRMT5 using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>). Additionally, a DNA-blotting assay confirmed the immunofluorescent staining results (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L, M</xref>). To further demonstrate the functional involvement of ERCC1 in the synergistic actions between PRMTis and PARPi, we knocked out ERCC1 in cancer cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5N</xref>). As expected, the ERCC1-XPF activity was significantly reduced (Figure S5). Colony formation assays demonstrated that ERCC1 knockout cancer cell lines were sensitized to PARPi treatments (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5O</xref>). Finally, the forced ERCC1 expression by lentiviral infection partially reduced the synergistic actions between PRMTis and PARPi in these cell lines (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5P</xref>). Therefore, both type I PRMT and PRMT5 inhibitor treatments significantly repressed ERCC1 expression and activity levels in cancer cells. ERCC1 serves as a common mechanism by which PRMTis sensitizes cells to PARPi treatments.</p>

<title>PRMT inhibition activates intrinsic innate immune pathways in cancer cells</title>
<p>We also analyzed the PRMTi treatment-induced genes using a gene set enrichment analysis and found that the most upregulated pathways were associated with immune responses (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Using the immune-related gene list from an immune gene annotation database (ImmPort), 516 reliably detectable genes (RPKM &gt;1 by RNA-seq) in MDA-MB-231 cells were defined as the immune-related genes. Consistently, we found that 17.8% and 23.6% were upregulated by GSK3368715 and GSK3235025 treatments, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Compared with the upregulated non-immune-related genes, a significant number of the immune-related genes were induced by PRMT inhibition (GSK3368715, p = 7.6e-9; GSK3235025, p = 1.8e-18). Notably, 53 immune-related genes were upregulated by both PRMTis, and 37.7% of them were classified as innate immune-related genes by the InnateBD database (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). These innate immune-related genes were associated the major innate immune signaling pathways, such as cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These results suggest that PRMTi treatments may enhance intrinsic immune reactions in tumor cells, providing a strong rationale for the application of PRMTis (or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors) in immuno-oncology. Notably, PARPi treatments trigger anticancer innate immune responses by increasing cytosolic DNA. Consequently, using the phosphorylation of TBK1 as a functional marker to monitor the activities of innate immune signals in tumor cells, we found that the PRMTi treatment alone induced comparable levels of p-TBK1 as the PARPi treatment, whereas the combination of PRMTi and PARPi increased p-TBK1 remarkably compared with single agent treatments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). This observation was confirmed by genetically knocking down PRMT1 and PRMT5 independently using CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). Because both PRMTi and PARPi treatments induced DNA damage in cancer cells, we also examined cytoplasmic micronuclei using PicoGreen staining, which specifically recognizes dsDNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Indeed, the numbers of cytoplasmic micronuclei significantly accumulated when cells were treated with PRMTis or PARPi alone, whereas the combination treatment synergistically enhanced this response (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). The combination of PRMTis and PARPi may synergistically enhance anticancer immunity because cytoplasmic dsDNA triggers the cGAS-STING-TBK1 pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Type I PRMT and PRMT5 inhibition act synergistically to enhance PARPi sensitivity</title>
<p>The inhibition of type I PRMT and PRMT5 represses shared, as well as distinct, BRCAness genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>); consequently, we hypothesized that the combination of type I PRMT and PRMT5 inhibitors may act synergistically to enhance PARPi sensitivity. Thus, using ERCC1 as an example, we examined whether there was a synergistic effect on the repression of shared targets. Both chemical (PRMTis) and genetic (CRISPR) approaches demonstrated that the repression of both PRMT1 and PRMT5 more significantly reduced ECRR1 promoter activities than single treatments (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, B</xref>). This transcriptional synergistic action was further confirmed by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). More importantly, the combination treatment almost completely repressed ERCC1 protein expression in cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Using combinations of inhibitors that target the same pathway or biological process not only leads to synergistic effects and overcomes resistance, it may also reduce the required dose of each drug, thereby reducing potential side effects and increasing the therapeutic window. For example, co-targeting type I PRMTs and PRMT5 using a combination of different PRMTis showed synergistic actions and promising therapeutic efficacies in preclinical models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Because PARPis are well tolerated in clinical practice, we next evaluated whether de-escalation doses of PRMTis in combination with PARPi can achieve a therapeutic efficacy in a panel of cancer cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Decreased independent doses of GSK3368715 (125 nM) and GSK3235025 (500 nM) achieved identical synergistic effects as the original doses of these two inhibitors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Furthermore, although extremely low doses of GSK3368715 (25 nM) and GSK3235025 (100 nM) independently showed moderate synergy with olaparib, and a triple combination produced a strong synergistic action with olaparib. More importantly, when we further reduced doses of PRMTis, synergistic effects were still achieved (i.e., GSK3368715 at 12.5 nM and GSK3235025 at 12.5 nM) in the triple combination setting (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Similar results were observed for another FDA-approved PARPi, rucaparib (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref> and Figure S6). Finally, we validated our <italic>in vitro</italic> observations in preclinical models in <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments using low doses of PRMTis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H–K</xref>). Consistently, olaparib in combination with GSK3368715 and GSK3235025 independently significantly reduced tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> compared with the olaparib treatment alone, although in this low-dose PRMTi setting, PRMTi alone showed no (GSK3235025) or modest (GSK3368715) effects on tumor growth. In addition, the triple combination achieved a stronger therapeutic effect compared with the double combinations. Notably, consistent with previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>, combinations of GSK3368715 and GSK3235025 also showed promising therapeutic effects compared with GSK3368715 and GSK3235025 alone. Importantly, no significant side effects were observed in PRMTi and PARPi combinations and the triple combination in this low-dose PRMTi setting (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7L</xref>), suggesting that both double and triple combinations may be tolerable in future clinical developments.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An “induced PARPi sensitivity by epigenetic modulation” strategy (i.e., epigenetically impairing the genes of the DDR pathway in HR-proficient tumors to induce an HR-deficiency or other DDR-defects, thereby enhancing and sensitizing tumor cells to PARPi) has been developed recently to expand PARPi clinical applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. For example, our previous study has demonstrated that repression of BET activity can significantly reduce the expression levels of essential HR genes by inhibiting the transcriptional activities of their super enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This preclinical discovery is being evaluated in a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial (NCT03901469) by a combination of BETi (ZEN-3694) with PARPi (talazoparib) for treatment of patients with metastatic TNBC without germline BRCA1/2 mutations (i.e., intrinsic HR-proficient patients)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Excitingly, promising anti-cancer activity of this novel drug combination has been observed in the on-going clinical trial. Importantly, paired tumor biopsies have shown robust target engagement (repression of BRCA1 and RAD51 mRNA expression)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, consistent with our preclinical studies in xenograft tumor models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This trial is being expanded to a Phase 2b stage to accrue additional patients with TNBC. In addition, other combination approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> based on the “induced PARPi sensitivity by epigenetic modulation” strategy also achieved promising clinical responses in intrinsic or acquired HR-proficient settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Most importantly, due to cancer cells being extremely sensitive to the epigenetic repression of DDR genes compared with normal cells, the clinical studies demonstrated that this strategy is well tolerable for the patients with cancer.</p>
<p>However, two key clinically challenges still need to be addressed for future expansion of the application of this strategy in oncology: i.e., which clinically applicable epi-drug(s) can provide the strongest synergistic effects with PARPi? and can a BRCA-independent strategy be developed? To design and evaluate highly effective and BRCA-independent epi-drug/PARPi combination strategy, we performed a drug screen by combining olaparib, an FDA-approved PARPi, with a set of clinical applicable epi-drugs, which contain 74 well-characterized epigenetic modulators that target five major classes of epigenetic enzymatic actions. Among them, 7 are FDA-approved drugs in oncology, and 14 and 54 are in clinical trials and preclinical development, respectively. Notably, both type I PRMTi and PRMT5i exhibited high combination and clinical priority scores in our screen. This result was further confirmed by using different FDA-approved PARPis in multiple HGSOC and TNBC cell lines. Our functional studies demonstrated that PRMT inhibition significantly enhanced PARPi treatment-induced DNA damage in HR-proficient cancer cell lines. In consistency with the significant and positive correlation between the expression of PRMTs and DDR genes across primary cancer specimens, we observed that PRMT activities maintain the transcription of genes associated with DNA damage repair and “BRCAness” in cancer cells.</p>
<p>The expression levels of many PRMT family members are significantly elevated in cancer cells and associated with poor clinical outcomes, strongly suggesting that they may serve as a class of novel therapeutic targets in oncology. Our large-scale genomic and functional profiles from TCGA and DepMap further confirm that PRMT1, PRMT4, and PRMT5 are potential therapeutic targets in oncology. Major pharmaceutical companies have developed more than ten selective and potent PRMTis that are currently undergoing early-stage clinical evaluation. Development of novel treatment strategy to expand its potential clinical application is a key challenge for application of PRMTis in oncology. Given that recent clinical trials indicate that the activity of PRMTi alone may be insufficient to manage patients with cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, even in MTAP-deletion setting, therefore, the design and evaluation of combination approaches using PRMTi with other therapeutic drugs are urgently needed. Our preclinical studies provide a strong rationale for a combination of PRMTi with PARPi for treatment of patients with HR-proficient HGSOC or TNBC. In addition, this strategy may also be expanded to other cancer types such as prostate and pancreatic cancers, in which PARPi has been approved by the FDA for clinical management.</p>
<p>As major histone modifiers, PRMTs control methylation of histones, thereby epigenetically regulating gene transcription and expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Additionally, through protein post-translational modification, PRMTs also directly regulate non-histone protein functions. For examples, PRMTs preferentially modify the splicing factors to maintain appropriate splicing process in cells. Given that the PRMT-regulome broadly influences multiple cellular processes in cancer cells, the mechanisms of action for the PRMT and PARP inhibitor combination may be highly complicated and context-dependent. For example, it has been reported that PRMTs indirectly regulate DDR gene expression through their functions on maintaining arginine methylation of the proteins in splicing complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Consistent with these studies, we also found that splicing of certain DDR genes, such as ERCC1, was impaired by PRMT inhibition. Additionally, PRMTs may also directly impact arginine methylation in certain DDR genes, thereby influencing their function in DNA damage response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In the context of HGSOC/TNBC, our results suggest that treatment with both type 1 PRMT and PRMT5 inhibitors suppressed RNA expression of many genes potentially involved in PARP inhibitor sensitivity (i.e. BRCAness genes). Although some of them were inhibited by both inhibitors, type 1 PRMT and PRMT5 inhibitors repressed distinct BRCAness genes. Splicing alterations in certain BRCAness genes were identified after a PRMTi treatment, therefore, the PRMTi-treatment-induced splicing susceptibility may also serve as an alternative mechanism for the synergistic action of PRMTi and PARPi. However, BRCAness genes were not significantly enriched among the genes whose splicing was significantly altered by PRMTi treatment, suggesting that splicing alteration might not serve as a dominant mechanism for PRMTi/PARPi combination, at least in the HGSOC/TNBC setting. Our studies not only provided mechanistic explanations for PRMTi and PARPi combinations but also provided novel information for the clinical development of this strategy. For example, ERCC1 expression may serve as a predictive biomarker for patient selection. Notably, ERCC1 is being evaluated in the clinic as a novel biomarker for predicting platinum sensitivity in lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref></sup>. Finally, tumor intrinsic genomic status may affect responses to PRMTi alone or combination treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Supporting previous reports found that the Myc-PRMT loop plays critical roles during tumorigenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, and “Myc-targets” signatures were the most significant signatures correlated with the expression of PRMT1 and PRMT5. Therefore, under MYC-hyperactivated condition, tumors may be extremely sensitive to PRMTis or PRMTi/PARPi combination.</p>
<p>Co-targeting type I PRMT and PRMT5 has shown strong synergistic actions and promising therapeutic efficacies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Combinations of drugs that target the same pathway (e.g., combination of dabrafenib and tremetinib) not only lead to synergistic effects and overcome resistance, they may also reduce the required dose of each drug, decreasing side effects and increasing the therapeutic window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>. In a PARPi treatment setting, type I PRMT and PRMT5 regulated shared as well as distinct BRCAness genes, suggesting that co-targeting type I PRMT and PRMT5 may produce a synergistic effect. Indeed, we observed that dual treatments of type I PRMT and PRMT5 more significantly reduced ECRR1 expression compared with single treatments. Notably, in consistence with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref></sup>, PRMT5i increased global sDMA levels, which suggested that type I PRMT and PRMT5 share a substrate (i.e., MMA) and/or their functions are compensatory. Therefore, we believe that co-targeting type I PRMT and PRMT5 not only results in a synergistic effect that enhances PARPi sensitivity, reducing the required dose of each drug, but it also serves as a strategy to overcome potential resistance due to the compensatory functions of type I PRMT and PRMT5. This concept was supported by our <italic>in vitro</italic> triple combination experiments as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Although treatment-related adverse events are manageable and reversible with treatment interruption and reduction, efficacy of PRMTis as monotherapeutic agents was modest in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. Therefore, novel combination strategies using lower doses of PRMTis urgently need to be designed and evaluated. Our studies indicated that, because PRMT “addiction” enables tumor cells to survive DNA damage, targeting PRMTs can lead to “treatment-induced DNA damage sensitivity”, thereby sensitizing tumor cells to PARPi (and other DNA damaging drugs) treatments. A low-dose PRMTi in combination with PARPi may represent a more tolerable strategy for future clinical applications in oncology. Finally, co-targeting type I PRMT and PRMT5 may further significantly reduce the doses of each PRMTi (i.e., ultra-low-dose), thereby decreasing side toxicity effects of PRMTis. Taken together, our studies provide a strong rationale for clinical application of a combination of PRMT and PARP inhibitors in the patients with HR-proficient ovarian or breast cancer. Our mechanistical characterization may contribute to the future clinical development of PRMTis by defining mechanism of action, identifying rationales for combination, selecting response predictive biomarkers, and guiding dose and treatment schedules.</p>

<title>In vivo treatment experiment</title>
<p>For MDA-MB-231 xenograft experiments, three million tumor cells were injected subcutaneously into 6-weeks-old athymic female nu/nu mice (Stock No: 002019, Jackson Labs) and grown until tumors reached a size of approximately 30 mm<sup>3</sup>. Xenografted mice were randomized and then received vehicle, 50 mg/kg olaparib ip, 25 mg/kg GSK3368715 po, 50 mg/kg GSK3235025 po or the combination of two agents and three agents, 5 days a week for 3 weeks (n=6∼8 per group). Caliper measurements were taken every three days starting from the initiation of drug treatment. Tumor volumes were calculated according to the formula: tumor volume [mm<sup>3</sup>] = (1/6) × π × (tumor length) × (tumor width)<sup>2</sup>. Due to the nature of the performed experiments, no randomization and no blinding was used because it was deemed unfeasible. However, the resulting tumors were analyzed in a blinded manner. All animal procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Large-scale and multi-dimensional profiling data generated by the publicly accessible databases (TCGA, CPTAC, and DepMap) were used, therefore statistical analysis was not used to predetermine sample size in this study. For TCGA analysis, if more than one profiling file existed for a patient in TCGA, only one single file will be selected and used, and detailed methods for exclusion of duplicated profiling files are described in the method section. The computational analyses were not randomized, and the investigators were not blinded during data analyses of this study. When applicable, enrichment was tested using Fisher’s exact test with FDR correction. Cell viability and gene relative expression data were shown as means with standard deviation (SD).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to enhance the effectiveness of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) in treating high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by inhibiting PRMT1/5 enzymes. They conducted a drug screen combining PARPi with 74 epigenetic modulators to identify promising combinations.</p>
<p>Zhang et al. reported that protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) 1/5 inhibition acts synergistically to enhance the sensitivity of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The authors are the first to perform a drug screen by combining PARPi with 74 well-characterized epigenetic modulators that target five major classes of epigenetic enzymes. Their drug screen identified both PRMT1/5 inhibitors with high combination and clinical priority scores in PARPi treatment. Notably, PRMT1/5 inhibitors significantly enhance PARPi treatment-induced DNA damage in HR-proficient HGSOC and TNBC cells through enhanced maintenance of gene expression associated with DNA damage repair, BRCAness, and intrinsic innate immune pathways in cancer cells. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis of large-scale genomic and functional profiles from TCGA and DepMap further supports that PRMT1/5 are potential therapeutic targets in oncology, including HGSOC and TNBC. These results provide a strong rationale for the clinical application of a combination of PRMT and PARP inhibitors in patients with HR-proficient ovarian and breast cancer. Thus, this discovery has a high impact on developing novel therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance to PARPi in clinical cancer therapy. The data and presentation in this manuscript are straightforward and reliable.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Innovative Approach: First to screen PARPi with a large panel of epigenetic modulators.</p>
<p>
(2) Significant Results: Found that PRMT1/5 inhibitors significantly boost PARPi effectiveness in HR-proficient HGSOC and TNBC cells.</p>
<p>
(3) Mechanistic Insights: Showed how PRMT1/5 inhibitors enhance DNA damage repair and immune pathways.</p>
<p>
(4) Robust Data: Supported by extensive bioinformatic analysis from large genomic databases.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Novelty Clarification: Needs clearer comparison to existing studies showing similar effects.</p>
<p>
(2) Unclear Mechanisms: More investigation is needed on how MYC targets correlate with PRMT1/5.</p>
<p>
(3) Inconsistent Data: ERCC1 expression results varied across cell lines.</p>
<p>
(4) Limited Immune Study: Using immunodeficient mice does not fully explore immune responses.</p>
<p>
(5) Statistical Methods: Should use one-way ANOVA instead of a two-tailed Student's t-test for multiple comparisons.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that a combination of arginine methyltransferase inhibitors synergize with PARP inhibitors to kill ovarian and triple-negative cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo using preclinical mouse models.</p>
<p>PARP inhibitors have been the common targeted-therapy options to treat high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). PRMTs are oncological therapeutic targets and specific inhibitors have been developed. However, due to the insufficiency of PRMTi or PARPi single treatment for HGSOC and TNBC, designing novel combinations of existing inhibitors is necessary. In previous studies, the authors and others developed an &quot;induced PARPi sensitivity by epigenetic modulation&quot; strategy to target resistant tumors. In this study, the authors presented a triple combination of PRMT1i, PRMT5i and PARPi that synergistically kills TNBC cells. A drug screen and RNA-seq analysis were performed to indicate cancer cell growth dependency of PRMT1 and PRMT5, and their CRISPR/Cas9 knockout sensitizes cancer cells to PARPi treatment. It was shown that the cells accumulate DNA damage and have increased caspase 3/7 activity. RNA-seq analysis identified BRCAness genes, and the authors closely studied a top hit ERCC1 as a downregulated DNA damage protein in PRMT inhibitor treatments. ERCC1 is known to be synthetic lethal with PARP inhibitors. Thus, the authors add back ERCC1 and reduce the effects of PRMT inhibitors suggesting PRMT inhibitors mediate, in part, their effect via ERCC1 downregulation. The combination therapy (PRMT/PARP) is validated in 2D cultures of cell lines (OVCAR3, 8 and MDA-MB-231) and has shown to be effective in nude mice with MDA-MB-231 xenograph models.</p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the data is well-presented. The experiments are well-performed, convincing, and have the appropriate controls (using inhibitors and genetic deletions) and statistics.</p>
<p>They identify the DNA damage protein ERCC1 to be reduced in expression with PRMT inhibitors. As ERCC1 is known to be synthetic lethal with PARPi, this provides a mechanism for the synergy. They use cell lines only for their study in 2D as well as xenograph models.</p>
