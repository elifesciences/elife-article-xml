<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Olfactory receptor (OR) choice represents an example of genetically hardwired stochasticity, where every olfactory neuron expresses one out of ~2000 OR alleles in a probabilistic, yet stereotypic fashion. Here, we show that topographic restrictions in OR expression are established in neuronal progenitors by two opposing forces: polygenic transcription and genomic silencing, both of which are influenced by dorsoventral gradients of transcription factors NFIA, B, and X. Polygenic transcription defines spatially constrained OR repertoires, among which one OR allele may be selected for singular expression later in development. Heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization preferentially eliminate from this âprivilegedâ repertoire ORs with more dorsal expression destinations, which are ectopically transcribed in neuronal progenitors throughout the olfactory epithelium. Our experiments identify early transcription as an âepigeneticâ contributor to future developmental patterning and reveal how two spatially responsive probabilistic processes act in concert to establish deterministic, precise, and reproducible territories of stochastic gene expression.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of multicellular organisms relies on gene expression programs that are precisely regulated in space and time. To transform probabilistic biochemical reactions, such as transcription and translation, into reproducible differentiation processes, plants and animals convert individual cellular variability into predictable cell population averages. Yet, there are cases in biology where gene expression variability is desirable, as it generates diverse cellular identities that are difficult to obtain with deterministic gene regulation. For example, production of antibodies via VDJ recombination, and evasion of immunological responses by antigenic variation represent biological systems that seek utmost randomness[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Other biological functions, however, benefit from balancing absolute determinism with complete randomness, producing biased stochasticity. Genetically encoded biased stochasticity is often observed in the nervous system, where gene expression choices generated by neurons must integrate into functional and reproducible circuits[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. In fly ommatidia, for example, biased randomness preserves a ratio of photoreceptor neuron identities across animals[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], whereas in mammals, random Protocadherin promoter choice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], was recently shown to obey spatial patterns in the mouse neocortex, assuring proper tiling between neighboring neurons[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Mammalian olfactory receptor (OR) gene choice provides an extreme case of hardwired biased randomness[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. OR transcription starts in neuronal progenitors of the main olfactory epithelium (MOE), which transiently express 5-15 ORs out of &gt;1,000 OR genes distributed across chromosomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. As these progenitor cells differentiate into post-mitotic olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), they switch from polygenic to monogenic and monoallelic OR transcription[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. This transition is mediated by the assembly of a multi-chromosomal enhancer hub over a single OR allele[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], followed by the stabilizing effects of an OR-elicited feedback signal[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. During this developmental progression, heterochromatic silencing[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] and genomic OR compartmentalization[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] act together to assure that the non-chosen OR alleles will remain transcriptionally repressed for the life of the OSN. Interestingly, the position of the OSN across the dorsoventral (DV) axis of the MOE predisposes this singular transcriptional choice towards a group of 50-200 OR genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], providing reproducible topographic restrictions in OR expression. The anatomical segments of the MOE that express a specific collection of OR identities are known as âzonesâ, with their total number varying from 4 to 9, depending on the analyses and criteria used to define them[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Although zonal restrictions in OR expression have a well-established influence in the wiring of the olfactory circuit[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], the mechanisms that bias this singular transcriptional choice towards specific OR identities remain unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we identified genetically encoded mechanisms that introduce topographic biases in OR gene regulation. We report that OSN progenitor cells from various MOE segments transcribe OR mixtures consisting of ORs with the corresponding or with more dorsal expression identities. Ectopic expression of dorsal ORs at the polygenic state of OR transcription is rectified during differentiation by preferential genomic silencing that is skewed towards ORs with more dorsal expression identities than the identity of the OSN. Patterns of polygenic OR transcription and genomic OR silencing are influenced by gradients of transcription factors Nfi A, B, and X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Triple Nfi deletion reduces heterochromatic silencing and genomic compartmentalization from dorsomedial ORs and eliminates them from ventral ORs, whose transcription in progenitor cells also becomes extinguished. Furthermore, spatial transcriptomics revealed a dramatic expansion of dorsomedial OR expression towards the ventral MOE and reciprocal transcriptional reduction of ventral ORs in triple Nfi cKOs, suggesting that patterns of genomic OR silencing and polygenic OR transcription influence OR gene choice. Indeed, transcriptional induction of an OR allele in OSN progenitors biases the choice of this allele in mature OSNs (mOSNs) throughout the MOE. Strikingly, by modulating the levels of OR induction in progenitor cells we can restrict expression of an OR allele in more dorsal OSNs, where heterochromatic silencing and genomic compartmentalization is less prevalent. Thus, our studies reveal that position-responsive OR transcription in OSN progenitors acts as an âepigeneticâ signal for future singular choice among the previously transcribed ORs. Moreover, our data suggest that polygenic transcription and heterochromatic silencing/genomic compartmentalization act as opposing regulatory ârheostatsâ that determine in a spatially influenced fashion the exact OR repertoire that is available for stochastic singular choice in mature OSNs.</p>

<title>OSN progenitors co-transcribe an increasing number of zonal OR identities towards the ventral MOE</title>
<p>The mouse MOE is divided into a limited series of stereotypic segments of OR expression that exhibit bilateral symmetry between the two nasal cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In whole mount views, these segments present a dorsoventral (DV) segmentation pattern, with zone 1 being at the dorsal- and zone 5 at the ventral end of the MOE. Intricate invaginations of the MOE occurring during embryonic development and early postnatal growth, convolute this dorsoventral segmentation pattern, especially when viewing coronal sections of the MOE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, we will continue referring to the DV coordinates of each one of the five segments, or zones, as they correspond to their initial patterning during development.</p>

<p>Within each zone mOSNs express a single OR allele that is randomly chosen among 50-200 OR genes with proper zonal identities. However, before the onset of singular OR expression, mitotically active OSN progenitors, the immediate neuronal precursor (INP) cells, co-express, multiple lowly expressed ORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. To determine whether zonal restrictions are operational from this polygenic stage of OR transcription, we performed deep scRNA-seq analyses of FAC-sorted OSNs and OSN progenitors from micro-dissected dorsal or ventral MOE segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Figure S1A</xref>). To enrich our plate-based scRNA-seq for cell populations of interest we used Mash1CreER; tdTomato; Ngn1-GFP triple transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Figure S1B</xref>). We injected P4 mice with tamoxifen, inducing permanent tdTomato expression, and then collected cells 48 hours later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Figure S1B</xref>). From each dissection we isolated four major cellular populations corresponding to four successive differentiation stages, as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]: GBCs (MOE stem cells), INPs (immediate neuronal precursors), iOSNs (immature OSNs), and mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Figure S1C-D</xref>).</p>
<p>We first detect OR mRNAs in INP3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which consistently transcribe multiple ORs. Surprisingly, while dorsal INPs transcribe almost exclusively dorsal ORs, ventral INPs have complex OR mixtures consisted of every zonal identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). With a 3 UMI cut off, we detect dorsal ORs in 43 ventral INP cells, and ventral ORs in only 29 of them, while dorsal INP cells express predominantly dorsal ORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>). Moreover, as the ventral INPs differentiate to iOSNs, dorsal OR transcription is replaced by ventral, zone-appropriate OR transcription, culminating to singular expression of an OR allele with the correct zonal identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). These observations were independently confirmed by bulk RNA-seq on FAC-sorted INP and mOSN cells extracted from trisected dorsal, medial, and ventral MOE. This bulk analysis showed that in every case INPs co-transcribe ORs with the correct and with more dorsal zonal identities, while further differentiation replaces dorsal ORs with ORs of the correct identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This immediately poses mechanistic questions about the process that shuts off dorsal ORs and enhances the transcription of the ORs expected to be expressed in each MOE segment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Heterochromatin eliminates ectopically expressed ORs along the dorsoventral MOE axis</title>
<p>We previously showed that OSN differentiation coincides with heterochromatin-mediated OR gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. If heterochromatinization contributes to singular OR choice by eliminating every non-chosen OR transcribed in INPs, then in any MOE segment silencing should be preferentially applied to ORs expressed in that segment and to more dorsal ORs. Therefore, dorsal ORs (zone 1 ORs), which are expressed in INPs throughout the MOE, should have highest levels of heterochromatin, whereas ventral ORs (zone 5 ORs), transcribed only in ventral INPs, should have the lowest, with the rest of the OR repertoire having intermediate levels of heterochromatic marks. Visual inspection of ChIP-seq genomic tracks along OR gene clusters with mixed zonal constitution, reveals highest H3K9me3/H3K79me3 levels on the dorsal ORs and lowest on the ventral ORs of the cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Aggregate ChIP-seq analysis of all the ORs grouped by zonal identities, corroborates the gradual reduction of H3K9me3 and H3K79me3 enrichment from dorsal to ventral ORs for the whole OR repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The only exception from this pattern is found at the dorsally expressed class I ORs, which rely on different regulatory mechanisms than the canonical class II ORs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Finally, using the FACS-based strategy described earlier, we confirmed that both heterochromatic marks are predominantly deposited during the INP to iOSN transition, simultaneously with the transition from polygenic to singular, zonally appropriate OR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplemental Figure 2A</xref>). Importantly, the descending pattern of heterochromatin enrichment from dorsal to ventral OR identities is preserved throughout differentiation.</p>

<p>We then asked if the patterns of heterochromatin deposition detected in mixed OSNs from the whole MOE are preserved in distinct zones. ChIP-seq in dorsal, dorsomedial, and ventral mOSNs showed that OR groups transcribed in INPs have higher heterochromatin levels than the ones that were not transcribed in that MOE segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplemental Figure S2B</xref>). Thus, most ORs are heterochromatic in ventral OSNs; dorsal and dorsomedial ORs are heterochromatic in dorsomedial OSNs; and only dorsal ORs have some heterochromatin in dorsal OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Although each zonal OR group is heterochromatic in the MOE segment that is expressed, it has lower enrichment of H3K9me3/H3K79me3 in its own segment than in more ventral segments, where it not chosen for stable expression. Thus, dorsal ORs have less heterochromatin in dorsal OSNs than the rest of the MOE, and dorsomedial ORs have less heterochromatin in dorsomedial OSNs than ventral OSNs. Similarly, at the ventral end of the DV axis, ventral ORs have less heterochromatin than dorsal and dorsomedial ORs. Detection of heterochromatin on ORs from the zonal group that is expressed is not counterintuitive, as only one OR allele from the ones co-transcribed will be eventually chosen, and the rest must be silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Supplemental Figure S2C</xref>). In other words, in every MOE segment, OR heterochromatinization is preserved only for the ORs that have the potential to be expressed and is not applied to more ventral ORs, which were not transcriptionally active in INPs. This is consistent with recent reports of heterochromatin marks being detected on trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) genes only in TAAR-expressing OSNs and not the rest of the MOE (REF).</p>

<title>DV gradient of OR gene compartmentalization follows patterns of heterochromatin assembly</title>
<p>Heterochromatic ORs converge into multi-chromosomal genomic clusters of extreme chromatin compaction that contributes to the effective and stable OR silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. We thus asked if the spatially determined pattern of OR heterochromatinization at the linear genome coincides with similar patterns of 3D genomic compartmentalization. <italic>In situ</italic> Hi-C in FAC-sorted OSNs from MOE segments along the DV axis revealed a striking resemblance between deposition of heterochromatic marks and genomic compartmentalization. For example, inspection of the genomic interactions between 3 OR clusters in chromosomes 2, shows that a cluster of ventral ORs is recruited to OR compartments only in ventral OSNs, where they are heterochromatic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, the other two clusters, which are either enriched for dorsal ORs, or have mixed constitution, make strong genomic contacts with each other in all three MOE segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To expand this analysis to every OR, we measured the frequency of interchromosomal genomic interactions between ORs with different DV identities, reaching the same conclusion: Interactions between dorsal ORs is the default in every OSN, whereas compartmentalization for the remaining of the OR repertoire increases along the DV axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Intriguingly, as with levels of heterochromatin, we detect the following recurrent pattern of OR compartmentalization: every OR has intermediate HiC contact frequencies with other ORs in their expression segment, lower HiC contact frequencies in more dorsal segments, and higher HiC contacts ventrally.</p>

<p>The âintermediateâ levels of heterochromatin enrichment and HiC contacts observed on ORs within their expression zone may reflect a less compact, transcription-compatible state of heterochromatin, or less frequent silencing of these ORs compared to more dorsal ORs. To distinguish between the two scenarios, we explored OR silencing at the single cell level using Dip-C[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. We performed Dip-C in 48 dorsal and 48 ventral OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We used haplotype resolved data to compute distances of all genomic loci at 20kb resolution and generated 3D models for all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Analyzing contact densities between OR loci, as well as distances in the 3D model we confirmed that OR compartments from ventral OSNs are larger and contain more ORs from more chromosomes than in dorsal OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), consistent with our bulk HiC data. Importantly, âstrongerâ HiC contacts among dorsal ORs observed in bulk, represents increased number of dorsal ORs participating in OR compartments in each OSN, rather a closer distance between dorsal ORs within a compartment (data not shown). Thus, extrapolating Dip-C results to H3K9me3/H3K79me3 enrichment, we conclude that âintermediateâ silencing levels of each OR group in their own zone likely reflects less frequent silencing than ORs from a more dorsal zone. In this note, OR compartmentalization is highly probabilistic, with each one of the 48 dorsal and ventral OSNs having unique maps of OR-OR genomic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Supplemental Figure 3A, B</xref>). Thus, we propose that the balance between two probabilistic, yet DV-responsive processes, early transcription and genomic silencing defines the OR ensemble that is available for singular choice along the DV axis. To test this model, we sought to identify factors responsible for generating these remarkable patterns.</p>

<p>To interrogate the potential role of NFI A, B and X in zonal OR expression we deleted all three genes simultaneously using the Krt5CreER driver, which is expressed in quiescent stem cells of the MOE (HBCs). We crossed Krt5CreER; tdTomato mice to NFIA, B, X fl/fl mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], and induced recombination with tamoxifen. To force the quiescent HBCs to differentiate into OSNs, we ablated the MOE with methimazole and allowed 40 days for a complete restoration by the marked progeny of the NFI KO or control HBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplemental Figure S4A</xref>), as previously described[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. RNA-seq analysis of the FAC-sorted OSNs from the whole MOE, revealed significant transcriptional reduction of ventral OR identities and reciprocal increase of dorsomedial ORs, with the transcription of the dorsal-most ORs being unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, triple NFI deletion only in mOSNs, with OMPiresCre has no measurable effects in OR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To ask whether the reduced transcription of ventral ORs reflects a developmental defect of ventral OSN differentiation, versus a <italic>bona fide</italic> dorsalization of ventral OSNs, we performed RNA-seq in OSNs isolated specifically from ventral MOE microdissections. This experiment revealed ectopic expression of dorsomedial OR identities in place of the proper ventral ORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), a result confirmed by immunofluorescence (IF) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplemental Figure S4B,C</xref>). This transcriptional transformation of ventral OSNs satisfies the original criteria of homeosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], since the overall mOSN identity is not altered by the triple NFI deletion: Only 13 out of ~200 OSN-specific genes are significantly different between control and KO OSNs, and 117/207 non OR zone 4/5 enriched genes are still expressed in the ventral-most zones, acting as independent fiducial markers for our zonal dissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplemental Figure S4E</xref>). The severity of this dorsomedial transformation depends on the number of NFI genes deleted, with the triple cKO expressing predominantly zone 2 and 3 ORs, double NFIA, B cKO expressing zone 3 and 4 ORs, and single NFIX cKO having almost wild type expression patterns of zone 4 and 5 ORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Supplemental Figure S4D</xref>).</p>

<title>Spatial transcriptomics reveal widespread homogenization and dorsalization of the MOE upon triple Nfi deletion</title>
<p>To obtain a complete and unbiased understanding of the consequences of triple Nfi deletion in patterns of OR expression we deployed a spatial transcriptomic approach. Since our goal was to decipher zonal patterns of OR expression across the dorsoventral MOE axis without requirements for single cell resolution, we opted for the Visium Spatial Gene Expression workflow (10X Genomics)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. This workflow is ideal for interrogation of spatial OR expression in mOSNs, as OR mRNAs are highly abundant and readily detectable in most spatial spots that contain OSN mRNAs. For increased stringency, we only included spatial spots that include more than 2 OR genes and 3 OR transcripts. We analyzed 4 MOE sections from NfiA,B,X triple cKO mice and littermate controls, from two mice each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Expression data on OR genes were normalized and integrated across replicates (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">STAR methods</xref>). We performed PCA analysis, by which spatial spots were arranged in 5 clusters in control and cKO MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, while dimensionality reduction and unbiased clustering generated OR clusters that correspond to zonal patterns of OR expression, i.e., each cluster contains ORs from a specific zone in control MOEs, only zone 1/class I ORs followed this correlation in cKO MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The other 4 clusters homogenously express zone 2-4 ORs, with expanded expression of zone 2 ORs in every cluster and loss of zone 5 OR detection. Thus, conditional triple Nfi deletion causes loss of spatial patterning for zone 2-4 OR genes and loss of expression for zone 5 ORs, without influencing the expression of zone 1 ORs.</p>

We generated the same clusters in Nfi cKO samples (right heatmap).

<p>To depict the effects of triple Nfi deletion in spatial patterns of OR expression we plotted the average OR expression per spatial spot of the top 20 most highly expressed OR genes for zones 1, 2, and 5. We then overlaid the corresponding values against the histological images of the control (wt) and Nfi ABX cKO MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As observed in the clustering and heatmap analysis, zone1 OR expression is confined to the same anatomical region for both samples. However, zone 2 OR expression in the cKO MOE extends beyond its defined anatomical region of the control MOE, and spreads to the ventral-most zones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This expansion is also observed in the expression of individual zone 2 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplemental Figure S5A</xref>). In contrast, the top 20 zone 5 OR genes, while highly expressed in control MOEs, are almost undetectable in Nfi cKO MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with our RNA-seq analysis. Olfr1507, the most highly expressed zone 5 OR, is undetectable in the cKO spatial spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Supplemental Figure S5B</xref>), in agreement with our IF data. Finally, to obtain a more general understanding of the spatial transformations in OR expression patterning upon triple Nfi deletion, we assigned a zonal index of each spatial spot using the maximum normalized expression of all the OR genes detected in a spot (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">STAR methods</xref>). Unlike control MOEs, where spot assignment reproduces zonal anatomical positions, most spatial spots in the cKO MOEs are assigned to zone 2, in a striking dorsalization and homogenization of the MOE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>NFI gradients control patterns of OR heterochromatinization and polygenic OR transcription</title>
<p>We searched for a mechanistic explanation for the homeotic transformation of ventral OSNs in NFI cKO mice. Our experiments so far have identified 3 spatially responsive processes that may contribute to the dorsoventral patterning of OR gene choice: polygenic OR transcription in INPs, OR heterochromatinization and genomic compartmentalization during INP to iOSN transition. Thus, we explored the effects of triple NFI deletion in all three processes. First, we investigated the effects of NFI deletion in OR heterochromatinization by ChIP-seq and HiC on triple NFI cKO OSNs from the ventral-most MOE segments. ChIP-seq revealed an almost complete loss of heterochromatin from ventral ORs and small reduction in dorsomedial ORs in NFI cKO ventral OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Supplemental Figure S7E, F</xref>). Similarly, <italic>in situ</italic> Hi-C in control and triple Nfi KO OSNs from ventral MOE segments, revealed a strong reduction in the long-range <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> genomic contacts made by ventral ORs, and intermediate reduction for dorsomedial ORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Dorsal ORs, which are not affected transcriptionally, did not exhibit any change in ChIP-seq and HIC contacts. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Strikingly, in both processes, heterochromatin assembly and genomic compartmentalization, the patterns observed in ventral OSNs upon Nfi deletion, are like the ones observed in dorsomedial OSNs from the control MOEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Supplemental Figure S6A, B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, we explored the effects of triple Nfi deletion to the polygenic transcription of ORs in INP cells. We used a FACS-based strategy to isolate INPs from the ventral MOE followed by bulk RNA-seq as described earlier. Again, as with the results from ChIP-seq and HiC experiments, we detect a conversion toward the signatures observed in dorsomedial INPs, i.e., detection of only dorsal and medial ORs and depletion of ventral OR identities from the INP transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, our data reveal an unexpected correlation between OR transcription in INP cells, and two diametrically opposing gene expression outcomes in OSNs: silencing for the majority of the co-transcribed OR alleles and singular choice for one of them. Although transcription mediated silencing is widely deployed for the stable repression of repetitive elements, transposons and retroviruses that integrate in the genomes of various organisms, a transcription-mediated gene choice mechanism that transcends differentiation stages is uncommon. Thus, we devised a genetic strategy that would test the hypothesis that polygenic OR transcription is a pre-requisite for singular OR choice.</p>

<title>Early OR transcription promotes OR gene choice in mOSNs</title>
<p>We manipulated OR transcription using a genetically modified Olfr17 allele with a tetO promoter inserted immediately downstream of its transcription start site[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. This allele enables strong transcriptional activation of Olfr17 from the endogenous genomic locus under the control of tTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Supplemental Figure S7A</xref>). Olfr17 expression is monitored by an iresGFP reporter inserted immediately downstream of the Olfr17 translational stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To induce transcription of this tetO-Olfr17iGFP OR allele in INPs and iOSNs, we used Gng8-tTA transgenic mice. Gng8 is expressed predominantly in INPs, downregulated in iOSNs, and completely shut off in mOSNs. Consistent with the expression properties of Gng8 and previous reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], we only detect GFP in the basal MOE layers of Gng8-tTA; tetO-GFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which are enriched for INPs and iOSNs. However, when we cross the same Gng8-tTA driver to tetO-Olfr17iGFP mice, we detect widespread GFP signal in apical MOE layers, which contain predominantly mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Since there is no tTA expression in mOSNs, we reasoned that the INP/iOSN-induced tetO-Olfr17iGFP allele is chosen for expression by the endogenous transcriptional machinery responsible for singular OR choice. Indeed, HiC experiments of these OSNs revealed that Greek Islands, the intergenic OR enhancers that converge over the chosen OR allele[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], are recruited specifically to the tetO-Olfr17iresGFP allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), explaining the sustained expression of this OR in mOSNs. Furthermore, high doxycycline diet to these mice for 30 days fails to extinguish tetO-Olfr17iresGFP expression in mOSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>), in support of the notion that transcriptional induction of Olfr17 in INPs/iOSNs, signals for the preferential choice of this OR in mOSNs. In contrast, ChIP-seq experiments on GFP-negative OSNs, which do not express this OR allele, did not reveal a significant increase of heterochromatin on the P2 locus (data not shown).</p>

<p>Intriguingly, transient induction of Olfr17 transcription promotes preferential choice of this OR throughout the MOE, rather than only in zone 2, were Olfr17 is normally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In fact, the vast majority of mOSNs from zones 1 to 4 are GFP<sup>+</sup>, and only in the ventral-most zone 5 we detect a more sporadic pattern of ectopic Olfr17 choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>). We hypothesized that reduced frequency of ectopic Olfr17 expression in the most ventral segment reflects the fact that heterochromatin levels and genomic compartmentalization of this dorsomedial OR allele is highest at this MOE segment even at the INP stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Supplemental Figure S7E</xref>). This immediately suggests that the balance between transcriptional activation heterochromatic silencing during INP to iOSN transition determines whether an OR can be chosen for singular expression. If this hypothesis is correct, then reducing Olfr17 transcription in INP/iOSN cells, should preferentially prohibit ectopic Olfr17 expression in ventral MOE segments, where heterochromatic silencing is stronger. To test this, we pharmacologically manipulated tTA activity using low levels of doxycycline (1mg/Kg) administration throughout the life of the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Supplemental Figure 7A</xref>), which reduce but do not eliminate tTA-driven transcription. Remarkably, mice that were subjected to this doxycycline regimen, continue to frequently express Olfr17 in dorsal mOSNs (zones 1-2), but not in mOSNs from more ventral MOE segments (zones 3-5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>), where heterochromatin levels on this OR allele are highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus, we can manipulate the zonal expression of an OR allele in mOSNs, by pharmacologically modulating the frequency and levels of transcriptional activation in INP/iOSN cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We uncovered a mechanism by which a random transcriptional process becomes skewed towards specific outcomes, transforming the relative position of a neuron across the dorsoventral axis of the MOE into biased OR gene choice. The solution to the perplexing segmentation of the MOE into distinct and reproducible territories of OR expression is the following: polygenic OR transcription in neuronal progenitors highlights a small group of ORs that can be chosen for singular expression later in development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). In each MOE segment this OR mixture includes ORs that should be expressed in mOSNs of the segment, as well as ORs that are only expressed in more dorsal MOE segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). As these progenitor cells differentiate into iOSNs, heterochromatic silencing preferentially decommissions from this mixture more dorsal ORs, and with lower efficiency ORs that could be expressed in the segment, biasing this singular choice towards a spatially appropriate OR repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Our scRNA-seq analysis revealed two vectors in the determination of the OR ensemble that is co-transcribed in each OSN progenitor: chance, as every OR combination is unique, and determinism, as the overall zonal identities of the co-transcribed OR mixtures are informed by the position of the progenitor cell. Similarly, Dip-C revealed that genomic silencing also follows skewed patterns, eliminating preferentially ORs with more dorsal expression signatures than ORs that could be expressed in each zone. The final product of these opposing probabilistic ârheostatsâ is the generation of gene expression programs that may not have sufficient resolution to determine which OR will be chosen in every OSN but are precise enough to generate reproducible expression territories for each one of the ~1400 OR genes.</p>
<p>We identified gradients of transcription factors Nfi A, B, and X as partial orchestrators of the dorsoventral patterning of OR expression, which they establish as follows: they contribute to the silencing of dorsomedial ORs (zone 2 and 3 ORs); they activate both polygenic transcription and silencing of ventral ORs (zone 4 and 5 ORs); and they have no influence on the expression of dorsal-most ORs (class I and Zone 1 ORs). Given that Nfi factors are predominantly known as regulators of embryonic and adult stem cell biology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], it is surprising that in the olfactory system their deletion does not interfere with the maintenance of stem cell populations, but with the OR expression patterns in post-mitotic, fully differentiated mOSNs. Interestingly, triple NFI deletion after the onset of singular OR choice, has no effect in OR patterning, consistent with the emerging model that OR specification takes place exclusively at the INP to iOSN transition, and the notion that these patterning factors are not required for maintenance of OR transcription. Thus, we speculate that singular OR gene choice in OSNs can be executed by the common nucleoprotein complex of Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1 bound to the multi-enhancer hub, consistent with the fact that we detect hubs of similar constitution associating with active ORs in different zones[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>A question emerging from these observations is why not use the same transcription factor gradients to regulate both polygenic and monogenic OR transcription? The answer is likely related to the absolute requirement for transcriptional singularity: transcription factor gradients can transcribe specific OR mixtures in a DV-responsive fashion, but they cannot activate only a single OR promoter among the many they can bind to. But even if singularity was achievable by transcription factor combinations and the OR-elicited feedback, OR promoters with the strongest binding motifs would be consistently chosen first, excluding ORs with weaker promoters in a âwinner takes allâ model. This would result in preferential choice of specific ORs, reduced diversity in OR representation, and a narrower sensory spectrum for the olfactory system. With the process revealed here, the most frequently activated OR promoter in INPs/iOSNs has only a 5-10% chance of being chosen for singular expression in OSNs. Thus, by segregating OR gene regulation into two stages, polygenic transcription in progenitor cells and singular choice in OSNs, the olfactory system can impose deterministic biases while assuring equitable receptor representation. Of course, this system has limitations in preserving transcriptional equity: artificial transcriptional induction of an OR allele in OSN progenitors under the powerful tetO promoter, bypasses these constraints and results in biased choice of this allele in most mOSNs. This immediately suggests that <italic>cis</italic> OR regulatory elements are subject to selective pressure that preserves their weak transcriptional activation properties, explaining why robust OR transcription in mOSNs requires assembly of interchromosomal multi-enhancer hubs.</p>
<p>In this note, zones may also have evolved to satisfy the requirement for distributed OR representation: if dorsal-most ORs, which are detected in every OSN progenitor regardless of DV origin, have the most frequently activated promoters, then silencing them in more ventral MOE segments assures that other OR identities will also have the chance to be expressed. Consistent with this model, is the observation that mutations on the Lhx2 or Ebf binding sites of the promoter of dorsal OR M71, result in less frequent and more ventral M71 expression patterns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Thus, DV segmentation of the MOE may serve as a mechanism that prevents ORs with stronger differences in promoter strength from competing for singular expression, assuring that every OR is expressed at meaningful, for odor perception, frequencies. In addition, as our spatial transcriptomic data showed, zonal regulation assures that ORs are expressed in a reproducibly patterned fashion in the MOE. While in wild type mice unbiased machine learning approaches identify at least 5 distinct OR expression patterns, in the triple Nfi cKO mice these patterns become intermixed for all but zone 1 ORs. With recent observations arguing that individual mitral cells, the second order neurons in the olfactory circuit, have patterned projections in the brain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], non-random OR expression in the MOE may contribute to putative hardwired components of odor perception and valance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>].</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Polygenic OR transcription as the arbiter between OR gene silencing and OR gene choice</title>
<p>A peculiar feature of the OR gene family that had emerged from our past work is that OR gene silencing is highest in the very cells that express ORs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Our zonal analysis further strengthened this intriguing correlation, as both H3K9me3/H3K79me3 and genomic compartmentalization in each MOE segment are strongest on OR groups that are transcriptionally active during OSN differentiation. A fascinating implication from this observation is that early OR transcription is the signal for both genomic silencing and singular choice. Although the former is only implied by the strong correlation between OR transcription in OSN progenitors and genomic silencing, the latter is experimentally supported by the striking observation that strong transcriptional induction of Olfr17 at the INP/iOSN stage results in strong recruitment of the Greek Island hub, and stable choice of this OR allele in most mOSNs throughout the MOE. Such a mechanism of promoter choice influenced by spatially-determined early transcription, could also explain the recent demonstration that clustered Pcdh choice, which is regulated by anti-sense transcription[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], abides to spatial restrictions in the neocortex[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>How could two fundamentally opposite gene expression outcomes be encoded on the same molecular feature? We propose that the timing and levels of transcriptional induction could be the arbiters between genomic silencing and singular choice. ORs that are transcribed first in the INP stage, when the Greek Island hub cannot yet form due to the continuous expression of Lamin b receptor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], are most likely to be silenced. OR alleles activated during the assembly of the multi-enhancer hub, at the INP to iOSN transition, may compete for hub recruitment. The OR allele that will first associate with a multi-enhancer hub, will be stably protected from heterochromatic silencing, possibly due to the significantly increased rates of OR transcription, whereas the other co-transcribed ORs will succumb to heterochromatic silencing. If timing and rates of OR transcription determine whether an OR allele will be silenced or chosen, then an OR allele that is highly transcribed in both INP and iOSN stage should evade silencing and dominate the competition for hub recruitment, explaining the striking expression pattern of the tTA-induced Olfr17 allele. Thus, according to this model, in each OSN ORs with more dorsal identity will be transcribed first, because they have stronger promoters, and therefore will become silenced in higher frequency; ORs with the correct zonal identity will be transcribed later, with a chance to associate with the Greek Island hub, explaining why one is chosen and the rest are silenced; ORs with more ventral identities will not be transcribed at all, thus, will not be silenced but also will not be chosen. In other words, singular OR transcription may not depend on the silencing of every single OR in the genome: by encoding silencing and stable choice with the same exact molecular feature, OSNs choose one and silence a small fraction of the whole OR repertoire in each nucleus-the rest are not relevant.</p>

<title>Limitations of this study</title>
<p>Our experiments did not clarify whether NFI proteins bind directly on OR promoters, or act indirectly by activating other transcription factors and chromatin modifying enzymes. Although there is a statistically significant enrichment of NFI motifs on zone 4/5 OR promoters compared to the other OR promoters (data not shown), we were not able to detect direct binding of NFI proteins on these promoters, which is expected since these promoters are active in less than 1% of the cells. Given that our studies provide the mechanism by which NFI gradients establish zonal boundaries, via polygenic OR transcription and chromatin-mediated silencing, answering this question is not essential for understanding the mechanism of dorsoventral patterning of OR expression. A second limitation of this study is that it did not reveal the mechanisms that regulate the expression of the dorsal-most ORs (Zone 1 ORs), as NFI deletion had not effects in the expression and chromatin regulation of these OR genes. However, having revealed the regulatory logic whereby these patterns are established, we expect that other transcription factors with zonal expression patterns identified here, regulate early transcription and silencing of these genes across the MOE.</p>

Ten days after the first injection, the olfactory epithelium was ablated with one intraperitoneal injection of methimazole, inducing proliferation of the HBCs and regeneration of a Nfi ABX knockout olfactory epithelium. The olfactory epithelium was allowed to regenerate for 40 days before collecting the MOE and FAC-sorting the tdTomato+(dim) cell population, which contains a mixture of mostly mOSNs and some INP and iOSN cells, as described in detail in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. For some experiments Omp-ires-GFP was crossed in to ensure all cells collected were mOSNs. To collect knockout INP cells the olfactory epithelium was only allowed to regenerate for 8 days before collecting the MOE and FAC-sorting the tdTomato+(dim) cells. Late knockout of Nfi ABX in mOSNs was achieved by crossing NfiA, B, and X triple conditional alleles with tdTomato and Omp-ires-Cre, and FAC-sorting tdTomato+ cells from adult mice. Complete list of all the mouse genotypes can be found in Table 2.</p>
<p>Induction of Olfr17 was achieved by crossing tetoOlfr17 mice, described in (reference), with Gng8-tTA mice (reference). To assess stability of tetoOlfr17 expression after induction, adult mice &gt;8 weeks were placed on a diet containing high doxycyclineâ200mg/kg (Bio Serv, S3888)âfor 35 days. To achieve a lower level of tetoOlfr17 induction, tetoOlfr17 mice were crossed with Gng8-tTA mice while being kept on a low amount of doxycycline in waterâ1ug/ml (Sigma Aldrich, D9891)âas described in (insert reference). Mice were kept on doxycycline water throughout gestation and postnatal life, until collecting the MOE for analysis from mice &gt; 6 weeks old.</p>

<title>Zonal Annotation</title>
<p>OR genes were assigned a zonal annotation (referring to their native zone of expression) based on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. We generated bins from the continuous data by rounding to the nearest integer. There are a total of 1011 ORs with known zonal annotation. Of these, 115 are ClassI ORs, of which nearly all are expressed in zone1, and 896 are ClassII ORs, of which 261 are expressed in zone1, 283 in zone2, 164 in zone3, 144 in zone4 and 44 in zone5.</p>

<title>Zonal dissection of the olfactory epithelium</title>
<p>We used the fluorescent signal in Olfr545-delete-YFP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>] (zone 1 OR), Olfr17-ires-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>](zone 2 OR), and Olfr1507-ires-GFP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] (zone 5 OR) mice to practice dissections of dorsal (zones 1) MOE, dorsomedial (zone 2-3) MOE, and ventral (zone 4-5) MOE, respectively. Upon obtaining an accurate understanding of the zonal boundaries in the MOE we performed zonal dissections without the use of these fiduciary markers. Accuracy of dissections was confirmed by RNA-seq. For some experiments Olfr1507-ires-Cre and tdTomato reporter was crossed in to assist with accurate ventral MOE dissection (see Table 2.)</p>

<title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting</title>
<p>Cells were prepared for FAC-sorting as previously described in[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] by dissociating olfactory epithelium tissue with papain for 40 minutes at 37Â°C according to the Worthington Papain Dissociation System. Cells were washed 2x with cold PBS before passing through a 40-um strainer. Live (DAPI-negative) fluorescent cells were collected for RNA-seq and native ChIP-seq. Alternatively, for Hi-C cells were fixed for 10 minutes in 1% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature, quenched with glycine, and washed with cold PBS before sorting fluorescent cells. Alternatively, for Dip-C, cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 minutes, inactivated with 1% BSA, and washed with cold 1% BSA in PBS before sorting fluorescent cells. All cells were sorted on a BD Aria II.</p>

<title>Single cell RNA-seq in olfactory lineage cell types</title>
<p>Mash1-CreER; tdTomato; Ngn1-GFP pups (ages P2-P4) were injected with tamoxifen and olfactory epithelium was collected after 48 hours. The tissue was dissected into ventral (zone 3-5) and dorsal OE (zone1-2) sections, from which GBC (tdTomato+, GFP-), INP (tdTomato+, GFP+), iOSN (tdTomato-, GFP+ bright) and mOSN (tdTomato-, GFP dim) cells were sorted into 384 well plates (split between the cell types). Each well of the 384 well plate had unique cell and molecular barcodes. Library preparation and sequencing was performed in collaboration with the New York Genome Center (NYGC) using a TSO approach for library preparation and sequenced on HiSeq2500. Reads were aligned to the mm10 genome according to the Drop-seq[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mccarrolllab.org/dropseq/">http://mccarrolllab.org/dropseq/</ext-link>), which uses STAR for alignment, and discarding multi mapped reads with Samtools -q 255. Aligned single cells had a median of 133,686 unique transcripts (UMIs) and 2,331 genes per cell (detected with a threshold of at least 3UMI). Experiment was performed in biological replicate, resulting in 764 cells, from which we discarded cells with less than 1000 genes and 20,000 UMIs, resulting in 669 cells. We further filtered for cells that contained less than 5% mitochondrial reads, resulting in 591 cells used for analysis. We used Seurat v3 to normalize counts and cluster single cells, resulting in 5 populations. Clusters were assigned a cell-type based on expression of known olfactory lineage markers. We used the default setting of genes expressed in at least 3 cells for clustering but changed it to 1 when looking at OR expression (since expression of any OR out of &gt; 1000 genes is a rare event). For all OR expression analysis we used a threshold of 3UMI for an OR to be considered expressed.</p>

<title>Bulk RNAseq in olfactory lineage cell types</title>
<p>GBC, INP, iOSN and mOSN were isolated from Mash1-CreER; tdTomato; Ngn1-GFP pups as described above with the tissue being dissected into a ventral (mostly zone 4-5), dorsal OE (mostly zone1) and a central section (that is enriched for zone2-3). The experiment was performed in biological replicate. RNA was extracted from FAC-sorted cells using Trizol and libraries were prepared with Nugen NuQuant RNA-seq library system and sequenced 50PE on HiSeq2500 or 75PE NextSeq (and trimmed to 50bp before aligning). Cutadapt was used to remove adapter sequences and reads were aligned to the mm10 genome with STAR. Samtools was used to select high mapping quality reads (-q 30). Normalization, calculation of FPKM (which we converted to TMP), and differential expression analysis was performed in R with DEseq2. For all RNA-seq data p-values refer to adjusted p-value (padj) calculated in DEseq2.</p>
<p>To find zone5 enriched transcription factors at each developmental stage we determined significantly differentially expressed transcription factors (from the Gene Ontology database annotation âDNA binding transcription factor activityâ) between ventral and dorsal cells with a padj less than 0.05 and at least a twofold change in expression (see Table 1.)

To find non-zonal mOSN markers, we made a list of significantly upregulated genes (with a padj less than 0.05, and a fold change greater two) in mOSNs (tomato-, GFP dim cells) across all zones compared to iOSNs (tomato-, GFP+ bright cells) across all zones.

After rebuilding the MOE from knockout progenitors, we dissected ventral (zone5) MOE and FAC-sorted GFP+ mOSNs. RNA was extracted from sorted cells using Trizol and RNA-seq libraries were prepared with Nugen Nuquant RNA-seq library prep kit and sequenced 75PE on Nextseq 550. Reads were aligned exactly as described for zonal olfactory lineage data and similarly DEseq2 was used to determine differentially expressed genes between the different knockout and wt cells. To determine if ventral mOSN, dorsal mOSN and non-zonal mOSN markers change in ventral Nfi knockout cells, we analyzed the expression differences of the genes in our marker lists.</p>

<p>Native chip was performed as described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Unless otherwise indicated all steps were carried out at 4Â°C. Briefly, FAC-sorted cells were pelleted at 600 rcf for 10 minutes in a swinging bucket centrifuge at 4Â°C and resuspended in cold Buffer I (0.3M Sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA, 15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM PMSF, 0.5 mM DTT, 1x protease inhibitors). Cells were lysed by adding equal volume cold Bufferll (Buffer I with 0.4% NP40) and incubating for 10 minutes on ice. Nuclei were pelleted 10 min at 1000 rcf and resuspended in 250ul cold MNase buffer (0.32M Sucrose, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1x protease inhibitors). Micrococcal Nuclease digestion was carried out by adding 0.1U Micrococcal Nuclease (Sigma) per 100ul buffer and incubating for 1 min 40 sec in a 37Â°C water bath, then stopping the digestion by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 20mM. The first soluble chromatin fraction (S1) was collected by pelleting nuclei 10 min at 10,000 rcf at 4Â°C and taking the supernatant to store at 4Â°C overnight. Undigested, pelleted material was resuspended in 250ul cold Dialysis Buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 1x protease inhibitors) and rotating overnight at 4Â°C. The second soluble chromatin fraction (S2) was collected by pelleting insoluble material 10 min at 10,000 rcf at 4Â°C and taking the supernatant. S1 and S2 chromatin fractions were combined and used for immunoprecipitation with 5% material being retained for input. Equal cell numbers were used for control and knockout IPs, or between different cell types or zones. To perform immunoprecipitation (IP), chromatin was diluted to 1ml in Wash Buffer1 (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 125 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5 mM 1x protease inhibitors) and rotated overnight at 4Â°C with 1ug antibody. Dynabeads (10ul Protein A and 10ul Protein G per IP) were blocked overnight with 2 mg/ml yeast tRNA and 2 mg/mL BSA in Wash Buffer 1. Blocked beads were washed once with Wash Buffer 1, then added to antibody bound chromatin and rotated 2-3 hours at 4Â°C. Chromatin bound beads were washed 4x with Wash Buffer1, 3x with Wash Buffer 2 (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 175 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP40, 1x protease inhibitors), and 1x in TE pH 7.5.

Reads were aligned to mm10 with BWA mem, and hickit was used to determine the haplotype of each contact based on SNPs between Cas and OMP-ires-GFP mice and make a model of the 3D genome. Since OMP-ires-GFP mice were a mixture of Bl6/129 strains, we only included SNPs that were unique to Cas mice to distinguish homologs. After alignment, cells were filtered using several quality control metrics described in Tan et al. 2019: We excluded cells that had less than 20,000 reads, cells that had a low contact-to-read ratio, and cells that had a high variability in 3D structure across computational replicates. Only 4 of 96 cells failed these metrics. Overall, the median number of contacts across cells was over 400,000. Computational analysis OR genes and Greek Island enhancers, including computing average contact densities and analysis of the 3D models, was performed using the Dip-C pipeline. Average contact densities between OR genes and/or Greek Islands were calculated with âdip-c ardâ. Pairwise distances between OR genes and/or Greek Islands from the 3D models were extracted with âdip-c pdâ.

<p>Mature mammalian olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) express only one of the hundreds of possible odor receptors (ORs) encoded in the genome. The process of selecting this OR in each OSN is the consequence of both deterministic developmental processes involving transcription factors, and more stochastic processes. How this balance is implemented is a major problem in molecular neuroscience, one whose solution has significant systems-level implications for odor coding. In Bashkirova et al the authors substantially revise the canonical view of how this process works. By querying single cell transcriptomes and genetic architecture across OSN development, the authors demonstrate that OSN progenitors express ORs for their zone and for more dortsal zones, and that the degree of heterochromatinization of non-expressed ORs varies as a function of which zone a given OSN resides in. Through additional genetic experiments (including knockouts of transcription factors that seem to be associated with zonal identity, and the clever use of OR transgenes) they synthesize these findings into a model in which progenitors co-express many ORs - both ORs that are appropriate for their zone and ORs that are dorsal to their zone - and that this expression both facilitates heterochromatinzation of non-selected and extra-zonal ORs, and enables singular OR selection. The experiments are careful and the data are novel, and definitely revise our simplistic current view of how this process works; as such this work will have significant impact on the field. As presented the model requires additional experiments to fully flesh it out, and to definitively demonstrate that i.e., precocious expression leads to gene silencing, but with some additional clarifications in the discussion this paper both breaks new ground and sets the stage for future work exploring mechanisms of OSN development and OR selection.</p>

<p>In this study, Bashkirova et al. analyzed how the gene choice of olfactory receptors (ORs) is regulated in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) during development. In the mouse olfactory system, there are more than 1000 functional OR genes and several hundred pseudogenes. It is well-established that each individual OSN expresses only one functional OR gene in a mono-allelic manner. This is referred to as the one neuron - one receptor rule. It is also known that OR gene choice is not entirely stochastic but restricted to a particular area or zone in the olfactory epithelium (OE) along the dorsoventral axis. It is interesting to study how this stochastic but biased gene-choice is regulated during OSN development, narrowing down the number of OR genes to be chosen to eventually achieve the monogenic OR expression in OSNs.</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors cell-sorted OSNs into three groups; immediate neuronal precursors (INPs), immature OSNs (iOSNs), and mature OSNs (mOSNs). They found that OR gene choice is differentially regulated positively by transcription factors in INPs and negatively by heterochromatin-mediated OR gene silencing in iOSNs. The authors propose that by the combination of two opposing forces of polygenic transcription (positive) and genomic silencing (negative), each OSN finally expresses only one OR gene out of over 2000 alleles in a stochastic but stereotypic manner.</p>
<p>The authors' model of OR gene choice is supported by well-designed experiments and by large amounts of data. In general, the paper is clearly written and easy to follow. It will attract a wide variety of readers in the fields of neuroscience, developmental biology, and immunology. The present finding will give new insight into our understanding of gene choice in the multigene family in the mammalian brain and shed light on the long-standing question of monogenic expression of OR genes.</p>

<p>This manuscript investigates how a seemingly random choice of odourant receptor (OR) gene expression is organised into sterotypic zones of OR expression along the olfactory epithelium. Using a varietty of functional genomics methods, the authors find that along the differentiation axis (progenitor to mature olfactory sensory neuron, OSN) multiple ORs are initally transcribed and from among these, only one OR is selected for expression. The rest are suppressed through chromatin silencing. In addition to this, the authors report a dorso-ventral gradient in OR expression at the immature stage - dorsally expressed ORs are also expressed ventrally and these then get silenced. The expression of the ventrally expressed ORs, on the other hand, are restricted to the ventral region. They suggest a role for the transcription factor NF1 in this dorsoventral process.</p>
<p>This is a valuable study. The data are compelling and generally well presented.</p>
