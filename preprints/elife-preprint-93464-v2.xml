<title>Abstract</title><p>Salt is an essential nutrient for survival, while excessive NaCl can be detrimental. In the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, internal taste organs in the pharynx are critical gatekeepers impacting the decision to accept or reject a food. Currently, our understanding of the mechanism through which pharyngeal gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) sense high salt are rudimentary. Here, we found that a member of the ionotropic receptor family, <italic>Ir60b</italic>, is expressed exclusively in a pair of GRNs activated by high salt. Using a two-way choice assay (DrosoX) to measure ingestion volume, we demonstrate that IR60b and two coreceptors IR25a and IR76b, are required to prevent high salt consumption. Mutants lacking external taste organs but retaining the internal taste organs in the pharynx exhibit much higher salt avoidance than flies with all taste organs but missing the three IRs. Our findings highlight the vital role for IRs in a pharyngeal GRN to control ingestion of high salt.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The sense of taste enables animals to find nutritious food while avoiding potentially harmful substances in their environment. Most animals have evolved sophisticated systems to detect and steer clear of consuming levels of substances that are toxic. Salts such as NaCl are essential for a wide array of physiological functions. However, consumption of excessive salt can contribute to various health issues in mammals, including hypertension, osteoporosis, gastrointestinal cancer, autoimmune diseases, and can lead to death <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, high concentrations of salt are rejected by most animals.</p>
<p>Multiple studies have delved into how Na<sup>+</sup> is sensed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> taste system, shedding light on the mechanisms behind the attraction to low salt and aversion to high salt <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The largest taste organs in flies are two bilaterally symmetrical labella, each of which is decorated with 31 gustatory bristles (sensilla). These sensilla are defined based on size (small, S; intermediate, I; large, L). The I-type sensilla harbor two gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), while the S- and L-sensilla contain four. These GRNs fall into five classes (A-E) based on their response profiles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These include Class A GRNs (formerly sugar GRNs; marked by <italic>Gr5a</italic> or <italic>Gr64f</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which respond to attractive compounds such as low salt, sugars, glycerol, fatty acids and carboxylic acids, Class B GRNs (formerly bitter GRNs; marked by <italic>Gr66a</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, which are activated by high Na<sup>+</sup>, bitter compounds, acids, polyamines, tryptophan, and L-canavanine, Class C GRNs respond to water (marked by <italic>ppk28</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, Class D GRNs detect high levels of cations such as Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (marked by <italic>ppk23</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and Class E GRNs sense low Na<sup>+</sup> levels and pheromones (marked by <italic>Ir94e</italic>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Several of the 66 ionotropic receptor (IR) family members function in the sensation of low and high salt. These include IR76b and IR25a, which are IR-coreceptors, and therefore have broad roles in sensing many taste stimuli including low and high Na<sup>+</sup> (also referred to in this work as salt) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, several carboxylic acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, fatty acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, amino acids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and carbonation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. A subset of Class A GRNs, as well as glutamatergic Class E GRNs are responsible for sensing low salt <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and this sensation depends on IR56b working together with the broadly expressed co-receptors IR25a and IR76b <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Conversely, detection of high salt depends on Class B GRNs and Class D GRNs, and IR7c, in conjunction with IR25a and IR76b <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, two Pickpocket channels, Ppk11, Ppk19, and Sano have been associated with high salt aversion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In addition to the labellum and taste bristles on other external structures, such as the tarsi, fruit flies are endowed with hairless sensilla on the surface of the labellum (taste pegs), and three internal taste organs lining the pharynx, the labral sense organ (LSO), the ventral cibarial sense organ (VCSO), and the dorsal cibarial sense organ (DCSO), which also function in the decision to keep feeding or reject a food <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. A pair of GRNs in the LSO express a member of the gustatory receptor family, <italic>Gr2a</italic>, and knockdown of <italic>Gr2a</italic> in these GRNs impairs the avoidance to slightly aversive levels of Na<sup>+</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Pharyngeal GRNs also promote the aversion to bitter tastants, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, L-canavanine, and bacterial lipopolysaccharides <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Other pharyngeal GRNs are stimulated by sugars and contribute to sugar consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Remarkably, a pharyngeal GRN in each of the two LSOs functions in the rejection rather the acceptance of sucrose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this work, we investigated whether IRs function in pharyngeal GRNs for avoidance of high Na<sup>+</sup>. We found that IR60b, along with co-receptors IR25a and IR76b function in a taste organ in the pharynx for limiting high salt consumption. <italic>Ir60b</italic> is expressed exclusively in a pair of pharyngeal GRNs in the LSO <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and we found that these neurons respond to high Na<sup>+</sup>. While these <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRNs are narrowly tuned, surprisingly, they have previously been shown to respond to sucrose and glucose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Introduction of the rat capsaicin receptor, TRPV1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, into <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRNs induces aversion towards capsaicin, supporting the conclusion that <italic>Ir60b</italic>-positive GRNs are sufficient for instinctive avoidance. To validate these findings further, we used a two-way choice DrosoX assay <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> to measure actual ingestion levels. We found that the three <italic>Ir</italic> mutants consumed high salt at levels similar to sucrose over an extended period, emphasizing the critical role of this single pair of pharyngeal GRNs in controlling harmful ingestion of high salt.</p>

<title><italic>Ir60b</italic> functions in the repulsion to high salt</title>
<p>To identify potential salt sensors in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we conducted binary food choice assays using 30 <italic>Ir</italic> mutants (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</italic></bold>). Through screens in which we gave flies a choice between 2 mM sucrose alone or 2 mM sucrose plus a low, attractive level of salt (50 mM NaCl), we confirmed that <italic>Ir76b</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, <italic>Ir25a</italic>, and <italic>Ir56b</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, are essential for detecting low salt (<bold><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</italic></bold>). Moreover, using tip recordings to assay tastant-induced action potentials, we confirmed a previous report <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> that loss of <italic>Ir56b</italic> nearly eliminated spikes in S-type and L-type sensilla in response to low salt (<bold><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</italic></bold>). Using <italic>Ir56b</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> to drive <italic>UAS-mCD8</italic>::<italic>GFP,</italic> we also confirmed that the reporter was restricted to a subset of Class A GRNs, which were marked with <italic>LexAop-tdTomato</italic> expressed under the control of the <italic>Gr64f-LexA</italic> (<bold><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1D—F</italic></bold>). We generated a <italic>UAS-Ir56b</italic> transgene which restored normal frequencies of action potentials in <italic>Ir56b</italic>-expressing GRNs (<bold><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</italic></bold>). Moreover, ectopic expression of <italic>UAS-Ir56b</italic> in GRNs that typically have minimal responses to low salt, caused a large increase in salt-induced action potentials (<bold><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</italic></bold>).</p>

<p>In our behavioral screen for <italic>Ir</italic> mutants required for avoiding high salt (300 mM NaCl), we found that in addition to <italic>Ir7c</italic>, <italic>Ir25a</italic>, and <italic>Ir76b</italic> as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, <italic>Ir60b</italic> was also required (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic></bold>). The <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutant, <italic>Ir60b<sup>3</sup></italic>, was generated by removing 768 base pairs, which spanned from 44 base pairs upstream of the predicted transcription start site to the region coding for the N-terminal 241 residues of the 577-amino acid protein (<bold><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 2A—C</italic></bold>). We verified the impairment in high salt avoidance using a previously described mutant, <italic>Ir60b<sup>1</sup></italic> (<bold><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</italic></bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We conducted dose-response behavioral assays using the <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutants, as well as <italic>Ir25a</italic>, <italic>Ir76b</italic> and <italic>Ir7c</italic> mutants and found that all four exhibited significant deficiencies in avoiding salt concentrations ranging from 200 mM to 500 mM (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic></bold>). Nevertheless, all of the mutants exhibited a strong aversion to an extremely high salt concentration (1000 mM), a level twice as concentrated as sea water. This very high level of NaCl could potentially trigger activation of nociceptive neurons, serving as a protective mechanism to prevent potential tissue and organ damage.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Activation of <italic>Ir60b</italic> neurons inhibits motivation to feed</title>
<p>To investigate whether activation of <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRNs induces aversive behavior, we used both chemogenetic and optogenetic approaches. Capsaicin, a ligand for the mammalian TRPV1 channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, does not normally elicit responses in flies (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic></bold>) as described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Therefore, we expressed <italic>UAS-trpV1</italic> under the control of the <italic>Ir60b-GAL4</italic>, and presented the flies with a choice between a 2 mM sucrose and a 2 mM sucrose laced with 100 μM capsaicin. We found that the transgenic flies actively avoided capsaicin (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic></bold>), whereas expression of TRPV1 in Class A (sweet) GRNs (<italic>Gr64f-GAL4</italic> and <italic>UAS-trpV1</italic>) induced a preference for capsaicin (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic></bold>). These findings support the idea that the activation of <italic>Ir60b</italic> neurons leads to gustatory avoidance.</p>
<p>To further test the proposal that <italic>Ir60b</italic>-positive GRNs elicit aversive behavior, we expressed CsChrimson, a light-activated cation channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> in the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN. As controls we drove <italic>UAS-CsChrimson</italic> expression using either the <italic>Gr5a</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> or the <italic>Gr66a</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic>. Upon stimulation with red lights and 2% sucrose, nearly all of the control flies (<italic>UAS-CsChrimson</italic> only) or flies expressing <italic>UAS-CsChrimson</italic> in Class A GRNs (<italic>Gr5a-GAL4</italic>) extended their proboscis (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></italic></bold>).

<p>To examine the gustatory repulsion to high salt that is mediated through the labellum, we conducted proboscis extension response (PER) assays. Starved control and <italic>Ir</italic> mutant flies extend their proboscis when the labellum is lightly touched with a 100 mM sucrose probe <bold><italic>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></italic></bold>). Upon a second sucrose offering, the various fly lines exhibited slightly diminished responses (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref></italic></bold>). When we added 300 mM salt to the sucrose, it significantly reduced the PER in the control group (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">I</xref></italic></bold>; first offering 40.9 ± 4.0%; second offering 41.5 ± 3.7%).

<title>High salt sensor in the pharynx</title>
<p>The observations that <italic>Ir60b</italic> is required for the normal aversion to high salt, but does not appear to function in labellar bristles raise the possibility that <italic>Ir60b</italic> is required in the pharynx for salt repulsion. <italic>Ir60b</italic> is expressed in the pharynx where it plays a role in limiting sucrose consumption <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. <italic>Gr2a</italic> is also expressed in the pharynx and contributes to the repulsion to moderate salt levels (150 mM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.

<p>To investigate a role for GRNs in the pharynx for high salt (300 mM) repulsion, we conducted tests on the <italic>Poxn</italic> mutant (<italic>Poxn<sup>70–28</sup></italic>/<italic>Poxn</italic><sup>Δ<italic>M22-B5</italic></sup>) in which external chemosensory bristles have been converted to mechanosensory sensilla <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.

<title>Quantification of increased high salt ingestion in <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutants</title>
<p>In a prior study, it was observed that the repulsion to high salt exhibited by the <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Specifically, the flies were presented with a drop of liquid (sucrose plus salt) at the end of a probe, and the <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutant flies fed on the food for the same period of time as control flies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. However, this assay did not discern whether or not the volume of the high salt-containing food consumed by the <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutant flies was reduced relative to control flies. Therefore, to assess the volume of food ingested, we used the DrosoX system, which we recently developed (<bold><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</italic></bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. This system consists of a set of five separately housed flies, each of which is exposed to two capillary tubes with different liquid food options. One capillary contained 100 mM sucrose and the other contained 100 mM sucrose mixed with 300 mM NaCl. The volume of food consumed from each capillary was then monitored automatically over the course of 6 hours and recorded on a computer. We found that control flies consuming approximately four times more of the 100 mM sucrose than the sucrose mixed with 300 mM NaCl (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>). In contrast, the <italic>Ir25a</italic>, <italic>Ir60b</italic>, and <italic>Ir76b</italic> mutants consumed approximately two-fold less of the sucrose plus salt (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic></bold>). Consequently, they ingested similar amounts of the two food options (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic></bold>; ingestion index). Thus, while the <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutant and control flies spend similar amounts of time in contact with high salt-containing food when it is the only option <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, the mutant consumes considerably less of the high salt food when presented with a sucrose option without salt.</p>

<p>To further investigate the requirement for <italic>Ir25a</italic>, <italic>Ir60b</italic>, and <italic>Ir76b</italic>, we performed genetic rescue experiments. We introduced their respective wild-type cDNAs under the control of their cognate <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers, which resulted in a conversion from salt-insensitive behavior to the salt-sensitive behavior observed in wild-type flies (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-H</xref></italic></bold>). In addition, the defects in the <italic>Ir25a<sup>2</sup></italic> and <italic>Ir76b<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants were fully rescued by expressing the wild-type <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> transgenes, respectively, in the pharynx using the <italic>Ir60b</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I-L</xref></italic></bold>). This suggests that both IR25a and IR76b act as coreceptors in the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRNs. Furthermore, we investigated whether the expression of <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Ir60b</italic> driven by <italic>Ir25a</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> or <italic>Ir76b</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> could rescue the defects observed in <italic>Ir60b<sup>3</sup></italic>. Despite the broad expression of <italic>Ir60b</italic> using these <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers, the <italic>Ir60b</italic> salt ingestion defect was rescued (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3M</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">N</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we addressed whether <italic>Ir60b</italic> is required specifically for regulating ingestion of high salt. To investigate this, we assessed the volumes of caffeine, strychnine, and coumarin consumed by <italic>Ir60b<sup>3</sup></italic> flies. We found that the <italic>Ir60b<sup>3</sup></italic> mutant displayed similar consumption patterns to the wild-type control flies for these bitter compounds (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O, P</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B—E</italic></bold>). This is in contrast to the impairments exhibited by the <italic>Gr66a<sup>ex83</sup></italic> mutant (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O, P</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B—E</italic></bold>), which displays defects in sensing many bitter chemicals. This indicates that <italic>Ir60b</italic> is involved in regulating the avoidance of high salt ingestion rather than general avoidance responses to toxic compounds. Nevertheless, the role of <italic>Ir60b</italic> in suppressing feeding is not limited to high salt, since <italic>Ir60b</italic> also functions in the pharynx in inhibiting the consumption of sucrose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To investigate the aversion induced by high salt in the absence of a highly attractive sugar, such as sucrose, we combined 300 mM salt with 100 mM sorbitol, which is a tasteless but nutritive sugar <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Using two-way choice assays, we found that the <italic>Ir25a</italic>, <italic>Ir60b</italic>, and <italic>Ir76b</italic> mutants exhibited substantial reductions in high salt avoidance (<bold><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</italic></bold>). In addition, we performed DrosoX assays using 100 mM sorbitol alone or sorbitol mixed with 300 mM NaCl. Sorbitol alone provoked less feeding than sucrose since it is a tasteless sugar (<bold><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C</italic></bold>). Nevertheless, addition of high salt to the sorbitol reduced food consumption (<bold><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C</italic></bold>).</p>

These findings imply that all three <italic>Ir</italic>s are coexpressed in the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN in the pharynx. Therefore, we examined the relative expression patterns of the <italic>Ir60b</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> reporter with the <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> reporters. We observed that the <italic>Ir76b</italic>-<italic>QF</italic> reporter was expressed in two cells within the labral sensory organ (LSO), one of which colocalized with the <italic>Ir60b</italic> reporter (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></italic></bold>).

Thus, we suggest that <italic>Ir25a</italic>, <italic>Ir60b</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> function in the same GRN in the LSO to limit consumption of high salt.

<p>To determine whether the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN in the LSO is activated by high salt, we examined Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the LSO using <italic>UAS-GCaMP6f</italic>, expressed under the control of each <italic>GAL4</italic> driver. In the wild-type LSO, we identified a single cell that responded to 300 mM NaCl (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref></italic></bold>), indicating that the GRN in the LSO that expresses all three reporters responds to high salt. Moreover, this GRN responded robustly to 300 mM to 1000 mM Na<sup>+</sup> but not to a low level of Na<sup>+</sup> (50 mM; <bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></italic></bold>). We then examined the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the <italic>Ir25a<sup>2</sup></italic>, <italic>Ir60b<sup>3</sup></italic>, and <italic>Ir76b<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants, and found that each of them failed to respond to NaCl (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">E</xref></italic></bold>). Additionally, we rescued the deficits in the GCaMP6f responses exhibited by each mutant by expressing a wild-type transgene under control of the corresponding <italic>GAL4</italic> driver (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></italic></bold>). We also tested other Cl<sup>−</sup> salts (CaCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and KCl) to determine if Cl<sup>−</sup> rather than Na<sup>+</sup> induced responses in the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN. None of these other salts affected these neurons at the 50 mM, 300 mM, and 500 mM concentrations tested (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></italic></bold>). In contrast, NaBr induced GCaMP6f responses (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></italic></bold>). Thus, the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN is responsive to Na<sup>+</sup> and not Cl<sup>−</sup>. Due to the effects of NaBr on the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN, we used the DrosoX assay to determine whether 300 mM NaBr suppressed ingestion of sucrose. We found that the impact of NaBr on sucrose ingestion was similar to that with NaCl (<bold><italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</italic></bold>). We also found that the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN did not respond to bitter compounds such as quinine, caffeine, strychnine, lobeline, denatonium, and coumarin at the 5 mM and 50 mM concentrations (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref></italic></bold>).</p>
<p>It has been shown previously that <italic>Ir60b</italic> is required in a single GRN in the LSO for suppressing sucrose feeding, and this neuron responds to sucrose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether the same GRN in the LSO that responds to salt also responds to sucrose. Using GCaMP6f, we found that the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN was responsive to sucrose in the LSO of control flies, but not in the <italic>Ir25a</italic>, <italic>Ir60b</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> mutants (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref></italic></bold>). Furthermore, we used GCaMP6f to compare the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses exhibited by the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN to 100 mM sucrose alone, 300 mM NaCl alone, and a combination of 100 mM sucrose and 300 mM NaCl. We found that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were significantly higher when we exposed the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN to 300 mM NaCl alone, compared with the response to 100 mM sucrose alone (<bold><italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</italic></bold>). However, the GCaMP6f response was not higher when we presented 100 mM sucrose in combination with 300 mM NaCl, compared with the response to 300 mM NaCl alone. We conclude that the same LSO neuron depends on the same three receptors (IR25a, IR60b, and IR76b) for suppressing feeding in response to high salt or to sucrose.</p>
<p>Both Class B and Class D GRNs in labellar bristles respond to high salt <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, and the Class D GRNs (marked by <italic>ppk23</italic>) depend on <italic>Ir7c</italic> as well as <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> for responding to high salt <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Consequently, we investigated whether <italic>Ir7c</italic> plays a role in the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN in the LSO.

We then stimulated the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN in the LSO with 300 mM NaCl and found that the responses elicited by the mutant and control were the same (<bold><italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</italic></bold>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The taste organs lining the walls of the pharynx represent the final gatekeepers that flies use to decide whether to continue feeding or to reject the food. We found that activation of a single pharyngeal GRN by high salt depends on three IRs, two of which are widely expressed in other GRNs (<italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic>) and were previously shown to function in salt taste sensation in external labellar bristles. In addition, we identified a third IR (<italic>Ir60b</italic>) that contributes to salt rejection. Consistent with a previous study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, <italic>Ir60b</italic> is expressed in a single GRN in each of two labral sense organs (LSOs) lining the pharynx. In addition, we demonstrated that <italic>Ir60b</italic> is co-expressed with <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> in this one GRN in each LSO.</p>
<p>Multiple observations in this study underscore the important role of the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN in sensing high Na<sup>+</sup> levels and in promoting salt rejection. Mutation of <italic>Ir60b</italic> eliminates the flies ability to reject sucrose laced with high salt over another option with sucrose only. This result is especially notable in view of the observation that flies that are missing all GRNs in labellar bristles in the <italic>Poxn</italic> mutant exhibit a less pronounced defect than the <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutant, since <italic>Poxn</italic> mutant flies still retain some bias for sucrose over sucrose laced with high salt. The observation that one pair of pharyngeal GRNs is sufficient to induce rejection of high salt underscores the profound role of internal taste neurons in protecting flies from ingesting dangerous levels of this mineral. In addition, activation of the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN suppresses feeding since optogenetic activation of these neurons effectively suppresses the proboscis extension response (PER) when the flies are presented with a highly attractive tastant (sucrose). Conversely, Yang et al. demonstrated that activation of <italic>Ir60b</italic> neurons can induce the activation of IN1 neurons, potentially leading to heightened feeding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. However, our research reveals a specific activation pattern for <italic>Ir60b</italic> neurons. Instead of being generalists, they exhibit specialization for certain sugars, such as sucrose and high salt. As a result, while <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRNs activate IN1 neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, we posit that there are other neurons in the brain responsible for inhibiting feeding.</p>
<p>A finding that is seemingly conflicting with the optogenetic results is that mutation of <italic>Ir60b</italic> does not reduce the suppression of the PER when the flies are presented with sucrose laced with high Na<sup>+</sup> levels. The PER assay under high salt conditions only permits flies to taste the food without allowing ingestion. Consequently, the internal sensor may not exhibit suppression of the PER. In contrast, optogenetic activation has the capability to directly stimulate the internal sensor, leading to the induction of PER suppression. We propose that high Na<sup>+</sup> is effective in suppressing the PER by the <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutant since these flies still have functional high salt receptors in aversive GRNs in labellar bristles. In support of this conclusion, loss of either <italic>Ir25a</italic> or <italic>Ir76b</italic> reduces the suppression of the PER by high salt, and this occurs because <italic>Ir76b</italic> and <italic>Ir25a</italic> are required in both high salt activated GRNs in labellar bristles <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and in the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN in the pharynx.</p>
<p>We also found that the requirement for <italic>Ir60b</italic> appears to be different when performing binary liquid capillary assay (DrosoX), versus solid food binary feeding assays. When we employed the DrosoX assay to test mutants that were missing salt aversive GRNs in labellar bristles but still retained functional <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRNs, the flies behaved the same as wild-type flies (e.g. <bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">L</xref></italic></bold>). However, using solid food binary assays, <italic>Poxn</italic> mutants, which are missing labellar taste bristles but retain <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRNs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, displayed repulsion to high salt food that was intermediate between control flies and the <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutant (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref></italic></bold>). <italic>Poxn</italic> mutants still possess taste pegs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and these hairless taste organs become exposed to food only when the labial palps open. We suggest that there are high-salt sensitive GRNs associated with taste pegs, which are accessed when the labellum contacts a solid substrate, but not when flies drink from the capillaries used in DrosoX assays. This explanation would also account for the findings that the <italic>Ir60b</italic> mutant is indifferent to 300 mM NaCl in the DrosoX assay (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic></bold>), but prefers 1 mM sucrose alone over 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM sucrose in the solid food binary assay (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic></bold>). Alternatively, the different behavioral responses might be due to the variation in sucrose concentrations in each of these two assays, which employed 5 mM sucrose in the solid food binary assay, as opposed to 100 mM sucrose in the DrosoX assay. The disparity in attractive valence between these two concentrations of sucrose might consequently impact feeding amount and preference.</p>
<p>Another unresolved question is why does the some pharyngeal GRN respond to sucrose and high Na<sup>+</sup>. It has been pointed out that since flies prefer over ripe fruit, which has lower sucrose levels that ripe fruit, then activation of the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN by sucrose might serve to favor consumption of fruit at an advanced state of ripeness <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In contrast to sugar, Na<sup>+</sup> levels tend to remain constant during the ripening process <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> and remain at relatively low levels (50-100mM), which is below the level that is aversive to flies. Thus, in contrast to sucrose, assessing the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> does not aid in the distinction of ripe versus overripe fruit, but may be important in avoiding consuming non-vegetarian sources of food that are high in Na<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p>Based on Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging results with GCaMP6f, we conclude that the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN directly responds to NaCl, and this depends on the presence of <italic>Ir25a</italic>, <italic>Ir60b</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic>. The <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN responds to high NaCl, but is not stimulated by CaCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub> and KCl. Thus, the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN is a Na<sup>+</sup> sensor not a Cl<sup>−</sup> sensor. In further support of this conclusion, we found that the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN also responds to NaBr.</p>
<p>An open question is the subunit composition of the pharyngeal high Na<sup>+</sup> receptor, and whether the sucrose/glucose and Na<sup>+</sup> receptors in the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN are the same or distinct. Our results indicate that the high salt sensor in the <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN includes IR25a, IR60b and IR76b since all three IRs are required in the pharynx for sensing high levels of NaCl. I-type sensilla do not elicit a high salt response, and we were unable to induce salt activation in I-type sensilla by ectopically expressing <italic>Ir60b</italic>, under control of the <italic>Gr33a-GAL4.</italic> This indicates that IR25a, IR60b and IR76b are insufficient for sensing high Na<sup>+</sup>. The inability to confer a salt response by ectopic expression of <italic>Ir60b</italic> was not due to absence of <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> in <italic>Gr33a</italic> GRNs since <italic>Gr33a</italic> and <italic>Gr66a</italic> are co-expressed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, and <italic>Gr66a</italic> GRNs express <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, the high salt receptor in <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRNs appears to require an additional subunit. Given that Na<sup>+</sup> and sugars are structurally unrelated, we suggest that the Na<sup>+</sup> and sucrose/glucose receptors do not include the identical set of subunits, or that they activate a common receptor through disparate sites.</p>
<p>Finally, it is remarkable that the single <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN in the LSO of the pharynx is also stimulated by sucrose and to a lesser extent to glucose <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, since this GRN is otherwise very narrowly tuned. We did not detect GCaMP signals upon application any of six bitter tastants tested. The <italic>Ir60b</italic> GRN is also unresponsive to trehalose and glycerol. Based on behavioral experiments, mutation of <italic>Ir60b</italic> does not impact on consumption of an array of amino acids, low pH, bitter chemicals and other sugars <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. It is also surprising that the pharyngeal GRN that responds to Na<sup>+</sup> is unresponsive to other cations such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is toxic at high levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The fact that there are relatively few pharyngeal GRNs, yet one is narrowly tuned to sucrose, glucose and Na<sup>+</sup> underscores the critical role of limiting Na<sup>+</sup> consumption in flies, which could otherwise lead to dehydration, and dysfunction of many homeostatic processes impacted by excessive levels of Na<sup>+</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>DrosoX binary capillary feeding assay</title>
<p>DrosoX is a recently developed modification of the Expresso technique, which quantifies the amount of feeding by fruit flies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. We conducted DrosoX assays essentially as described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Each sensor bank of the DrosoX system is composed of a printed circuit board housing five Linear Optical Array Sensors (TAOS, TSL1406). Each sensor consists of 768 photodiodes and a microcontroller, establishing a connection to a computer through a Universal Serial Bus port. In the DrosoX setup, when a fly consumes liquid food from a glass capillary, a decrease in the liquid level is identified by a photodiode, enabling the calculation of instantaneous food ingestion. Photodiodes are semiconductor devices, which generate photocurrents upon absorbing light. To ensure light-tight conditions, the sensor bank is enclosed in a box made of black acrylic sheets using precision cutting. A computer reads the electrical signal generated by each photodiode, and the microcontroller (STMicroelectronics, STM32 F103RCBT6) on a development board (Scitech Korea) connected to the DrosoX sensor bank samples the light intensity at each pixel in the array at a rate of 8 Hz. Liquid level readings can be obtained at sample rates ranging from 0.1 to 2 Hz. The data acquisition software records the time vs. liquid level data for multiple sensor banks into a single file using the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/</ext-link>). The obtained data is then analyzed using software (DrosoX_gui) supplied by Scitech Korea.</p>
<p>The conduct the DrosoX assays, we inserted the system in a controlled incubator (25°C, 60% humidity). To quantify ingestion, a mixture comprising 100 mM sucrose and the specified concentration of chemicals was injected into a glass tube (Cat # 53432-706; VWR International, USA) using a syringe (KOVAX-SYRINGE 1 mL 26G; KOREA VACCINE, Korea) and needle (Cat # 90025; Hamilton, Switzerland). DrosoX was equipped with five glass tubes containing a solution, while DrosoXD was equipped with another set of five glass tubes containing different solutions (<bold><italic>Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</italic></bold>). DrosoX and DrosoXD were cross-tested. Each cuvette contained flies (3-6 days old) and was physically isolated to prevent them from consuming the solution prior to the experiment. Each experiment was conducted for a duration of 6 hours, from 9 AM to 3 PM. The ingestion amount at time X (X h) was calculated as the difference between the initial solution amount (0 h) and the solution amount at time X.</p>
<p>The ingestion index (I.I) was calculated at each time point using the following equation: (Ingestion volume<sub>DrosoX</sub> - Ingestion volume<sub>DrosoXD</sub>)/(Ingestion volume<sub>DrosoX</sub> + Ingestion volume<sub>DrosoXD</sub>) or (Ingestion volume<sub>DrosoXD</sub> - Ingestion volume<sub>DrosoX</sub>)/(Ingestion volume<sub>DrosoXD</sub> + Ingestion volume<sub>DrosoX</sub>), depending on the specific tastant combinations. A I.I. at 0.0 indicated no preference based on their ingestion between the two food alternatives.</p>

Pairwise comparisons were conducted using unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests. Statistical significance is denoted by asterisks (*p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01). We performed all statistical analyses using Origin Pro 8 for Windows (ver. 8.0932; Origin Lab Corporation, USA).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Sang et al. proposed a pair of IR60b-expressing pharyngeal neurons in Drosophila use IR25a, IR76b, and IR60b channels to detect high Na+ and limit its consumption. Some of the key findings that support this thesis are: 1) animals that lacked any one of these channels - or with their IR60b-expressing neurons selectively silenced - showed much reduced rejection of high Na+, but restored rejection when these channels were reintroduced back in the IR60b neurons; 2) animals with TRPV artificially expressed in their IR60b neurons rejected capsaicin-laced food whereas WT did not; 3) IR60b-expressing neurons exhibited increased Ca2+ influx in response to high Na+ and such response went away when animals lacked any of the three channels.</p>
<p>The experiments were thorough and well designed and further improved after revision. The results are compelling and support the main claim. The development and the use of the DrosoX two-choice assay put forward for a more quantitative and automatic/unbiased assessment for ingestion volume and preference.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Sang et al. set out to identify gustatory receptors involved in salt taste sensation in Drosophila melanogaster. In a two-choice assay screen of 30 Ir mutants, they identify that Ir60b is required for avoidance of high salt. In addition, they demonstrate that activation of Ir60b neurons is sufficient for gustatory avoidance using either optogenetics or TRPV1 to specifically activate Ir60b neurons. Then, using tip recordings of labellar gustatory sensory neurons and proboscis extension response behavioral assays in Ir60b mutants, the authors demonstrate that Ir60b is dispensable for labellar taste neuron responses to high salt and the suppression of proboscis extension by high salt. Since external gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) are not implicated, they look at Poxn mutants, which lack external chemosensory sensilla but have intact pharyngeal GRNs. High salt avoidance was reduced in Poxn mutants but was still greater than Ir60b mutants, suggesting that pharyngeal gustatory sensory neurons alone are sufficient for high salt avoidance. The authors use a new behavioral assay to demonstrate that Ir60b mutants ingest a higher volume of sucrose mixed with high salt than control flies do, suggesting that the action of Ir60b is to limit high salt ingestion. Finally, they identify that Ir60b functions within a single pair of gustatory sensory neurons in the pharynx, and that these neurons respond to high salt but not bitter tastants.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A great strength of this paper is that it rigorously corroborates previously published studies that have implicated specific Irs in salt taste sensation. It further introduces a new role for Ir60b in limiting high salt ingestion, demonstrating that Ir60b is necessary and sufficient for high salt avoidance and convincingly tracing the action of Ir60b to a particular subset of gustatory receptor neurons. Overall the authors have achieved their aim by identifying a new gustatory receptor involved in limiting high salt ingestion. They use rigorous genetic, imaging, and behavioral studies to achieve this aim, often confirming a given conclusion with multiple experimental approaches. They have further done a great service to the field by replicating published studies and corroborating the roles of a number of other Irs in salt taste sensation.</p>

It further introduces a new role for Ir60b in limiting high salt ingestion, demonstrating that Ir60b is necessary and sufficient for high salt avoidance and convincingly tracing the action of Ir60b to a particular subset of gustatory receptor neurons.

They have further done a great service to the field by replicating published studies and corroborating the roles of a number of other Irs in salt taste sensation. An aspect of this study that merits further investigation is how the same gustatory receptor neurons and Ir in the pharynx can be responsible for regulating the ingestion of both appetitive (sugar) and aversive tastants (high salt).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A previous report published in eLife from John Carlson’s lab (Joseph et al, 2017) showed that the Ir60b GRN in the pharynx responds to sucrose resulting in sucrose repulsion. Thus, stimulation of this pharyngeal GRN results in gustatory avoidance only, not both attraction and avoidance. (lines 205-207)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are several weaknesses that, if addressed, could greatly improve this work.</p>
<p>(1) The authors combine the results and discussion but provide a very limited interpretation of their results. More discussion of the results would help to highlight what this paper contributes, how the authors interpret their results, and areas for future study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and have now separated the Results and Discussion, and in so doing have greatly expanded discussion of the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors rename previously studied populations of labellar GRNs to arbitrary letters, which makes it difficult to understand the experiments and results in some places. These GRN populations would be better referred to according to the gustatory receptors they are known to express.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One of the corresponding authors (Craig Montell) introduced this alternative GRN nomenclature in a review in 2021: Montell, C. (Drosophila sensory receptors—a set of molecular Swiss Army Knives. Genetics 217, 1-34) (Montell, 2021). We are not fans of referring to different classes of GRNs based on the receptors that they express since it is not obvious which receptors to use. For example, the GRNs that respond to bitter compounds all express multiple GR co-receptors. The same is true for the GRNs that respond to sugars. The former system of referring to GRNs simply as sugar, bitter, salt and water GRNs is also not ideal since the repertoire of chemicals that stimulates each class is complex. For example, the Class A GRNs (formerly sugar GRNs) are also activated by low Na+, glycerol, fatty acids, and acetic acid, while the B GRNs (former bitter GRNs) are also stimulated by high Na+, acids, polyamines, and tryptophan. In addition, there are five classes of GRNs. At first mention of the Class A—E GRNs, we mention the most commonly used former nomenclature of sugar, bitter, salt and water GRNs. In addition, for added clarify, we now also include a mention of one of the receptors that mark each class. (lines 51-59)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The conclusion that GRNs responsible for high salt aversion may be inhibited by those that function in low salt attraction is not well substantiated. This conclusion seems to come from the fact that overexpression of Ir60b in salt attraction and salt aversion sensory neurons still leads to salt aversion, but there need not be any interaction between these two types of sensory neurons if they act oppositely on downstream circuits.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not make this claim.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors rely heavily on a new Droso-X behavioral apparatus that is not sufficiently described here or in the previous paper the authors cite. This greatly limits the reader's ability to interpret the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We expanded the description of the apparatus in the Droso-X assay section of the Materials and Methods. (lines 588-631)</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sang et al. successfully demonstrate that a set of single sensory neurons in the pharynx of <italic>Drosophila</italic> promotes avoidance of food with high salt concentrations, complementing previous findings on Ir7c neurons with an additional internal sensing mechanism. The experiments are well-conducted and presented, convincingly supporting their important findings and extending the understanding of internal sensing mechanisms. However, a few suggestions could enhance the clarity of the work.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate the avoidance phenotype using different behavioral assays, thus comprehensively analyzing different aspects of the behavior. The experiments are straightforward and well-contextualized within existing literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>While the authors effectively relate their findings to existing literature, expanding the discussion on the surprising role of Ir60b neurons in both sucrose and salt rejection would add depth. Additionally, considering Yang et al. 2021's (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109983">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109983</ext-link>) result that Ir60b neurons activate feeding-promoting IN1 neurons, the authors should discuss how this aligns with their own findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yang et al. demonstrated that the activation of Ir60b neurons can trigger the activation of IN1 neurons akin to pharyngeal multimodal (PM) neurons, potentially leading to enhanced feeding (Yang et al, 2021). However, our research reveals a specific pattern of activation for Ir60b neurons. Instead of being generalists, they are specialized for certain sugars, such as sucrose and high salt. Consequently, while Ir60b GRNs activate IN1 neurons, we contend that there are other neurons in the brain responsible for inhibiting feeding. (lines 412-417)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lines 187: The discussion primarily focuses on taste sensillae outside the labellum, neglecting peg-type sensillae on the inner surface. Clarification on whether these pegs contribute to the described behaviors and if the Poxn mutants described also affect the pegs would strengthen the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the following to the Discussion section. “We also found that the requirement for Ir60b appears to be different when performing binary liquid capillary assay (DrosoX), versus solid food binary feeding assays. When we employed the DrosoX assay to test mutants that were missing salt aversive GRNs in labellar bristles but still retained functional Ir60b GRNs, the flies behaved the same as wild-type flies (e.g. Figure 3J and 3L). However, using solid food binary assays, Poxn mutants, which are missing labellar taste bristles but retain Ir60b GRNs (LeDue et al, 2015), displayed repulsion to high salt food that was intermediate between control flies and the Ir60b mutant (Figure 2J). Poxn mutants retain taste pegs (LeDue et al., 2015), and these hairless taste organs become exposed to food only when the labial palps open. We suggest that there are high-salt sensitive GRNs associated with taste pegs, which are accessed when the labellum contacts a solid substrate, but not when flies drink from the capillaries used in DrosoX assays. This explanation would also account for the findings that the Ir60b mutant is indifferent to 300 mM NaCl in the DrosoX assay (Figure 3B), but prefers 1 mM sucrose alone over 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM sucrose in the solid food binary assay (Figure 1B).”. (lines 430-444)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In line 261 the authors state: &quot;We attempted to induce salt activation in the I-type sensilla by ectopically expressing Ir60b, similar to what was observed with Ir56b 8; however, this did not generate a salt receptor (Figures S6A)&quot;</p>
<p>An obvious explanation would be that these neurons are missing the identified necessary co-receptors Ir76b and Ir25a. The authors should discuss here if the Gr33a neurons they target also express these co-receptors, if yes this would strengthen their conclusion that an additional receptor might be missing.</p>

<p>We clarified this point in the Discussion section as follows, “An open question is the subunit composition of the pharyngeal high Na+ receptor, and whether the sucrose/glucose and Na+ receptors in the Ir60b GRN are the same or distinct. Our results indicate that the high salt sensor in the Ir60b GRN includes IR25a, IR60b and IR76b since all three IRs are required in the pharynx for sensing high levels of NaCl. I-type sensilla do not elicit a high salt response, and we were unable to induce salt activation in I-type sensilla by ectopically expressing Ir60b, under control of the Gr33a-GAL4. This indicates that IR25a, IR60b and IR76b are insufficient for sensing high Na+. The inability to confer a salt response by ectopic expression of Ir60b was not due to absence of Ir25a and Ir76b in Gr33a GRNs since Gr33a and Gr66a are co-expressed (Moon et al, 2009), and Gr66a GRNs express Ir25a and Ir76b (Li et al, 2023). Thus, the high salt receptor in Ir60b GRNs appears to require an additional subunit. Given that Na+ and sugars are structurally unrelated, we suggest that the Na+ and sucrose/glucose receptors do not include the identical set of subunits, or that that they activate a common receptor through disparate sites”.

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, Sang et al. proposed a pair of IR60b-expressing pharyngeal neurons in Drosophila use IR25a, IR76b, and IR60b channels to detect high Na+ and limit its consumption. Some of the key findings that support this thesis are: 1) animals that lacked any one of these channels - or with their IR60b-expressing neurons selectively silenced - showed much reduced rejection of high Na+, but restored rejection when these channels were reintroduced back in the IR60b neurons; 2) animals with TRPV artificially expressed in their IR60b neurons rejected capsaicin-laced food whereas WT did not; 3) IR60b-expressing neurons exhibited increased Ca2+ influx in response to high Na+ and such response went away when animals lacked any of the three channels. In general, I find the collective evidence presented by the authors convincing. But I feel the MS can benefit from having a discussion session and a few simple experiments. Below I listed some inconsistencies I hope the authors can address or at least discuss.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now added a Discussion section, and expanded the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The role of IR60b neurons on suppressing PER appeared inconsistent. On the one hand, optogenetic activation of these neurons suppressed PER (Fig 1D), on the other hand, IR60b mutants were as competent to suppress PER in response to high salt as WT (Fig 2G). Are pharyngeal neurons expected to modulate PER? It might be worth including a retinal-free or genotype control to ascertain the PER suppression exhibited by IR60b&gt;CsChrimson is genuine.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please note that Figure 2G is now Figure 2H.</p>
<p>Our interpretation is that activation of aversive GRNs by high salt either in labellar bristles or in the pharynx is sufficient to inhibit repulsion to high salt. Consistent with this conclusion, optogenetic activation of Ir60b GRNs, which are specific to the pharynx, is sufficient to reduce the PER to sucrose containing food (Figure 1D). However, mutation of Ir60b has no impact on the PER to sucrose plus high (300 mM) NaCl since the high-salt activated GRNs in labellar bristles are not impaired by the Ir60b mutation. In contrast, Ir25a and Ir76b are required in both labellar bristles and in the pharynx to reject high salt. As a consequence, mutation of either Ir25a or Ir76b impairs the repulsion to high salt. Thus, there is no inconsistency between the optogenetics and PER results. We clarified this point in the Discussion section. In terms of controls for IR60b&gt;CsChrimson, we show that UAS-CsChrimson alone or UAS-CsChrimson in combination with the Gr5a driver has no impact on the PER (Figure 1D). In addition, we now include a retinal free control (Figure 1D). These findings provide the key genetic controls and are described in the Results section. (lines 167-170)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The role of labellar high-salt sensors in regulating salt intake appeared inconsistent. On the one hand, they appeared to have a role in limiting high salt consumption because poxn mutants were significantly more receptive to high salt than WT (Fig. 2J). On the other hand, selectively restoring IR76b or IR25a in only the IR60b neurons in these mutants - thus leaving the labellar salt sensors still defective - reverted the flies to behave like WT when given a choice between sucrose vs. sucrose+high salt (Fig 3J, L).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now offer an explanation for these seemingly conflicting results in the Discussion section. When we employed the DrosoX assay with mutants with functional Ir60b GRNs, but were missing salt aversive GRNs in labellar bristles, the flies behaved the same as control flies (e.g. Figure 3J and L). However, using solid food binary assays, Poxn mutants, which are missing labellar taste bristles but retain Ir60b GRNs (LeDue et al., 2015), display aversion high salt food intermediate between control and Ir60b mutant flies (Figure 2J). Poxn mutants retain taste pegs (LeDue et al., 2015), which are exposed to food substrates only when the labial palps open. We suggest that the taste pegs harbor high salt sensitive GRNs, and they may be exposed to solid substrates, but not to the liquid in capillary tubes used in the DrosoX assays. This explanation would also account for the findings that the Ir60b mutant is indifferent to 300 mM NaCl in the DrosoX assay (Figure 3B), but prefers 1 mM sucrose alone over 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM sucrose in the solid food binary assay (Figure 1B). (lines 433-444)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The behavior sensitivity of IR60b mutant to high salt again appeared somewhat inconsistent when assessed in the two different choice assays. IR60b mutant flies were indifferent to 300 mM NaCl when assayed with DrosoX (Fig 3A, B) but were clearly still sensitive to 300 mM NaCl when assayed with &quot;regular&quot; assay - they showed much reduced preference for 5 mM sucrose over 1 mM sucrose when the 5 mM sucrose was adulterated with 300 mM NaCl (Fig 1B).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The explanation provided above may also account for the findings that the Ir60b mutant is indifferent to 300 mM NaCl in the DrosoX assay (Figure 3B), but not when selecting between 300 mM NaCl and 5 mM sucrose versus 1 mM sucrose in the solid food binary assay (Figure 1B). Alternatively, the different behavioral responses might be due to the variation in sucrose concentrations in each of these two assays, which employed 5 mM sucrose in the solid food binary assay, as opposed to 100 mM sucrose in the DrosoX assay. This disparity in attractive valence between these two concentrations of sucrose might consequently impact feeding amount and preference. This point is now also included in the Discussion section. (lines 441-449)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Given the IR60b neurons exhibited clear IR60b/IR25a/IR76b-dependent sucrose sensitivity, too, I am curious how the various mutant animals behave when given a choice between 100 mM sorbitol vs. 100 mM sorbitol + 300 mM NaCl, a food choice assay not complicated by the presence of sucrose. Similarly, I am curious if the Ca2+ response of IR60 neurons differs significantly when presented with 100 mM sucrose vs. when presented with 100 mM sucrose + 300 mM NaCl. In principle, the magnitude for the latter should be significantly larger than the former as animals appeared to be capable of discriminating these two choices solely relying on their IR60b neurons.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To investigate the aversion induced by high salt in the absence of a highly attractive sugar, such as sucrose, we combined 300 mM salt with 100 mM sorbitol, which is a tasteless but nutritive sugar (Burke &amp; Waddell, 2011; Fujita &amp; Tanimura, 2011). Using two-way choice assays, we found that the Ir25a, Ir60b, and Ir76b mutants exhibited substantial reductions in high salt avoidance (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). In addition, we performed DrosoX assays using 100 mM sorbitol alone, or sorbitol mixed with 300 mM NaCl. Sorbitol alone provoked less feeding than sucrose since it is a tasteless sugar (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C). Nevertheless, addition of high salt to the sorbitol reduced food consumption (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and C). (lines 300-308)</p>
<p>We also conducted a comparative analysis of the Ca2+ responses within the Ir60b GRN, examining its reaction to various stimuli, including 100 mM sucrose alone, 300 mM NaCl alone, and a combination of 100 mM sucrose and 300 mM NaCl. We found that the Ca2+ responses were significantly higher when we exposed the Ir60b GRN to 300 mM NaCl alone, compared with the response to 100 mM sucrose alone (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). However, the GCaMP6f responses was not higher when we presented 100 mM sucrose with 300 mM NaCl, compared with the response to 300 mM NaCl alone (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). (lines 360-367)</p>

<p>We have now added citations. We prefer the A—E nomenclature, which was introduced in a 2021 Genetics review by one of the authors of this manuscript (Montell) (Montell, 2021) since naming different classes of GRNs on the basis of markers or as sweet, bitter, salt and water GRNs is misleading and an oversimplification. We cite the Genetics 2021 review, and for added clarity include both types of former names (markers and sweet, bitter, salt and water). Class D GRNs are not marked by Gr66a. The eLife reference cited above provided the initial rationale for stating that Class E GRNs are marked by Ir94e and activated by low salt. According to the Taisz et al reference (Cell 2023), the Class E GRNs, which are marked by Ir94e, are also activated by pheromones, which we now mention (Taisz et al, 2023). (lines 51-59)</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We devote the following paragraph to pharyngeal GRNs. We do not mention how they fit in with the A—E categories because it is not clear.</p>
<p>“In addition to the labellum and taste bristles on other external structures, such as the tarsi, fruit flies are endowed with hairless sensilla on the surface of the labellum (taste pegs), and three internal taste organs lining the pharynx, the labral sense organ (LSO), the ventral cibarial sense organ (VCSO), and the dorsal cibarial sense organ (DCSO), which also function in the decision to keep feeding or reject a food (Chen &amp; Dahanukar, 2017, 2020; LeDue et al., 2015; Nayak &amp; Singh, 1983; Stocker, 1994). A pair of GRNs in the LSO express a member of the gustatory receptor family, Gr2a, and knockdown of Gr2a in these GRNs impairs the avoidance to slightly aversive levels of Na+ (Kim et al, 2017). Pharyngeal GRNs also promote the aversion to bitter tastants, Cu2+, L-canavanine, and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (Choi et al, 2016; Joseph et al., 2017; Soldano et al, 2016; Xiao et al, 2022). Other pharyngeal GRNs are stimulated by sugars and contribute to sugar consumption (Chen &amp; Dahanukar, 2017; Chen et al, 2021; LeDue et al., 2015). Remarkably, a pharyngeal GRN in each of the two LSOs functions in the rejection rather the acceptance of sucrose (Joseph et al., 2017).”. (lines 74-89)</p>

<p>Line 218-219, It would be helpful to expand on this to explain how the previous paper detected no difference. Is this because the contact time with the food is the same but the rate of ingestion is slower?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. This is correct. We now clarify this point by stating that, “In a prior study, it was observed that the repulsion to high salt exhibited by the Ir60b mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type (Joseph et al., 2017). Specifically, the flies were presented with drop of liquid (sucrose plus salt) at the end of a probe, and the Ir60b mutant flies fed on the food for the same period of time as control flies (Joseph et al., 2017). However, this assay did not discern whether or not the volume of the high salt-containing food consumed by the Ir60b mutant flies was reduced relative to control flies. Therefore, to assess the volume of food ingested, we used the DrosoX system, which we recently developed (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) (Sang et al, 2021). This system consists of a set of five separately housed flies, each of which is exposed to two capillary tubes with different liquid food options. One capillary contained 100 mM sucrose and the other contained 100 mM sucrose mixed with 300 mM NaCl. The volume of food consumed from each capillary was then monitored automatically over the course of 6 hours and recorded on a computer. We found that control flies consuming approximately four times more of the 100 mM sucrose than the sucrose mixed with 300 mM NaCl (Figure 3A). In contrast, the Ir25a, Ir60b, and Ir76b mutants consumed approximately two-fold less of the sucrose plus salt (Figure 3A). Consequently, they ingested similar amounts of the two food options (Figure 3B; ingestion index). Thus, while the Ir60b mutant and control flies spend similar amounts of time in contact with high salt-containing food when it is the only option (Joseph et al., 2017), the mutant consumes considerably less of the high salt food when presented with a sucrose option without salt.”.
