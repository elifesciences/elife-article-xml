<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Ikaros is a transcriptional factor required for conventional T cell development, differentiation, and anergy. While the related factors Helios and Eos have defined roles in regulatory T cells (Treg), a role for Ikaros has not been established. To determine the function of Ikaros in the Treg lineage, we generated mice with Treg-specific deletion of the Ikaros gene (<italic>Ikzf1</italic>). We find that Ikaros cooperates with Foxp3 to establish a major portion of the Treg epigenome and transcriptome. Ikaros-deficient Treg exhibit Th1-like gene expression with abnormal expression of IL-2, IFNg, TNFa, and factors involved in Wnt and Notch signaling. While <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-Treg-cko mice do not develop spontaneous autoimmunity, Ikaros-deficient Treg are unable to control conventional T cell-mediated immune pathology in response to TCR and inflammatory stimuli in models of IBD and organ transplantation. These studies establish Ikaros as a core factor required in Treg for tolerance and the control of inflammatory immune responses.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The zinc finger DNA binding protein Ikaros is expressed in hematopoietic precursors, where it regulates genes involved in antigen receptor recombination, hemoglobin synthesis, and genome stability by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Germline deletion of <italic>Ikzf1</italic> in mice results in arrested erythroid and lymphoid development, leading to immunodeficiency and immature B and T cell leukemia. In conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, Ikaros functions as a transcriptional repressor of inflammatory cytokine genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Conventional CD4+ T cells with loss of Ikaros function are unable to differentiate into peripherally-induced regulatory T cells (iTreg)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, and are resistant to suppression by regulatory T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, the role of Ikaros in thymic Treg development and function has not been addressed.</p>
<p>The Ikaros family members Helios and Eos have each been deleted or knocked down in human or mouse regulatory T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Loss of Eos function in Treg is associated with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL-2 and IFNg, and an inability to control pathogenic conventional T helper cell responses in an IBD model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, although a separate study found that Eos-deficient Treg had normal function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Helios also contributes to the control of Treg activation and cytokine production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, but this may be secondary to its role in promoting stable expression of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we conduct a genome-scale multi-omic analysis of open chromatin, active histone marks, Ikaros occupancy, Foxp3 occupancy, and gene expression in wild-type and <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-deficient regulatory T cells. We find that Ikaros plays a crucial role in establishing the normal landscape of enhancer activity, Foxp3 binding, and gene expression in Treg that cannot be filled by other Ikaros family members. Loss of Ikaros function in Treg results in uncontrolled conventional T cell inflammatory responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To address the role of Ikaros in the Treg lineage, we crossed mice with a floxed <italic>Ikzf1</italic> allele<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> with mice carrying a Foxp3-YFP-Cre reporter/driver. This strain generates an <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-null allele and the Cre neither generates a Foxp3 fusion protein nor affects Foxp3 function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Male <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-fl-Foxp3-YFP-Cre mice (B6 background) do not develop overt autoimmune pathology under specific pathogen-free housing conditions over an 8 week timeframe, and basic aspects of T cell and Treg thymic development are unaltered (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref></bold>). CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ peripheral Treg in these mice exhibit a nearly complete loss of Ikaros protein (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a,b</xref></bold>) and full DNA demethylation at the <italic>Foxp3</italic> CNS2-TSDR (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref></bold>), indicating that they are of thymic origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The expression of Ikaros in conventional CD4+ T cells from <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-fl-Foxp3-YFP-Cre mice is indistinguishable from that of control Foxp3-YFP-Cre mice (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>). <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-fl-Foxp3-YFP-Cre mice exhibit a statistically significant increase in the total, effector, and follicular Treg pools, with a concomitant decrease in the naive Treg pool in the spleen and lymph nodes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref></bold>). <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-deficient Treg express normal levels of Foxp3, GITR, and PD1 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c,d</xref></bold>), and higher levels of the high-affinity IL-2 receptor CD25 and the costimulatory receptor ICOS (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref></bold>). Ikaros-deficient Treg maintained Eos, Aiolos and Helios protein expression, exhibiting a mild increase in the expression of Eos and Aiolos particularly in the lymph nodes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Ikaros contributes significantly to the Treg gene expression program</title>
<p>Ikaros is a transcription factor, so to assess how loss of Ikaros function impacts the Treg gene expression program, we compared the transcriptomes of wild-type and Ikaros-deficient Treg isolated directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> from 6-8 week old aged-matched mice (N=3). A total of 661 genes were differentially expressed in <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg, 149 of which greater than 2-fold (FDR&lt;0.05, <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>). Some of these genes were downregulated compared to wild-type Treg (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref></bold>, clusters 1, 4 and 5), but 80% were upregulated (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref></bold>, clusters 7 and 8), indicating that Ikaros functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor in Treg. Loss of Ikaros results in up-regulation of at least 12 factors that negatively regulate Treg function, <italic>e.g</italic>., multiple genes involved in Wnt signaling (<italic>Wisp1, Ctnnd1, Ctnna1</italic>), <italic>Ox40, Tlr2, Lag3, Tnf,</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). Increased <italic>Ifng</italic> expression correlated with decreased DNA methylation at the <italic>Ifng</italic> locus compared to wild-type Treg (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1d</xref></bold>). <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg also exhibited down-regulation of at least 10 factors that are required for full Treg function, <italic>e.g</italic>., the activin receptor <italic>Acvr1b, Nr4a1/Nur77, Tet1</italic>, and perforin (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). <italic>Bcl6</italic>, which is required for follicular Treg function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, is also down-regulated in Ikaros-deficient Treg. However, <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg up-regulated at least 24 factors known to promote Treg function (<bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>), suggesting that the loss-of-function program may be counteracted by a gain-of-function program in the absence of inflammation.</p>

<p>To simulate antigen encounter by Treg during an immune response, we stimulated wild-type and Ikaros-deficient Treg through the TCR and CD28 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Previous studies established a role for Ikaros in restricting IL-2 and IFNg production by conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. We find that Ikaros plays a similar role in Treg, as unlike wild-type Treg, <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg are capable of secreting IL-2 and IFNg protein upon stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold>). Treg from mice expressing a dominant-negative form of Ikaros likewise ectopically express IL-2, IFNg, and TNFa at the protein level upon stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref></bold>). Consistent with their increased expression of IL-2 and IL-2R, Ikaros-deficient Treg exhibit enhanced IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref></bold>) and increased proliferative capacity (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref></bold>) compared to wild-type Treg.</p>

<p>At genome scale, stimulation through the TCR and CD28 led to differential expression of 895 genes (FDR&lt;0.05, <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>), 533 down-regulated (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref></bold>, clusters 2, 3 and 5) and 362 up-regulated in <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg compared to wild-type Treg (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref></bold>, clusters 6, 7 and 8). Consistent with its role in antigen receptor selection during lymphocyte development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, gene ontology analysis (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>) of genes down-regulated in Ikaros-deficient Treg shows enrichment for immune cell development and TCR/VDJ recombination and diversification (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref></bold>). Genes upregulated in Ikaros-deficient Treg are enriched for networks involved in interferon and cytokine production and responses (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref></bold>). The set of upregulated genes includes at least 20 factors known to promote Treg function like <italic>Foxp3, Il2ra, Icos, Ezh2,</italic> and <italic>Gpr83</italic> (<bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). However, loss of Ikaros results in up-regulation of at least 11 factors that negatively regulate Treg function like <italic>Irf1, Il12rb2</italic> (IL-12 receptor), <italic>Il3</italic>, and several genes in the Notch and Wnt pathways like <italic>Notch2, Maml3, Rbpj, Wisp,</italic> and <italic>Ctnnd1</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref></bold>), and down-regulation of at least 14 factors that are required for full Treg function like <italic>Tcf7, Satb1, Foxp1, Id3, Smad3, Il27ra, Tlr7</italic>, and follicular Treg (Tfreg) genes like <italic>Bcl6, Cxcr5,</italic> and <italic>S1pr1</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The Wnt pathway is normally repressed in Treg, and ectopic Wnt signaling in Treg has been associated with ectopic IFNg production and reduced suppressive function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We show that the Wnt signaling factor B-catenin is elevated in <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref></bold>), and that ectopic IFNg production by Ikaros-deficient Treg is Wnt-dependent, while IFNg production by conventional CD4+ T cells does not depend on Wnt (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b,c</xref></bold>). Together, these transcriptomic analyses indicate that Ikaros normally regulates a large proportion of the core Treg program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref></bold>, genes in red), and is required to restrain Wnt, Notch, and inflammatory cytokine gene expression in the Treg lineage.</p>

<title>Ikaros is required for establishing the Treg open chromatin and enhancer landscape</title>

<p>To explore how Ikaros regulates the Treg enhancer landscape, we measured histone acetylation at nucleosomes flanking open chromatin regions in wild-type and <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg (N=3, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2f,g</xref></bold>). Out of approximately 21,000 H3K27ac peaks called in both cell populations, 40% were affected by loss of Ikaros function (<bold>Supplementary Table 5</bold>), with 323 regions showing a &gt;2-fold reduction acetylation and 1206 regions exhibiting a &gt;2-fold increase in H3K27ac (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref></bold>). Differential analysis also showed that Ikaros controls histone acetylation at ∼25% of Treg open chromatin regions (OCR, 9937 out of ∼40,000, FDR &lt;0.05), with the vast majority (78%, 7788) showing increased acetylation upon loss of Ikaros function (<bold>Supplementary Table 5</bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2h</xref></bold>). At genome scale, enrichment of the H3K27ac mark correlates with regional accessibility (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2i</xref></bold>), and strength of the enhancer signature at a given element correlates with the level of nearby gene expression (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2j</xref></bold>). Dense collections of multiple enhancers that tend to drive expression of genes involved in cell identity are called ‘super-enhancers’. We defined 1,700 Treg super-enhancers based on H3K27ac density (<bold>Supplementary Table 6</bold>), 20% of which (324) are regulated by Ikaros (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2k</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Ikaros ChIP-seq analysis identified 7642 Ikaros binding sites in WT Tconv, 83% of which (6361) are located in open chromatin, and 7061 Ikaros binding sites in WT Treg, 76% of which (5477) are located in open chromatin (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Table 7</bold>). Of all accessible Ikaros binding sites detected, 39% (3567) were Tconv-specific, 31% (2794) were shared between Tconv and Treg, and 29% (2683) were only detected in Treg (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref></bold>). The Ikaros ChIP-seq signal is enriched at accessible Ikaros motifs in the Treg and Tconv genome (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref></bold>), and the set of genes with accessible Ikaros binding motifs showed increased expression in Ikaros-deficient compared to wild-type Treg (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref></bold>). Motif analysis (<bold>Supplementary Table 8</bold>) at regions that exhibit increased accessibility in <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg shows enrichment of the Ikaros GGGAA core binding sequence that is shared with immune trans-activators like NFkB, NFAT, Notch, and Stat1/4, and these regions are also enriched for AP-1 (Fos/Jun) and T-bet (Tbx21) motifs (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5g</xref></bold> inset). This suggests that Ikaros can directly repress inflammatory gene expression in Treg by competing with NFkB, NFAT, Notch, and Stats for binding to enhancers and recruiting epigenetic factors that silence these elements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Loci under direct repressive control of Ikaros in Treg include <italic>Bcl6</italic>, <italic>Notch2, Irf4,</italic> and <italic>Ifng</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5h</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3a-c</xref></bold>). However, the majority of genomic regions exhibiting increased accessibility in <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg are not bound by Ikaros in wild-type cells (873 of 918, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3d</xref></bold>), suggesting that indirect gene regulation due to observed alterations in the expression of other transcription factors is another mechanism by which Ikaros establishes the Treg gene expression program.</p>

<title>Foxp3 cooperates with Ikaros for DNA binding across the Treg genome</title>
<p>Regions that exhibit reduced accessibility in <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko compared to wild-type Treg are enriched for the binding motif for Ikaros and the motif for TCF1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5g</xref></bold>), a factor that cooperates with Foxp3 to enforce Treg function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and is down-regulated in <italic>Ikzf1</italic> cko Treg (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref></bold>).

<p>Consistent with these observations, we find that Ikaros and Foxp3 exist in a complex in the nuclei of cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6e</xref></bold>), confirming prior proteomic data suggesting a physical interaction between Foxp3 and Ikaros in transfected cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The studies reported here establish a crucial role for Ikaros in regulatory T cells that cannot be replaced by the Ikaros family members Helios, Eos and Aiolos. While Ikaros is required for induction of Foxp3 by TGF-B in conventional T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, Ikaros-deficient Treg exhibited normal Foxp3 expression. Instead, loss of Ikaros activity results in significant dysregulation of the Treg gene expression program, including pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes normally not expressed by Treg (<italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>Ifng, Tnf, Il3, Il12rb, Tlr2</italic>), and genes required for normal Treg function (<italic>e.g</italic>., <italic>Tcf7, Lef1, Satb1, Nr4a1</italic>). Many of these dysregulated genes are Foxp3 targets, and we show that Foxp3 cooperates with Ikaros to occupy the majority of Foxp3 binding sites in Treg.</p>
<p>Mice with Treg lineage-specific loss of Ikaros occupancy showed an accumulation of activated regulatory and helper T cells in the secondary lymphoid tissues, but no evidence for increased T cell infiltration into organs or frank autoimmunity. This might be explained by the fact that Treg isolated directly <italic>ex vivo</italic> showed elevated expression of many genes that promote Treg function, potentially balancing the dysregulated program predicted to have deleterious effects on Treg homeostasis and function. However, upon TCR stimulation, <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-deficient Treg induce a set of inflammatory Th1, Notch, and Wnt pathway genes normally repressed in Treg, and fail to control <italic>in vivo</italic> cellular and humoral immune responses mediated by conventional T cells. Importantly, our results show that the loss of suppressive function <italic>in vivo</italic> is not due to failure of Treg to home to sites of tissue inflammation. The lack of spontaneous inflammation or autoimmunity in <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-fl-Foxp3-Cre mice is similar to mice with Treg-specific deletion of <italic>Prdm1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, <italic>Icos</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, <italic>Il10</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and <italic>Mef2d</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Mice lacking <italic>Il10</italic> in Treg exhibit mild colitis, but no autoimmunity, while mice with deletion of <italic>Prdm1</italic> in Treg show signs of autoimmunity only in aged mice. Moreover, deletion of <italic>Mef2d, Blimp1, Icos,</italic> or <italic>Il10</italic> in Tregs does not impact their suppressive activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, but impairs their function <italic>in vivo</italic> in the context of inflammation.</p>
<p>Although the literature is not in complete agreement, Eos and Helios are considered to be necessary for Treg function through their contribution to the Treg gene expression program. Eos, like Ikaros, is required to repress inflammatory gene expression by Treg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and Eos can cooperate with Foxp3 to strengthen a core Treg gene expression program when ectopically co-expressed in conventional T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Loss of Helios function in Treg has the primary effect of destabilizing <italic>Foxp3</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and also contributes to core Treg gene expression when ectopically co-expressed with Foxp3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Despite these functions, neither Eos, Helios, nor Aiolos were able to compensate for the loss of Ikaros, despite the fact that <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-deficient Treg express all these proteins at comparable or higher levels as compared to wild-type Treg. The availability of Helios ChIP-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and Helios-dependent gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> data allowed us to compare Ikaros and Helios genome occupancy and gene regulatory programs (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref></bold>). Of the 1838 Helios binding sites and 5477 Ikaros binding sites detected in Treg open chromatin, 64 are shared, representing only ∼3.5% of Helios binding sites and ∼1% of Ikaros binding sites. Similarly, we found a statistically significant overlap between the Ikaros-dependent set of 660 genes and the Helios-dependent set of 147 genes, but this consisted of only 9 genes (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref></bold>). For five of these genes Ikaros and Helios have the same effect on expression, while Ikaros and Helios have the opposite effect on expression of the other four genes. This level of discordance at the level of both genome occupancy and gene regulation likely explains whey Helios, for example, cannot compensate for the loss of Ikaros in Treg.</p>

<p>Coding mutations in <italic>IKZF1</italic> in humans is a cause of common variable immune deficiency (CVID) and autoimmunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. To date, studies have focused on the impact of these mutations on T and B lymphocyte function, and our results here suggest Treg defects could also contribute to the immune dysregulation observed in these patients. In addition, common genetic polymorphism at the <italic>IKZF1</italic> locus have been associated with SLE susceptibility by GWAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, and one mechanism for this is an SLE-associated distal regulatory element required for normal expression of Ikaros in human T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Given the important roles for Ikaros in conventional B and T cell function, and its role newly defined here in regulatory T cell function, Ikaros is a relevant target for novel therapies for autoimmunity, organ transplant rejection, and cancer.</p>

<title>ChIP-seq library generation and analysis</title>
<p>For transcription factor and H3K27ac ChIP-seq analysis, we used <italic>in vivo</italic> expanded Tregs generated in mice using IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes. Anti-mouse IL-2 antibody (BE0043) was purchased from Bioxcell and recombinant mouse IL-2 (carrier free, cat # 575408 from Biolegend). IL-2/anti-IL-2 complexes were prepared by mixing both reagents, incubating at 37C for 30 minutes, and diluted with 1X PBS. Foxp3-YFP-Cre and <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-fl-Foxp3-YFP-Cre mice (5-6 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 200 ul of complex containing 2 ug IL-2 and 10 ug anti-IL-2. Each mouse received injection daily for 3 days and treatment-free for another 3 days before harvesting lymph nodes and spleens. For Ikaros ChIP-seq, total CD4+ T cells were negatively enriched using Miltenyi CD4 microbeads and then sorted for YFP+ Tregs by a FACSJaz sorter. Tregs purified through Miltenyi Treg purification kit were used for Foxp3, Ikaros, and H3K27ac-ChIP-seq. Naïve CD4+ T cells from Foxp3-YFP-Cre mice were also purified for Ikaros and H3K27ac ChIP-seq using a mouse CD4+ naïve purification kit purchased from Mitenyi Biotech. For all ChIP-seq experiments, 3 biological replicates of cells isolated from 3 individual mice were used. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed using ChIP-IT high-sensitivity kits (cat #53040, Active Motif) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5×10<sup>6</sup> purified cells were fixed in medium for 15 minutes at room temperature using complete cell fixative solution prepared using formaldehyde and cell fixative solution from the kit. The reaction was stopped by adding 1/20 media volume of stop solution, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and a cell pellet was stored at -80C for later use or cells were lysed in chromatin preparation buffer cells as described in the protocol. The cell pellet was resuspended in ChIP buffer and chromatin was sonicated by a QSonica Q800R sonicator with settings: amplitude 20%, pulse for 30 seconds on, 30 second off, for a total of 30 cycles. For input DNA preparation, 25 ul of the sonicated sample was removed and DNA was isolated as suggested in the protocol. An agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis was performed for DNA isolated from the input fraction to determine the sonication efficiency. ChIP-validated anti-mouse Ikaros antibody (cat #39355) and H3K27Ac antibody (cat #39133) were purchased from Active Motif. For Foxp3 ChIP-seq, eBioscience anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (cat#14-5773-82) was purchased from ThermoFisher Scientific. The volume of the sheared chromatin was adjusted to 200 ul using ChIP buffer, and to which was added 5 ul of Protease inhibitor, and a mix containing ChIP antibody (4 ug) and 5 ul of blocker, mixed and pre-incubated at room temperature for a minute. Final volume of the ChIP reaction was 240 ul, which was incubated at 4C overnight on a rotator. Antibody precipitated chromatin immune complexes were collected using washed protein G agarose beads and immune complexes were washed 5X in ChIP filtration columns using wash buffer, and eluted the DNA with elution buffer. The eluted DNA was reverse cross linked and further purified through DNA purification columns. ChIP’d DNA was eluted from the column using 30 ul of DNA purification elution buffer. All ChIP-seq and input DNA libraries were made using ThruPLEX DNA-Seq kit (cat #R400674, Takara Bio, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the fragmented DNA obtained from ChIP reaction or input DNA was end repaired to generate blunt ends, to which stem-loop adaptors with blocked 5’ ends are ligated. Libraries were amplified through high fidelity amplification buffer mix and Takara dual indexing primers (cat# R400407). Finally, the amplified dual indexed libraries were purified using AMpure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Cat # A63880) at 1:1 ratio. The purified DNA was recovered from the beads using 20 ul of TE buffer. The library quality was checked on a bioanalyzer using high sensitivity DNA Chip. Library DNA concentration was determined using Qubit. Dual-indexed ChIP-seq libraries were pooled and sequenced on a the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Reads were aligned to mm9 using bowtie2 and duplicated reads were marked using Picard with parameters VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=LENIENT and ASSUME_SORTED=true and removed samtools. Library quality was accessed using samtools flagstat to assess library complexity and strand cross correlation to assess<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Peaks were called using MACS2 with the parameters -g mm9 –nomodel –p 0.01 –keep-dup_all with the – extsize estimated fragment size from the strand cross correlation for each replicate of H3K27ac, Ikaros, or Foxp3 with matching input sample. Reads were subsequently filtered by the ENCODE mm9 blacklist regions. Within condition peaks were filtered to ones found in at least two replicates. Binary comparison between different ChIP peaks and ATAC-seq was performed using the R package GenomicRanges (1.46.1) findOverlaps function. For differential comparisons of H3K27ac ChIP signal, reads were normalized against background (10K bins) using csaw (v1.28, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/csaw.html">http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/csaw.html</ext-link>). Peaks with a cpm value less than 3.0 were removed from further differential analysis. Differential analysis was performed using glmQLFit approach in edgeR (v3.36.0) with the normalization scaling factors calculated from csaw. FDR &lt; 0.05 was used as the cutoff for statistical significance. Signal reproducibility between replicate samples was accessed using pairwise pearson correlation tests and principal component analysis. Significant OCR overlapping with H3K27ac peaks were annotated as enhancers. Correlations between enhancer accessibility, H3K27ac ChIP signal, and expression of nearest gene were computed using pearson correlation coefficient implemented in the R function cor.test. Super-enhancers were called using the rank ordering of super-enhancer (ROSE) algorithm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Briefly OCR called by ATAC-seq were used as input regions and clustered by genomic coordinates with a 12.5kb stitching window. Merged replicates of WT and Ikzf1-cko H3K27ac signal and input were used as measure of enhancer activity. The signal is represented as input subtracted reads per million per basepair and then are ranked-ordered. The position in the ranked list where the change in signal (slope when x-axis is the super-enhancer rank and y-axis is signal) equals 1 is used to define super-enhancers by the rapid increase in enhancer activity. Super-enhancers were defined independently for WT and Ikzf1-cko H3K27ac data. ChIP peaks were annotated to their nearest gene based on linear genomic distance.</p>

Small pieces of tissue were cut from the lower part of colon and were fixed in formal fixative for histopathological analysis. Single cell suspension was made from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes from individual mice, lymphocyte cell density was estimated using a hemocytometer. Lymphocytes were stained for CD4, CD8, CD25, CD44 and Foxp3 and analyzed by flow cytometry. Absolute T cell count was estimated using hemocytometer count and cell frequency derived from the flow cytometry analysis. Variation in weight curve between groups were statistically analyzed by ANOVA (GraphPad Prism).</p>

<title>Cardiac transplantation</title>
<p>Fully MHC-mismatched BALB/c hearts (H-2d) were transplanted heterotopically into Foxp3-YFP-Cre and <italic>Ikzf1</italic>-fl-Foxp3-YFP-Cre mice by anastomosis of the donor ascending aorta and pulmonary artery to the recipient infrarenal aorta and pulmonary artery. On days 0, 2 and 4 of posttransplant, the transplant recipient mice were given i.p injection of CTLA4 Ig fusion protein (200 ug) and CD154 (200 ug). A separate batch of cardiac recipient mice were administered donor specific transfusion (DST) with Balb/c splenocytes (5 million cells/recipient) and a single dose of MR1 (250 ug). Cardiac graft survival was determined by abdominal palpation, and cessation of cardiac contraction was considered as rejection of the graft. Grafts were monitored for a 100 days, and graft survival data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meir/log-rank methods. For histopathological analysis, a separate batch of mice consisting of 3 mice per group were subjected to same transplant procedure for a short duration and then these recipient mice were sacrificed, grafts were removed before rejection, fixed in 1X formal solution, and analyzed by standard histopathological methods.</p>

<title>Cardiac histopathology and intra-graft gene expression analysis</title>
<p>For histopathologic analysis of cardiac graft and colon from IBD experiments, portions of tissues were fixed in Shandon formal-Fixx solution (1X), ThermoScientific. Tissues were processed and embedded in paraffin. Histologic sections were cut at 4um thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain and or with alcian blue. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for CD4 and Foxp3 by the CHOP Pathology cores. Blinded histopathological evaluations were performed by a histopathologist. For intragraft gene expression analysis and histopathological analysis, a separate batch of mice consisting of 3 mice per group were subjected to same transplant procedure with a duration of 19 days for CTLA4Ig and MRI treated mice and a duration of 14 days for MRI and DST treated mice, based on the weakness of transplant heart palpitation. These transplant recipient mice were sacrificed, graft was removed, a portion of the cardiac graft was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and a second portion of the graft tissue was fixed in 1X formal solution and analyzed by standard histopathological methods. Total RNA was extracted from the homogenized graft tissue using Trizol. One microgram of RNA was treated with DNase to avoid DNA contamination. It was then reverse transcribed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (cat #170-8891) purchased from Bio-Rad. Gene expression analysis for the cardiac graft was performed by qRT PCR using Fast SYBR Green mastermix on a Applied Biosystems step one plus real time PCR system. Following primer pairs were used for the qRT PCR amplification: Foxp3-Exp-F; AAAAGGAGAAGCTGGGAGCTATG, Foxp3-Exp-R; GTGGCTACGATGCAGCAAGAG, IFNg-Exp-F; TTGCCAAGTTTGAGGTCAACAA, IFNg-Exp-R; GCTGGATTCCGGCAACAG, TNF-a-F; CTGTAGCCCACGTCGTAGC, TNF-a-R; TTGAGATCCATGCCGTTG, IL-6-F; TGTTCTCTGGGAAATCGTGGA, IL-6-R ; CTGCAAGTGCATCATCGTTGT, CXCR3-F; TACCTTGAGGTTAGTGAACGTCA, CXCR3-R; CGCTCTCGTTTTCCCCATAATC, CXCL-10-F; TGCCGTCATTTTCTGCCTCA, CXCL-10-R; GGACCGTCCTTGCGAGAG, Bcl-6-F; GTGTCCCCCAGTTTGTGTCA, Bcl-6-R; TGGAGCATTCCGAGCAGAAG, DGKA-F; CAAACAGGGCCTGAGCTGTA, DGKA-R; CGAGACTTGGCATAGGTGCT, CD27-F; GGATGTGTGAGCCAGGTACA, CD27-R; GGGTGTGGTAGTCTGGAGAG, m18S RNA-F; TTCGAACGTCTGCCCTATCAA, m18S RNA-R; ACCCGTGGTCACCATGGTA.</p>

<p>This comprehensive study provides <bold>valuable</bold> information on the cooperation of Ikaros with Foxp3 to establish and regulate a major portion of the epigenome and transcriptome of T-regulatory cells. However, the characterization is <bold>incomplete</bold> in that incontrovertible evidence that these are intrinsic features regulating biological function and not outcomes of the inflammatory micro-environment of the genetically manipulated mice is missing.</p>

<p>This study investigates the role of Ikaros, a zinc finger family transcription factor related to Helios and Eos, in T-regulatory (Treg) cell functionality in mice. Through genome-wide association studies and chromatin accessibility studies, the authors find that Ikaros shares similar binding sites to Foxp3. Ikaros cooperates with Foxp3 to establish a major portion of the Treg epigenome and transcriptome. Ikaros-deficient Treg exhibits Th1-like gene expression with abnormal expression of IL-2, IFNg, TNFa, and factors involved in Wnt and Notch signalling. Further, two models of inflammatory/ autoimmune diseases - Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and organ transplantation - are employed to examine the functional role of Ikaros in Treg-mediated immune suppression. The authors provide a detailed analysis of the epigenome and transcriptome of Ikaros-deficient Treg cells.</p>
<p>These studies establish Ikaros as a factor required in Treg for tolerance and the control of inflammatory immune responses. The data are of high quality. Overall, the study is well organized, and reports new data consolidating mechanistic aspects of Foxp3 mediated gene expression program in Treg cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors have performed biochemical studies focusing on mechanistic aspects of molecular functions of the Foxp3-mediated gene expression program and complemented these with functional experiments using two models of autoimmune diseases, thereby strengthening the study. The studies are comprehensive at both the cellular and molecular levels. The manuscript is well organized and presents a plethora of data regarding the transcriptomic landscape of these cells.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>
The authors claim that the mice have no pathologic signs of autoimmune disease even at a relatively old age, yet mice have an increased number of activated CD4+ T cells and T-follicular helper cells (even at the age of 6 weeks) as well as reduced naïve T-cells. Thus, immune homeostasis is perturbed in these mice even at a young age and the effect of inflammatory microenvironments on cellular functions cannot be ruled out. Further, clear conclusions from the genome-wide studies are lacking.</p>
