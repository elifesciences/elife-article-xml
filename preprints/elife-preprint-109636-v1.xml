<abstract>
<p>Being a fluent language user involves recognizing words as they unfold in time. How does this skill develop over the course of early childhood? And how does facility in word recognition relate to the growth of vocabulary knowledge? We address these questions using data from Peekbank, an open database of experiments measuring children’s eye movements during early word recognition. Combining 24 datasets from almost 2,000 children ages 1–6 years, we show that word recognition becomes faster, more accurate, and less variable across development, consistent with a process of skill learning. Factor analysis reveals covariation of word recognition speed and accuracy with children’s vocabulary size in cross-sectional analysis. Further, across a range of longitudinal models, speed, accuracy, and vocabulary show coupled growth such that children with faster word recognition tend to show faster vocabulary growth. Together, these findings support the view that word recognition is a skill that develops gradually across early childhood and that this skill plays a role in supporting early language learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children acquiring a language are learning a body of knowledge - a set of words and the ways they are combined - but they are also learning to deploy this knowledge in the myriad complex, noisy, and fast-moving environments in which language is used. As children enter their second year, language explodes onto the scene; both vocabulary and grammatical abilities grow rapidly and in tandem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). This growth in knowledge is also accompanied by changes in language processing efficiency: children become quicker and more accurate in recognizing words and matching them with their referents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet unlike language production, which is manifest via overt behavior, evidence for word recognition is often more subtle. Very young children with incomplete knowledge may not be able to point to the correct referent of a word, but they may still have some representation of word meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Eye tracking has thus emerged as a key method that allows the measurement of language comprehension with high temporal resolution: both adults and children reliably fixate the referent of a word soon after it is used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The relative timecourse of fixation then can provide an index of an individual comprehender’s ability or be used to measure the difference between two stimulus conditions.</p>
<p>The version of this method that is used with children goes by many names, including the “intermodal preferential looking” paradigm and the “looking while listening” paradigm (LWL, the name we adopt here) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In LWL experiments, children are typically shown two images displayed side by side and asked to find one of them. For example, a ball and a book might be shown, and the child might hear “Look at the ball! Can you find it?”. Accuracy is then computed as the proportion of time their eyes fixate the correct image within a fixed window after the onset of the noun (“ball” in this case). Reaction time is computed only on trials in which the child is fixating the distractor image (the book) at word onset; in these cases, the average time it takes for the child to shift fixation from the distractor to the target image is used as an index of processing speed. Early work using this method showed that both children’s speed and accuracy increase rapidly across the second year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Related methods have provided a window into how children process phonological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), morphological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), lexical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), syntactic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and semantic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) information.</p>
<p>Word recognition ability, as measured by LWL, is hypothesized to play a key role in language learning. Measurements of children’s language input at home are consistently associated with their vocabulary size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The mechanism posited to drive this association is that each word that a child experiences is an opportunity to learn. But each word must first be recognized during the short window of time when it is present in the child’s memory. Consider a child hearing the utterance “Can you put the ball in the crate?” The faster and more accurately the child can recognize the word “ball”, the better they can use this evidence to help infer the speaker’s intended meaning, allowing possible inferences about the meaning of the less familiar word, “crate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Consistent with this idea, one important study found that children’s word recognition speed mediated the longitudinal relationship between home language input and vocabulary growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>Word recognition speed has also been used as an index of individual differences in early childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Over and above measures of vocabulary size, word recognition speed at 18 months predicts children’s standardized test scores years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Further, faster processing at 18 months is predictive of whether “late talkers” catch up to their peers or could benefit from further intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Critically, these assessments use words that children at the target age are reported to understand and produce - they are not indices of vocabulary size but rather of how quickly and accurately the child can recognize a familiar spoken word and use it to guide their visual attention to a referent.</p>
<p>Yet given the logistical hurdles involved in sampling from this population, individual experiments measuring processing speed with young children typically recruit relatively small samples in a restricted range of ages. These samples provide neither the breadth of ages nor the number of participants needed to estimate how word recognition changes developmentally and how it connects with other aspects of early language development (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) for examples of these analyses in school-aged children). To overcome these limitations, we created Peekbank, an open database of LWL data from young children, stored in a harmonized format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). This dataset unifies and carefully curates a large amount of eye-tracking data from studies with infants and toddlers, representing cumulatively over 12 million individual samples of children’s eye movements during real-time language processing. The Peekbank dataset allows us to gain an unprecedented view of the development of word recognition across a large sample of children.</p>
<p>We investigate two specific hypotheses here. First, one influential theory posits that language learning is a process of skill learning, in which the child is learning the skill of fluent conversation with other language users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In this theory, the major information processing challenge of language learning is that incoming language is ephemeral and must be processed quickly before it is lost (the “now-or-never bottleneck”). On this kind of account, we should expect to see the signatures of expertise and skill learning in word recognition, which is one of the primary skills involved in processing incoming language in real time. Accuracy should change linearly with the logarithm of age, reflecting gradual asymptotic convergence to mature levels of accuracy. In addition, we might observe what is known as the “power law of practice,” the regularity found in many cases of skill learning that the logarithm of reaction time decreases with the logarithm of experience across participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Indeed, this pattern is predicted by an influential associative process model of early word learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). In our case, we expect that chronological age is a proxy for experience and so the logarithm of reaction time should decrease linearly with the logarithm of age. Finally, trial-to-trial variability in both speed and accuracy should decrease with increasing expertise, as is found in studies of motor expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, previous findings have provided limited and sometimes conflicting evidence on the concurrent and predictive relations between word recognition and language learning. Initial reports showed strong predictive relationships between both speed and accuracy and later vocabulary growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), with replications in infants born preterm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) and late talkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Subsequent studies have primarily focused on speed of processing and found more mixed results, with reaction time measures found to be only inconsistently predictive of later vocabulary outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). A larger dataset should allow us to make a more definitive test of the presence of these relationships. Further, by examining the relationship between speed, accuracy, and vocabulary, it should be possible to assess the extent to which processing speed specifically plays a role in vocabulary growth.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We retrieved data from Peekbank, focusing on data from English-speaking children ages 1–6 years and on simple word recognition trials in which children were shown two pictures of concrete objects and heard a label for an object (typically embedded in a simple carrier phrase such as “Look at the … “). While other experimental manipulations and languages are included in the database, we narrowed our sample to English-speaking children because they are well-represented across our age range and excluded manipulations which aimed to capture phenomena other than simple concrete noun reference (e.g., adjective comprehension or novel word learning). These criteria yielded 24 datasets, including 1963 children and 3553 administrations of the LWL procedure (some datasets were longitudinal or involved multiple closely-spaced testing sessions).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> shows the characteristics of individual datasets (see also <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-1">S1</xref> Dataset Description in the Supplementary Information). The size of the combined dataset, the unified data processing pipeline, and the fact that individual studies used very similar implementations of the LWL experimental paradigm all allowed us to make a more detailed study of the development of word recognition than has previously been possible. While our analyses are exploratory in nature, they are guided by the two hypotheses outlined above: the presence of 1) signatures of skill learning in word recognition, and 2) linkages between word recognition and vocabulary.</p>

<title>Speed and accuracy of word recognition increase</title>
<p>We began by examining developmental changes in children’s word recognition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> depicts the average timecourse at different ages across all datasets (not controlling for any variation in items and procedures across age groups). Intuitively, these timecourses show gradual increases in accuracy (higher overall proportion target looking) and speed (faster looking to the target after hearing a label) as age increases. To characterize age gradients in speed and accuracy across children, we computed both RTs (reaction times) and accuracies (proportion looking at the target image) following standard practices in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Reaction times were computed only on trials for which the child was fixating the distractor at the point of disambiguation (label onset), and were defined as the time from label onset to the first fixation on the target image (see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-2">S2</xref> Reaction Times, including further details on how reaction times were computed in <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-2-1">S2.1</xref> and discussion of issues surrounding distinguishing “correct” vs. “incorrect” trials when computing looking-based reaction times in <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-2-2">S2.2</xref>).</p>

<p>The x-axis shows time (in ms) from the onset of the target label (vertical solid line). Colored lines show the average increase in proportion target looking post label onset at each age bin (in months). Age bins are larger for older children due to decreased data density. The dashed horizontal line represents chance looking. Error bands represent standard errors of the mean. Grey backgrounds highlight the short and long time windows used in subsequent analyses.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="dtv2fv2_fig1.tif" mime-subtype="tif" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Because there is no consensus about the length of time windows for the computation of accuracy, we considered both a shorter window (from 200 – 2000 ms after noun onset) and a longer window (from 200 – 4000 ms). For each window, we averaged all fixations within the window to compute a continuous proportion of target looking between 0 (no fixation on the target during the window) and 1 (total fixation on the target during the window) on every trial. In this initial analysis, we treat observations of RT and target looking as direct measures of the constructs speed and accuracy (see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-4">S4</xref> Test-Retest Reliability); in subsequent analyses we estimate latent variables representing these constructs.</p>
<p>Our first question was about the functional form of the relationships between age, speed, and accuracy (see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-5">S5</xref> Pairwise Correlations of Main Measures for raw pairwise correlations between variables). We began by fitting linear mixed-effects models predicting speed and accuracy on each trial across the full dataset with random slopes of child age nested within study (modeling item and procedural variation across studies) and random intercepts by participant (see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-8">S8</xref> Mixed-effects model specifications for further details on these specifications). We compared models that included both long and short accuracy windows, as well as logarithmic and linear effects of age, and logarithmic and linear transformations of RT (see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-3">S3</xref> Checks on Data Distributional Assumptions for further analyses and discussion of these modeling choices). The best fitting model of accuracy predicted long window accuracy as a function of the logarithm of age; the best fitting model of speed predicted log RT as a function of log age as well (see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-6">S6</xref> Functional Form Model Comparison and S7 Power Law Fits). Because long window accuracies were more correlated with other variables and showed clearer age gradients, we focus on these in our analyses.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows these age gradients. Log RT decreased significantly with age, reflecting increasing speed (<inline-formula id="ID1">

<title>Speed and accuracy relate to vocabulary size</title>
<p>We were next interested in whether the various aspects of word recognition − including speed, accuracy, and the variability of each of these − were related to other aspects of early language ability. Of the studies in our database, 15 gathered parent reports about children’s early vocabulary using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI), a popular survey instrument that provides a reliable and valid estimate of children’s early vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Different forms of the CDI can be used to measure either receptive and expressive vocabulary (for children up to 18 months) or expressive vocabulary only (for children 16 − 30 months).</p>
<p>We fit a series of factor analytic models to explore the dimensionality of the parent report and child LWL data. Our goal in these analyses was to understand the underlying relatedness of the various measures of word recognition and vocabulary, and in particular to assess the evidence for 1) whether the speed, accuracy, and variability measures described above all index the same underlying language processing construct and 2) the nature of the relation between this construct (or set of constructs) and early vocabulary. We begin developing models using all data, treating each observation as independent even if it comes from a longitudinal study; this assumption is equivalent to asserting an invariant factor structure across development (for a test of this assumption, see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-10">S10</xref> Factor Analysis on First Administrations). In subsequent models, we relax this assumption and explore longitudinal growth.</p>
<p>Initial exploratory factor analysis using parallel analysis to select the number of factors suggested that three factors explained substantial variance in the data (see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-9">S9</xref> Factor Analysis). To better accommodate missing data under the assumption of data missing at random (e.g., missingness due to the age sampling schemes of the various datasets), we used confirmatory factor analysis with full information maximum likelihood to find the best set of loadings. The best fitting model was a three-factor model with factors for speed (RT and RT variability), accuracy (proportion looking to target on each trial and associated variability of this measure), and vocabulary (comprehension and production from the CDI). Fit statistics for this model were generally good (Confirmatory fit index: 0.97, RMSE: 0.06); see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-11">S11</xref> Alternative Factor Structures).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows a regression model fit to this confirmatory factor analysis, with log age predicting each latent variable. This regression model allows interpretation of the covariances between latent factors as partial correlations (controlling for age). The non-age related variance of all three latent factors was significantly related to that of the other factors, with speed and accuracy showing strong negative covariance (<italic>β</italic> = −0.82, SE = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) and weaker but significant covariation between RT and vocabulary (<italic>β</italic> = −0.29, SE = 0.04, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001) and accuracy and vocabulary (<italic>β</italic> = 0.39, SE = 0.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). This model supports the idea that variation in speed and accuracy of word recognition is related to individual differences in parent-reported vocabulary beyond the effects of age. Further, the broader set of analyses support a factor structure in which speed and accuracy (and their associated variabilities) are related but distinct aspects of word recognition, rather than being measures of one single construct. These analyses treat all data as between person, however, rather than modeling change in these factors within individuals.</p>

<title>Speed of processing relates to vocabulary growth</title>
<p>To investigate within-person relationships between LWL and vocabulary, we began by fitting longitudinal growth models to the portion of the data containing multiple LWL sessions for individual children. We first reproduced the analysis reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), in which between-person differences in longitudinal growth in productive vocabulary were predicted based on between-person differences in speed during the initial session of the study. We fit a mixed-effects model predicting growth in vocabulary as a quadratic function of age, RT at study initiation (<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>), and their interaction (as well as random effects of age nested within participant and also age nested within dataset).

<p>We confirmed this analysis using a non-linear growth model with a logistic shape, which provides a better fit to vocabulary size within a fixed-length form than the quadratic model (see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-12">S12</xref> Non-Linear Growth Model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows predictions from this model, confirming the differentiation of growth curves for children with higher and lower initial reaction time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is possible that differences in predicted growth trajectories are due to coupling between vocabulary size and language processing across the entire developmental period, rather than a predictive relationship specifically between <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> RT and vocabulary growth. To test this relationship, we used longitudinal structural equation models. We separated the longitudinal speed, accuracy, and vocabulary data into two-month bins spanning up to 10 months from the initial measurement (i.e., <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>, ..., <italic>t</italic><sub>4</sub>) and fit individual growth across each of these variables. We used full-information maximum likelihood to handle the substantial missing data caused by the different longitudinal sampling schemes of studies in our dataset (see <xref ref-type="section" rid="s4-13">S13</xref> SEM Longitudinal Missingness).

<p>Our key question of interest concerned coupling among the (latent) intercepts and slopes of these growth models. Consistent with our earlier analysis showing that faster processing is related to vocabulary growth, we saw significant coupling between processing speed intercepts and vocabulary growth slopes (<italic>β</italic> = −0.14, SE = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) as well as a variety of other couplings. On the other hand, there was not significant coupling between <italic>growth</italic> in speed and <italic>growth</italic> in vocabulary (<italic>β</italic> = −0.01, SE = 0.01, <italic>p</italic> = 0.65). This null effect could be interpreted as being consistent with these abilities growing independently, but there are other possibilities. First, the longitudinal data we had might not have allowed sufficiently precise estimates of growth slopes, or second, since vocabulary growth is non-linear, the linear model we used here might not have captured coupling among nonlinear aspects of developmental change.</p>
<p>In sum, these findings provide evidence consistent with the claim that differences in processing speed are related to differences in the rate of age-related change in vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Children with greater skill in word recognition learn words faster.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How does word recognition change across early childhood and how does it relate to language learning? We investigated these questions using a new, large-scale dataset of developmental eye-tracking measurements compiled across many prior studies. The age gradients for speed and accuracy indicated that both improve asymptotically. Gradients for recognition speed were consistent with the log-log relationship associated with the “power law of practice,” that is, with a gradual convergence to mature levels of processing efficiency. Further, the age gradient suggested that trial-to-trial variability decreases with age, consistent with both the literature on skill learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) and other work on developmental changes in variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Speed and accuracy were both related to vocabulary size concurrently and processing speed was also related longitudinally to later vocabulary growth.</p>
<p>Together, our findings are consistent with theories that posit that language learning is a process of skill acquisition, in which children become adept at quickly converting ephemeral signals into meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). This skill develops gradually over the course of early childhood and supports word learning. Further, our results point to consistency between skill development in early childhood and the continued refinement of language processing and language knowledge during middle childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>By aggregating data from many pre-existing studies, we were able to overcome the limitations of prior investigations, which typically had sample sizes at least an order of magnitude smaller than ours. Our approach was to build on the time-consuming and meticulous data collection from previous infant and toddler eye-tracking studies - representing cumulatively many thousands of hours of in-lab data collection and hand-annotation of the resulting videos of child looking behavior - by harmonizing these data into a single, large-scale database. This approach illustrates how building harmonized databases can be especially powerful when composed of high-effort and high-quality datasets that are smaller in scope, maximizing the impact of previous data collection efforts and allowing us to ask broader questions about developmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). In contrast to individual studies, which typically have at best the statistical power to test one or two specific contrasts, our “big data” approach provided the sample sizes necessary to explore the relationships between different variables. Because early language is so variable, these kinds of samples – with thousands, rather than dozens of children - are likely to be required to gain further insight into the psychometrics of early language learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>
<p>Our approach is both observational and exploratory. Thus, we cannot untangle the range of different causal models that explain the variation we observed. First, early word recognition skill could lead to faster word learning, but faster children could also be faster due to their larger vocabulary and stronger lexical representations. These two causal directions could also interact reciprocally, leading to a “rich get richer” process in which children with larger vocabularies process faster, and their faster processing helps them increase their vocabulary size more rapidly. Finally, a third shared factor - perhaps general cognitive ability - could underpin both processes. Our cross-sectional data cannot distinguish these hypotheses even in principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), and our longitudinal data are likely too sparse to distinguish such complex causal models. Future work must also explore how the functional forms we observed here between individuals reflect processes of within-person change. Although the Peekbank dataset includes a variety of longitudinal data, most reflect a small number of measurements; denser longitudinal data collection is required to better estimate within-person growth models.</p>
<p>The consistency of the trends we observed across datasets suggests that our qualitative conclusions are robust to some significant cross-laboratory and cross-sociodemographic variation. Nevertheless, these findings are still limited in their generalizability by the convenience samples that were used in most of the studies aggregated in Peekbank. These studies typically (but not always) represent children from well-educated parents living in university-adjacent communities. We would not expect that specific numerical parameters estimated in our aggregate convenience sample would generalize to other samples.</p>
<p>More broadly, our results here suggest the continued importance of the looking-while-listening paradigm as an index of children’s language processing abilities. If language learning is, at least in part, a process of skill learning, then measurement of this skill in larger samples provides a critical window into understanding the remarkable process of language learning.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>We included information from 1963 unique participants across 24 datasets. Dataset information is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Although experiments in Peekbank include a variety of different experimental manipulations, we analyzed only data from standard, simple word recognition trials; these trials were sometimes the main focus of the original studies and sometimes constituted control conditions for experiments with more complex manipulations. Requirements for being considered a standard word recognition trial included that (a) the target word was familiar (also no part-words); (b) the target word was the first point of disambiguation; (c) the target word was embedded in a well-formed, grammatical carrier phrase; (d) there was no informative language presented prenominally (e.g. semantically informative verbs, adjectives); (e) there were no nonsense words presented anywhere during the trial (including the carrier phrase); (f) there was no language-, speaker-, or accent-switching within trial; (g) the distractor image was unrelated to both the target label and the target image; and (h) there was no phonological overlap between the distractor label and target label. We focus here on English purely for practical reasons − the Peekbank dataset at present contains limited data from other languages.</p>
<p>We excluded trials entirely if they were missing data on more than 50% of timepoints, and excluded RTs if they were based on fewer than 50% of timepoints in the short analytic window (200 – 2000 ms). We also removed RTs shorter than 367 ms, as these were unlikely to be generated based on the specific linguistic stimulus. We then excluded participants from the analysis if they contributed fewer than four accuracy measurements or fewer than two reaction time measurements. At the participant level, these steps together led to 17% missingness for RTs and 6.30% missingness for long window accuracies.</p>

<title>S2. Reaction Times</title>
<sec id="s4-2-1">
<title>S2.1. Reaction Time Computation</title>
<p>Eye-tracking data are stored in Peekbank as a time series of fixations to specific areas of interest (in particular, the target and distractor on each trial). Other fixations can be to areas not in the target or distractor as well to off-screen areas. This time series has a uniform sample rate of 25ms/sample, based on resampling of the data in Peekbank to 40 Hz during preprocessing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Zettersten et al. 2023</xref>). Reaction times are computed by filtering trials to only those on which the child is fixating the distractor at the point of disambiguation (<italic>t</italic> = 0) and then finding those trials on which the first non-missing fixation is to the target (hence excluding trials without a shift and trials on which a shift is to an off-screen location). The reaction time is then the total time from <italic>t</italic> = 0 to the first timestep during which the child fixates the target. Consistent with standard practice in the literature following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fernald et al. (2008)</xref>, RTs that are shorter than 367 ms are excluded as they are too short to be considered a response to the stimulus.</p>

<title>S2.2. Comparison of Reaction Times for Correct and Incorrect Trials: Re-analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Creel, 2024</xref></title>
<p>The Peekbank dataset only includes measurements of infants’ looking behavior, with no measure of a final target selection. This contrasts with work in the visual-world paradigm with older children and adults, in which participants make a final explicit choice about which image matches the target label (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Colby &amp; McMurray, 2023</xref>). Having this additional response allows a clearer separation of accuracy and reaction times, because researchers can compute reaction times specifically on those trials in which participants responded correctly. This strategy helps avoid a possible mixing of reaction times for incorrect and correct responses, which might be generated by different underlying cognitive processes. A possible concern with the Peekbank datasets — and reaction times in infant looking-while-listening studies more generally — is that it is difficult to separate reaction times for correct vs. incorrect responses in the absence of an independent final choice response.</p>
<p>To address this concern, we investigated data from a recent large-scale word recognition study with toddlers in which eyetracking measures were collected together with a final pointing response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Creel, 2024</xref>). This dataset included 914 responses from children (2.5–6.5 years) completing a looking-while listening procedure in which they also were instructed to point to the target image. Using this dataset, we investigated the correlation between reaction times (following the same procedure as in our main analyses, i.e. focusing specifically on distractor-to-target shifts) computed over all trials and reaction times computed only for those trials in which children selected the correct referent. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3</xref>. Reaction times (i.e., distractor to target shifts) for correct trials only were highly correlated with reaction times across all trials (<italic>r</italic> = .85, 95% CI [.82, .87], <italic>t</italic>(479) = 34.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This result suggests that having the ability to filter out incorrect trials has a minimal impact on reaction time computation, even in young children. While there is some uncertainty about how these results may generalize to infants in our younger age ranges (i.e., below 2.5 years of age), who struggle to provide reliable pointing responses, it seems reasonable to assume that our reaction time results would stay largely the same if it were possible to filter out trials on which infants make an incorrect mapping between the target label and the target image using an eyetracking-independent final choice response.</p>

<title>S3. Checks on Data Distributional Assumptions</title>
<p>Here, we check whether the distributional forms that are assumed for the distributions of RT and accuracy are a reasonable empirical fit to the data, and compare against other commonly used distributional forms.</p>
<p>We confirm that, across the age range, the choice to use a log-normal distribution for RT and a normal distribution for accuracy is justified.</p>
<sec id="s4-3-1">
<title>S3.1. Reaction Time</title>
<p>The literature focuses on the use of the Exponential-Gaussian (ex-Gaussian) distribution as well as Wald, Weibull, gamma, and log normal distributions (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Luce, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ratcliff, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Van Zandt, 2002</xref>). All of these are 2- or 3-parameter distributions meaning that there is no necessary relationship between mean and variance.</p>
<p>The problem of fitting RT distributions is complex and a substantial literature exists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ratcliff, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Luce, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Van Zandt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Baayen &amp; Milin, 2010</xref>). One of the big challenges in our dataset as well as elsewhere is that distributions are conditional on factors such as participant and task, so it is challenging to draw inferences about the underlying distribution when looking at average data.</p>
<p>That said, we find that overall the data are best fit by either an ex-Gaussian or a log normal distribution, again consistent with prior literature, giving us confidence in this conclusion. Across the full dataset, the BIC values for ex-Gaussian (42553) and log normal (42624) are quite close to one another, and better than the Wald (49038) and normal (43459) fits. When binned by age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Fig S4</xref>), younger children seem better fit for a log normal distribution and older children seem better fit by ex-Gaussian (models with lowest BICs are shown in red since significant differences can be obscured by the large scale). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS5">Figure S5</xref> shows the RT data distribution overlaid with the corresponding log-normal distributions.</p>
<p>Overall, we think this result generally vitiates our decision to use log-transformed RTs as our primary dependent measure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4-3-2">
<title>S3.2. Accuracy</title>
<p>Individual trial-level accuracies are not binomial because they are an average probability of fixation over a viewing window. They are bounded at 0 and 1, but in general they tend towards the range .5 – .8 in most studies of this population. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS6">Figure S6</xref> shows the data binned by age group with fitted gaussian distributions.</p>
<p>These distributions seem well fit by standard gaussians, but they are in principle bounded and so we asked whether this made a difference, using a Beta distribution (a two-parameter continuous distribution bounded at 0 and 1) for fitting. Surprisingly, across all data, the BIC values for the two distributions were very similar (−4321 for normal versus −4314 for Beta), though the normal distribution was slightly favored. Across age groups, there was heterogeneity with some groups better fit by a gaussian and others better fit by a Beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS7">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
<p>Again, we feel that this result generally vitiates our approach of modeling accuracies via standard linear mixed-effects models: their distributional form is quite close to normal.</p>

<title>S4. Test-Retest Reliability</title>
<p>We examined test-retest reliability for our primary variables of interest by calculating Pearson correlations between pairs of administrations given no more than three months apart. Test-retest correlations were significant but relatively modest: <italic>ρ<sub>longwindowacc</sub></italic> = 0.462, <italic>ρ<sub>shortwindowacc</sub></italic> = 0.496, <italic>ρ<sub>rt</sub></italic> = 0.407. These reliabilities were biased downwards by three factors, however. First, longitudinal assessments sometimes use variable items between testing sessions, leading to item-related variance in measurement. Second, even three months can lead to substantial change in some children’s language abilities, thus correlations are attenuated by true change as well as measurement error. Third, longitudinal data in the dataset come primarily from the youngest children and hence are likely to show overall higher measurement error due to variability in children’s behavior and an overall lower number of trials.</p>

<title>S7. Power Law Fits</title>
<p>In the literature on the “law of practice”, although the log-log relationship we observed is commonly present in the aggregate across individuals, the situation is substantially more complex when relationships are measured within individuals. The best fitting curves for individuals are often exponentials or delayed exponentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Heathcote, Brown, &amp; Mewhort, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>With our current dataset, we unfortunately cannot specifically determine whether within-individual patterns of change conform to linear, power law, or exponential developmental patterns, because we have insufficient data about individuals’ improvement across time. Thus, our current results apply to the form of the age gradient as opposed to the form of any individual’s pattern of developmental change.</p>
<p>We believe that, unlike the skills being studied in the prior adult literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Anderson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Heathcote, Brown, &amp; Mewhort, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Logan, 1988</xref>), language processing is being learned over the course of a child’s lifetime. Thus, we do not expect to see within-paradigm changes in learning in what is a narrow period of time compared to the duration over which language processing skills are refined.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, here we test for other forms of the aggregate relationship between age and reaction time. In particular, we consider 1) a log~log relationship between RT and age (presented in the main text), 2) using both a log age and a linear age to predict log RT, 3) a quadratic relationship between age and RT, and 4) a cubic relationship between age and RT. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS4">Table S4</xref>, the model with a linear age term in addition to a log age term has the best fit, although the linear age term coefficient is only marginally significant (coefficients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS5">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>These models reveal a small but significant additional linear age term over and above log age, but - because individual participant-level fits are not possible - this term can’t really be used to weigh in on the debate about the precise nature of the learning pattern.</p>

A comparison of all 4 models is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS7">Table S7</xref>. For the three-factor CFA, the first administration model shows increased CFI (.992 instead of .972) and decreased RMSEA (.030 instead of .065).

<p>To test for the differentiation of vocabulary growth based on initial reaction time, we used the package brms to fit a (Bayesian) logistic growth model to the production data. This model has two parameters for the logistic curve, a scale and an intercept. Both were allowed to interact with initial reaction time. We also included random effects of logistic intercept and scale by participant and a grouping term across datasets.</p>

<p>Age and reaction time are correlated, so to check that the effects of initial reaction time were not due to age effects, we reran the model using residualized reaction time to remove effects of age. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS10">Table S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS9">Figure S9</xref>, the pattern of effects is similar for residualized reaction time as for reaction time.</p>
<p>Interpretation of growth in both this model and the linear growth model in the main text is complicated by the fact that the CDI form puts a ceiling on the total number of words that can be recorded; both the quadratic growth functions and the logistic functions come together at the form ceiling. Thus, a shift in quadratic growth in the linear model and a shift in intercept in the logistic model both point to the same overall effect, which is faster growth at the point of maximal sensitivity of the CDI. Neither model can estimate whether the overall growth trajectory is different beyond the range of the CDI. Thus, although these models might initially seem to be in conflict, we believe that they actually point to the same phenomenon, which is perhaps better described by the longitudinal SEM model reported in the main text. Children with greater skill in word recognition show an overall positive shift in the growth trajectory of vocabulary development.</p>

<title>S13. SEM Longitudinal Missingness</title>
<p>The SEM model was fit to the entire dataset, including the large mass of cross-sectional data (to anchor the estimates of t0 coefficients) and the sparse longitudinal data for each time point. We have 3%-12% of the total t0 datapoints for any given time point (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tblS11">Table S11</xref>), given the sparsity of longitudinal sampling (only 6/24 of the datasets are longitudinal).</p>
<p>Our data are MAR (missing at random) rather than MCAR (missing completely at random). This is because their missingness is due to which dataset they are part of - if they are from a cross-sectional dataset, they are by definition missing all longitudinal observations. For our analyses to be appropriate given this structure, we have to assume that the general developmental patterns we are studying are replicated across datasets. We believe that they are, and we show this statistically using our mixed-effects and non-linear mixed-effects models, which control for dataset-related variation. We also show dataset-level effects in a number of our visualizations for this same reason. The same degree of random effect specification that we can do in the mixed-effects models is not possible in the SEM model, however, purely for technical reasons. Again, this point highlights the importance of convergence across analyses.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> contribution that largely confirms prior evidence that word recognition - a cornerstone of development - improves across early childhood and is related to vocabulary growth. This study is distinguished by its use of a large, multi-study dataset that is uncommon in prior research on cognitive development. It provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence that speed, accuracy, and consistency of word learning improve with age, and will therefore prove of interest to those studying language, and more broadly, perception and development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study examined the extent to which children's word recognition skill improves across early development, becoming faster, more accurate and less variable, and the extent to which word recognition skill is related to children's concurrent and later vocabulary knowledge.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of the study comes from the dataset, which recycles previously collected data from 24 studies to examine the development of word recognition skill using data from 1963 children. This maximizes the impact of previously collected data while also allowing the study to reliably ask big-picture questions on the development of word recognition skill and its relation to chronological age and vocabulary knowledge. Data analysis is rigorous, thought through and very clearly described. Data and code necessary to reproduce the manuscript are shared on the project's GitHub.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The limitations of the study are acknowledged to some extent, but need to be improved and ensured that they run throughout the manuscript. Thus, in the discussion, the authors note that the approach is observational and exploratory, and highlight for me a key alternative explanation of the findings, namely that faster children could be faster due to their larger vocabulary, rather than faster children learning more words. Indeed, the latter explanation for the relationship is called into question, given that growth in speed was not related to growth in vocabulary. Here, the authors note that the null result may be related to the fact that they do not sufficiently precise estimates of growth slopes, rather than taking the alternative explanation seriously that there may not be as causal a link between being a faster word learner and a better word learner (learn more words). This is especially since, but correct me if I'm wrong here, the current vocabulary size is not taken into consideration in the model examining vocabulary growth. Given the increasing number of studies showing that current vocabulary knowledge predicts vocabulary growth (Laing, Kalinowski et al, Siew &amp; Vitevitch), one simple alternative explanation is that current vocabulary knowledge predicts both current word recognition skill and later vocabulary knowledge. Is there anything in the data speaking against this hypothesis?</p>
<p>Equally, while the SEM examines vocabulary growth controlling for age, I wonder about the other way around. What would happen to the effect of age on word recognition skill (in the LME model, S8) if one were to add concurrent vocabulary size? So does chronological age explain word recognition skill or vocabulary knowledge? Right now, the manuscript describes this effect purely related to chronological age, but is it age per se or other cognitive abilities, including a key change across development, namely, vocabulary size? Thus, the presentation of the skill learning hypothesis suggests that age is a proxy for experience, while you actually have here a very nice proxy for experience in terms of children's vocabulary size.</p>
<p>Critically, while the discussion is more nuanced, the way the abstract is concluded and the way the Introduction is phrased suggest that the study is able to answer a causal question, which, as the authors themselves note, is not possible. The abstract, for instance, states that word recognition becomes faster, more accurate and less variable...consistent with a process of skill learning. And also that this skill plays a role in supporting early language learning, which is very causal language. I don't think you can really claim that you are testing the two hypotheses you suggest here. The work is definitely embedded in the context of these hypotheses, but are you really able to test them? My worry is that while the discussion is more nuanced, the extent to which this study will then be cited down the line as showing that children learn more words down the line because they are faster at recognizing words, and anything that you can do to tamper with such interpretations would be good for the literature. For me, this should not just be relegated to the discussion but should be touched upon in the abstract and Introduction.</p>
<p>Finally, it would help to talk more about the mechanisms at work in any relationship between word recognition and language learning. It seems to me that this would rely on some predictive processing framework, given the description on page 4, and it would be good to make this clear (faster and more accurately you can recognize a ball, better use this evidence to infer the speaker's intended meaning). Equally, when referring to word recognition, it would be good to clarify what this refers to - how well a child knows what a word refers to (and in the context of LWL, what it does not refer to) or how quickly it directs attention to what is referred to.</p>
<p>With regards to the data, I wonder if there is a clustering of kids past 24 months that is happening here, looking at Figures 1 and 2, where it seems like there is less change past the 24-month point. Is there any way to look at whether the effect of age or vocabulary on word recognition is not linear but asymptotic?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper presents a series of analyses of a large dataset combining many prior studies of early word recognition (Peekbank). The analyses demonstrate that the speed, accuracy and consistency of word learning improve with age. Moreover, the speed of word learning early in development was related to vocabulary growth over time.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of the paper is the use of a large multi-study dataset. This is particularly valuable in the field of early cognitive development, which has (due to practical limitations) often been based on small-scale studies that necessarily provide a shaky foundation for conclusions. The analyses are also well-motivated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses I saw are primarily in some aspects of the conceptual motivation for the research.</p>
<p>First, I wasn't entirely clear about what the authors meant by &quot;word recognition ability&quot;. For much of the manuscript (including the use of the term &quot;word recognition ability&quot; itself), this comes across as an intrinsic ability or skill that improves with development. Alternatively, the speed and accuracy metrics taken from studies in Peekbank might capture children's increasing knowledge of the common, concrete words typically used in these studies. To me, this is a somewhat different construct from a general skill at recognizing words. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify which construct they intend to capture, or if it is not possible to distinguish between these constructs from the Peekbank data.</p>
<p>Second, and relatedly, if the source of the age-related improvements is increasing experience with the common concrete words used in the Peekbank studies, then one might expect word recognition and improvements with age to be related to word frequency, given that more frequent words are experienced more often. Word frequency predicts word knowledge when assessed using CDI data. Can effects of frequency be detected in Peekbank word recognition metrics? If not, why? Similarly, is the speed and accuracy of word recognition in Peekbank data related to CDI-derived word age of acquisition, and again, if not, why?</p>
<p>Finally, there is a bit of a risk of the main findings of this paper coming across as a foregone conclusion. I.e., how could it be otherwise that word recognition improves with development?</p>
