<title>Abstract</title><p>The precise onset of flowering is crucial to ensure successful plant reproduction. The gene <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T</italic> (<italic>FT</italic>) encodes florigen, a mobile signal produced in leaves that initiates flowering at the shoot apical meristem. In response to seasonal changes, <italic>FT</italic> is induced in phloem companion cells located in distal leaf regions. Thus far, a detailed molecular characterization of the <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells has been lacking. Here, we used bulk nuclei RNA-seq and single nuclei RNA (snRNA)-seq to investigate gene expression in <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells and other phloem companion cells. Our bulk nuclei RNA-seq demonstrated that <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells in cotyledons and in true leaves differed transcriptionally. Within the true leaves, our snRNA-seq analysis revealed that companion cells with high <italic>FT</italic> expression form a unique cluster in which many genes involved in ATP biosynthesis are highly upregulated. The cluster also expresses other genes encoding small proteins, including the flowering and stem growth inducer FPF1-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (FLP1) and the anti-florigen BROTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (BFT). In addition, we found that the promoters of <italic>FT</italic> and the genes co-expressed with <italic>FT</italic> in the cluster were enriched for the consensus binding motifs of NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1 (NIGT1). Overexpression of the paralogous <italic>NIGT1.2</italic> and <italic>NIGT1.4</italic> repressed <italic>FT</italic> expression and significantly delayed flowering under nitrogen-rich conditions, consistent with NIGT1s acting as nitrogen-dependent <italic>FT</italic> repressors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that major <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells show a distinct expression profile that suggests that these cells may produce multiple systemic signals to regulate plant growth and development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plants determine the seasonal timing of flowering based on environmental cues such as day length and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). The small protein FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is a florigen, a mobile signaling molecule that promotes flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, some phloem companion cells residing in the distal parts of leaves highly express <italic>FT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Although <italic>FT</italic> exhibits only a single expression peak in the evening under common laboratory long-day (LD) conditions, <italic>FT</italic> is highly expressed in the morning and evening under natural light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The discrepancy between natural and laboratory conditions can be attributed to differences in the red-to-far-red light (R/FR) ratios. Adjusting the R/FR ratio to that observed in nature is sufficient to recreate the bimodal expression pattern of <italic>FT</italic> in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite extensive research on the genetic regulation of <italic>FT</italic> expression and function, our understanding of the cells that express <italic>FT</italic> is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Although <italic>FT</italic> is expressed in some phloem companion cells, the precise molecular features that distinguish <italic>FT</italic>-expressing phloem companion cells from other companion cells have remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Recently, to understand the distinct features of <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells, we employed Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)-seq, a method that identifies ribosome-associated transcripts in specific tissues or cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). We found that the list of differentially translated transcripts in <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells partially overlapped with that in the general phloem companion cell marker gene <italic>SUC2</italic>-expressing cells but also contained unique transcripts to <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). This supports the notion that the <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells are similar but different from general phloem companion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Our TRAP-seq datasets showed that several <italic>FT</italic> positive and negative transcriptional regulators and proteins involved in FT protein transport were specifically enriched in <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells. We also found that a gene encoding the small protein FPF1-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (FLP1) is highly expressed in <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells under LD conditions with adjusted R/FR ratio (hereafter, LD+FR conditions), but not under standard laboratory LD conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Further analysis revealed that FLP1 promotes flowering and initial inflorescence stem growth, suggesting that it orchestrates flowering and inflorescence stem growth during the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive stage.</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to study different cell populations within the complexity of biological tissues. Although our bulk tissue/cell-specific TRAP-seq analysis revealed some unique characteristics of <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells, we still do not know their characteristics in a single-cell resolution. As <italic>FT</italic> is expressed at specific times of the day in relatively small numbers of phloem companion cells, we needed a method to collect the information from these rare <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells in a time-dependent manner. To capture <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells when <italic>FT</italic> expression peaks, we deployed single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) combined with fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) to isolate GFP-labeled cell-type-specific nuclei at a specific time of the day. Here, we report the unique characteristics of <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells at a single-cell level and identify new, growth condition-specific transcriptional repressors of <italic>FT</italic>.</p>

<title>Bulk nuclei RNA-seq analysis finds profound expression differences in <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells between cotyledons and true leaves</title>
<p>To investigate gene expression in the nuclei of specific cell populations, we used <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> transgenic lines expressing the gene encoding NTF [Nuclear Targeting Fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>)] under the control of cell type-specific promoters. In addition to the previously generated <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), we generated transgenic lines with <italic>pSUC2</italic> to capture most phloem companion cells, <italic>pCAB2</italic> for mesophyll cells, and <italic>p35S</italic> as a non-specific control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We employed FANS to isolate the respective GFP-positive nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>

<p>Although <italic>FT</italic> is expressed in both cotyledons and true leaves, it was heretofore unknown whether <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells in cotyledons and true leaves were equivalent to one another at the whole transcriptome level or showed tissue-specific differences in transcription. The previous histological analyses of the <italic>Arabidopsis pFT:GUS</italic> reporter line showed that <italic>FT</italic> expression in true leaves was confined to the distal part of the leaf vasculature, whereas in cotyledons, <italic>FT</italic> expression was observed in the broader part of the vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), suggesting different profiles of <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells in cotyledons and true leaves. To exclude possible tissue-specificity as a source of noise in our single-nuclei data, we conducted bulk nuclear RNA-seq of GFP-positive nuclei isolated from either cotyledons or true leaves. To do so, we harvested cotyledons and the first set of two true leaves from two-week-old transgenic plants grown under LD+FR conditions at Zeitgeber time 4 (ZT4), the time of the <italic>FT</italic> morning expression peak, and isolated GFP-positive nuclei within an hour using a cell sorter (<bold>Fig. S1A, C</bold>). We successfully collected GFP-positive nuclei from both cotyledons and true leaves for all transgenic lines (<bold>Fig. S2</bold>) and conducted bulk RNA-seq.</p>
<p>The principal component analysis (PCA) of the resulting expression data indicated separation by tissue and targeted cell population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the biggest difference among these datasets was the difference between cotyledons and true leaves, rather than a cell/tissue-type difference. Among different cells/tissues, <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells show a distinct gene expression profile compared with other cell/tissue types examined.</p>
<p>Next, to ensure that we had properly enriched for the targeted cell populations, we conducted pairwise comparisons between the <italic>p35S:NTF</italic> control line and the cell type-specific <italic>NTF</italic> lines (<bold>Data S1–6</bold>). As expected, in true leaves of the <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> line, phloem companion cell marker genes <italic>FT</italic>, <italic>SUC2</italic>, <italic>AHA3</italic>, <italic>APL</italic>, <italic>CM3,</italic> and <italic>AAP4</italic> showed higher expression than in the <italic>p35S:NTF</italic> line, and the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> line showed strong upregulation of <italic>FT</italic> in both cotyledon and true leaves (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <bold>Fig. S3A–E</bold>). True leaves of the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> line also showed upregulation of other phloem companion cell marker genes such as <italic>AHA3</italic>, <italic>APL,</italic> and <italic>AAP4</italic>; however, cotyledons of the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> line only showed upregulation of <italic>AAP4</italic> (<bold>Fig. S3A–E</bold>), indicating some of known vascular marker genes are more suitable for representing vascular tissues in true leaves.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> line, we observed differences in cell marker gene expression between cotyledons and true leaves. In cotyledons of the <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> line, <italic>CM3</italic> and <italic>AAP4</italic> were upregulated, but not <italic>SUC2</italic>, <italic>FT</italic>, <italic>AHA3</italic> and <italic>APL</italic>. To ensure that FANS properly enriched nuclei from <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> cotyledons, we checked the spatial expression pattern of each gene that was highly expressed in <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> cotyledons [adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value (<italic>padj</italic>) &lt; 0.05, fold-change &gt; 2-fold, <bold>Table S1</bold>]. The majority of the genes upregulated in the cotyledons of our <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> line were found to be expressed in the vasculature. As expected, expression of mesophyll marker gene <italic>CAB2</italic> was significantly lower in <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> cotyledon samples (<italic>padj</italic> = 1.5 x 10<sup>−4</sup>), in addition to the mesophyll cell marker <italic>RBCS1A</italic> in true leaf samples, suggesting that a significant amount of mesophyll cells was successfully removed by FANS (<bold>Fig. S3F, G</bold>).</p>
<p>Having ensured proper enrichments of the targeted nuclei, we compared global changes in expression among the tested transgenic lines. Consistent with the PCA analysis, the vast majority of differentially expressed genes within a given transgenic line did not overlap between cotyledons and true leaves (<bold>Fig. S4, S5</bold>). Next, we compared the expression of known <italic>FT</italic> positive and negative regulators in cotyledons and true leaves of the <italic>pFT:NTF, pSUC2:NTF,</italic> and <italic>pCAB2:NTF</italic> lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D–K</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the transcription factors that promote <italic>FT</italic> expression, <italic>APL</italic> and <italic>VOZ1</italic> were upregulated in true leaves of the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> and <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). In true leaves of the <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> line, a CO destabilizing factor was significantly upregulated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>), in addition to TFs that repress <italic>FT</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). In contrast to <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> true leaves, true leaves of the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> line did not show significant upregulation for most of these <italic>FT</italic> repressors. This lack of <italic>FT</italic> repression appears to be crucial for specifying <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells. In contrast, there were far fewer expression differences in cotyledons between the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> and <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> lines, indicating that the respective cells in true leaves have diverged more than comparable ones in cotyledons.</p>
<p>Similarly, <italic>FT</italic> expression and FT transport appeared to be more tightly associated in true leaves than in cotyledons. As reported, the expression of the FT transporter gene <italic>FTIP1</italic> is highly associated with <italic>FT</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Consistent with this earlier finding, among FT transporter genes, we observed significant upregulation of <italic>FTIP1</italic> expression in true leaves of the <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> and the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> lines but not in the respective cotyledon samples (<bold>Fig. S3H–K</bold>).</p>
<p>To further support true leaves as most suitable for investigating <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells, we performed Terms enrichment analysis with Metascape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> line, the genes involved in the “regulation of reproductive process” were upregulated in both cotyledons and true leaves, while the genes related to the term “long-day photoperiodism, flowering” were only upregulated in the true leaf samples of the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> line (<bold>Fig. S4</bold>).</p>

<title>snRNA-seq revealed subpopulation of phloem companion cells that highly express <italic>FT</italic></title>
<p>Next, we used true leaves of the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> and <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> lines for snRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform (<bold>Fig. S1B</bold>). We captured a total of 1,173 nuclei for the <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> line and 3,650 nuclei for the <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> line. In total, we captured 4,823 nuclei and detected 20,732 genes, a median of 149 genes per nuclei (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Gene expression of these nuclei were projected in a two-dimensional UMAP as 11 different clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The nuclei in clusters 8 and 10 showed substantially higher number of transcripts than other clusters <bold>(Fig. S6A and B</bold>). Because this discrepancy made comparisons difficult, we focused on analyzing gene expression in the other clusters.</p>

<p>We first asked which nuclei highly expressed <italic>FT</italic>. These nuclei resided in cluster 7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, <bold>2E</bold>). <italic>SUC2</italic> expression showed a far broader distribution across clusters than <italic>FT</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). The nuclei in cluster 7 significantly highly expressed 268 genes compared with total population (<bold>Data S7</bold>). Among these genes, we found <italic>FLP1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), a gene encoding a flowering-promoting factor acting in parallel with FT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Next, we cross-checked these 268 genes with genes identified in the previous TRAP-seq experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). 202 of the 268 genes showed higher expression in <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells (<italic>pFT:FLAG-GFP-RPL18</italic>) than in whole companion cells (<italic>pSUC2:FLAG-GFP-RPL18</italic>) (<bold>Fig. S7A</bold>) in the prior study, validating our single nuclei analysis. Further, <italic>FKBP12</italic>, a gene encoding a CO stabilizing protein was expressed in cluster 7 (<bold>Fig. S7B</bold>).</p>
<p>To explore the <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cluster 7, we conducted Terms enrichment analysis using Metascape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Genes involved in “Oxidative phosphorylation” were enriched in cluster 7 (<bold>Fig. S7C</bold>), suggesting that ATP synthesis is particularly active in nuclei belonging to this cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Genes involved in proton-generating complex I–IV and ATP synthesizing complex V in mitochondrion membrane were also upregulated in cluster 7 (<bold>Fig. S8D</bold>), suggesting that the entire ATP synthesis pathway is activated in <italic>FT</italic>-expressing nuclei. Additional terms such as “generation of precursor metabolite and energy” and “purine nucleotide triphosphate metabolic process,” further indicated upregulation of ATP production. Since phloem companion cells actively hydrolyze ATP to generate proton gradients to load sucrose and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), it is plausible that <italic>FT</italic>-expressing phloem companion cells generate a substantial amount of ATP for transport.</p>
<p>We next inquired about the characteristics of other phloem nuclei clusters. Like cluster 7, cluster 4 showed significantly higher <italic>SUC2</italic> expression compared with other clusters, suggesting companion cell identity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, <bold>Data S7</bold>). Moreover, the genes <italic>LTP1</italic>, <italic>MLP28</italic>, and <italic>XTH4</italic> were upregulated in cluster 4, consistent with prior studies showing their exclusive expression in vascular tissues including phloem (<bold>Fig. S8A–C</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>).Terms enrichment analysis found that genes encoding aquaporin were enriched in cluster 4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>, <bold>Fig. 8D, E</bold>). Taken together, the nuclei in cluster 4 are likely to be derived from phloem cells that are active in solute transport.</p>
<p>Cluster 5 is mostly composed of nuclei from the <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> line (464 out of 515 nuclei) (<bold>Fig. S6B</bold>). The nuclei in this cluster showed differentially expressed genes related to defense (<bold>Fig. S9A</bold>). Specifically, <italic>MYC2,</italic> a master regulator of response to jasmonic acid (JA), and the JA biosynthetic genes <italic>LOX3</italic>, <italic>LOX4</italic>, <italic>OPR3,</italic> and <italic>OPCL1,</italic> are expressed in cluster 5 (<bold>Fig. S9B</bold>). These genes are known to be expressed in vascular tissues, with <italic>OPR3</italic> expressed in phloem companion cells and <italic>LOX3</italic>/<italic>4</italic> in phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). This subpopulation of phloem cells appears to play pivotal roles in JA-dependent defense responses.</p>
<p>Cluster 6 consisted of both phloem parenchyma and bundle sheath cells (<bold>Fig. S10A–F</bold>). Subclustering revealed that the nuclei in the upper part of cluster 6 expressed phloem parenchyma marker genes, and the nuclei in the lower part expressed bundle sheath marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) (<bold>Fig. S10C–F</bold>). Overall, the genes expressed in this cluster were enriched for genes functioning in sulfur metabolisms (<bold>Fig. S10G</bold>), including glucosinolate biosynthesis (<bold>Fig. S10H</bold>). A previous study showed that sulfur metabolic and glucosinolate biosynthetic genes are actively expressed in bundle sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, Clusters 1, 2, and 3 showed expression of mesophyll cell marker genes <bold>(Fig. S6C–F)</bold>, suggesting that some mesophyll cells were included during the sorting process. This result might be due to weak induction of the <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>SUC2</italic> promoters in mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Indeed, we found both genes to be expressed at low levels in mesophyll protoplasts <bold>(Fig. S11)</bold>. In summary, using snRNA-seq combined with FANS, we revealed the presence of a unique subpopulation of cells with high nuclear <italic>FT</italic> expression. In these nuclei, genes related to ATP synthesis were enriched. Moreover, we identified other phloem cell clusters enriched for genes in water transport and JA response, which were not previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we subclustered the nuclei in cluster 7, finding three subclusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Subcluster 7.2 contained the nuclei with the highest <italic>FT</italic> expression, in addition to expression of the companion cell marker genes, <italic>SUC2</italic> and <italic>AHA3</italic>. These nuclei contained fewer transcripts of the mesophyll marker genes <italic>RBCS1A</italic>, <italic>CAB3,</italic> and <italic>CAB2</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C, D</xref>), consistent with a prior scRNA-seq study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). The vascular tissue located at the distal part of true leaves, where <italic>FT</italic> is expressed highly, is developmentally old, whereas veins emerging from the bottom part of leaves are developmentally young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Thus, subcluster 7.3 may be comprised of nuclei from developmentally younger companion cells that have not fully matured yet, whereas those in subcluster 7.2 are older and have gained a stronger companion cell identity.</p>

<title>Phloem companion cells with high <italic>FT</italic> expression express other genes encoding small proteins</title>

We asked whether the cluster 7 nuclei might express other genes encoding small proteins, which could move through phloem flow. Indeed, the median number of amino acids encoded in the differentially expressed genes of cluster 7 is smaller than those in clusters 4 and 5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>Next, we asked whether some of these genes encode new systemic flowering or growth regulators. We selected eight genes, five of which were tested for overlap with <italic>FT</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>) and overexpressed each one of them using the <italic>SUC2</italic> promoter. Some of these genes were previously implicated in flowering. <italic>BFT</italic> is an <italic>FT</italic> homolog and acts as a floral repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). <italic>SENESCENCE-ASSOCIATED AND QQS-RELATED</italic> (<italic>SAQR</italic>) promotes flowering under short-day (SD) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). <italic>RAD-LIKE 4</italic> (<italic>RL4</italic>) has high homology to the <italic>RADIALIS</italic> (<italic>RAD</italic>) gene in <italic>Antirrhinum majus</italic>, whose ectopic expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> causes growth defects and late flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). We measured the flowering time of the overexpression lines in independent T1 plants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). T1 <italic>pSUC2:BFT</italic> plants grown under LD+FR conditions showed severely delayed flowering compared with <italic>pSUC2:GFP</italic> control lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This result is in stark contrast to prior results obtained under standard laboratory light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), suggesting that BFT proteins might be mobile or more functionally active under natural light conditions. None of the other transgenic lines showed noticeable changes in flowering time.</p>

<title>Motif enrichment analysis and transgenic studies identify <italic>NIGT1</italic> transcription factors as direct <italic>FT</italic> repressors</title>
<p>We performed motif enrichment analysis on the promoters of the 268 genes differentially expressed in cluster 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>), using randomly selected 3,000 genes as a control set. The most enriched motif was the motif of the NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1.2 (also known as HHO2, <italic>P</italic> = 9.3 x 10<sup>−6</sup>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>; <bold>Data S8</bold>). Although the NIGT1/HHO transcription factors (TFs) are primarily known as repressors of genes involved in nitrate uptake, constitutive expression of <italic>NIGT1.2</italic> significantly decreases <italic>FT</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In fact, there are two potential NIGT1 binding sites located within and adjacent to the <italic>shadow 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> domains (<italic>S1 and S2</italic>) in the <italic>FT</italic> regulatory region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>) (<bold>Fig. S12</bold>). These domains are highly conserved among <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> species and important for <italic>FT</italic> transcriptional regulation. Moreover, the NIGT1 binding motifs reside in close proximity to the CO binding motif (TGTGNNATG, CO-responsive element, CORE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), suggesting that NIGT1 binding could affect CO binding.</p>

<p>We performed a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) screen of 1,957 TFs against four tandem repeats of a short <italic>FT</italic> promoter sequence containing the <italic>S1</italic> and <italic>S2</italic> domains and the two NIGT1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). We found that NIGT1.1/HHO3, NIGT1.2/HHO2, NIGT1.3/HHO1, NIGT1.4/HRS1, and HHO5 specifically bind to this sequence within the <italic>FT</italic> regulatory region (<bold>Data S9</bold>). Next, we overexpressed five different <italic>NIGT1/HHO</italic> genes using the <italic>SUC2</italic> promoter. The overexpression of <italic>NIGT1.2</italic> and <italic>NIGT1.4</italic> delayed flowering, while the overexpression of <italic>NIGT1.1</italic>, <italic>NIGT1.3</italic>, and <italic>HHO5</italic> did not (data not shown). Therefore, we generated T3 lines of <italic>pSUC2:NIGT1.2</italic> and <italic>pSUC2:NIGT1.4</italic> and measured their flowering time. Under LD+FR conditions, these transgenic plants flowered significantly later than wild-type plants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). To test which genes were altered by the overexpression of <italic>NIGT1.2</italic> and <italic>NIGT1.4</italic>, we conducted RNA-seq analysis of the respective transgenic plants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). We found that genes specifically expressed in cluster 7 such as <italic>FT</italic>, <italic>BFT</italic>, and <italic>SAQR</italic> were downregulated in both the <italic>pSUC2:NIGT1.2</italic> and <italic>pSUC2:NIGT1.4</italic> lines. <italic>FLP1</italic> expression was decreased only in <italic>pSUC2:NIGT1.2</italic> lines, which might explain why <italic>pSUC2:NIGT1.2</italic> plants exhibited a more severe late flowering phenotype than <italic>pSUC2:NIGT1.4</italic> plants. Similar results were obtained with qRT-PCR analysis (<bold>Fig. S13</bold>). Consistent with our snRNA-seq data (<bold>Fig. S14</bold>), previous studies reported that <italic>NIGT1.2</italic> is expressed broadly in shoots while <italic>NIGT1.4</italic> is expressed only in roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), suggesting that <italic>NIGT1.2</italic> is the major player in <italic>FT</italic> regulation.</p>
<p>Ample nitrogen prolongs the vegetative growth stage and delays flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>); however, the detailed mechanisms of this delay remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Since <italic>NIGT1</italic> genes are induced under high nitrogen conditions, we tested the quadruple mutant of the <italic>NIGT1</italic> genes (<italic>nigtQ</italic> mutant) for <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>BFT</italic> expression with (+N) and without high nitrogen (–N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). The <italic>nigtQ</italic> plants showed enhanced <italic>FT</italic> and <italic>BFT</italic> expression compared to WT plants under +N but not –N conditions, suggesting that the NIGT1 TFs act as novel nitrate-dependent repressors of flowering (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Plants utilize seasonal information to determine the onset of flowering. One of the key mechanisms of seasonal flowering is the transcriptional regulation of the florigen <italic>FT</italic> in leaves. Our previous study revealed that <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells also produce FLP1, another small protein that may systemically promote both flowering and elongation of leaves, hypocotyls, and inflorescence stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Therefore, a more detailed characterization of <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells might identify additional components that are essential for the integration of the many environmental cues in natural environments into the precise timing of flowering and related developmental changes.

<p>In young <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants grown in LD, true leaves show <italic>FT</italic> expression in the distal and marginal parts of the leaf vasculature, while cotyledons express <italic>FT</italic> across entire veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). We used bulk RNA-seq to examine the <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells in cotyledons versus those in true leaves, using FANS-enriched nuclei. Tissue-specific differences (cotyledons vs. true leaves) in gene expression were more significant than those observed for the enriched cell populations, an unexpected result as cotyledons and true leaves are not typically treated as separate organs.</p>
<p>The true leaves but not the cotyledons of the <italic>pSUC2:NTF</italic> and <italic>pFT:NTF</italic> lines showed differences in the expression of <italic>FT</italic> negative regulators. This result suggests that <italic>FT</italic> expression is strongly repressed in most of the true leaf companion cells, contributing to the spatial expression pattern of <italic>FT</italic> observed in true leaves. In this study, we focused on the <italic>FT</italic> expression peak in the morning (ZT4) under LD+FR conditions; however, in the future, it would be interesting to investigate the expression patterns of <italic>FT</italic> regulators at the <italic>FT</italic> evening peak (ZT16), as our results suggest that there are two different mechanisms regulating each <italic>FT</italic> peak in natural long days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>

<title>A subpopulation of phloem companion cells highly expresses <italic>FT</italic> and other genes encoding small proteins</title>
<p>Our snRNA-seq identified a cluster with nuclei derived from cells with high <italic>FT</italic> expression. The cluster 7 nuclei are derived from cells that appear to be metabolically active and produce ATP, which may be used to upload sugars, solutes, and small proteins, including FT, into the phloem sieve elements. Based on subclustering analysis, <italic>FT</italic> expression levels were positively correlated with companion cell marker gene expression and negatively correlated with mesophyll cell marker gene expression. The observed shift from mesophyll to companion cell identity may represent the trajectory of companion cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>In clusters 4 and 5, we found nuclei isolated from phloem cells with high expression of aquaporin and JA-related genes, respectively. These cell populations were not identified in a previous protoplast-based scRNA-seq analysis targeting phloem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). We speculate that these cells are highly embedded in the tissue and therefore practically difficult to isolate. Orthologous studies show that JA biosynthetic genes such as <italic>LOX3/4</italic> and <italic>OPR3</italic> are highly expressed in phloem including companion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), consistent with our results.</p>
<p>Aquaporin genes such as <italic>PIP2;1</italic> and <italic>PIP2;6</italic> are thought to be highly expressed in leaf xylem parenchyma and bundle sheath tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). However, cluster 6, which contains nuclei isolated from bundle sheath and phloem parenchyma cells, showed fewer expressed aquaporin genes than the cluster 4 nuclei, which also expressed <italic>SUC2</italic>. This result might indicate that the cells active in water transport exist not only in bundle sheath or xylem parenchyma cells but also in a subpopulation of phloem cells. In summary, <italic>SUC2</italic>/<italic>FT</italic>-expressing vasculature cells consist of cell subpopulations with different functions within true leaves.</p>

<title>BFT may fine-tune the balance between flowering and growth as a systemic anti-florigen</title>
<p>The <italic>FT</italic>-expressing nuclei of cluster 7 preferentially expressed genes encoding small proteins including <italic>FLP1</italic>, <italic>BFT,</italic> and <italic>SAQR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Although a previous study reported that <italic>BFT</italic> driven by the <italic>SUC2</italic> promoter does not alter flowering time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), our result shows that overexpression of this gene delays flowering under LD+FR conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). This discrepancy is likely due to our use of growth conditions with the adjusted R/FR ratio that mimics natural light conditions, as the majority of our transgenic lines showed a similar late flowering phenotype.</p>
<p>Why do <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants produce florigen FT and anti-florigen BFT in the same cells? There is precedent for the co-expression of florigen and anti-florigen in leaves in other plants. In Chrysanthemums, a weak florigen <italic>CsFTL1</italic> and a strong anti-florigen <italic>CsAFT</italic> are both expressed in leaves in long days. Short-day conditions repress <italic>CsAFT</italic> but induce the expression of a strong florigen <italic>CsFTL3</italic> to initiate flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The balance in florigen and anti-florigen expression is also important for wild tomatoes to control flowering time, and this regulation was lost in domesticated tomatoes, resulting in day-neutral flowering behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the FT-homolog floral repressor TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) is expressed at the shoot apical meristem and competes with FT for physical interaction with FD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). In addition to preventing precocious flowering, the presence of TFL1 is crucial for the balance between flowering initiation and stem growth because FT terminates inflorescence stem growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Like FT and TFL1, BFT directly binds to FD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), suggesting that BFT’s mode of action is similar to that of TFL1. However, unlike for TFL1, loss of BFT does not affect flowering time under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The lack of a visible flowering phenotype in the <italic>bft</italic> knockout mutant might be due to the substantially lower expression of <italic>BFT</italic> compared to <italic>FT</italic> under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, the <italic>bft</italic> knockout mutant is significantly delayed in flowering under high salinity conditions where <italic>BFT</italic> gene expression is strongly induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Thus, BFT appears to act as an anti-florigen under specific growth conditions, possibly including LD+FR conditions. Given the complexity of natural environments, the existence of multiple specialized anti-florigens might facilitate signal integration and reduce noise in the onset of flowering and stem growth.</p>

<title>NIGT1 TFs contribute to the nutrient-dependency of flowering time</title>
<p>To identify potential novel transcriptional regulators of <italic>FT</italic>, we identified enriched motifs in the promoters of the 268 genes that were differentially expressed in cluster 7. This analysis indicated that NIGT1 TFs may affect the expression of <italic>FT</italic> and other genes co-expressed with <italic>FT</italic>. Using Y1H screening, we found that all NIGT1s and HHO5 can bind to the enhancer sequences derived from the <italic>FT</italic> promoter. NIGT1s are involved in nitrogen absorption as negative regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). It is well-known that nitrogen availability affects the onset of flowering; however, most of the mechanistic underpinnings remain unknown. A recent study showed that ample nitrogen availability causes phosphorylation of FLOWERING BHLH 4 (FBH4), a direct positive regulator of CO, which results in attenuation of FBH4 transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). This mechanism acts upstream of <italic>FT</italic>, whereas the NIGT1 TFs likely act as direct repressors of <italic>FT</italic>. Multiple nitrogen-dependent mechanisms acting on <italic>FT</italic> regulation might ensure the proper balance between nutrient availability and resource allocation toward developmental transitions.</p>

<p>The authors demonstrated cellular heterogeneity of companion cells (CCs) and also suggested the CC subpopulation that highly expressed the florigen gene FT. Based on this finding, they further identified flowering time regulators acting in CCs, including small proteins and NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR1 type proteins (NIGT1s). In particular, the authors propose the NIGT1-FT regulatory module, which may be involved in the response to nitrogen status. This <bold>important</bold> study advances our understanding of flowering time control at high spatial resolution. While we believe this work will be of broad interest to plant biologists, the supporting evidence remains in parts <bold>incomplete</bold>. In particular, the quality of the single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data needs to be addressed to solidify the conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors revealed the cellular heterogeneity of companion cells (CCs) and demonstrated that the florigen gene FT is highly expressed in a specific subpopulation of these CCs in Arabidopsis. Through a thorough characterization of this subpopulation, they further identified NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1 (NIGT1)-like transcription factors as potential new regulators of FT. Overall, these findings are intriguing and valuable, contributing significantly to our understanding of florigen and the photoperiodic flowering pathway. However, there is still room for improvement in the quality of the data and the depth of the analysis. I have several comments that may be beneficial for the authors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The usage of snRNA-seq to characterize the FT-expressing companion cells (CCs) is very interesting and important. Two findings are novel: 1) Expression of FT in CCs is not uniform. Only a subcluster of CCs exhibits high expression level of FT. 2) Based on consensus binding motifs enriched in this subcluster, they further identify NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1 (NIGT1)-like transcription factors as potential new regulators of FT.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Title: &quot;A florigen-expressing subpopulation of companion cells&quot;. It is a bit misleading. The conclusion here is that only a subset of companion cells exhibit high expression of FT, but this does not imply that other companion cells do not express it at all.</p>
<p>
(2) Data quality: Authors opted for fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) instead of traditional cell sorting method. What is the rationale behind this decision? Readers may wonder, especially given that RNA abundance in single nuclei is generally lower than that in single cells. This concern also applies to snRNA-seq data. Specifically, the number of genes captured was quite low, with a median of only 149 genes per nucleus. Additionally, the total number of nuclei analyzed was limited (1,173 for the pFT:NTF and 3,650 for the pSUC2:NTF). These factors suggest that the quality of the snRNA-seq data presented in this study is quite low. In this context, it becomes challenging for the reviewer to accurately assess whether this will impact the subsequent conclusions of the paper. Would it be possible to repeat this experiment and get more nuclei?</p>
<p>
(3) Another disappointment is that the authors did not utilize reporter genes to identify the specific locations of the FT-high expressing cells (cluster 7 cells) within the CC population in vivo. Are there any discernible patterns that can be observed?</p>
<p>
(4) The final disappointment is that the authors only compared FT expression between the nigtQ mutants and the wild type. Does this imply that the mutant does not have a flowering time defect particularly under high nitrogen conditions?</p>

<p>This manuscript submitted by Takagi et al. details the molecular characterization of the FT-expressing cell at a single-cell level. The authors examined what genes are expressed specifically in FT-expressing cells and other phloem companion cells by exploiting bulk nuclei and single-nuclei RNA-seq and transgenic analysis. The authors found the unique expression profile of FT-expressing cells at a single-cell level and identified new transcriptional repressors of FT such as NIGT1.2 and NIGT1.4.</p>
<p>Although previous researchers have known that FT is expressed in phloem companion cells, they have tended to neglect the molecular characterization of the FT-expressing phloem companion cells. To understand how FT, which is expressed in tiny amounts in phloem companion cells that make up a very small portion of the leaf, can be a key molecule in the regulation of the critical developmental step of floral transition, it is important to understand the molecular features of FT-expressing cells in detail. In this regard, this manuscript provides insight into the understanding of detailed molecular characteristics of the FT-expressing cell. This endeavor will contribute to the research field of flowering time.</p>
<p>Here are my comments on how to improve this manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) The most noble finding of this manuscript is the identification of NTGI1.2 as the upstream regulator of FT-expressing cluster 7 gene expression. The flowering phenotypes of the nigtQ mutant and the transgenic plants in which NIGT1.2 was expressed under the SUC2 gene promoter support that NIGT1.2 functions as a floral repressor upstream of the FT gene. Nevertheless, the expression patterns of NIGT1.2 genes do not appear to have much overlap with those of NIGT1.2-downstream genes in the cluster 7 (Figs S14 and F3). An explanation for this should be provided in the discussion section.</p>
<p>
(2) To investigate gene expression in the nuclei of specific cell populations, the authors generated transgenic plants expressing a fusion gene encoding a Nuclear Targeting Fusion protein (NTF) under the control of various cell type-specific promoters. Since the public audience would not know about NTF without reading reference 16, some explanation of NTF is necessary in the manuscript. Please provide a schematic of constructs the authors used to make the transformants.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors revealed the cellular heterogeneity of companion cells (CCs) and demonstrated that the florigen gene FT is highly expressed in a specific subpopulation of these CCs in Arabidopsis. Through a thorough characterization of this subpopulation, they further identified NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1 (NIGT1)-like transcription factors as potential new regulators of FT. Overall, these findings are intriguing and valuable, contributing significantly to our understanding of florigen and the photoperiodic flowering pathway. However, there is still room for improvement in the quality of the data and the depth of the analysis. I have several comments that may be beneficial for the authors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The usage of snRNA-seq to characterize the FT-expressing companion cells (CCs) is very interesting and important. Two findings are novel: 1) Expression of FT in CCs is not uniform. Only a subcluster of CCs exhibits high expression level of FT. 2) Based on consensus binding motifs enriched in this subcluster, they further identify NITRATE-INDUCIBLE GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR 1 (NIGT1)-like transcription factors as potential new regulators of FT.</p>

<p>We are pleased to hear that reviewer 1 noted the novelty and importance of our work. As reviewer 1 mentioned, we are also excited about the identification of a subcluster of companion cells with very high <italic>FT</italic> expression. We believe that this work is an initial step to describe the molecular characteristics of these <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells. We are also excited to share our new findings on _NIGT1_s as potential <italic>FT</italic> regulators. We think that this finding attracts broader audiences, as the molecular factor that coordinates plant nutrition status with flowering time remains largely unknown despite its well-known plant phenomenon.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Title: &quot;A florigen-expressing subpopulation of companion cells&quot;. It is a bit misleading. The conclusion here is that only a subset of companion cells exhibit high expression of FT, but this does not imply that other companion cells do not express it at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this comment, as we also did not intend to say that FT is not produced in other companion cells than the subpopulation we identified. We will revise the title to more accurately reflect the point.</p>

<p>(2) Data quality: Authors opted for fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) instead of traditional cell sorting method. What is the rationale behind this decision? Readers may wonder, especially given that RNA abundance in single nuclei is generally lower than that in single cells. This concern also applies to snRNA-seq data. Specifically, the number of genes captured was quite low, with a median of only 149 genes per nucleus. Additionally, the total number of nuclei analyzed was limited (1,173 for the pFT:NTF and 3,650 for the pSUC2:NTF). These factors suggest that the quality of the snRNA-seq data presented in this study is quite low. In this context, it becomes challenging for the reviewer to accurately assess whether this will impact the subsequent conclusions of the paper. Would it be possible to repeat this experiment and get more nuclei?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment; we noticed that we did not clearly explain the rationale of using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) instead of single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). As reviewer 1 mentioned, RNA abundance in scRNA-seq is higher than in snRNA-seq. To conduct scRNA-seq using plant cells, protoplasting is the necessary step. However, in our study, protoplasting has many drawbacks in isolating our target cells from the phloem. It is technically challenging to efficiently isolate protoplasts from highly embedded phloem companion cells from plant tissues. Usually, it requires a minimum of several hours of enzymatic incubation to protoplast companion cells and the efficiencies of protoplasting these cells are still low. For our analysis, restoring the time information within a day is also crucial. Therefore, we performed more speedy isolation method. In the revision, we will explain our rationale of choosing snRNA-seq due to the technical limitations.</p>
<p>Here, reviewer 1 raised a concern about the quality of our snRNA-seq data, referring to the relatively low readcounts per nucleus. Although we believe that shallow reads do not necessaryily indicate low quality and are confident in the accuracy of our snRNA-seq data, as supported by the detailed follow-up experiments (e.g., imaging analysis in Fig. 4B), we agree that it is important to address this point in the revision and alleviate readers’ concerns regarding the data quality.</p>

<p>(3) Another disappointment is that the authors did not utilize reporter genes to identify the specific locations of the FT-high expressing cells (cluster 7 cells) within the CC population in vivo. Are there any discernible patterns that can be observed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we previously showed only limited spatial images of overlap between <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells and other cluster 7 gene-expressing cells in Fig. 4B, this comment is understandable. To respond to it, we will include whole leaf images of <italic>FT</italic>- and cluster 7 gene-expressing cells to assess the spatial overlaps between <italic>FT</italic> and cluster 7 genes within a leaf.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The final disappointment is that the authors only compared FT expression between the nigtQ mutants and the wild type. Does this imply that the mutant does not have a flowering time defect particularly under high nitrogen conditions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To answer this question, we will include the flowering time measurement data of the <italic>nigtQ</italic> mutants grown on the soil with sufficient nitrogen sources.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript submitted by Takagi et al. details the molecular characterization of the FT-expressing cell at a single-cell level. The authors examined what genes are expressed specifically in FT-expressing cells and other phloem companion cells by exploiting bulk nuclei and single-nuclei RNA-seq and transgenic analysis. The authors found the unique expression profile of FT-expressing cells at a single-cell level and identified new transcriptional repressors of FT such as NIGT1.2 and NIGT1.4.</p>
<p>Although previous researchers have known that FT is expressed in phloem companion cells, they have tended to neglect the molecular characterization of the FT-expressing phloem companion cells. To understand how FT, which is expressed in tiny amounts in phloem companion cells that make up a very small portion of the leaf, can be a key molecule in the regulation of the critical developmental step of floral transition, it is important to understand the molecular features of FT-expressing cells in detail. In this regard, this manuscript provides insight into the understanding of detailed molecular characteristics of the FT-expressing cell. This endeavor will contribute to the research field of flowering time.</p>

<p>We are grateful that reviewer 2 recognizes the importance of transcriptome profiling of <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells at the single-cell level.</p>

<p>Here are my comments on how to improve this manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) The most noble finding of this manuscript is the identification of NTGI1.2 as the upstream regulator of FT-expressing cluster 7 gene expression. The flowering phenotypes of the nigtQ mutant and the transgenic plants in which NIGT1.2 was expressed under the SUC2 gene promoter support that NIGT1.2 functions as a floral repressor upstream of the FT gene. Nevertheless, the expression patterns of NIGT1.2 genes do not appear to have much overlap with those of NIGT1.2-downstream genes in the cluster 7 (Figs S14 and F3). An explanation for this should be provided in the discussion section.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree reviewer 2 that spatial expression patterns of <italic>NIGT1.2</italic> and cluster 7 genes do not overlap much, and some discussion should be provided in the manuscript. Although we do not have a concrete answer for this phenomenon, NIGT1.2 may suppress <italic>FT</italic> gene expression in non-cluster 7 cells to prevent the misexpression of <italic>FT</italic>. Another possible explanation is that NIGT1.2 negatively affects the formation of cluster 7 cells. If so, cells with high <italic>NIGT1.2</italic> gene expression hardly become cluster 7 cells. We will discuss it further in the discussion section in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) To investigate gene expression in the nuclei of specific cell populations, the authors generated transgenic plants expressing a fusion gene encoding a Nuclear Targeting Fusion protein (NTF) under the control of various cell type-specific promoters. Since the public audience would not know about NTF without reading reference 16, some explanation of NTF is necessary in the manuscript. Please provide a schematic of constructs the authors used to make the transformants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As reviewer 2 pointed out, we lacked a clear explanation why we used NTF in this study. NTF is the fusion protein that consists of a nuclear envelope targeting domain, GFP, and biotin acceptor peptide. It was originally designed for the INTACT (isolation of nuclei tagged in specific cell types) method that enables us to isolate bulk nuclei from specific tissues. Although our original intention was profiling the bulk transcriptome of mRNAs that exist in nuclei of the <italic>FT</italic>-expressing cells using INTACT, we utilized our <italic>NTF</italic> transgenic lines for snRNA-seq analysis. To explain what NTF is to readers, we will include a schematic diagram of NTF.</p>
