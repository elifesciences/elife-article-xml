<title>Abstract</title>
<p>How cells regulate the size of their organelles remains a fundamental question in cell biology. Cilia, with their simple structure and surface localization, provide an ideal model for investigating organelle size control. However, most studies on cilia length regulation are primarily performed on several single-celled organisms. In contrast, the mechanism of length regulation in cilia across diverse cell types within multicellular organisms remains a mystery. Similar to humans, zebrafish contain diverse types of cilia with variable lengths. Taking advantage of the transparency of zebrafish embryos, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into intraflagellar transport (IFT), an essential process for ciliogeneis. We observed IFT in multiple types of cilia with varying lengths. Remarkably, cilia exhibited variable IFT speeds in different cell types, with longer cilia exhibiting faster IFT speeds. The increased IFT speed in longer cilia was not due to changes in common factors that regulate IFT, such as motor selection, BBS proteins, or tubulin modification. Instead, longer cilia can organize larger IFT particles for faster transportation. Reducing the size of IFT particles can slow down IFT speed, resulting in shorter cilia. Our study presents an intriguing model of cilia length regulation via controlling IFT speed through the modulation of the size of the IFT complex. This discovery may provide further insights into our understanding of how organelle size is regulated in higher vertebrates.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Understanding how cells regulate the size of their organelles is a fundamental question in cell biology. However, the three-dimensional complexity of most organelles poses challenges for accurate measurement, and thus, the underlying regulation mechanisms remain largely elusive. In contrast to the localization of most organelles within cells, cilia (also known as flagellar) are microtubule-based structures that extend from the cell surface, facilitating a more straightforward quantification of their size. Cilia are highly conserved organelles found across various organisms, ranging from protozoa to humans. Their formation relies on microtubules, and their size can be easily measured by their length, making cilia an ideal model for studying size regulation of sub-cellular organelles within the same organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chan and Marshall, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Cilia play a crucial role in regulating various physiological and biochemical processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nachury and Mick, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Singla and Reiter, 2006</xref>). Structural or functional abnormalities of this organelle can result a wide range of human genetic disorders, including retinal degeneration, polycystic kidneys, and mental retardation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mill et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Song et al., 2016</xref>). The assembly and maintenance of cilia rely on an elaborate process known as intraflagellar transport (IFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>). The IFT complex is located between the doublet microtubules of the cilia and the ciliary membrane, playing a vital role as a mediator of cargo transportation within cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Hesketh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Meleppattu et al., 2022</xref>). The IFT complex consists of two subcomplexes: the IFT-B complex, which transports the precursors required for cilia assembly from the base to the tip, powered by Kinesin-2; and the IFT-A complex, which transports axonemal turnover products back to the cell body by binding to dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kardon and Vale, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ou et al., 2007</xref>; Scholey and J., 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Taschner et al., 2012</xref>). Electron microscopy studies have suggested that multiple IFT particles move together along the axoneme, earning the name âIFT trainsâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Jordan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Stepanek and Pigino, 2016</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, both the slow-speed heterotrimeric kinesin II and the fast-speed homodimeric kinesin OSM-3 coordinate IFT, ensuring the assembly of sensory cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Snow et al., 2004</xref>). The IFT system also interacts with the BBSome complex, dysfunction of which is associated with the human ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome. The BBSome complex is moved by IFT and functions to maintain the physical connection between IFT-A and IFT-B subcomplexes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ou et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, the BBSome is involved in diverse functions, including protein trafficking into and out of the cilia. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Berbari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Jin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Lechtreck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Ye et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The intraflagellar transport system plays a crucial role in ciliogenesis and is highly conserved across various organisms. Interestingly, the length of cilia exhibits significant diversity in different models. For example, <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> has two flagella with lengths ranging from 10 to 14 Î¼m, while sensory cilia in <italic>C. elegans</italic> vary from approximately 1.5 Î¼m to 7.5 Î¼m. In most mammalian cells, the primary cilium typically measures between 3 and 10 Î¼m. Considering the conserved structure of cilia, it becomes intriguing to understand how their length is regulated in different cell types. Extensive research into flagellar length regulation has been conducted in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. After one or two flagella are abscised, the shorter flagella can regenerate to their original length. During this regeneration process, the short flagella undergo a rapid growth phase, transitioning to a slower elongation phase as they approach their steady-state length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Rosenbaum et al., 1969</xref>). IFT plays a central role in mediating flagellar regeneration and IFT particles usually assemble into âlongâ and âshortâ trains within the flagella. At the onset of flagellar growth, long trains are prevalent, while the number of short trains gradually increases as the flagellum elongates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Engel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Vannuccini et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, the rate at which IFT trains enter the flagella, known as the IFT injection rate, is negatively correlated with flagellar length during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Engel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ludington et al., 2013</xref>). Researchers have proposed and tested several theoretical models to explain the regulatory mechanism of the IFT injection rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ishikawa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Marshall, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wemmer et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, recent studies in the parasitic protist Giardia, which possesses eight flagella of varying lengths, revealed that the ciliary tip localization of microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin-13 is inversely correlated with flagellar length, similar to its role in flagellar length regulation (McInally et al., 2019; Piao et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013). These findings add another layer of complexity to our understanding of ciliary length regulation and underscore the importance of investigating diverse model organisms to gain comprehensive insights into this fundamental biological process.</p>
<p>Notably, most studies on ciliary length control have focused on single-celled organisms. However, in vertebrates, the presence of highly diverse cell types results in cilia of varying lengths. Understanding how cilia length is regulated in different cell types and why such diversity exists is essential for comprehending the pathogenic mechanisms underlying various organ defects seen in ciliopathies. Unfortunately, direct observation of intraflagellar transport (IFT) in living vertebrates has posed challenges, limiting our knowledge in this area.</p>
<p>In this study, we capitalized on the benefits of embryonic transparency in zebrafish to explore dynamic IFT in various types of cilia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of IFT investigation in multiple organs within a living organism. Our findings revealed a positive correlation between the speed of IFT transport and cilia length. Furthermore, ultra-high-resolution microscopy showed a close association between cilia length in different organs and the size of IFT fluorescent particles, indicating the presence of larger IFT trains in longer cilia. This observation suggests that cargo and motor proteins are more effectively coordinated in transporting materials, resulting in increased IFT velocityâa novel regulatory mechanism governing IFT speed in vertebrate cilia.</p>

<title>Zebrafish provide an ideal model to compare ciliogenesis in different organs</title>
<p>Similar to humans, cilia are widely present in various organs in zebrafish. Utilizing an Arl13b-GFP transgene under the control of the beta-actin promoter, we can observe cilia in live embryos within organs such as Kupfferâs vesicle, ear, lateral line, spinal cord, and skin. Cilia in the pronephric duct, olfactory pit, photoreceptor cells, and sperms can be visualized through antibody staining with acetylated-tubulin. Notably, the number and length of cilia exhibit significant variation across different tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). While most cells contain a single cilium, certain specialized cell types, including olfactory epithelia and pronephric duct, form multiple cilia. In adult zebrafish, multiciliated cells can also be found in the brain ventricles (ependymal cells) and ovary(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ogino et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, zebrafish provides an ideal model for investigating ciliogenesis in diverse cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Song et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Rescue of <italic>ovl</italic> (<italic>ift88</italic>) mutants with <italic>Tg(hsp70l:ift88-GFP)</italic> transgene</title>
<p>To visualize IFT in zebrafish, we first generated a stable transgenic line, <italic>Tg(hsp70l:ift88-GFP)</italic>, which expresses a fusion protein of Ift88 and GFP under the control of the heat shock promoter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Ift88 plays a crucial role as a component of the IFT complex in maintaining ciliogenesis. Zebrafish <italic>ovl</italic> mutants exhibited body curvature defects and typically do not survive beyond 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Tsujikawa and Malicki, 2004</xref>). By performing a daily heat shock starting from 48 hours post-fertilization (hpf), we observed that the body curvature defects were completely rescued at 5dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B, C</xref>). Furthermore, we assessed ciliogenesis defects in these mutants. At 5 dpf, cilia were absent in most tissues of the <italic>ovl</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). In contrast, this transgene effectively rescued ciliogenesis defects in all examined tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A</xref>). Interestingly, the GFP fluorescence of the transgene was prominently enriched in the cilia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Additionally, we conducted continuous heat shock experiments, which showed that <italic>ovl</italic> mutants carrying this transgene were able to survive to adulthood (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that Ift88-GFP can substitute for endogenous Ift88 in promoting ciliogenesis.</p>

<title>Visualization of IFT in different cilia</title>
<p>The enrichment of Ift88-GFP within cilia implies that the <italic>Tg(hsp70l: ift88-GFP)</italic> transgene could serve as a valuable tool for real-time observation of IFT movement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Despite cilia typically being situated in the deep regions of the body, we managed to detect the movement of GFP fluorescence particles using a high-sensitive spinning-disc microscope. First, we focused on ear cristae hair cell cilia which are longer and easy to detect. We succeeded in the direct visualization of the movement of fluorescent particles in these cilia (Movie S1). Kymograph analysis revealed bidirectional movement of the Ift88-GFP particles along the cilia axoneme (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), akin to IFT movements observed in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Orozco et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, we also captured the dynamic movement of these Ift88-GFP particles in various cilia, including those of neuromasts, pronephric duct, spinal cord, and skin epidermal cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B-E</xref>, Movies S2-5). These movies provide a great opportunity to compare IFT across different cilia.</p>

<title>Correlation between IFT speed and ciliary length</title>
<p>To characterize the dynamics of IFT, we quantified their movement speed using kymographs generated from recorded movies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F, G</xref>). Within each type of cilia, the retrograde IFT showed higher speed compared to anterograde transport, consistent with previous findings in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where dynein motors were found to move faster than Kinesin motors. Surprisingly, we observed significant variability in IFT velocities among different cilia. In ear crista cilia, the average speed of anterograde IFT was 0.68 Î¼m/s, while in the cilia of neuromast hair cells, it decreased to 0.54 Î¼m/s. In skin epidermal cilia and spinal canal cilia, the transport rates were further reduced to 0.42 Î¼m/s and 0.33 Î¼m/s, respectively. The pronephric duct cilia showed intermediate average anterograde IFT rates at 0.46 Î¼m/s. Similarly, retrograde transport also displayed considerable variability, with ear crista and neuromast cilia exhibiting the highest speeds (1.55 Î¼m/s and 1.47 Î¼m/s, respectively). In contrast, cilia in the spinal canal showed the slowest IFT, with an average speed of 0.35 Î¼m/s, which was less than one fourth of the speed observed in ear crista cilia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>).</p>
<p>Both anterograde and retrograde IFT displayed remarkably high transport speeds in ear crista and neuromast cilia. Intriguingly, we observed that these cilia were particularly longer compared to others. To investigate this correlation further, we compared ciliary length in different tissues and discovered a strong correlation between cilia length and IFT speeds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H, I</xref>). Specifically, longer cilia demonstrated faster IFT rates in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. Interestingly, longer cilia also have a higher frequency of fluorescent particles entering cilia (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3J</xref>). These findings establish a compelling link between ciliary length and IFT speeds, suggesting a potential functional significance. To validate this relationship further, we created an additional transgenic line, <italic>Tg(Î²actin2: tdTomato-ift43),</italic> which allowed us to label Ift43, a constituent of the IFT-A complex. Through the analysis of Ift43 transport in this transgenic line, we reaffirmed that the tdTomato-Ift43 fluorescence particles also exhibited the highest transport speeds in ear crista cilia (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>IFT in the absence of Kif17 or Bbs proteins</title>
<p>To understand the potential mechanisms underlying the variation in IFT speeds among different cilia, we initially focused on differences in motor proteins. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the homodimeric kinesin-2, OSM-3, drives the IFT complex at a relatively higher speed compared to the heterotrimeric Kinesin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ou et al., 2005</xref>). We examined IFT in <italic>kif17</italic> mutants, which carry a mutation of the fast homodimeric kinesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, in the absence of Kif17, the IFT speeds remained similar to those of control larvae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A, B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>, Movie S6, Table S1). Similarly, the IFT maintained regular speed in the absence of Kif3b in the ear crista(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A, B</xref>, Movie S7, Table S1), possibly due to the redundant function of Kif3c in the heterotrimeric Kinesin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, we assessed IFT in the <italic>bbs4</italic> mutants, which has been proposed to affect the connection between the two IFT subunits in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Once again, the Bbs4 mutation had little effect on IFT motility (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A, B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3</xref>, Movie S8, Table S1). Thus, these data suggest that the variability in IFT speeds among different cilia cannot be attributed to the use of different motor proteins or the involvement of the BBSome complex.</p>

<title>Tubulin modifications, ATP concentration and IFT</title>
<p>IFT was driven by kinesin or dynein motor proteins along the ciliary axoneme. The post-translational modifications of axonemal tubulins can affect the interaction between microtubules and motor proteins, thereby regulating their dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Hong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Janke and Bulinski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">OâHagan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sirajuddin et al., 2014</xref>). Next, we asked whether tubulin modifications can affect IFT in zebrafish. Ttll3 is a tubulin glycylase that are involved in the glycylation modification of ciliary tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wloga et al., 2009</xref>). We generated zebrafish <italic>ttll3</italic> mutants and identified a mutant allele with an 8bp insertion, which causes frameshift, resulting in a significantly truncated Ttll3 protein without TTL domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,D</xref>). Immunostaining with anti-monoglycylated or polyglycylated tubulin antibody revealed that the glycylation modification was completely eliminated in all the cilia investigated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4</xref>). Surprisingly, there are no obviously defects in the number and length of cilia in the mutants. The velocity of IFT within different cilia was also seems unchanged (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>, Movie S9, Table S1). Moreover, the mutants were able to survive to adulthood and there is no difference in the fertility or sperm motility between mutants and control siblings, which is slightly different to those observed in mouse mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Gadadhar et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether polyglutamylation of axonemal tubulins can regulate IFT movement in zebrafish. First, we knocked down the expression of <italic>ttll6</italic>, which has been shown early to reduce tubulin glutamylation and resulted in body curvature in zebrafish (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A, B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Pathak et al., 2011</xref>). The efficiency of <italic>ttll6</italic> morpholinos was confirmed via RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR), which showed the splicing error of intron 12 when introduced the morpholinos (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C, D</xref>). Interestingly, we observed only minor differences in IFT velocity between <italic>ttll6</italic> morphants and control groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>, Table S1). Similarly, the IFT speeds also exhibited only slightly changes in <italic>ccp5</italic> morphants, which decreased the deglutamylase activities of Ccp5 and resulted in a hyper-glutamylated tubulin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5E-H</xref>, Table S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these results suggest that tubulin codes may play relatively minor roles on IFT in zebrafish. Considering the big difference in the IFT speed among different cilia, we think it is very unlikely such difference is caused by different levels of tubulin modification.</p>
<p>The movement of kinesin and dynein motors relies on the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis. In vitro studies using molecular force clamp techniques have shown that increasing ATP concentration significantly enhances the speed of kinesin during cargo loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Visscher et al., 1999</xref>). We further examined whether the difference of IFT speeds was caused by variation of ATP concentration inside cilia. We generated an ATP reporter line, <italic>Tg (Î²actin2: arl13b-mRuby-iATPSnFR<sup>1.0</sup>)</italic>, which contains a ciliary localized ATP sensor, mRuby-iATPSnFR<sup>1.0</sup> driven by b-actin2 promotor (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A-B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lobas et al., 2019</xref>). This ATP sensor utilizes relative fluorescence intensity to indicate the concentration of ATP. By measuring the ratio of mRuby red fluorescence to green fluorescence in the longer crista and shorter epidermal cilia, we compared relative ATP levels between these two types of cilia. Again, we found no difference in the ATP concentration between crista and epidermal cilia, suggesting that variation of ATP concentration was unlikely to be the cause of different IFT speed (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>).</p>

<title>Larger IFT particles in longer cilia</title>
<p>Finally, we aim to investigate the size of IFT particles within different type of cilia. In the flagellar of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, IFT particles are usually transported as IFT trains, consisting of multiple IFT-A and IFT-B repeating subcomplexes and the kinesin-2 and IFT dynein motors. However, with current technique, it is unfeasible to distinguish the size of IFT trains on different type of cilia through ultra-structure electron microscopy in zebrafish. Instead, we sought to compare the size of the fluorescence particles using STED ultra-high-resolution microscopy. With this method, we were able to identify single IFT fluorescence particles with relatively high resolution. Compared with regular spinning disk data, the number of IFT fluorescence particles was significantly increased in the cilia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A, B</xref>). When comparing the size of these fluorescence particles, we found that the particle sizes were significantly larger in the longer crista cilia than those of the shorter spinal cord cilia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further test whether the higher IFT velocity was associated with large IFT particles in the crista cilia, we performed morpholino based knockdown analysis. Injection of <italic>ift88</italic> morpholino caused body curvature due to ciliogenesis defects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). When injecting lower dose of <italic>ift88</italic> morpholino, we found zebrafish embryos can still maintain grossly normal body axis, while cilia in ear crista became significantly shorter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D, E, I</xref>). Due to partial loss of Ift88 proteins, the number of IFT complex decreased significantly as suggested by the reduced number of IFT fluorescence particles in the morphant cilia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F, G</xref>). Noticeably, the size of the fluorescent particles also decreased significantly, implying a potentially reduced length of the IFT trains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F, H</xref>). Strikingly, we found the IFT speed also decreased significantly in the shorter cilia (1.55 Î¼m/s in control vs 1.18 Î¼m/s in morphants) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5I, J</xref>, Movie S10). Taken together, these data strongly suggested that the size of IFT fluorescence particles is closely related to IFT speed and longer cilia are prone to contain larger IFT particles than shorter cilia.</p>

<title>A hypothetical model of cilia length regulation in zebrafish</title>
<p>With its diverse array of cilia types, zebrafish provide an exceptional model for investigating the intricate mechanisms underlying ciliary length regulation. By creating a transgenic line that expresses ciliary-targeted IFT proteins, we have demonstrated a positive correlation between IFT transport speed and the length of cilia. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first instance of comparing IFT transport in cilia from different types of organs within the same organism. Interestingly, certain conventional factors known to govern IFT transport regulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> or <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> appear to exert limited influence in zebrafish. Firstly, IFT transport speed showed no discernible connection to ciliary motility, as evidenced by the comparable IFT speeds observed in both motile spinal cord cilia and primary cilia of the skinâs epidermal cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Furthermore, the accelerated IFT transport cannot be attributed to distinct motor utilization, BBS proteins, or tubulin modifications, all of which have been suggested to regulate IFT transport in worms. Surprisingly, tubulin glycylation is not only non-essential for IFT transport but also dispensable for zebrafish development, as zebrafish <italic>ttll3</italic> mutants are viable and fertile. Collectively, these results suggest that the regulation of IFT velocity in zebrafish cilia differs from that observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, thereby highlighting the intricate complexity of IFT regulation across various organisms.</p>
<p>Remarkably, our studies revealed that the IFT fluorescence particles were significantly larger in longer crista cilia than those of shorter cilia. The IFT complex typically travels as trains, with multiple repeating IFT units being transported simultaneously. The increased size of the fluorescence particles implies that longer cilia might form larger IFT trains for more effective cargo transportation. Decreasing the quantity of IFT88 proteins could diminish the likelihood of IFT complex assembly, consequently leading to a reduction in the size of IFT trains. Importantly, the size of IFT particles was significantly reduced in <italic>ift88</italic> morphants, concurrent with the decreased transport speed of IFT. Thus, our data support a length control model for cilia that operates through the modulation of IFT train size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5K</xref>). Within longer cilia, the IFT complex appears predisposed to form lengthier repeating units, thereby creating an optimal platform for efficient transport. This environment enhances the coordination between cargos and motor proteins, resulting in an improved transportation speed. This orchestration potentially involves the synchronization of motor proteins, ensuring their precise functionality and directional alignment during transportâa concept supported by various models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Stukalin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, insights from the cryo-EM structure of intraflagellar transport trains have suggested that each dynein motor protein might propel multiple IFT complexes. For instance, the ratio of dynein: IFT-B: IFT-A in the flagella of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> is approximately 2:8:4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Jordan et al., 2018</xref>). It remains plausible that longer cilia in vertebrates could recruit a higher ratio of motor proteins to execute IFT, thus intensifying the driving force for cargo transport. The mechanisms behind achieving these conditions may require further investigation.</p>

<p>For crista cilia imaging, zebrafish larvae were anesthetized with 0.01% Tricaine in E3 water and then embedded in 1.25% low melting point agarose on a confocal dish. When imaging cilia in neuromast, epidermal cells, spinal cord, or pronephric duct epithelial cells, the embryos were anesthetized and placed on a confocal dish. Excess water was carefully removed, and a circular cover glass was then placed over the sample for imaging. IFT movements in crista cilia and neuromast were recorded using an Olympus IX83 microscope equipped with a 60X, 1.3 NA objective lens, an EMCCD camera (iXon+ DU-897D-C00-#BV-500; Andor Technology), and a spinning disk confocal scan head (CSU-X1 Spinning Disk Unit; Yokogawa Electric Corporation).

<p>Among the many challenges in the cilia field, is the question of how multicellular organisms assemble a variety of structurally and functionally specialized cilia, including cilia of different lengths. This study addresses the important question of how ciliary length differences are established in vertebrates. Specifically, the authors analyzed the role of intraflagellar transport (IFT) in ciliary length regulation in zebrafish, exploiting the transparency of the embryos. Zebrafish possess functionally specialized motile and non-motile cilia in a variety of tissues. Expression of GFP-tagged IFT88, a component of the IFT-B subcomplex, in a corresponding mutant, allowed the authors to image IFT in five distinct types of cilia. They note that IFT moves faster in longer cilia. Tagging and imaging of the IFT-A protein IFT43 further support this observation. IFT speed was largely unaffected in knock-out and morphants targeting the BBSome, various kinesin-2 motors, and the posttranslational modifications of tubulin polyglycylation and polyglutamylation. Using high-resolution STED imaging, the authors observe that IFT signals (likely, corresponding to IFT trains) are smaller in the shorter spinal cord cilia compared to the long cristae cilia. Based on these observations, the authors test the hypothesis that larger IFT trains recruit more motors or coordinate the motors better, resulting in faster trains, and causing cilia to be longer. This is further tested using partial knock-down of IFT88-GFP, which resulted in shorter crista cilia, reduced IFT particle number, size, and velocity. Some parts of the manuscript show &quot;negative&quot; data (e.g., ciliary length and IFT are not affected by the loss of BBS4) but these add beautifully to the overall story and allow for additional conclusions such as the minor role of ttll3 and ccp knockouts on ciliary length in this model. This is an excellent study, which documents IFT in a vertebrate species and explores its regulation. The data are of high quality and support most of the conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) The main hypothesis/conclusion is summarized in the abstract: &quot;Our study presents an intriguing model of cilia length regulation via controlling IFT speed through the modulation of the size of the IFT complex.&quot; The data clearly document the remarkable correlation between IFT velocity and ciliary length in the different cells/tissues/organs analyzed. The experimental test of this idea, i.e., the knock-down of GFP-IFT88, further supports the conclusion but needs to be interpreted more carefully. While IFT particle size and train velocity were reduced in the IFT88 morphants, the number of IFT particles is even more decreased. Thus, the contributions of the reduction in train size and velocity to ciliary length are, in my opinion, not unambiguous. Also, the concept that larger trains move faster, likely because they dock more motors and/or better coordinating kinesin-2 and that faster IFT causes cilia to be loner, is to my knowledge, not further supported by observations in other systems (see below).</p>
<p>(2) I think the manuscript would be strengthened if the IFT frequency would also be analyzed in the five types of cilia. This could be done based on the existing kymographs from the spinning disk videos. As mentioned above, transport frequency in addition to train size and velocity is an important part of estimating the total number of IFT particles, which bind the actual cargoes, entering/moving in cilia.</p>
<p>(3) Here, the variation in IFT velocity in cilia of different lengths within one species is documented - the results document a remarkable correlation between IFT velocity and ciliary length. These data need to be compared to observations from the literature. For example, the velocity of IFT in the quite long (~ 100 um) olfactory cilia of mice is similar to that observed in the rather short cilia of fibroblasts (~0.6 um/s). In Chlamydomonas, IFT velocity is not different in long flagella mutants compared to controls. Probably data are also available for C. elegans or other systems. Discussing these data would provide a broader perspective on the applicability of the model outside of zebrafish.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors study intraflagellar transport (IFT) in cilia of diverse organs in zebrafish. They elucidate that IFT88-GFP (an IFT-B core complex protein) can substitute for endogenous IFT88 in promoting ciliogenesis and use it as a reporter to visualize IFT dynamics in living zebrafish embryos. They observe striking differences in cilia lengths and velocity of IFT trains in different cilia types, with smaller cilia lengths correlating with lower IFT speed. They generate several mutants and show that disrupting the function of different kinesin-2 motors and BBSome or altering post-translational modifications of tubulin does not have a significant impact on IFT velocity. They however observe that when the amount of IFT88 is reduced it impacts the cilia length, IFT velocity as well as the number and size of IFT trains. They also show that the IFT train size is slightly smaller in one of the organs with shorter cilia (spinal cord). Based on their observations they propose that IFT velocity determines cilia length and go one step further to propose that IFT velocity is regulated by the size of IFT trains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main highlight of this study is the direct visualization of IFT dynamics in multiple organs of a living complex multi-cellular organism, zebrafish. The quality of the imaging is really good. Further, the authors have developed phenomenal resources to study IFT in zebrafish which would allow us to explore several mechanisms involved in IFT regulation in future studies. They make some interesting findings in mutants with disrupted function of kinesin-2, BBSome, and tubulin modifying enzymes which are interesting to compare with cilia studies in other model organisms. Also, their observation of a possible link between cilia length and IFT speed is potentially fascinating.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript as it stands, has several issues.</p>
<p>(1) The study does not provide a qualitative description of cilia organization in different cell types, the cilia length variation within the same organ, and IFT dynamics. The methodology is also described minimally and must be detailed with more care such that similar studies can be done in other laboratories.</p>
<p>(2) They provide remarkable new observations for all the mutants. However, discussion regarding what the findings imply and how these observations align (or contradict) with what has been observed in cilia studies in other organisms is incomprehensive.</p>
<p>(3) The analysis of IFT velocities, the main parameter they compare between experiments, is not described at all. The IFT velocities appear variable in several kymographs (and movies) and are visually difficult to see in shorter cilia. It is unclear how they make sure that the velocity readout is robust. Perhaps, a more automated approach is necessary to obtain more precise velocity estimates.</p>
<p>(4) They claim that IFT speeds are determined by the size of IFT trains, based on their observations in samples with a reduced amount of IFT88. If this was indeed the case, the velocity of a brighter IFT train (larger train) would be higher than the velocity of a dimmer IFT train (smaller train) within the same cilia. This is not apparent from the movies and such a correlation should be verified to make their claim stronger.</p>
<p>(5) They make an even larger claim that the cilia length (and IFT velocity) in different organs is different due to differences in the sizes of IFT trains. This is based on a marginal difference they observe between the cilia of crista and the spinal cord in immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 5C). Inferring that this minor difference is key to the striking difference in cilia length and IFT velocity is incorrect in my opinion.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>Overall, I think this work develops an exciting new multicellular model organism to study IFT mechanisms. Zebrafish is a vertebrate where we can perform genetic modifications with relative ease. This could be an ideal model to study not just the role of IFT in connection with ciliary function but also ciliopathies. Further, from an evolutionary perspective, it is fascinating to compare IFT mechanisms in zebrafish with unicellular protists like Chlamydomonas, simple multicellular organisms like C elegans, and primary mammalian cell cultures. Having said that, the underlying storyline of this study is flawed in my opinion and I would recommend the authors to report the striking findings and methodology in more detail while significantly toning down their proposed hypothesis on ciliary length regulation. Given the technological advancements made in this study, I think it is fine if it is a descriptive manuscript and doesn't necessarily need a breakthrough hypothesis based on preliminary evidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A known feature of cilia in vertebrates and many, if not all, invertebrates is the striking heterogeneity of their lengths among different cell types. The underlying mechanisms, however, remain largely elusive. In the manuscript, the authors addressed this question from the angle of intraflagellar transport (IFT), a cilia-specific bidirectional transportation machinery essential to biogenesis, homeostasis, and functions of cilia, by using zebrafish as a model organism. They conducted a series of experiments and proposed an interesting mechanism. Furthermore, they achieved in situ live imaging of IFT in zebrafish larvae, which is a technical advance in the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors initially demonstrated that ectopically expressed Ift88-GFP through a certain heat-shock induction protocol fully sustained the normal development of mutant zebrafish that would otherwise be dead by 7 dpf due to the lack of this critical component of IFT-B complex. Accordingly, cilia formations were also fully restored in the tissues examined. By imaging the IFT using Ift88-GFP in the mutant fish as a marker, they unexpectedly found that both anterograde and retrograde velocities of IFT trains varied among cilia of different cell types and appeared to be positively correlated with the length of the cilia.</p>
<p>For insights into the possible cause(s) of the heterogeneity in IFT velocities, the authors assessed the effects of IFT kinesin Kif3b and Kif17, BBSome, and glycylation or glutamylation of axonemal tubulin on IFT and excluded their contributions. They also used a cilia-localized ATP reporter to exclude the possibility of different ciliary ATP concentrations. When they compared the size of Ift88-GFP puncta in crista cilia, which are long, and spinal cord cilia, which are relatively short, by imaging with a cutting-edge super-resolution microscope, they noticed a positive correlation between the puncta size, which presumably reflected the size of IFT trains, and the length of the cilia.</p>
<p>Finally, they investigated whether it is the size of IFT trains that dictates the ciliary length. They injected a low dose (0.5 ng/embryo) of ift88 MO and showed that, although such a dosage did not induce the body curvature of the zebrafish larvae, crista cilia were shorter and contained less Ift88-GFP puncta. The particle size was also reduced. These data collectively suggested mildly downregulated expression levels of Ift88-GFP. Surprisingly, they observed significant reductions in both retrograde and anterograde IFT velocities. Therefore, they proposed that longer IFT trains would facilitate faster IFT and result in longer cilia.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The current manuscript, however, contains serious flaws that markedly limit the credibility of major results and findings. Firstly, important experimental information is frequently missing, including (but not limited to) developmental stages of zebrafish larvae assayed (Figures 1, 3, and 5), how the embryos or larvae were treated to express Ift88-GFP (Figures 3-5), and descriptions on sample sizes and the number of independent experiments or larvae examined in statistical results (Figures 3-5, S3, S6). For instance, although Figure 1B appears to be the standard experimental scheme, the authors provided results from 30-hpf larvae (Figure 3) that, according to Figure 1B, are supposed to neither express Ift88-GFP nor be genotyped because both the first round of heat shock treatment and the genotyping were arranged at 48 hpf. Similarly, the results that ovl larvae containing Tg(hsp70l:ift88 GFP) (again, because the genotype is not disclosed in the manuscript, one can only deduce) display normal body curvature at 2 dpf after the injection of 0.5 ng of ift88 MO (Fig 5D) is quite confusing because the larvae should also have been negative for Ift88-GFP and thus displayed body curvature. Secondly, some inferences are more or less logically flawed. The authors tend to use negative results on specific assays to exclude all possibilities. For instance, the negative results in Figures 4A-B are not sufficient to &quot;suggest that the variability in IFT speeds among different cilia cannot be attributed to the use of different motor proteins&quot; because the authors have not checked dynein-2 and other IFT kinesins. In fact, in their previous publication (Zhao et al., 2012), the authors actually demonstrated that different IFT kinesins have different effects on ciliogenesis and ciliary length in different tissues. Furthermore, instead of also examining cilia affected by Kif3b or Kif17 mutation, they only examined crista cilia, which are not sensitive to the mutations. Similarly, their results in Figures 4C-G only excluded the importance of tubulin glycylation or glutamylation in IFT. Thirdly, the conclusive model is based on certain assumptions, e.g., constant IFT velocities in a given cell type. The authors, however, do not discuss other possibilities.</p>
