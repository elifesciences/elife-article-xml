<title>Abstract</title><p>The UFD-1 (ubiquitin fusion degradation 1)-NPL-4 (nuclear protein localization homolog 4) heterodimer is involved in extracting ubiquitinated proteins from several plasma membrane locations, including the endoplasmic reticulum. This heterodimer complex helps in the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins via the proteasome with the help of the AAA+ ATPase CDC-48. While the ubiquitin-proteasome system is known to have important roles in maintaining innate immune responses, the role of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in regulating immunity remains elusive. In this study, we investigate the role of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in maintaining <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> innate immune responses. Inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex activates an aberrant immune response that reduces the survival of the wild-type worms on the pathogenic bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> despite diminishing colonization of the gut with the bacterium. This aberrant immune response improves the survival of severely immunocompromised worms on pathogenic bacteria but is detrimental on nonpathogenic bacteria. Transcriptomics studies reveal that the GATA transcription factor ELT-2 mediates the aberrant immune response upon inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex. Collectively, our findings show that inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex triggers an aberrant immune response that is detrimental to immunocompetent worms under infection conditions but can be advantageous for immunocompromised worms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Maintenance of a healthy proteome involves the degradation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Vilchez et al., 2014</xref>). Proteasomes are a major site for the degradation of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Clague and Urbe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ding and Yin, 2008</xref>). Proteins are tagged for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitin through a series of enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dikic, 2017</xref>). In addition to the proteasomal degradation of proteins, ubiquitination controls a vast array of cellular signals and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Husnjak and Dikic, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mukhopadhyay and Riezman, 2007</xref>). The ubiquitination pathways also have important roles in innate immunity regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The host ubiquitination pathways are involved in the targeting of bacterial proteins, lipopolysaccharides, and bacteria-containing vacuoles, resulting in selective macroautophagy or xenophagy of bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Haldar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Otten et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tripathi-Giesgen et al., 2021</xref>). Because of the important roles of ubiquitination in host defenses, bacterial pathogens have evolved multiple strategies to target the host ubiquitination pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bomberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Herhaus and Dikic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ribet and Cossart, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that inhibition of the ubiquitination pathways would activate immune responses via compensatory mechanisms.</p>
<p>The proteasomal degradation requires ubiquitin-tagged proteins to be unfolded and extracted from macromolecular complexes (Boom and Meyer, 2018). CDC-48 (VCP/p97 in vertebrates) is a highly conserved AAA+ ATPase that uses its protein unfoldase activity to extract a variety of ubiquitinated polypeptides from membranes or macromolecular complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bodnar and Rapoport, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). CDC-48 uses different cofactor proteins to recognize its client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). The UFD-1 (ubiquitin fusion degradation 1)-NPL-4 (nuclear protein localization homolog 4) heterodimer is a CDC-48 cofactor that is involved in the extraction of misfolded and ubiquitinated proteins from several plasma membrane locations, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Meyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wolf and Stolz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ye et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex is critical for the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wu and Rapoport, 2018</xref>). In addition to ERAD, the ER has evolved other strategies to deal with misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Singh, 2023</xref>), including a series of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways that enhance the folding capacity of the ER by synthesis of molecular chaperones and reduction of protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hetz et al., 2015</xref>). The ER-UPR pathways are required for an optimum immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Engel and Barton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Richardson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sun et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the role of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex, which is required for ERAD, in regulating immune responses remains poorly explored. Because ubiquitin-dependent pathways have important roles in immunity, it will be interesting to explore the role of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in regulating immune responses.</p>
<p>In this study, we showed that the inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex results in the activation of an aberrant immune response in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The wild-type worms had a significant reduction in survival on the pathogenic bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> despite having diminished colonization of the gut with the bacterium. Inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex also led to diminished bacterial colonization in mutants of ER-UPR and immunity pathways. The diminished bacterial colonization improved the survival of severely immunocompromised mutants on pathogenic bacteria. However, on nonpathogenic bacteria, on which the severely immunocompromised mutants exhibit a normal lifespan, inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex resulted in a significant reduction in lifespan.</p>
<p>Transcriptomic studies revealed that inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex resulted in the activation of the intracellular pathogen response. Analysis for transcription factor enrichment for upregulated genes identified that the GATA transcription factor ELT-2 mediated the aberrant immune response upon inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex. Thus, our studies demonstrated that inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex triggers an aberrant immune response that is detrimental to immunocompetent worms under infection conditions but can be advantageous for immunocompromised worms.</p>

<p>To explore the role of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex in the innate immune response of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we knocked down <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> by RNA interference (RNAi) and studied the survival of the worms on the pathogenic bacterium <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14.

<p>Mutants that have reduced lifespan but improved immunity have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Amrit et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Otarigho and Aballay, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ren and Ambros, 2015</xref>). Moreover, immunocompromised animals such as mutants of the MAP kinase pathway mediated by NSY-1/SEK-1/PMK-1 have a normal lifespan despite having significantly reduced survival on pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liberati et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we explored the mechanisms that led to the reduced survival of <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown animals on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Colonization of the gut with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a major determinant of infection and survival of <italic>C. elegans</italic> under slow-killing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Das et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tan et al., 1999</xref>). Because knockdown of <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> reduced survival on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we asked whether the animals had enhanced colonization of the gut with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> after <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> RNAi. Surprisingly, we observed that <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown resulted in reduced colonization of the gut with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). To validate further, we performed the colony-forming unit assay (CFU) upon knockdown of <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic>. There was a significant decline in the CFU per worm in <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown worms, indicating reduced numbers of live bacteria in these worms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm the specificity of the RNAi knockdowns and rule out potential off-target effects, we examined transcript levels of <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> following RNAi treatment. RNAi against <italic>ufd-1</italic> significantly reduced <italic>ufd-1</italic> mRNA levels without reducing <italic>npl-4</italic> expression, while <italic>npl-4</italic> RNAi specifically downregulated <italic>npl-4</italic> transcripts with no impact on <italic>ufd-1</italic> mRNA levels (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B). Additionally, alignment of <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> mRNA sequences against the <italic>C. elegans</italic> transcriptome revealed no significant similarity to other genes, supporting the specificity of the RNAi constructs. Moreover, the <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> RNA sequences do not share significant sequence similarity. Therefore, the highly similar phenotypes observed in <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown animals, including shortened lifespan, reduced survival on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and decreased intestinal colonization with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, strongly suggest that these outcomes result from the disruption of the functional UFD-1-NPL-4 complex.</p>
<p>Reduced colonization of the gut by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> could be because of reduced uptake of the bacterium in <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown animals. The rate of pharyngeal pumping is an indicator of the uptake of bacterial food. We studied whether inhibition of <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> affected the pharyngeal pumping rate. The knockdown of <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> did not affect the pharyngeal pumping rate (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A), indicating that the reduced colonization was unlikely due to the reduced uptake of bacteria. Next, we tested whether exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> affected the pharyngeal pumping in <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown animals. Exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> for 12 hours resulted in a minimal reduction in the pharyngeal pumping rate in <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown animals compared to control animals (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B). These results suggested that the reduced colonization of <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown animals by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was unlikely because of the reduced uptake of bacteria.</p>
<p>The clearance of intestinal contents through the defecation motor program (DMP) is known to influence gut colonization by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Das et al., 2023</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that knockdown of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex might increase defecation frequency, thereby promoting the physical expulsion of bacteria and resulting in reduced gut colonization. To test this possibility, we measured DMP rates in animals subjected to <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> RNAi. Contrary to this hypothesis, both <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown animals exhibited a significant reduction in defecation frequency compared to control RNAi-treated animals (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C). This reduction in DMP rate persisted even after 12 hours of exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D). Thus, the change in the DMP rate in <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> knockdown animals is unlikely to be the reason for the reduced gut colonization by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggested that the inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex reduced the survival of <italic>C. elegans</italic> on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> despite diminished colonization of the gut with the bacterium. Because <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>npl-4</italic> RNAi led to very similar phenotypes, we further used only <italic>ufd-1</italic> RNAi to decipher the mechanisms of reduced survival and diminished colonization on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>

<p>To further examine the role of XBP-1 in this context, we assessed the effect of <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown in animals neuronally overexpressing the constitutively active spliced form of XBP-1 (XBP-1s), which has been previously associated with enhanced longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Taylor and Dillin, 2013</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>ufd-1</italic> resulted in the reduced survival of XBP-1s-overexpressing animals on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, despite a concurrent decrease in bacterial colonization of the gut (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-C).

<p>The <italic>atf-6(ok551)</italic> animals exhibited reduced survival on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> upon <italic>ufd-1</italic> RNAi compared to the control RNAi (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).

<p>Knockdown of <italic>ufd-1</italic> reduced colonization in wild-type animals as well as mutants of ER-UPR and innate immunity pathways. Interestingly, despite variable survival rates on control RNAi, all strains had similar survival rates upon knockdown of <italic>ufd-1</italic> (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). We reasoned that <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown might lead to an aberrant immune response that results in diminished gut colonization by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and reduces the survival of healthy but not immunocompromised animals. If this were the case, knockdown of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex might improve the survival of severely immunocompromised animals by activating a compensatory immune response.

Gene ontology (GO) analysis for biological processes for upregulated genes showed enrichment for innate immune response (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). As <italic>ufd-1</italic> is required for ERAD, different ER-UPR pathway genes were also enriched in the upregulated genes. In addition, enrichment for proteolysis genes was also observed. GO analysis for cellular components and molecular function for upregulated genes showed enrichment for lysosomes and peptidase activities, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). These results indicated that the knockdown of <italic>ufd-1</italic> might result in increased proteolysis activities via lysosomes. GO analysis for biological processes for downregulated genes also showed enrichment for innate immune response (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). This indicated that <italic>ufd-1</italic> might be required for the expression of some innate immune response genes. GO analysis for cellular components and molecular function for downregulated genes primarily identified functions related to nucleosomes (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B and 1C). Indeed, UFD-1 is known to localize to the nucleus and is required for chromatin stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mouysset et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we compared the upregulated genes with previously published gene expression data using WormExp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 2016b</xref>).

<title>GATA transcription factor ELT-2 mediates the <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown phenotypes</title>
<p>To identify the genes downstream of <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown that were responsible for reduced colonization, we knocked down individual genes that were upregulated upon <italic>ufd-1</italic> RNAi and studied colonization of the gut with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. We hypothesized that the reduced colonization might be because of increased expression of proteolysis genes. Therefore, we knocked down the proteolysis genes that were upregulated by <italic>ufd-1</italic> RNAi. Knockdown of the protease genes <italic>cpr-1</italic>, <italic>asp-12</italic>, and Y71H2AR.25 led to a significant increase in colonization in <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown animals (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A), suggesting that increased expression of protease genes might be responsible for reduced colonization. Because <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown also resulted in the upregulation of several <italic>pals</italic> genes, which are part of the IPR, we next targeted the <italic>pals</italic> genes upregulated by <italic>ufd-1</italic> RNAi. Knockdown of the <italic>pals</italic> genes, <italic>pals-9</italic>, <italic>pals-14</italic>, <italic>pals-16</italic>, <italic>pals-17</italic>, and <italic>pals-29</italic>, resulted in a significant increase in colonization in <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown animals (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B). These results indicated that some of the proteases and IPR genes are involved in the regulation of colonization in <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown animals. It is also likely that these genes function redundantly, and multiple genes contribute to the observed phenotype.</p>
<p>To identify the transcription factors that regulate the diminished colonization and reduced survival phenotype of <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown, we carried out transcription factor enrichment analysis for upregulated genes using WormExp. The <italic>ufd-1</italic> RNAi upregulated genes substantially overlapped with the genes regulated by the GATA transcription factor ELT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dineen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mann et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>). Indeed, ELT-2 is known to regulate the expression of protease and <italic>pals</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Mann et al., 2016</xref>). To assess whether ELT-2 contributes to the phenotypes associated with <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown, we conducted double RNAi experiments in N2 animals targeting both <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>elt-2</italic> and examined <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> colonization. The double knockdown of <italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>elt-2</italic> did not compromise RNAi efficiency, as evidenced by significantly reduced <italic>ufd-1</italic> mRNA levels and diminished ELT-2::GFP signal (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A and B).

<p>Because <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown in <italic>sek-1(km4)</italic> worms improves their survival on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), we also studied whether <italic>elt-2</italic> was responsible for the increased survival of <italic>sek-1(km4)</italic> worms upon <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown.

<p>To determine whether ELT-2 activation alone is sufficient to recapitulate the phenotypes observed upon UFD-1-NPL-4 complex inhibition, we analyzed animals overexpressing ELT-2. Similar to <italic>ufd-1</italic> knockdown, ELT-2 overexpression led to a significant reduction in the colonization of the gut by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A and 3B). However, overexpression of ELT-2 did not alter the survival of worms on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3C). Taken together, these findings suggest that the phenotypes triggered by disruption of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex are partially mediated by ELT-2. However, additional pathways, yet to be identified, likely cooperate with ELT-2 to regulate both pathogen resistance and host survival.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we show that inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex leads to an aberrant immune response in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Suppression of this complex leads to reduced gut colonization with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in wild-type animals as well as mutants of different ER-UPR and immunity pathways. Despite the reduction in pathogen load, the wild-type animals exhibit reduced survival, indicative of a detrimental immune response. However, immunocompromised mutants, which have significantly reduced survival on pathogenic bacteria, exhibit reduced colonization and improved survival on inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex. This indicates that the immune response activated by the inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex compensates for the dampened immune response of the immunocompromised mutants. Despite beneficial effects on the survival on pathogenic bacteria, inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex leads to adverse effects on the lifespan of immunocompromised mutants. This is because the immunocompromised mutants have a normal lifespan on nonpathogenic bacteria, and the aberrant immune response becomes detrimental on such bacterial diets.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that hyperactivation of immune pathways can negatively affect organismal development. For example, sustained activation of the p38 MAPK pathway impairs development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheesman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), and excessive activation of the IPR also leads to developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">LaÅ¾etiÄ et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to our current study, recent work has demonstrated that heightened immune responses can reduce gut pathogen load while paradoxically decreasing host survival during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ghosh and Singh, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peterson et al., 2022</xref>). However, our study uniquely shows that while such heightened immune responses are detrimental to immunocompetent animals, they can be beneficial in the context of immunodeficiency.</p>
<p>We find that the knockdown of <italic>ufd-1</italic> led to the upregulation of several genes that are part of the IPR activated by intracellular pathogens <italic>N. parisii</italic> and Orsay virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bakowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sarkies et al., 2013</xref>). The ubiquitination components have been shown to be required for targeting the intracellular pathogen <italic>N. parisii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bakowski et al., 2014</xref>). As a counterattack, the pathogen probably targets the ubiquitin-proteasome system of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bakowski et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the intracellular pathogens <italic>N. parisii</italic> and Orsay virus might activate the IPR by inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bakowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Reddy et al., 2019</xref>). We show that inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex activates the IPR. The activation of the IPR by the inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex could be a consequence of the direct inhibition of this complex itself or an indirect perturbation of the proteasomal degradation of proteins. In future studies, it will be intriguing to decipher whether intracellular pathogens target the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that the GATA transcription factor ELT-2 mediated the aberrant response downstream of the inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex. ELT-2 is known to be required for defense as well as recovery responses against a variety of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Head and Aballay, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Shapira et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yang et al., 2016a</xref>). Previous studies have reported interactions of ELT-2 with the proteasome system. The non-proteolytic activity of the 19S proteasome subunit RPT-6 was shown to regulate the ELT-2-mediated immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Olaitan and Aballay, 2018</xref>). Another study showed that the bacterial pathogen <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> leads to the downregulation of ELT-2 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). It was demonstrated that the downregulation of ELT-2 targets was associated with the degradation of ELT-2 protein by the host ubiquitin-proteasome system. Therefore, multiple mechanisms could regulate the activity of ELT-2 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In future studies, it will be interesting to study how inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex modulates the activities of the GATA transcription factor ELT-2.</p>

The gravid adults were removed, and the eggs were incubated at 20Â°C for 96 hours. For protease and IPR genesâ co-RNAi with <italic>ufd-1</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic> HT115(DE3) with the appropriate vectors were grown separately at 37Â°C overnight until growth saturation. Then, the RNAi cultures were mixed in a ratio of 1:1, concentrated ten times, and plated onto RNAi plates, followed by overnight growth at 37Â°C. We used all the protease and <italic>pals</italic> genes that were upregulated upon <italic>ufd-1</italic> RNAi and were present in the Ahringer RNAi library. For experiments involving <italic>elt-2</italic> RNAi, the worms were grown on the control <italic>gfp</italic> RNAi (GFP) and <italic>ufd-1</italic> RNAi for 48 hours at 20Â°C to obtain the L4 stage worms. Afterward, the worms grown on <italic>gfp</italic> RNAi were transferred to GFP+<italic>elt-2</italic> RNAi plates, and those grown on <italic>ufd-1</italic> RNAi were transferred to GFP+<italic>ufd-1</italic> and <italic>ufd-1</italic>+<italic>elt-2</italic> RNAi plates. This was followed by the incubation of the worms at 20Â°C for another 48 hours before transferring to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> plates.

<p>In this <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript, Rao and colleagues investigate the UFD-1/NPL-4 complex, which is involved in extracting misfolded proteins in the plasma membrane and the accumulation of pathogenic bacteria in the intestine. Using <bold>convincing</bold> methods, the authors find that knockdown of the ufd-1 and npl-4 genes leads to shortened lifespan of the nematode C. elegans and reduced accumulation of the bacterial pathogen P. aeruginosa in the intestine.</p>

<p>The authors adequately addressed the concerns I raised in my initial review, which are noted below.</p>
<p>(1) I suggest that the authors choose a different term in their title, abstract and manuscript to describe the phenotypes associated with ufd-1 and npl-4 knockdown other than an &quot;inflammation-like response.&quot; Inflammation is a pathological term with four cardinal signs: redness (rubor), swelling (tumor), warmth (calor) and pain (dolor). These are not symptoms known to occur in C. elegans. The authors could consider using &quot;inappropriate,&quot; &quot;aberrant&quot; or &quot;toxic&quot; immune activation in the title and abstract.</p>
<p>(2) I think it is important to point out in the context of the authors novelty claim in the abstract and manuscript that the toxic effects of inappropriate immune activation in C. elegans has been widely catalogued. For example: doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1011120 (2023); doi:10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z (2016).; doi:10.1126/science.1203411 (2011); doi:10.1534/g3.115.025650 (2016). In addition, doi:10.7554/eLife.74206 (2022) previously described a mutation that caused innate immune activation that reduced accumulation of P. aeruginosa in the intestine, but also caused animals to have a shortened lifespan.</p>
<p>Thus, I do not think this study reveals the existence of inflammatory-like responses in C. elegans, as stated by the authors. Indeed, I think it is important for the authors to remove this novelty claim from their paper and discuss their work in the context of these studies in a paragraph in the introduction.</p>
<p>(3) The authors rely on the use of RNAi of ufd-1 and npl-4 to study their effect on P. aeruginosa colonization and pathogen resistance throughout the manuscript. To address the possibility of off-target effects of the RNAi, the authors should consider both (i) showing with qRT-PCR that these genes are indeed targeted during RNAi, and (ii) confirming their phenotypes with an orthologous technique, preferably by studying ufd-1 and npl-4 loss-of-function mutants [both in the wild-type and sek-1(km4) backgrounds]. If mutation of these genes is lethal, the authors could use Auxin Inducible Degron (AID) technology to induce the degradation of these proteins in post-developmental animals.</p>
<p>(4) I am confused about the author's explanation regarding their observation that inhibition of the UFD-1/ NPL-4 complex extends the lifespan of sek-1(km25) animals, but not pmk-1(km25) animals, as SEK-1 is the MAPKK that functions immediately upstream of the p38 MAPK PMK-1 to promote pathogen resistance.</p>
<p>I am also confused why their RNA-seq experiment revealed a signature of intracellular pathogen response genes and not PMK-1 targets, which the authors propose is accounting for toxic immune activation. Activation of which immune response leads to toxicity?</p>
<p>(5) The authors did not test alternative explanations for why UFD-1/ NPL-4 complex inhibition compromises survival during pathogen infection, other than exuberant immune activation. For example, it is possible that inhibition of this proteosome complex shortens lifespan by compromising the general health/ normal physiology of nematodes. Immune responses could be activated as a secondary consequence of this stress, and not be a direct cause of early mortality. Does sek-1(km4) mutant suppress the lifespan shortened lifespan of ufd-1 and npl-4 knockdown? This experiment should also be done with loss-of-function mutants, as noted in point 3.</p>
<p>(6) The conclusion of Figure 6 hinges on an experiment that uses double RNAi to knockdown two genes at the same time (Fig. 6D and 6G), an approach that is inherently fraught in C. elegans biology owing to the likelihood that the efficiency of RNAi-mediated gene knockdown is compromised and may account for the observed phenotypes. The proper control for double RNAi is not empty vector + ufd-1(RNAi), but rather gfp(RNAi) + ufd-1(RNAi), as the introduction of a second hairpin RNA is what may compromise knockdown efficiency. In this context, it is important to confirm that knockdown of both genes occurs as expected (with qRT-PCR) and to confirm this phenotype using available elt-2 loss-of-function mutants.</p>
<p>(7) A supplementary table with the source data for at least three replications (mean lifespan, n, statistical comparison) for each pathogenesis assay should be included in this manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to uncover what role, if any, the UFD1/NPL4 complex might play in innate immune responses of the nematode C. elegans. The authors find that loss of the complex renders animals more sensitive to both pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. However, there appears to be a complex interplay with known innate immune pathways since loss of UFD1/NPL4 actually results in increased survival of animals lacking the canonical innate immune pathways.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors perform robust genetic analysis to exclude and include possible mechanisms by which the UFD1/NPL4 pathway acts in the innate immune response.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The argument that the loss of the UFD1/NPL4 complex triggers a response that mimics that of an intracellular pathogen is not thoroughly investigated. Additionally, the finding of a role of the GATA transcription factor, ELT-2, in this response is suggestive, but experiments showing sufficiency in the context of loss of the UFD1/NPL4 complex need to be explored.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have performed several control experiments for their RNAi based experiments and also tested the requirement for xbp-1s in their paradigm. The findings and their interpretations are acceptable.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) I suggest that the author's choose a different term in their title, abstract and manuscript to describe the phenotypes associated with ufd-1 and npl-4 knockdown other than an &quot;inflammation-like response.&quot; Inflammation is a pathological term with four cardinal signs: redness (rubor), swelling (tumor), warmth (calor) and pain (dolor). These are not symptoms know to occur in C. elegans. The authors could consider using &quot;tolerance&quot; instead, as this term may better describe their findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed âinflammation-like responseâ to âaberrant immune responseâ throughout the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It would help the reader to better understand the novelty of the findings in this study if the authors include a paragraph in their introduction to put their results in context of the published literature that has examined the relationship between immune activation and nematode health and survival. In particular, I suggest that the authors discuss doi:10.7554/eLife.74206 (2022), a study that charcterized a similar observation to what the authors are reporting. This study found that low cholesterol reduces pathogen tolerance and host survival during pathogen infection. Cholesterol scarcity increases p38 PMK-1 phosphorylation, priming immune effector induction in a manner that reduces pathogen accumulation in the intestine during a subsequent infection. I also suggest that the authors highlight in this introductory paragraph that the toxic effects of inappropriate immune activation in C. elegans has been widely catalogued. For example: doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1011120 (2023); doi:10.1186/s12915-016-0320-z (2016).; doi:10.1126/science.1203411 (2011); doi:10.1534/g3.115.025650 (2016).</p>
<p>In this context, the authors could consider re-wording their novelty claim in the abstract and introduction to take into account this previous body of work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion section to place our findings in the context of previous research. The revised manuscript now includes the following text (page 11, lines 336â344): âPrevious studies have shown that hyperactivation of immune pathways can negatively affect organismal development. For example, sustained activation of the p38 MAPK pathway impairs development in C. elegans (Cheesman et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016), and excessive activation of the IPR also leads to developmental defects (LaÅ¾etiÄ et al., 2023). Similar to our current study, recent work has demonstrated that heightened immune responses can reduce gut pathogen load while paradoxically decreasing host survival during infection (Ghosh and Singh, 2024; Peterson et al., 2022). However, our study uniquely shows that while such heightened immune responses are detrimental to immunocompetent animals, they can be beneficial in the context of immunodeficiency.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors rely on the use of RNAi of ufd-1 and npl-4 to study their effect on P. aeruginosa colonization and pathogen resistance throughout the manuscript. To address the possibility of off-target effects of the RNAi, the authors should consider both (i) showing with qRT-PCR that these genes are indeed targeted during RNAi, and (ii) confirming their phenotypes with an orthologous technique, preferably by studying ufd-1 and npl-4 loss-offunction mutants [both in the wild-type and sek-1(km4) backgrounds]. If mutation of these genes is lethal, the authors could use Auxin Inducible Degron (AID) technology to induce the degradation of these proteins in post-developmental animals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We attempted several protocols of CRISPR in our laboratory to generate ufd-1 loss-of-function mutants; however, these efforts were unsuccessful. While this does not rule out the possibility of generating ufd-1 mutants, the failure is likely due to technical limitations on our part rather than an inherent inability to disrupt the gene. Nevertheless, to confirm the specificity of our RNAi-based approach, we quantified ufd-1 and npl-4 mRNA levels following RNAi treatment and found that each gene was specifically and effectively downregulated by its respective RNAi.</p>
<p>Importantly, ufd-1 and npl-4 RNA sequences do not share significant homology, yet knockdown of either gene results in nearly identical phenotypes, including reduced survival on P. aeruginosa, diminished intestinal colonization, and shortened lifespan. These consistent outcomes strongly support the conclusion that the phenotypes are attributable to the disruption of the functional UFD-1-NPL-4 complex. We have added these results in the revised manuscript (pages 4-5, lines 114-125): âTo confirm the specificity of the RNAi knockdowns and rule out potential off-target effects, we examined transcript levels of ufd-1 and npl-4 following RNAi treatment. RNAi against ufd-1 significantly reduced ufd-1 mRNA levels without reducing npl-4 expression, while npl-4 RNAi specifically downregulated npl-4 transcripts with no impact on ufd-1 mRNA levels (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A and B). Additionally, alignment of ufd-1 and npl-4 mRNA sequences against the C. elegans transcriptome revealed no significant similarity to other genes, supporting the specificity of the RNAi constructs. Moreover, the ufd-1 and npl-4 RNA sequences do not share significant sequence similarity. Therefore, the highly similar phenotypes observed in ufd-1 and npl-4 knockdown animals, including shortened lifespan, reduced survival on P. aeruginosa, and decreased intestinal colonization with P. aeruginosa, strongly suggest that these outcomes result from the disruption of the functional UFD-1-NPL-4 complex.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>We consistently observe that sek-1(km4) mutants are more sensitive to P. aeruginosa infection than pmk-1(km25) mutants, a finding also reported in previous studies (for example, PMID: 33658510). Given that SEK-1 functions upstream of PMK-1 in the MAPK signaling cascade, it is plausible that SEK-1 also regulates additional MAP kinases, such as PMK-2 (PMID: 25671546), which could contribute to the enhanced susceptibility observed in sek-1 mutants.</p>
<p>Our results show that inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex improves survival specifically in severely immunocompromised animals, such as sek-1(km4) mutants, but not in pmk1(km25) mutants. To further validate this, we generated the double mutant dbl-1(nk3);pmk1(km25), which exhibits reduced survival on P. aeruginosa compared to either single mutant.</p>
<p>Notably, inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex also enhances survival in the dbl1(nk3);pmk-1(km25) background, reinforcing the observation that this response is specific to severely compromised immune states.</p>
<p>We would also like to clarify that the observed phenotypes are independent of the SEK1/PMK-1 pathway, as shown in Figure 3A-3C, Figure 3âfigure supplement 1, and Figure 4A-4C. The IPR seems to play a role in the observed phenotypes, as inhibition of some of the protease and pals genes (IPR genes) leads to increased P. aeruginosa colonization in ufd-1 knockdown animals (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). The other immune response pathway that leads to the observed phenotypes is ELT-2, as explained in Figure 6. Finally, we have included in the revised manuscript a note that, in addition, as-yet unidentified pathways are also likely contributing to the phenotypes triggered by disruption of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have already included this data in Figure 4D, where we observed that ufd-1 and npl-4 knockdown reduce the lifespan of sek-1(km4) animals. It is possible that immune activation is a secondary consequence of cellular stress induced by inhibition of the UFD-1NPL-4 complex. However, our data strongly suggest that the observed phenotypes, including reduced gut pathogen load and decreased survival on the pathogen, are due to the aberrant immune response activated by the inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex. Evidence from sek-1(km4) mutants particularly underscores the role of this dysregulated immune activation. While this aberrant immune response is detrimental to wild-type animals under pathogenic conditions, it appears to be beneficial in severely immunocompromised backgrounds. Specifically, in sek-1(km4) mutants, inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex enhances survival during P. aeruginosa infection (Figure 4A). However, under non-infectious conditions, where sek-1(km4) mutants exhibit a normal lifespan, the same immune activation becomes harmful (Figure 4D). Together, these findings demonstrate that the aberrant immune response induced by UFD-1âNPL-4 inhibition is context-dependent: it is advantageous only for immunocompromised animals under infection, but deleterious to healthy animals under infection and to both healthy and immunocompromised animals under non-infectious conditions.</p>

<p>RNAi experiments using gfp RNAi as a control instead of the empty vector (Figure 6 and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). Additionally, we assessed the efficiency of gene knockdown in the double RNAi conditions (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2) and found that RNAi efficacy was not compromised by the double RNAi treatment.</p>

<p>We have investigated the role of IPR genes in the phenotypes observed upon ufd1 knockdown (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1), and our results suggest that the IPR may contribute, at least in part, to the phenotypic outcomes of ufd-1 RNAi. In the Discussion section (pages 11â12, lines 345â356), we have included a detailed discussion on the possible mechanisms underlying IPR activation upon inhibition of the UFD-1âNPL-4 complex. We agree that the interaction between the UFD-1âNPL-4 complex and the IPR is intriguing and warrants further investigation. However, we believe that an in-depth exploration of this interaction lies beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
<p>We have incorporated new data on ELT-2 overexpression in the revised manuscript. Overexpression of ELT-2 partially phenocopies the effects of ufd-1 knockdown, supporting the idea that other pathways likely contribute to the full spectrum of phenotypes observed upon UFD-1-NPL-4 complex inhibition. The revised manuscript reads (page 10, lines 311319): âTo determine whether ELT-2 activation alone is sufficient to recapitulate the phenotypes observed upon UFD-1-NPL-4 complex inhibition, we analyzed animals overexpressing ELT-2. Similar to ufd-1 knockdown, ELT-2 overexpression led to a significant reduction in the colonization of the gut by P. aeruginosa (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A and 3B). However, overexpression of ELT-2 did not alter the survival of worms on P. aeruginosa (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3C). Taken together, these findings suggest that the phenotypes triggered by disruption of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex are partially mediated by ELT-2. However, additional pathways, yet to be identified, likely cooperate with ELT-2 to regulate both pathogen resistance and host survival.â</p>

<p>What happens with overexpression of ELT2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Overexpression of ELT-2 partially recapitulates the phenotypes of ufd-1 knockdowns, indicating that additional pathways are likely involved in controlling the phenotypes observed upon inhibition of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex. The revised manuscript reads (page 10, lines 311-319): âTo determine whether ELT-2 activation alone is sufficient to recapitulate the phenotypes observed upon UFD-1-NPL-4 complex inhibition, we analyzed animals overexpressing ELT-2. Similar to ufd-1 knockdown, ELT-2 overexpression led to a significant reduction in the colonization of the gut by P. aeruginosa (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A and 3B).

<p>The data with xbp-1 loss of function is very different than that of pek1 and atf-6. Does loss of ufd1/npl4 suppress the increased pathogen survival of xbp-1s overexpressing animals?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have examined worms overexpressing XBP-1s and found that overexpression of XBP-1s does not rescue the phenotypes caused by ufd-1 knockdown. The revised manuscript reads (page 6, lines 167-174): âTo further examine the role of XBP-1 in this context, we assessed the effect of ufd-1 knockdown in animals neuronally overexpressing the constitutively active spliced form of XBP-1 (XBP-1s), which has been previously associated with enhanced longevity (Taylor and Dillin, 2013). Knockdown of ufd-1 resulted in the reduced survival of XBP-1s-overexpressing animals on P. aeruginosa, despite a concurrent decrease in bacterial colonization of the gut (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-C). This indicated that the XBP-1 pathway was not required for the reduced P. aeruginosa colonization of ufd-1 knockdown animals.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Lastly, while the pathogen burden is reduced in ufd1/npl4 loss and pumping rates are marginally affected, have you checked defecation rates? Could they be increased?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We measured defecation rates following ufd-1 and npl-4 knockdown and, unexpectedly, found that inhibition of ufd-1/npl-4 leads to a reduction in defecation frequency. These findings clearly indicate that altered defecation cannot explain the observed decrease in gut colonization. The revised manuscript reads (page 5, lines 138-148): âThe clearance of intestinal contents through the defecation motor program (DMP) is known to influence gut colonization by P. aeruginosa in C. elegans (Das et al., 2023). It is therefore conceivable that knockdown of the UFD-1-NPL-4 complex might increase defecation frequency, thereby promoting the physical expulsion of bacteria and resulting in reduced gut colonization. To test this possibility, we measured DMP rates in animals subjected to ufd-1 and npl-4 RNAi. Contrary to this hypothesis, both ufd-1 and npl-4 knockdown animals exhibited a significant reduction in defecation frequency compared to control RNAi-treated animals (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C). This reduction in DMP rate persisted even after 12 hours of exposure to P. aeruginosa (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D). Thus, the change in the DMP rate in ufd-1 and npl-4 knockdown animals is unlikely to be the reason for the reduced gut colonization by P. aeruginosa.â</p>
<p>In summary, we would like to thank the reviewers again for providing constructive and thoughtful feedback. We believe we have fully addressed all the concerns of the reviewers by carrying out several new experiments and modifying the text. The manuscript has undergone substantial revision and has thereby improved significantly. We do hope that the evidence in support of the conclusions is found to be complete in the revised manuscript.</p>
