<title>Summary</title><p>Memory consolidation during sleep depends on the interregional coupling of slow waves, spindles, and sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), across the cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus. The reuniens nucleus of the thalamus, linking the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus, may facilitate interregional coupling during sleep. To test this, electrophysiological recordings were obtained in vivo from the cat reuniens nucleus, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Interregional synchrony was measured using phase-amplitude coupling and interregional time delays between SWRs, spindles and slow waves together with reuniens spiking and local field potential (LFP) activity. Electrical stimulation of the reuniens evoked intracellular mPFC responses, consistent with bidirectional functional connectivity between mPFC-reuniens and hippocampus. Cortical slow waves preceded reuniens slow waves and hippocampal SWRs. Hippocampal SWRs and REM sleep theta modulated reuniens activities and reuniens spindles preceded cortical spindles. The neural mass model of this network demonstrates that the strength of bidirectional hippocampo-thalamic connections determines the coupling of oscillations, suggesting a mechanistic link between synaptic weights and the propensity for interregional synchrony.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Interactions between the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are essential for cognition. During sleep, hippocampal and cortical activity is continually synchronized by cardinal sleep oscillations such as slow waves (SWs, 0.1-4 Hz), thalamocortical spindles (10-15 Hz), and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs, 100-300 Hz) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. These rhythms have well-known roles in neuronal plasticity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and in the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In particular, the hierarchical coupling of slow waves, spindles and SWRs is thought to promote the stabilization of short-term memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Consistent with this hypothesis, the temporal coupling of hippocampal and mPFC sleep oscillations results in a selective increase in the recall of hippocampus-dependent memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>At present, the pathways that coordinate the long-range coupling of slow waves, spindles and SWRs across the prefronto-hippocampal network are not well characterized. Although the hippocampus extends projections to several prefrontal areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, few regions of the prefrontal cortex reciprocate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. With respect to medial regions of the prefrontal cortex, no direct projections to the hippocampus have been identified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (reuniens) is bidirectionally connected to the hippocampus and the mPFC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, making it an ideal hub for coupling hippocampo-cortical interactions during sleep. Reuniens is part of the ventral group of midline thalamic nuclei with widespread connections to cortical, thalamic, hypothalamic and brainstem structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Consistent with its anatomical connections to the hippocampus and the mPFC, reuniens is required for memory function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and a growing body of evidence points its critical role in processing hippocampus-dependent memory <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Although evidence for the functional significance of reuniens in cognitive operations is strong, little is known about the nature of reuniens-prefrontal interactions and their interplay with hippocampal events during sleep <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Considering the well-established link between sleep and memory consolidation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, we investigated the role of the reuniens in coupling hippocampo-cortical oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep. Using in vivo intracellular recordings, computational modelling, and spike/local field potential (LFP) recordings, we demonstrate that reuniens is driven by hippocampal oscillations during sleep and that it elicits fast, consistent synaptic responses in mPFC. Hippocampal and reuniens activity precedes the onset of mPFC spindles, suggesting a hippocampo-thalamic trigger for spindle initiation. In turn, the phase of mPFC slow waves determined the amplitude of reuniens spindles and of SWR timing, forming a functional feedback loop through the reuniens.</p>

<p>We obtained intracellular recordings of mPFC neurons in vivo (n=49 neurons) during targeted, electrical stimulation of the ventral hippocampus and reuniens in anesthetized cats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>). Stimulation of the hippocampus and reuniens elicited synaptic responses in 55% and 51% of recorded mPFC neurons, respectively. Hippocampal stimulation generated variable responses in the same neurons, consisting of complex sequences of either two excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) followed by long-lasting hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, top, left), a depolarization-hyperpolarization sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, middle, left), or no response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, bottom, left). The polarity of early depolarizing responses elicited by hippocampal stimulation was dependent on membrane potential, reversing with progressive depolarization of the membrane at around -70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right), suggesting that the initial depolarization was an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP).</p>

Reuniens stimulation evoked field postsynaptic potential in a wider prefrontal territory compared to hippocampal stimulation which was restricted to the ventromedial wall of the mPFC.

<title>Reuniens and hippocampal activity precede the onset of mPFC spindles</title>
<p>Sleep enhances communication in the hippocampo-cortical pathway by promoting interregional synchrony through highly rhythmic events such as slow waves and spindles. To investigate the role of the reuniens in mediating synchrony in the mPFC-hippocampal network, we performed LFP recordings of the mPFC and hippocampus, as well as targeted spike/LFP recordings of the reuniens during natural sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Recordings were segmented into wake, NREM and REM epochs, based on mPFC delta power, mPFC signal amplitude, and nuchal muscle activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 B</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">D</xref>). During NREM sleep, LFP recordings and corresponding wavelet transforms of the signal suggested correlated activity among mPFC slow waves, spindles, hippocampal SWRs, and reuniens multi-unit activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We observed co-occurring reuniens and mPFC spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), characterized by significantly earlier onset of reuniens spindles relative to the onset of mPFC spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>

<title>Hippocampal-thalamocortical model</title>
<p>To explore the parameters that control interregional synchrony during NREM sleep, we constructed a neural mass firing rate model consisting of two cortical networks (N 1 &amp; 2), representing mPFC layers 5 and 6, respectively, and two hippocampal (CA1-CA3) and three thalamic networks (TRN, MD, and Reu, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Slow waves and sharp waves are spontaneously generated in the isolated CA3 and cortical networks respectively as a result of adaptation and excitatory-to-excitatory recurrent connections. SWRs are reproduced in the CA1 network during the active phase of the sharp wave due to recurrent connections between the CA1 excitatory and inhibitory neurons with the firing rates sharply dependent on the membrane potential in this firing rate model <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The oscillations in the range of spindle frequency are spontaneously generated in the bursting, recurrently connected MD-TRN network. The beginning and end of the spindles are controlled by cortical inputs in the thalamocortical model with long-range bidirectional projections between cortical and thalamic networks. In the full hippocampo-cortico-thalamic model, the CA1 is directly connected to the cortical network while reuniens, which is bidirectionally connected to both CA1 and cortical networks, mediates the cortical to CA1 influence. With large enough strength of multi-regional projections, the model can spontaneously reproduce the experimentally observed coupling between the slow waves, spindles, and SWRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that reuniens slow waves occur significantly later than cortical slow waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, thalamic spindles occur significantly earlier than cortical spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> shows the average of cortical slow wave trough-locked time-frequency representations of the membrane potential of mPFC excitatory neurons and reuniens neurons. The slow wave-spindle coupling angles are nonuniformly distributed for both cortical and reuniens spindles indicating strong coupling with slow waves. In quantitative match to the experimental data, reuniens spindles occur mainly around the slow wave peak (active phase) while cortical spindles mainly occur around the slow wave trough. The slow wave-spindle coupling strength is also higher for reuniens than cortical spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Slow waves in the thalamocortical network are also accompanied by large negative deflections and a subsequent peak in CA1 network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Phase locking analysis revealed that, consistent with the experimental data, SWRs are phase-locked to slow waves, occurring mainly before slow wave peaks (active phase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The bidirectional projections between reuniens and CA1 coordinate the communication between these two networks so that the membrane potential of the reuniens neurons increases after SWRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Reuniens spindles were also preceded by an increase in the SWR rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, the peak SWR rate occurs 0.32 s before the spindle onset).</p>

<title>Bidirectional projections between the reuniens and CA1 control multiregional interactions</title>
<p>To investigate how bidirectional projections between the reuniens and CA1 control multiregional interactions in the model, we explored hippocampal-thalamocortical coupling during sleep rhythms as a function of the strength of bidirectional projections between reuniens and CA1. The correlation between reuniens and CA1 membrane potentials during SWRs increased by increasing the strength of CA1 to REU projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In addition, the SWR activity before spindle onset is an increasing function of bidirectional projections between CA1 and reuniens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, we studied the effect of the strength of reuniens-CA1 bidirectional projections on CA1 activity during cortical slow waves. The peak-to-trough magnitude of CA1 deflections around the cortical slow wave also increases by increasing the reuniens-CA1 bidirectional projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The slow wave mean phase at the time of SWR occurrence decreased by increasing the strength of the bidirectional projections between reuniens and CA1 so that SWRs mostly occur before and after slow wave peak for strong and weak projections, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These results suggest that for strong reuniens-CA1 projection, the depolarizing input from reuniens during down-to-up transition is large enough to induce the SWRs in CA1 before the slow wave peak. Further, slow wave phases at the time of SWR occurrence are more nonuniformly distributed for stronger CA1-reuniens projection, indicating stronger phase locking of SWRs to slow waves.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the functional relationship between mPFC, reuniens, and hippocampal activity in cats using electrophysiological and computational approaches. We found that reuniens activity during natural sleep was strongly modulated by hippocampal oscillations, and that reuniens-mPFC spindles were preceded by increased probability of hippocampal SWRs and ripple power. Electrical stimulation of reuniens generated orthodromic and antidromic spiking in mPFC neurons, indicating bidirectional thalamocortical circuitry between the mPFC and reuniens. Slow waves in reuniens lagged prefrontal slow waves but spindles in reuniens led prefrontal spindles, suggesting a bidirectional, oscillation-dependent dialogue between reuniens and the mPFC. Spindle amplitude and SWR occurrence was modulated by the phase of the prefrontal slow oscillation, consistent with the idea that prefrontal slow waves control the timing of thalamic and hippocampal events. Overall, the study provides physiological confirmation to the hypothesis that reuniens is a core mediator in hippocampo-cortical dialogue.</p>
<p>Hippocampal influence on the activity of prefrontal neurons is a central mechanism in sleep-dependent memory consolidation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Previous research has shown that response latency in the hippocampo-prefrontal pathway exhibits substantial variability <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, indicating the involvement of both monosynaptic and polysynaptic mechanisms in prefrontal response to hippocampal input. Our findings support this notion, as we observed inconsistent mPFC responses to hippocampal stimulation, occurring later than those elicited by reuniens stimulation. Notably, the same cell in mPFC could respond or not respond to hippocampal stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">E</xref>) while LFP responses were less variable. This was possibly due to inhibitory mechanisms such as shunting/feedforward inhibition or cholinergic, monoaminergic, or thalamic gating mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While the functional impact of the hippocampo-prefrontal pathway has been extensively studied, there are fewer studies on the effects of reuniens on the prefrontal cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In our study, half of recorded prefrontal cells responded to reuniens stimulation, with a mean response latency of 6 ms and with antidromic spikes with a latency of approximately 3 ms, pointing to bidirectional functional connectivity between the two structures. Similarly, electrical stimulation of the reuniens/rhomboid nucleus in rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> elicits prominent evoked potentials in prefrontal cortices that have putatively monosynaptic latencies of 4.5 ms. We found that mPFC responses to reuniens stimulation were qualitatively different from responses elicited by hippocampal stimulation, with significant differences in latency, amplitude, slope of EPSPs, and duration of hyperpolarization. Reuniens-evoked responses occurred earlier and were more consistent than hippocampal-evoked responses, suggesting higher response fidelity in the reuniens-prefrontal pathway than in the hippocampo-cortical pathway. Both pyramidal cells and inhibitory neurons mediate the hippocampo-prefrontal response, with the early component thought to be primarily mediated by AMPA receptors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> and the early hyperpolarization was likely mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> and the late component by either GABA<sub>B</sub> conductances <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> or it was mediated by disfacilitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Interneurons also respond to hippocampal stimulation, with a shorter response latency than pyramidal cells, suggesting that the hippocampus can exert feedforward inhibition in the medial prefrontal cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. AMPA receptors and GABA inhibition may also mediate the primary and hyperpolarizing responses to reuniens stimulation in medial prefrontal cells as in the mediodorsal-prefrontal pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Similar to hippocampal afferents to the mPFC, the reuniens nucleus extends glutamatergic afferents to the prefrontal cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and exerts a strong influence on the prefrontal activity.</p>
<p>Reuniens is believed to play a critical role in connecting the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus due to its bidirectional connections with both structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are both essential for memory processing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and previous research indicates the reuniens may synchronize the activity of these two structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Demonstrations that the nucleus reuniens exerts excitatory actions at the CA1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and also at the prefrontal cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>(intracellularly confirmed and described in our study) provides supporting evidence for this claim. We also found that hippocampal stimulation evoked strong responses in cortical areas coincident with the recording site of antidromic responses to reuniens stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results support the idea that the reuniens nucleus, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex form a functional loop, with the prefrontal cortex acting as a mediator of the hippocampo-prefronto-thalamic relay.</p>
<p>In NREM sleep, the coupling of hippocampal SWRs to cortical slow waves and thalamocortical spindles is thought to be the main network mechanisms by which the brain promotes the consolidation of short-term memory into long-term storage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism that govern the emergence of this interregional synchrony remain unclear. We found that reuniens single-unit activity exhibited sporadic locking to hippocampal theta cycles and was strongly modulated by hippocampal SWRs. Considering the strong influence of reuniens on prefrontal targets, the hippocampal modulation of reuniens activity points to a thalamic pathway for the coupling of sleep rhythms. Although the minimal requirement to generate spindles is the reticular thalamic nucleus (TRN) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, our finding of increased SWR probability and ripple power prior to the onset of thalamocortical spindles suggest that hippocampal drive through reuniens may initiate the thalamocortical cascade of events that leads to spindles.</p>
<p>In first-order nuclei of the thalamus, cortical firing can trigger spindles by exciting hyperpolarized neurons of the TRN, eliciting high-frequency spike bursts<sup>5<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In turn, TRN bursts can drive IPSPs in thalamocortical neurons, eliciting low-threshold calcium spikes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> and developing the spindle primarily through recurrent inhibitory-excitatory interactions between the TRN and thalamocortical neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Cortical firing also contributes to spindle synchronization and the maintenance of the spindle through its influence on the TRN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Thus, cortical activation after the down state can initiate thalamocortical spindling and lock the timing of spindles to the phase of the slow oscillation. However, less is known about spindle generation in higher-order thalamic nuclei, especially in thalamic nuclei with limbic circuitry such as reuniens. In general, although first order thalamocortical cells display inhibitory, spindle-like activities during cortical active state, higher order thalamocortical cells show persistent depolarizing states, excluding their possibility to generate spindle-related rebound spike bursts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The bidirectional connections of the reuniens to neocortical and archicortical structures make it difficult to discern the possible triggering event that initiates the spindle in this nucleus. We found that hippocampal SWRs trigger thalamic firing and precede the onset of reuniens and mPFC spindles, which points to SWRs as possible candidate events for spindle initiation. In this regard, the strong excitatory drive emerging form the hippocampus during SWRs may represent an ontogenetically different mechanism for the initiation of spindles in the limbic circuitry. However, the generation and maintenance of spindle cycles depend on burst firing from inhibitory structures such as the TRN. To date, it is not yet clear whether the hippocampus influences inhibitory thalamic structures such as the TRN or the zona incerta, although projections from subiculum to the rostral TRN were previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. We propose that hippocampal SWRs can initiate a cascade of thalamocortical events, beginning with the excitation of reuniens, which in turn excites the mPFC. This mPFC excitation leads to spindle activity generated through cortico-thalamic feedback from the mPFC to other thalamic nuclei, such as the MD nucleus.</p>
<p>Our computational model demonstrates the presence of cross-regional interactions between the prefrontal cortex and its thalamic partners. The model confirmed that thalamic slow waves occur significantly later than cortical slow waves, whereas thalamic spindles occur significantly earlier than cortical spindles, recapturing our experimental findings and pointing to the cortical origin of slow-wave activity and thalamic origin of spindles. The model predicts that, while CA1 to reuniens connection strength plays a critical role in the modulation of reuniens activity by SWRs, bidirectional connections between reuniens and CA1 are critical for SWR-dependent triggering of spindles. Similarly, bidirectional reuniens and CA1 connections are important for transmitting cortical slow wave activity to the CA1 region. With strong bidirectional connections, the SWR occurred primarily before the slow wave active phase peak and with weak connections, the SWR tended to occur after this peak. Given our experimental findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3, J</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">K</xref>) the model suggests that the effectiveness of bidirectional connections between reuniens and CA1 is particularly strong during NREM in cat.</p>

<title>Wake, NREM and REM detection</title>
<p>Detection of wake, NREM and REM sleep was based on automated analysis of the mPFC and EMG signals, followed by manual REM scoring using mPFC, EMG and EOG data.

Briefly, the mPFC signal was downsampled to 100 Hz and bandpassed in the delta range (1-4 Hz). The mPFC, EMG and the delta-filtered mPFC signals were then squared and the mean of each signal was calculated in 5 second bins. Each 5-second bin was classified as NREM if the mPFC and delta signals exceed the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD) of the signal and if the EMG fell below mean - 1 s.d. All bins other than NREM were initially classified as wake. In the subsequent manual correction, “wake” bins with EMG below mean – 1 s.d. and EOG above mean + 1 s.d. were classified as REM. In the final stage, the 5-second bins were combined into groups of 4 to create 20 second epochs of wake, REM or NREM according to the majority of 5-second bins that comprised the 20 second epoch.

The detection protocol for all three events was restricted to periods of NREM sleep.</p>
<p>The Freely Moving Animal (FMA) toolbox<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> was used for slow wave and spindle detection. For slow waves, mPFC and reuniens LFP signals were bandpass filtered between 0.5 to 4 Hz using a FIR filter with a filter order corresponding to 3 cycles of the low frequency cut-off. Tentative slow wave events whose positive peaks were greater than 2.5 standard deviations of the signal and whose difference between positive and negative peaks was greater than 4 standard deviations were detected. Slow waves were finally defined as periods when consecutive positive-to-negative zero crossings of the signal filtered in 0.5-2 Hz occurred between 0.5 and 2 seconds of each other.</p>
<p>For spindles, mPFC and reuniens LFP signals were bandpassed in the spindle frequency band (7-15 Hz) using finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters from the EEGLAB toolbox <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. The instantaneous amplitude of the filtered signal was then computed from its Hilbert transform and the results were smoothed using a 300 ms Gaussian window. Potential spindles were detected as periods when this signal crossed 3 standard deviations (SD) above its mean for 0.5-3 s A threshold of 2.5 SD above the mean was set to detect spindle onset and offset. Events that occurred within 0.5 seconds of each other were merged into a single event. Events longer than 0.5 s and shorter than 3 s were defined as spindles. The largest peak in spindle amplitude was defined as the time of the spindle event.</p>
<p>For SWRs, hippocampal LFP signals were bandpassed in the ripple frequency band (150-200 Hz, FIR filter from the EEGLAB toolbox).

Epochs of ± 250 ms around times when the signal crossed ± 16 SD were considered as artifacts and removed from the analysis. Spikes were detected using UltraMegaSort2000 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> with a negative threshold of -4SD. During a shadow time of 0.75 ms after the threshold crossing, no new event was detected to avoid multiple threshold crossings of one event. A window of 1.5 ms was considered around each detected spike from 0.6 ms before the threshold crossing time to 0.9 ms after this time.</p>
<p>Spike sorting was based on a method described previously in Souza et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. We first extracted spike features for each channel. The features consisted of peak-to-trough value, trough value and also an index which was set to one for the channel with maximum trough amplitude and zero for the other channels. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to combine 12 features (3 features times 4 channels) and selected the two first components. Gaussian distributions were fitted to PCA components with gaussian mixture model (GMM) algorithm. Each distribution was determined as a potential spike cluster. We further limited the distribution by removing spikes with large Mahalanobis distance from the center of the distribution. We removed, combined, and limited the distributions manually by visual inspection of the plots showing PCA components versus each other and the plots showing the features for different channel pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1</xref>). For multi-unit analysis, spikes were detected according to threshold crossing and template matching algorithms in Spike2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Briefly, fast signals (∼1-3 ms) that exceeded the threshold were first detected as putative spikes and timestamped. Thresholds were manually determined according to the signal-to-noise ratio of spikes in each recording. Next, a temporary spike template was formed according to the shape of the putative spike and a “template width” was estimated (twice the mean difference between the template and the spike that created it). Each new spike was then compared against the template and added to it if the spike’s sample points fell within the template width. The template was modified with the addition of each new spike up to a maximum of eight spikes after which the template was checked against previous templates. If a match was found, the temporary template was merged with the existing template. Otherwise, a new confirmed template was generated.</p>

<title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using the MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Phase analysis was performed using the circular statistics tool box developed by Berens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. The Rayleigh test was performed to determine the uniformity in the phase preference of events. The Watson-Williams test was used to test the inequality of phases. Polar plots showing phases, and mean phases were plotted using MATLAB.</p>
<p>Intracellular data was analyzed using JMP 5.01 software. Normality was assessed by normal quantile plots and by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Homogeneity of variance was assessed by Levene’s test. Confidence intervals were set at 95% (p&lt;0.05). ANOVA was used when data was normally distributed and variance homogeneous, Welch ANOVA when variance was non-homogeneous. To determine group differences in normally distributed data, Tukey’s range test was used.</p>
<p>Otherwise, differences were assessed by non-parametric testing (van der Waerden test). Standard deviations are reported as SD and the mean absolute deviation is reported as MAD.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this study, Basha and colleagues aim to test whether the thalamic nucleus reuniens can facilitate the hippocampus/prefrontal cortex coupling during sleep. Considering the importance of sleep in memory consolidation, this study is important to understand the functional interaction between these three majorly involved regions. This work suggests that the thalamic nucleus reuniens has a functional role in synchronizing the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors performed recordings in naturally sleeping cats, and analysed the correlation between the main slow wave sleep oscillatory hallmarks: slow waves, spindles, and hippocampal ripples, and with reuniens' neurons firing. They also associated intracellular recordings to assess the reuniens-prefrontal connectivity, and computational models of large networks in which they determined that the coupling of oscillations is modulated by the strength of hippocampal-thalamic connections.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors' main claim is made on slow waves and spindle coupling, which are recorded both in the prefrontal cortex and surprisingly in reuniens. Known to be generated in the cortex by cortico-thalamic mechanisms, the slow waves and spindles recorded in reuniens show no evidence of local generation in the reuniens, which is not anatomically equipped to generate such activities. Until shown differently, these oscillations recorded in reuniens are most likely volume-conducted from nearby cortices. Therefore, such a caveat is a major obstacle to analysing their correlation (in time or frequency domains) with oscillations in other regions.</p>
<p>Finally, the choice of the animal model (cats) is the best suited one, as too few data, particularly anatomical ones regarding reuniens connectivity, are available to support functional results.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The interplay between the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampal system is critical for many cognitive processes, including memory and its consolidation over time. A prominent idea in recent research is that this relationship is mediated at least in part by the midline nucleus reuniens with respect to consolidation in particular. Whereas the bulk of evidence has focused on neuroanatomy and the effects of temproary or permanent lesions of the nucleus reuniens, the current work examined the electrophysiology of these three structures and how they inter-relate, especially during sleep, which is anticipated to be critical for consolidation. They provide evidence from intercellular recordings of the bi-directional functional connectivity among these structures. There is an emphasis on the interactions between these regions during sleep, especially slow-wave sleep. They provide evidence, in cats, that cortical slow waves precede reuniens slow waves and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, which may reflect prefrontal control of the timing of thalamic and hippocampal events, They also find evidence that hippocampal sharp wave ripples trigger thalamic firing and precede the onset of reuniens and medial prefrontal cortex spindles. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of bidirectional connections between the reuniens and the (ventral) CA1 is particularly strong during non-rapid eye movement sleep in the cat. This is a very interesting, complex study on a highly topical subject.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
An excellent array of different electrophysiological techniques and analyses are conducted. The temporal relationships described are novel findings that suggest mechanisms behind the interactions between the key regions of interest. These may be of value for future experimental studies to test more directly their association with memory consolidation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Given the complexity and number of findings provided, clearer explanation(s) and organisation that directed the specific value and importance of different findings would improve the paper. Most readers may then find it easier to follow the specific relevance of key approaches and findings and their emphasis. For example, the fact that bidirectional connections exist in the model system is not new per se. How and why the specific findings add to existing literature would have more impact if this information was addressed more directly in the written text and in the figure legends.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript presents valuable evidence of temporal correlations during specific oscillatory activity between the prefrontal cortex, thalamic nucleus reuniens, and the hippocampus, in naturally sleeping animals. Such correlations represent solid evidence to support the notion that the thalamic nucleus reuniens participates in the hippocampal and prefrontal cortex dialogue subserving memory processes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Basha and colleagues aim to test whether the thalamic nucleus reuniens can facilitate the hippocampus/prefrontal cortex coupling during sleep. Considering the importance of sleep in memory consolidation, this study is important to understand the functional interaction between these three majorly involved regions. This work suggests that the thalamic nucleus reuniens has a functional role in synchronizing the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors performed recordings in naturally sleeping cats, and analysed the correlation between the main slow wave sleep oscillatory hallmarks: slow waves, spindles, and hippocampal ripples, and with reuniens' neurons firing. They also associated intracellular recordings to assess the reuniens-prefrontal connectivity, and computational models of large networks in which they determined that the coupling of oscillations is modulated by the strength of hippocampal-thalamic connections.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors' main claim is made on slow waves and spindle coupling, which are recorded both in the prefrontal cortex and surprisingly in reuniens. Known to be generated in the cortex by cortico-thalamic mechanisms, the slow waves and spindles recorded in reuniens show no evidence of local generation in the reuniens, which is not anatomically equipped to generate such activities. Until shown differently, these oscillations recorded in reuniens are most likely volume-conducted from nearby cortices. Therefore, such a caveat is a major obstacle to analysing their correlation (in time or frequency domains) with oscillations in other regions.</p>

<p>1. We fully agree with the reviewer that reuniens likely does not generate neither slow waves nor spindles. We do not make such claim, which we clearly stated in the discussion (lines 319-324). We propose that Reuniens neurons mediate different forms of activity. In the model, we introduced MD nucleus only because without MD we were unable to generate spindles. While the slow waves and spindles are generated in other thalamocortical regions, the REU neurons show these rhythms due to long-range projections from these regions to REU as has been shown in the model.</p>
<p>2. Definitely, we cannot exclude some influence of volume conductance on obtained LFP recordings in REU nucleus. However, we show modulation of spiking activity within REU by spindles. Spike modulation cannot be explained by volume conductance but can be explained by either synaptic drive (likely the case here) or some intrinsic neuronal processes (like T-current).</p>
<p>3. In our REU recordings for spike identification we used tetrode recordings. If slow waves and spindles are volume conducted, then slow waves and spindles recorded with tetrodes should have identical shape. Following reviewer comment, we took these recordings and subtracted one channel from another. The difference in signal during slow waves is in the order 0.1 mV. Considering that the distance between electrodes is in the order of 20 um, such a difference in voltage is major and can only be explained by local extracellular currents, likely due to synaptic activities originating in afferent structures.</p>

<p>Finally, the choice of the animal model (cats) is the best suited one, as too few data, particularly anatomical ones regarding reuniens connectivity, are available to support functional results.</p>

<p>1. Thalamus of majority of mammals (definitely primates and carnivores, including cats) contain local circuit interneurons (about 30 % of all neurons). A vast majority of studies in rodents (except LGN nucleus) report either absence or extremally low (i.e. Jager P, Moore G, Calpin P, et al. Dual midbrain and forebrain origins of thalamic inhibitory interneurons. eLife. 2021; 10: e59272.) number of thalamic interneurons. Therefore, studies on other species than rodents are necessary, and bring new information, which is impossible to obtain in rodents.</p>
<p>2. Cats’ brain is much larger than the brain of mice or rats, therefore, the effects of volume conductance from cortex to REU are much smaller, if not negligible. The distance between REU and closest cortical structure (ectosylvian gyrus) in cats is about 15 mm.</p>
<p>3. Indeed, there is much less anatomical data on cats as opposed to rodents. This is why, we performed experiments shown in the figure 1. This figure contains functional anatomy data. Antidromic responses show that recorded structure projects to stimulated structure. Orthodromic responses show that stimulated structure projects to recorded structure.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The interplay between the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampal system is critical for many cognitive processes, including memory and its consolidation over time. A prominent idea in recent research is that this relationship is mediated at least in part by the midline nucleus reuniens with respect to consolidation in particular. Whereas the bulk of evidence has focused on neuroanatomy and the effects of temproary or permanent lesions of the nucleus reuniens, the current work examined the electrophysiology of these three structures and how they inter-relate, especially during sleep, which is anticipated to be critical for consolidation. They provide evidence from intercellular recordings of the bi-directional functional connectivity among these structures. There is an emphasis on the interactions between these regions during sleep, especially slow-wave sleep. They provide evidence, in cats, that cortical slow waves precede reuniens slow waves and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples, which may reflect prefrontal control of the timing of thalamic and hippocampal events, They also find evidence that hippocampal sharp wave ripples trigger thalamic firing and precede the onset of reuniens and medial prefrontal cortex spindles. The authors suggest that the effectiveness of bidirectional connections between the reuniens and the (ventral) CA1 is particularly strong during non-rapid eye movement sleep in the cat. This is a very interesting, complex study on a highly topical subject.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>An excellent array of different electrophysiological techniques and analyses are conducted. The temporal relationships described are novel findings that suggest mechanisms behind the interactions between the key regions of interest. These may be of value for future experimental studies to test more directly their association with memory consolidation.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given the complexity and number of findings provided, clearer explanation(s) and organisation that directed the specific value and importance of different findings would improve the paper. Most readers may then find it easier to follow the specific relevance of key approaches and findings and their emphasis. For example, the fact that bidirectional connections exist in the model system is not new per se. How and why the specific findings add to existing literature would have more impact if this information was addressed more directly in the written text and in the figure legends.</p>

<p>Thank you for this comment. In the revised version, we will do our best to simplify presentation and more clearly explain our findings.</p>
