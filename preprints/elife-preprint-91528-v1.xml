<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>In mammals, spermatogonial cells (SCs) are undifferentiated male germ cells in testis quiescent until birth that self-renew and differentiate to produce spermatogenic cells and functional sperm across life. The transcriptome of SCs is highly dynamic and timely regulated during postnatal development. We examined if such dynamics involves changes in chromatin organization by profiling the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in SCs from early postnatal stages to adulthood in mice using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. By integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic features, we show that SCs undergo massive chromatin remodeling during postnatal development that correlates with distinct gene expression profiles and transcription factors (TF) motif enrichment. We identify genomic regions with significantly different chromatin accessibility in adult SCs that are marked by histone modifications associated with enhancers and promoters. Some of the regions with increased accessibility correspond to transposable element subtypes enriched in multiple TFs motifs and close to differentially expressed genes. Our results underscore the dynamics of chromatin organization in developing germ cells and the involvement of the regulatory genome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogonial cells (SCs) are the initiators and supporting cellular foundation of spermatogenesis in testis in many species including mammals. In mice, SCs become active one to two days after birth, when they exit mitotic arrest and start dividing to populate the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules. During the first week of postnatal life, a population of SCs continues to proliferate to give rise to undifferentiated A<sub>single</sub> (A<sub>s</sub>), A<sub>paired</sub> (A<sub>pr</sub>) and A<sub>aligned</sub> (A<sub>al</sub>) cells. The remaining SCs differentiate to form chains of daughter cells that become primary and secondary spermatocytes around postnatal day (PND) 10 to 12. Spermatocytes then undergo meiosis and give rise to haploid spermatids that develop into spermatozoa. Spermatozoa are then released in the lumen of seminiferous tubules and continue to mature in the epididymis until becoming capable of fertilization by PND 42-48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">De Rooij, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Kubota and Brinster, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Oatley and Griswold, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent work showed that SCs in early postnatal life have distinct transcriptional signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Green et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hammoud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Law et al., 2019</xref>). During the first week of postnatal development, SCs display unique features necessary for the rapid establishment and expansion of the cell population along the basement membrane. This includes high expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, stem cell proliferation, transcription and RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Grive et al., 2019</xref>). In comparison, genes expressed in adult SCs are involved in the maintenance of a balance between proliferation and differentiation, and help constitute a steady cell population that ensures sperm formation across life. Previous transcriptome analyses have revealed that adult SCs prioritize pathways related to paracrine signaling and niche communication, as well as mitochondrial functions and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Grive et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>). Epigenetic changes such as histone tail modifications and DNA methylation have also been reported in SCs during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hammoud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hammoud et al., 2015</xref>). Today however, the relationship between the transcriptome dynamics and chromatin landscape in SCs during the transition from early postnatal to adult stage has not been fully characterized.</p>
<p>We characterized the transcriptome and the profile of chromatin accessibility in SCs during the transition from early postnatal to adult stages. The results reveal extensive changes in transcription and in chromatin accessibility in particular, an increase in chromatin accessibility at enhancer regions in adult SCs compared to postnatal SCs. Regions with changes in chromatin accessibility are enriched in binding motifs of several TFs that are differentially expressed between postnatal and adult stages, suggesting a possible role in changes in chromatin accessibility. Analyses of chromatin accessibility at transposable elements (TEs) identified previously uncharacterized changes at long terminal repeats (LTR) and LINE L1 subtypes between developing and adult SCs. Together, these findings suggest a functional link between transcriptional dynamics and chromatin accessibility in SCs during development, and underscore the plasticity of genome organization in germ cells.</p>

<title>FACS enriches SCs collected from postnatal and adult mouse testis</title>
<p>We collected testes from 8- and 15-day old pups (PND8 and 15) and adult males and prepared cell suspensions from each animal by enzymatic digestion. The preparations were enriched for SCs by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using specific surface markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kubota et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). The purity of sorted cells was evaluated by immunocytochemistry using PLZF (ZBTB16), a well-established marker for undifferentiated SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Costoya et al., 2004</xref>). FACS enriched cell populations from 3-6% PLZF+ (before FACS) to 85-95% PLZF+ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), suggesting a high SCs enrichment.</p>

<p>To validate the molecular identity of enriched SCs populations, we profiled their transcriptome at PND8, PND15 and adulthood by total RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (n=6 for each group) and examined the expression of known spermatogonial stem cell and somatic markers (Leydig and Sertoli cells) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and Fig. S1A, B). Classical SCs markers such as <italic>c-kit</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Schrans-Stassen et al., 1999</xref>)<italic>, Id4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Helsel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Lin28a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chakraborty et al., 2014</xref>; Wang et al., 2020), <italic>Zbtb16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Costoya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Song et al., 2020</xref>) and <italic>Gfra1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">He et al., 2007</xref>) were robustly expressed in all SCs samples at each developmental stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and Fig. S1A, B), indicating high purity of sorted cells. In contrast, low to negligible expression of somatic cells markers such as <italic>Vim</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bernardino et al., 2018</xref>) and <italic>Tspan17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gewiss et al., 2021</xref>) for Sertoli cells, and <italic>Fabp3</italic> and <italic>Hsd3b1</italic> for Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sararols et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>) was detected. To further validate the samples purity, we manually curated a list of spermatogonial and somatic cell markers derived from recent single-cell RNA-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sararols et al., 2021</xref>) and determined their expression level in our datasets. Again, we detected robust and consistent expression of all reported spermatogonial markers and low expression of somatic cells markers in all samples at each developmental stage (Fig. S1A). These results confirm the efficiency of our FACS-based enrichment method.</p>

<title>Dynamic transcriptomic states characterize postnatal and adult SCs</title>
<p>We examined the transcriptome dynamics of SCs from postnatal to adult stages by identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the RNA-seq datasets. We used a stringent cut-off (adjusted-P≤0.05, abs Log<sub>2</sub> fold change (FC)≥1) on 17,000 genes expressed during at least one developmental stage (See Methods). A total of 663 DEGs were identified between PND8 and PND15 (146 down-regulated and 517 up-regulated) and 2483 DEGs between PND15 and adult stage (914 down-regulated and 1579 up-regulated) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-E</xref> and Table S1). Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hammoud et al., 2015</xref>), we observed a dynamic regulation of germ cell factors, transcription factors (TF) involved in core pluripotency pathways and signaling molecules important for self-renewal (Fig. S1B). For instance, <italic>Pou5f1 (Oct4)</italic>, a TF necessary for pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nichols et al., 1998</xref>), is significantly down-regulated in adult SCs while the TFs <italic>Klf4</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic>, also needed for pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">An et al., 2019</xref>), are expressed similarly in postnatal and adult stages although at different level (i.e <italic>Klf4</italic> is expressed more than <italic>Sox2</italic>) (Fig. S1B).</p>
<p>We conducted Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses to identify the biological processes which DEGs are involved in. GO analyses showed that DEGs between PND8 and PN15 are involved in cell differentiation, cilium movement, sperm motility and transcription and include for instance, TFs such as <italic>Junb</italic>, <italic>Hoxb6</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic> and <italic>Pparg</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> and Table S2). Further, genes coding for histone proteins such as histone H2B <italic>Hist2h3b</italic> and epigenetic modifiers like the methyltransferase <italic>Pygo1</italic> and histone acetyl-transferase <italic>Ncoa1</italic> are also differentially expressed between PND8 and 15. Interestingly, genes down- or up-regulated between postnatal stages are involved in different processes. While down-regulated genes are implicated in cell differentiation, cell migration and regulation of proliferation for instance, <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> that is down-regulated at PND15 regulates genetic diversity during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2022</xref>), up-regulated genes are rather involved in germ cell development, cell signalling, insulin secretion and transcription (Fig. S1C and Table S2). Further, DEGs between PND15 and adulthood have roles in reproduction, spermatogenesis, cell differentiation, DNA replication, glycolysis and extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction pathways (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>, Fig. S1D and Table S2). For example, the DNA methyltransferase <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, necessary for genome regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Edwards et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>Col4a2,</italic> a subunit of type IV collagen and component of the basal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Reissig et al., 2019</xref>), are specifically down-regulated in adult SCs (Fig. S1C). Interestingly, expression of collagen has been associated to a high proliferative potential and the ability to form germ cell colonies in SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">He et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that regulation of collagen genes in adult SCs may decrease germ-stem cell potential. Genes up-regulated in adult SCs are involved in cilium movement, germ cell development and glycolysis (Table S2).</p>
<p>We then examined the differences and similarities of transcriptional profiles across the three developmental stages. To identify unique or common changes in gene expression during the transition from early postnatal to adult stages, we compared the list of DEGs at PND8 versus PND15 and at PND15 versus adulthood. Remarkably, the vast majority of DEGs show significant stage-specific changes in transcription (Fig. S2A). For instance, 75% (495/663) of DEGs between PND8 and PND15 are not statistically changed in the transition to adult SCs (Fig. S2B and Table S1 and S2). Similarly, 93% (2325/2493) of DEGs in adult SCs are not statistically changed when compared to PND8 versus PND15 SCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref> and Table S1 and S2). GO enrichment analyses showed that adult-specific down-regulated genes are involved in cell differentiation, cell migration, regulation of signal transduction and Wnt signalling, regulation of DNA replication and transcription as well as collagen biosynthesis and laminin interactions while adult-specific up-regulated genes are involved in sexual reproduction, male gamete generation, germ cell development, cilium movement and glycolysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref> and Table S1 and S2).</p>
<p>Interestingly, a small fraction of all DEGs (4.9%) are detected as significantly changed in the same direction and magnitude (adjusted-P≤0.05, absLog<sub>2</sub>FC≥1) across the three developmental stages (Fig. S2C and Table S1 and S2). For instance, 121 genes are consistently up-regulated from PND8 to adult stage, while just 26 are consistently down-regulated from PND8 to adult stage (Fig. S2C). Such DEGs are involved in different biological pathways like chromatin organization (Table S2). In particular, the histone gene clusters displayed significant down-regulation across postnatal development and in adulthood (Table S2).</p>

<title>Landscape of chromatin accessibility in SCs during postnatal development</title>
<p>Cellular differentiation is generally accompanied by changes in chromatin accessibility at regulatory elements (Atlasi et al., 2017). We examined how chromatin accessibility in SCs is modified during development using omni-ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Corces et al., 2017</xref>). We focused on SCs at PND15 and adulthood, stages that showed the highest changes in gene expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Accessible regions were identified by peak-calling on merged nucleosome-free fragments (NFF) as proxy for genomic regions with potential regulatory activity. We identified 158,977 peaks with clear ATAC-seq signal compared with surrounding genomic regions (Fig. S3A and Table S3). Most accessible regions were located at distal intergenic regions (38%), introns (28%) and putative promoter regions (23%) (Fig. S3B, C) and encompassed sequences enriched for histone PTMs associated with active chromatin such as H3K4 mono-, di- and tri-methylation (Fig. S2D). Notably, signal enrichment was higher for H3K4 methylation than for other histone PTMs (Fig. S3D). These results are consistent with previous observations that ATAC-seq peaks are identified at regulatory elements such as enhancers and promoters and are preferentially located at genomic regions with nucleosomes carrying H3K4me (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Henikoff et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>We then examined differences in chromatin accessibility between PND15 and adult SCs by differential accessibility analysis. 3212 differentially accessible regions (DARs) were identified (adjusted-P≤0.05, absLog<sub>2</sub>FC≥1) with a total of 760 regions with decreased chromatin accessibility (DARs-down) and 2452 regions with increased accessibility (DARs-up) in adult SCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, B and Table S3). DARs were predominantly localized in distal intergenic regions (54% DARs-down, 37% DARs-up) and introns (33% DARs-down, 36% DARs-up) with a minority located in putative promoter regions (8% DARs-down, 12% DARs-up), consistent with the genomic distribution of all detected ATAC-seq peaks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). GO analyses of the closest genes assigned to each DAR showed that these genes are involved in male gonad development, cell adhesion, sex differentiation and regulation of cell communication among others (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, E</xref>).</p>

<p>Epigenomic annotation of DARs using high-quality publicly available ChIP-seq datasets for postnatal SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>) revealed that DARs are predominantly located in regions enriched for histone PTMs associated with enhancers and promoters. 51% of regions with increased accessibility are located at genomic loci that carry histone PTMs since early postnatal stages, and about half (48%) overlap with regions significantly enriched in H3K4me1, a histone PTM associated to enhancers. In contrast, 80% of regions with decreased accessibility are located in regions with H3K4me1 and 1/3 (33%) also overlap with the repressive histone PTM, H3K27me3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Interestingly, while 16% of regions with increased accessibility are located at potential active regulatory elements that carry H3K27ac, none of the regions with decreased accessibility overlap with H3K27ac (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Therefore, our data indicate that the transition from postnatal to adult SCs is accompanied by discrete, yet robust, changes in chromatin accessibility at potential regulatory elements, suggesting their involvement in the control of gene transcription.</p>

<p>Table S4). Expression analyses showed that many of these TFs are differentially expressed in postnatal or adult SCs (adjusted-P&lt;0.05, 10 down-regulated and 11 up-regulated) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). For example, KLF11,12 and 15, TFs that regulate stem cell maintenance and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bialkowska et al., 2017</xref>), are upregulated in adult SCs compared to PND15 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These TFs and their motif match top enriched motifs detected in DARs in adult SCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The SP family of TFs also show differential expression and enrichment of binding motifs in regions with decreased accessibility. SP5, which has its lowest expression in adult SCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>), promotes self-renewal of mESCs by directly regulating <italic>Nanog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Tang et al., 2017</xref>) .</p>
<p>Members of the FOXO family of TFs also have an enrichment of motifs in regions with decreased accessibility. While FOXO3 has increased expression from PND15 onwards, FOXO1 is decreased in adult compared to postnatal SCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C</xref>). Interestingly, FOXO1 and FOXO3 regulate spermatogonial stem cell function and maintenance in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Goertz et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, ETS-type of TFs also show differential expression during SCs development and their motif is enriched in regions with decreased accessibility. ELK4 is up-regulated in adult SCs and can act as a transcriptional repressor via recruitment of the HDAC Sirt7 and deacetylation of H3K18ac (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Barber et al., 2012</xref>). EKL4 can also act as transcriptional activator of immediate early genes such as <italic>c-Fos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dalton and Treisman, 1992</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>c-Fos</italic> itself codes for a TF important for the regulation of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">He et al., 2008</xref>) and shows a trend towards up-regulation in adult SCs (Table S1). In contrast, GABPA is downregulated in adult SCs compared to PND15, and has been involved in the regulation of proliferation in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Ueda et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Regions with decreased chromatin accessibility also show an enrichment for the binding motif of the TF DMRT1. <italic>Dmrt1</italic> is progressively repressed during SCs postnatal development and is the lowest in adult SCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, C and E). DMRT1 can act either as a repressor or activator and controls testis development and male germ cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). DMRT1 can inhibit meiosis and promote mitosis in SCs by repressing Stra8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Matson et al., 2010</xref>). Consistently, we observed transcriptional repression of <italic>Stra8</italic> in adult SCs (Table S1).</p>
<p>Next, we identified motifs overrepresented in regions with increased chromatin accessibility in adult SCs. The identified motifs correspond to binding motifs of members of specific TF families such as POU (POU2F2, POU1F1, POU5F1), RFX (RXF1-7), DMRT (DMRT1, DMRT3, DMRTA1-2, DMRTC2), SOX (SOX2, SOX3, SOX5, SOX13), NFY (NFYA, NFYB, NFYC) and AP-1 (JUN, JUNB, JUND, FOS, ATF3, BATF) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref> and Table S4). A subset of them is also differentially expressed (adjusted-P&lt;0.05, 13 down-regulated and 5 up-regulated). The most overrepresented motif is similar to the binding motif of the POU family of TFs, which are critical regulators of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Nichols et al., 1998</xref>). <italic>Pou1f1</italic> and <italic>Pou5f1</italic> are transcriptionally repressed in adult SCs while <italic>Pou2f2</italic> is maximally expressed in PND15 SCs and down-regulated in adult cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). We also identified motifs for members of the RFX family of TFs, which are master regulators of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Choksi et al., 2014</xref>) implicated in regulation of neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Kawase et al., 2014</xref>). RFX2 is robustly expressed in adult SCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, H</xref> and I) and has been reported to induce the expression of ciliary genes in association with the TF FOXJ, which has a trend towards up-regulation in adult SCs (Fig. S4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Quigley and Kintner, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, ciliary genes are among the top genes specifically up-regulated in adult SCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>), suggesting a regulatory relationship between RFX2 and ciliary genes expression in adult SCs.</p>
<p>Other binding motifs enriched at regions with increased accessibility correspond to members of the NF-Y complex, NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC. In mESCs, NF-Y TFs facilitate a permissive chromatin conformation and play an important role in the expression of core ESC pluripotency genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Oldfield et al., 2014</xref>). NF-YA/B motif enrichment has also been found in regions of open chromatin in human SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of NF-YA and NF-YC is progressively down-regulated starting at PND15 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, H</xref>). We also detected an enrichment for the binding motifs of members of the AP-1 family of TFs, which are involved in many processes, from regulation of cell proliferation to differentiation and acute responses to environmental clues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bejjani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Vierbuchen et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, except for <italic>Fosl2</italic>, other TFs do not show any significant change in transcription in postnatal or adult SCs and are either constitutively expressed or repressed. For instance, c-FOS and JUN are robustly expressed in postnatal and adult SCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>) consistent with their role in promoting the proliferative potential of spermatogonial stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these data reveal that a shift in TFs repertoire accompanies chromatin reorganization occurring in SCs during postnatal to adult development.</p>

<title>A subset of DARs is associated with differential gene expression</title>
<p>Thus far, our results show that in SCs, the transition from postnatal to the adult stages is accompanied by changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. In some instances, differences in gene expression can be correlated with differences in chromatin accessibility of regulatory elements. Since DARs in postnatal and adult SCs overlap with putative enhancer and promoter elements, we examined if these changes in chromatin accessibility correlate with changes in gene expression. First, we tested if promoter regions of DEGs (+/-2.5kb from TSS) have differential chromatin accessibility by identifying all possible ATAC-seq peaks located in promoters and calculating an average accessibility signal. No significant difference was detected for down-regulated genes in adult SCs, despite a trend for decreased accessibility around the TSS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). However, down-regulated genes had a significant increase in chromatin accessibility in their body (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Up-regulated genes had a significant increase in chromatin accessibility both at the promoter region and gene body (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). Then, we conducted motif enrichment analyses and identified families of TFs with overrepresented binding motifs at the promoter of DEGs. Binding motifs for members of KLF and SP family of TFs were overrepresented in the promoter of both down- and up-regulated DEGs, while motifs for members of TF families SOX and NFY were detected only in the promoter of down-regulated genes. Promoters of up-regulated genes were specifically enriched in motifs for RFX and AP-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These observations suggest that changes in chromatin accessibility, in particular at the promoter of up-regulated DEGs may be associated with differential binding of RFX and AP-1 TFs.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the overlap between DARs and the promoter of DEGs. Unexpectedly, only 3.2% of all promoters of DEGs overlap with at least one DAR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). The majority of overlapping DARs (71%) is associated with promoters of up-regulated genes in adult SCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). For example, <italic>Gpx4</italic>, a peroxidase involved in the control of stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Hu et al., 2021</xref>), is transcriptionally active in adult SCs and has an open chromatin at its promoter region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). Since the majority of DARs are located at distal intergenic regions and have histone PTMs associated with active regulatory elements, we extended our search of their target genes by assigning a large region (+/-100kb) around each DEG. We observed that a third of DEGs were associated with at least one DAR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>), with the majority of DARs (69%) overlapping regulatory elements of up-regulated genes. For instance, <italic>Braf</italic> is transcriptionally up-regulated in adult SCs, which correlates with increased chromatin accessibility at distal regulatory elements (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Our results overall show that only a fraction of DEGs is associated with DARs, suggesting that changes in gene expression are not always mirrored at the level of chromatin accessibility, consistent with recent observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kiani et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Chromatin accessibility at transposable elements (TEs) undergoes remodeling during the transition from early postnatal to adulthood in SCs</title>
<p>TEs are tightly regulated in the germline by coordinated epigenetic mechanisms involving DNA methylation, chromatin silencing and PIWI proteins-piRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Deniz et al., 2019</xref>).

<p>LTR retrotransposons were the most abundant TEs with altered chromatin accessibility, specifically ERVK and ERV1 subtypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). Exemplary ERVK subtypes with less accessible chromatin included RLTR17, RLTR9A3, RLTR12B and RMER17B (Table S5). Enrichment of RLTR17 and RLTR9 repeats was previously reported in mESCs, specifically at TFs important for pluripotency maintenance such as <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fort et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we identified the promoter region of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) <italic>Lncenc1</italic>, an important regulator of pluripotency in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fort et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), to harbor several LTR loci with decreased accessibility in adult SCs. One of these loci, RLTR17, overlap with the TSS of <italic>Lncenc1</italic>, and its decreased accessibility correlates with markedly lower <italic>Lncenc1</italic> expression in adult SCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). <italic>Lncenc1</italic> (also known as <italic>Platr18</italic>) is part of the pluripotency-associated transcript (<italic>Platr</italic>) family of lncRNAs recently identified as potential regulators of pluripotency-associated genes <italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic> and</p>
<p><italic>Zfp42</italic> in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bergmann et al., 2015</xref>). We also identified several other <italic>Platr</italic> genes such as <italic>Platr27</italic> and <italic>Platr14</italic>, whose TSS overlap with LTRs with reduced accessibility, RLTR17 and RLTR16B_MM, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and Table S5). These two pluripotency-associated transcripts tended to be downregulated in adult SCs but were unchanged at PND8 and PND15 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref> and Table S1). The other LTR subtypes with decreased accessibility in adult SCs belong to ERV1, ERVL and MaLR families (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). A few non-LTR TEs also had decreased chromatin accessibility particularly 7 DNA element subtypes, 2 satellite subtypes and 1 LINE subtype, respectively (Table S5).</p>
<p>TE subtypes with increased accessibility mostly included members of ERVK, ERVL and ERV1 families (24/42, 57.1%) (Table S5). Interestingly, many LINE L1 subtypes had increased chromatin accessibility in adult SCs (Table S5). When parsing the data for more accessible loci within L1 subtypes, we found several L1 loci situated less than +/-5kb from the TSS of olfactory (<italic>Olfr</italic>) genes, particularly <italic>Olfr</italic> gene clusters on chromosome 2, 7 and 11 (Table S5).</p>
<p>TEs are known to provide tissue-specific substrates for TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sundaram and Wysocka, 2020</xref>). We examined the regulatory potential of differentially accessible LTR subtypes by determining the enrichment of TF motifs in these regions. We grouped LTR subtypes by family (EVK, ERV1, ERVL and ERVL-MaLR families) and observed that among families with less accessible chromatin, ERVKs had the highest number of enriched TF motifs in adult SCs (Table S5). Top hits included TFs with known regulatory functions in cell proliferation and differentiation such as FOXL1 and FOXQ1, stem cell maintenance factors ELF1, EBF1 and THAP11 and TFs important for spermatogenesis PBX3, ZNF143 and NFYA/B (Table S5). ERVLs displayed motif enrichment for very few TFs, among which ETV2, recently reported to be the spermatogonial stem cell factor ZBTB7A and the testis-specific CTCF paralog CTCFL (Table S5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Green et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>More accessible LINE L1 subtypes were highly enriched in TF motifs, particularly in multiple members of ETS, E2F and FOX families (Table S5). The most significant motifs belonged to spermatogonial stem cell maintenance and stem cell potential regulators FOXO1 and ZEB1, as well as TFs recently associated with active enhancers of the stem cell-enriched population of SCs such as ZBTB17 and KLF5 (Table S5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>). More accessible ERV1s were also enriched in several TF binding sites, including spermatogenesis-related TFs (PBX3, PRDM1, NFYA/B), hypoxia inducible HIF1A and cytokine regulators STAT5A/B, suggesting different metabolic demand between postnatal and adult stage (Table S5).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examines the transcriptomic landscape and chromatin accessibility of mouse SCs from early postnatal development to adulthood. Using FACS-enriched SCs populations at PND8, PND15 and adulthood, it shows that the transcriptome of SCs is dynamically regulated during development and that many factors including pluripotency-related TFs and signaling molecules are differentially expressed. This correlates with changes in chromatin accessibility although not all DEGs have altered accessibility. TEs such as LTR retrotransposons have modified chromatin accessibility, which in some cases affects pluripotency-associated lncRNAs. TF motif enrichment in differentially accessible TEs suggested various regulatory roles in SCs.</p>

<title>Different transcriptional states characterize the postnatal development of SCs</title>
<p>SCs are known to undergo genome-wide transcriptional changes during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Grive et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hammoud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Hermann et al., 2018</xref>). The present data complement previous findings by showing that postnatal maturation of SCs is accompanied by an overall decrease in the expression of pluripotency markers and differential expression of signaling molecules and regulators of cell cycle and spermatogenesis. The high quality and depth of our RNA-seq datasets allowed us to uncover specific transitional states of SCs postnatal maturation that were not known before. For instance, we observed that while the transition from early to mid-postnatal stages (PND8 to PND15) is accompanied by changes in gene expression, the transition from mid-postnatal to adult stages is more extensive, both in number of regulated genes and magnitude of changes. We also observed a clear trend towards up-regulation of gene expression as postnatal maturation proceeds, that may reflect gradual transcriptional increase for some genes and possibly sharp changes at certain developmental stages for others.</p>
<p>Consistently, many transcriptional regulators and chromatin modifiers are differentially regulated during SCs development. Different families of TFs including factors with a specific role in SCs like RFX and DMRT, and factors with more widespread functions across cell types such as members of the AP-1 family are modulated, suggesting the contribution of multiple classes of TFs to SCs development. Notably, several transcriptional repressors and epigenetic silencers are differentially down-regulated which may explain the marked trend towards transcriptional up-regulation in our datasets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed a global down-regulation of histone genes starting at PND15 (Table S1), which may modify the composition and structure of chromatin and be associated with chromatin openness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Prado et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, our transcriptional data highlight the yet unappreciated dynamic regulation of TFs and epigenetic/chromatin modifiers in SCs during postnatal development.</p>

In particular, accessibility is increased in regions enriched in H3K4me1, a histone PTM typically associated with primed enhancers, but also to a lesser extent, in regions enriched in H3K27ac, a mark associated with active regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gasperini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that the transition of SCs from postnatal to adult stages involves changes in the regulatory genome, in particular at primed enhancers. Enhancer priming has recently been proposed as an important mechanism for SCs differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">McCarrey, 2023</xref>). Differences in chromatin accessibility may be partially explained by differential binding of TFs to regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Klemm et al., 2019</xref>). This may involve at least three non-mutually exclusive events: 1) a change in the abundance of TFs, 2) a change in the epigenetic status of TF binding sites due to different amount and/or activity of epigenetic modifiers, and 3) a change in nucleosome positioning around TF binding sites due to different amount and/or activity of chromatin remodelers. For instance, CpG methylation and nucleosome positioning can influence TF binding at regulatory elements and affect chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Barisic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kaluscha et al., 2022</xref>). The fact that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> is downregulated in adult SCs concomitantly with differential expression of TFs and chromatin modifiers may explain changes in chromatin accessibility at potential enhancers.</p>

<title>Modest correspondence between transcription and chromatin accessibility in SCs</title>
<p>Despite robust changes in gene expression in adult SCs, only a subset of DARs could be assigned to DEGs. This suggests that transcriptional regulation and chromatin accessibility at regulatory elements are not always linked and can be dissociated, as previously reported (Chereji et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kiani et al., 2022</xref>). This implies that chromatin accessibility may be modified without any effects on transcription and conversely, transcription can be activated or repressed without requiring any change in chromatin accessibility. In turn, it is possible that a repressor can be exchanged with an activator at a regulatory element but have no detectable consequences. It is also possible that changes in chromatin accessibility have no immediate effects on transcription but reflect an intermediate state that primes a gene or genomic locus for later activation or repression such as observed with developmentally- or experience-dependent primed enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Marco et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, the majority of DARs with increased accessibility overlap with regions enriched in H3K4me1, a histone PTM characteristic of primed enhancers thought to control future transcriptional responses in different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>). These regions may be important for responses to external cues in adult SCs. The apparent lack of correspondence between transcription and accessibility may also be technical and due to the stringency of filters we used to assign genomic loci to DARs. We cannot exclude the possibility that modest changes in accessibility (&lt;log2FC1) correspond to changes in TF occupancy. Chromatin accessibility has been suggested to not be the primary determinant of chromatin-mediated gene regulation (Chereji et al., 2019). Such possibility could be addressed by examining genome-wide maps of TFs, cofactors and RNA-Pol II occupancy that would provide more accurate information about the regulatory genome and its relationship with observed gene expression programs.</p>

<title>Chromatin accessibility at TEs during SCs maturation</title>
<p>Our results reveal differences in chromatin accessibility and TFs motif landscape at different TEs subtypes between PND15 and adult SCs. ERVK and ERV1 subtypes were the most abundant categories of TEs that become less accessible in adult SCs, whilst LINE L1 subtypes gained accessibility. Although the majority of these TEs reside in intergenic and intronic regions, we could detect specific loci belonging to differentially accessible ERVK and LINE L1 subtypes localized nearby TSS of distinct gene families. Notably, ERVKs are known to play an important role in the regulation of mRNA and lncRNAs transcription during spermatogenesis (Davis et al., 2017; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Sakashita et al., 2020</xref>). The landscape of chromatin accessibility at LTRs loci in SCs is known to be unique compared to other mitotic germ cells and meiotic gametes in testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Sakashita et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>RLTR17, one of the LTR subtypes with decreased chromatin accessibility in adult SCs overlaps with the TSS of several downregulated lncRNAs from the <italic>Platr</italic> family. <italic>Platr</italic> genes, including <italic>Lncenc1</italic> and <italic>Platr14</italic> identified in our study, are LTR-associated lncRNAs important for gene expression programs in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bergmann et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, RLTR17 has also previously been linked to pluripotency maintenance. In mESCs, it is highly expressed and enriched in open chromatin regions and has been shown to provide binding sites for the pluripotency factors Oct4 and Nanog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fort et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that RLTR17 chromatin organization may play a role in regulating pluripotency programs between early postnatal and adult SCs.</p>
<p>In contrast to decreased accessibility at LTRs loci, LINE L1 subtype had increased accessibility in adult SCs. Some of these L1 loci were located close to olfactory receptor genes with upregulated mRNA expression. Recent findings in mouse and human ESCs suggest a non-random genomic localization of L1 elements, specifically at genes encoding proteins with specialized functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). Among them, the <italic>Olfr</italic> gene family was the most enriched in L1 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). Although their role in SCs is currently not established, Olfr proteins have been implicated in swimming behaviour of sperm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Fukuda and Touhara, 2005</xref>). Given their dynamic regulation in SCs, we speculate that <italic>Olfr</italic> genes play additional roles in spermatogenesis, other than in sperm physiology. Together with the high number of enriched TF motifs identified at differentially accessible ERVKs and LINE L1 elements, these data highlight a regulatory role for chromatin organization of TEs in SCs during the transition from development to adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Sundaram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sundaram and Wysocka, 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One limitation of our study is the partial purity of SCs populations obtained by FACS, due to the fact that it does not fully remove other testicular cells from the samples. This therefore does not exclude the possible influence of contaminating cells on the data and their interpretation. Such influence may explain differences between our datasets and datasets in the literature. Nevertheless, by comparing chromatin landscape in developing and adult SCs, the study reveals an age-dependent dynamic reorganization of chromatin accessibility in these cells. When integrated with our transcriptomic datasets and published histone PTMs profiles, the data provide novel insight into transcriptome-chromatin dynamics of mouse SCs from early postnatal life to adulthood. This represents an important resource for future studies on mouse germ cells.</p>

<title>Germ cells isolation</title>
<p>Germ cells were isolated at postnatal day (PND) 8 or 15 for RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, and at postnatal week 20 (adult) for ATAC-seq. Testicular single-cell suspensions were prepared as previously described with slight modifications (Kubota et al., 2004a, 2004b). For PND8 and PND15 cells, testes from 2 animals were pooled for each sample while for adults, testes from individual males were used. Pup testes were collected in sterile HBSS on ice. Tunica albuginea was gently removed from each testis, making sure to keep seminiferous tubules as intact as possible. Tubules were enzymatically digested in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 7mg/ml DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 5 min at 37oC. The suspension was vigorously pipetted up and down 10 times and incubated again for 3 min at 37oC. The digestion was stopped by adding 10% fetal bovine serum (ThermoFisher Scientific) and cells were passed through a 20μm-pore-size cell strainer (Miltenyi Biotec) and pelleted by centrifugation at 600g for 7 min at 4oC. Cells were resuspended in PBS-S (PBS with 1% PBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM pyruvate, 1mg/ml glucose, 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and used for sorting. Adult testes were collected and the tunica was removed. Seminiferous tubules were digested in 1 mg/mL collagenase type IV (Sigma Aldrich) and then in 0.25 % Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco), both times for 8-12 minutes and in the presence of DNase I solution (Sigma Aldrich). FBS (Cytiva HyClone) was added to a concentration of 10 % and the cell suspension was filtered through a 40μm-pore-size cell strainer (Corning) and washed with DPBS-S (1 % FBS, 10 mM HEPES (Gibco), 1mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 1mg/mL Glucose (Gibco) and 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin (Gibco) in DPBS (Gibco). 5 mL of the single cell suspension was then overlayed on 2 mL 30 % Percoll (Sigma) and centrifuged with disabled break at 600g for 8 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and cell suspension was washed twice in DPBS-S and used for sorting.</p>

<title>SCs enrichment by FACS</title>
<p>For pup testis, dissociated cells were stained with BV421-conjugated anti-β2M, biotin-conjugated anti-THY1 (53-2.1) and PE-conjugated anti-αv-integrin (RMV-7) antibodies. THY1 was detected by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-Sav. For adult testes, cells were stained with anti-α6-integrin (CD49f; GoH3), BV421-conjugated anti-β2 microglobulin (β2M; S19.8) and R-phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-THY1 (CD90.2; 30H-12) antibodies. α6-Integrin was detected by Alexa Fluor 488-SAv after staining with biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG1/2a (G28-5) antibody. Prior to FACS, 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) was added to cell suspensions to discriminate dead cells. All antibody incubations were performed in PBS-S for at least 30 min at 4oC followed by washing in PBS-S. Antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, United States) unless otherwise stated. Cell sorting was performed at 4oC on a FACS Aria III 5L using an 85μm nozzle at the Cytometry Facility of University of Zurich. For RNA-seq at PND8 and PND15, cells were collected in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes in 500 μL PBS-S, immediately pelleted by centrifugation and snap frozen in liquid N2. Cell pellets were stored at -80oC until RNA extraction. For RNA-seq of adults, 1000 spermatogonial cells (MHC I negative, alpha-6-integrin and Thy1 positive) per male were sorted into PBS. For Omni-ATAC at PND15, 25’000 cells were collected in a separate tube, pelleted by centrifugation and immediately processed using a library preparation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Corces et al., 2017</xref>).

<p>The protocol used for assessing SCs enrichment after sorting was kindly provided by Jon Oatley at Washington State University, Pullman, USA (Yang et al., 2013). Briefly, 30,000-50,000 cells were adhered to poly-L-Lysine coated coverslips (Corning Life Sciences) in 24-well plates for 1 h. Cells were fixed in freshly prepared 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature then washed in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBS-T). Non-specific antibody binding was blocked by incubation with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated overnight at 4oC with mouse anti-PLZF (0.2 μg/ml, Active Motif) primary antibody. Alexa488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1 µg/mL, ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for secondary labelling at 4oC for 1 h. Coverslips were washed 3 times, mounted onto glass slides with VectaShield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. SCs enrichment was determined by counting PLZF+ cells in 10 random fields of view from each coverslip and dividing by the total number of cells present in the same fields of view (DAPI-stained nuclei). The number of PLZF+ and PLZF-cells from the 10 different fields of view was averaged.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and RNA-seq library preparation</title>
<p>For RNA-seq at PND8 and PND15, total RNA was extracted from sorted cells using AllPrep RNA/DNA Micro kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies). Samples were quantified using Qubit RNA HS Assay (ThermoFisher Scientific). RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v3 (Takara Bio USA, Inc) following the recommended protocol with minor adjustments. For PND8 and PND15 SCs libraries, RNA was fragmented for 4 minutes at 94 °C. After reverse transcription, samples were barcoded using SMARTer Unique Dual Index Kit (Takara Bio USA, Inc). Five PCR cycles were run and PCR products were purified using AMPure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences; bead:sample ratio 0.8X). Ribosomal cDNA was depleted following the protocol and final library amplification was performed with 12 PCR cycles. Libraries were purified twice using AMPure XP reagent (bead:sample ratio 1X) and eluted in Tris buffer. Adult SCs libraries were prepared using the option to start directly from cells (1000 cells as input). Cells were incubated for 6 minutes at 85 °C and processed as indicated for PND8 and PND15 SCs. Samples were pooled at equal molarity, as determined in a 100-800 bp window on the Bioanalyzer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors appear to be attempting to describe dynamic changes in the chromatin landscape in spermatogonial cells during postnatal development ranging from prepubertal stages at postnatal days 8 or 15 to adult stages. The authors attempt to relate differences they observe in chromatin accessibility at these different stages to changes in gene expression to better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating this differential gene expression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The primary strength of the manuscript is that it provides additional datasets describing gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterns in spermatogonial cells at different postnatal ages.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There appears to be a lack of basic knowledge of the process of spermatogenesis. For instance, the statement that &quot;During the first week of postnatal life, a population of SCs continues to proliferate to give rise to undifferentiated Asingle (As), Apaired (Apr) and Aaligned (Aal) cells. The remaining SCs differentiate to form chains of daughter cells that become primary and secondary permatocytes around postnatal day (PND) 10 to 12.&quot; is inaccurate. The Aal cells are the spermatogonial chains, the two are not distinct from one another. In addition, the authors fail to mention spermatogonial stem cells which form the basis for steady-state spermatogenesis. The authors also do not acknowledge the well-known fact that, in the mouse, the first wave of spermatogenesis is distinct from subsequent waves. Finally, the authors do not mention the presence of both undifferentiated spermatogonia (aka - type A) and differentiating spermatogonia (aka - type B). The premise for the study they present appears to be the implication that little is known about the dynamics of chromatin during the development of spermatogonia. However, there are published studies on this topic that have already provided much of the information that is presented in the current manuscript.</p>
<p>It is not clear which spermatogonial subtype the authors intended to profile with their analyses. On the one hand, they used PLZF to FACS sort cells. This typically enriches for undifferentiated spermatogonia. On the other hand, they report detection in the sorted population of markers such as c-KIT which is a well-known marker of differentiating spermatogonia, and that is in the same population in which ID4, a well-known marker of spermatogonial stem cells, was detected. The authors cite multiple previously published studies of gene expression during spermatogenesis, including studies of gene expression in spermatogonia. It is not at all clear what the authors' data adds to the previously available data on this subject.</p>
<p>The authors analyzed cells recovered at PND 8 and 15 and compared those to cells recovered from the adult testis. The PND 8 and 15 cells would be from the initial wave of spermatogenesis whereas those from the adult testis would represent steady-state spermatogenesis. However, as noted above, there appears to be a lack of awareness of the well-established differences between spermatogenesis occurring at each of these stages.</p>
<p>In general, the authors present observational data of the sort that is generated by RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses, and they speculate on the potential significance of several of these observations. However, they provide no definitive data to support any of their speculations. This further illustrates the fact that this study contributes little if any new information beyond that already available from the numerous previously published RNA-seq and ATAC-seq studies of spermatogenesis. In short, the study described in this manuscript does not advance the field.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of epigenetic priming is discussed, but then it seems that there is some expression of surprise that the data demonstrate what this reviewer would argue are examples of that phenomenon. The authors discuss the &quot;modest correspondence between transcription and chromatin accessibility in SCs.&quot; Chromatin accessibility is an example of an epigenetic parameter associated with the primed state. The primed state is not fully equivalent to the actively expressing state. It appears that certain histone modifications along with transcription factors are critical to the transition between the primed and actively expressing states (in either direction). The cell types that were investigated in this study are closely related spermatogenic, and predominantly spermatogonial cell types. It is very likely that the differentially expressed loci will be primed in both the early (PND 8 or 15) and adult stages, even though those genes are differentially expressed at those stages. Thus, it is not surprising that there is not a strict concordance between +/- chromatin accessibility and +/- active or elevated expression.</p>

<p>The objective of this study from Lazar-Contes et al. is to examine chromatin accessibility changes in &quot;spermatogonial cells&quot; (SCs) across testis development. Exactly what SCs are, however, remains a mystery. The authors mention in the abstract that SCs are undifferentiated male germ cells and have self-renewal and differentiation activity, which would be true for Spermatogonial STEM Cells (SSCs), a very small subset of total spermatogonia, but then the methods they use to retrieve such cells using antibodies that enrich for undifferentiated spermatogonia encompass both undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia. Data in Fig. 1B prove that most (85-95%) are PLZF+, but PLZF is known to be expressed both by undifferentiated and differentiating (KIT+) spermatogonia (Niedenberger et al., 2015; PMID: 25737569). Thus, the bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data arising from these cells constitute the aggregate results comprising the phenotype of a highly heterogeneous mixture of spermatogonia (plus contaminating somatic cells), NOT SSCs. Indeed, Fig. 1C demonstrates this by showing the detection of Kit mRNA (a well-known marker of differentiating spermatogonia - which the authors claim on line 89 is a marker of SCs!), along with the detection of markers of various somatic cell populations (albeit at lower levels). This admixture problem influences the results - the authors show ATAC-seq accessibility traces for several genes in Fig. 2E (exhibiting differences between P15 and Adult), including Ihh, which is not expressed by spermatogenic cells, and Col6a1, which is expressed by peritubular myoid cells. Thus, the methods in this paper are fundamentally flawed, which precludes drawing any firm conclusions from the data about changes in chromatin accessibility among spermatogonia (SCs?) across postnatal testis development. In addition, there already are numerous scRNA-seq datasets from mouse spermatogenic cells at the same developmental stages in question. Moreover, several groups have used bulk ATAC-seq to profile enriched populations of spermatogonia, including from synchronized spermatogenesis which reflects a high degree of purity (see Maezawa et al., 2018 PMID: 29126117 and Schlief et al., 2023 PMID: 36983846 and in cultured spermatogonia - Suen et al., 2022 PMID: 36509798) - so this topic has already begun to be examined. None of these papers was cited, so it appears the authors were unaware of this work. The authors' methodological choice is even more surprising given the wealth of single-cell evidence in the literature since 2018 demonstrating the exceptional heterogeneity among spermatogonia at these developmental stages (the authors DID cite some of these papers, so they are aware). Indeed, it is currently possible to perform concurrent scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq (10x Genomics Multiome), which would have made these data quite useful and robust. As it stands, given the lack of novelty and critical methodological flaws, readers should be cautioned that there is little new information to be learned about spermatogenesis from this study, and in fact, the data in Figures 2-5 may lead readers astray because they do not reflect the biology of any one type of male germ cell. Indeed, not only do these data not add to our understanding of spermatogonial development, but they are damaging to the field if their source and identity are properly understood. Here are some specific examples of the problems with these data:</p>
<p>1. Fig. 2D - Gata4 and Lhcgr are not expressed by germ cells in the testis.</p>
<p>2. Fig. 3A - WT1 is expressed by Sertoli cells, so the change in accessibility of regions containing a WT1 motif suggests differential contamination with Sertoli cells. Since Wt1 mRNA was differentially high in P15 (Fig. 3B) - this seems to be the most likely explanation for the results. How was this excluded?</p>
<p>3. Fig. 3D - Since Dmrt1 is expressed by Sertoli cells, the &quot;downregulation&quot; likely represents a reduction in Sertoli cell contamination in the adult, like the point above. Did the authors consider this?</p>

<p>In this study, Lazar-Contes and colleagues aimed to determine whether chromatin accessibility changes in the spermatogonial population during different phases of postnatal mammalian testis development. Because actions of the spermatogonial population set the foundation for continual and robust spermatogenesis and the gene networks regulating their biology are undefined, the goal of the study has merit. To advance knowledge, the authors used mice as a model and isolated spermatogonia from three different postnatal developmental age points using a cell sorting methodology that was based on cell surface markers reported in previous studies and then performed bulk RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing. Overall, the technical aspects of the sequencing analyses and computational/bioinformatics seem sound but there are several concerns with the cell population isolated from testes and lack of acknowledgment for previous studies that have also performed ATAC-sequencing on spermatogonia of mouse and human testes. The limitations, described below, call into question the validity of the interpretations and reduce the potential merit of the findings.</p>
<p>I suggest changing the acronym for spermatogonial cells from SC to SPG for two reasons. First, SPG is the commonly used acronym in the field of mammalian spermatogenesis. Second, SC is commonly used for Sertoli Cells.</p>
<p>The authors should provide a rationale for why they used postnatal day 8 and 15 mice.</p>
<p>The FACS sorting approach used was based on cell surface proteins that are not germline-specific so there were undoubtedly somatic cells in the samples used for both RNA and ATAC sequencing. Thus, it is essential to demonstrate the level of both germ cell and undifferentiated spermatogonial enrichment in the isolated and profiled cell populations. To achieve this, the authors used PLZF as a biomarker of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Although PLZF is indeed expressed by undifferentiated spermatogonia, there have been several studies demonstrating that expression extends into differentiating spermatogonia. In addition, PLZF is not germ-cell specific and single-cell RNA-seq analyses of testicular tissue have revealed that there are somatic cell populations that express Plzf, at least at the mRNA level. For these reasons, I suggest that the authors assess the isolated cell populations using a germ-cell specific biomarker such as DDX4 in combination with PLZF to get a more accurate assessment of the undifferentiated spermatogonial composition. This assessment is essential for the interpretation of the RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data that was generated.</p>
<p>A previous study by the Namekawa lab (PMID: 29126117) performed ATAC-seq on a similar cell population (THY1+ FACS sorted) that was isolated from pre-pubertal mouse testes. It was surprising to not see this study referenced in the current manuscript. In addition, it seems prudent to cross-reference the two ATAC-seq datasets for commonalities and differences. In addition, there are several published studies on scATAC-seq of human spermatogonia that might be of interest to cross-reference with the ATAC-seq data presented in the current study to provide an understanding of translational merit for the findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1  (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:
There appears to be a lack of basic knowledge of the process of spermatogenesis. For instance, the statement that &quot;During the first week of postnatal life, a population of SCs continues to proliferate to give rise to undifferentiated Asingle (As), Apaired (Apr) and Aaligned (Aal) cells. The remaining SCs differentiate to form chains of daughter cells that become primary and secondary permatocytes around postnatal day (PND) 10 to 12.&quot; is inaccurate. The Aal cells are the spermatogonial chains, the two are not distinct from one another. In addition, the authors fail to mention spermatogonial stem cells which form the basis for steady-state spermatogenesis. The authors also do not acknowledge the well-known fact that, in the mouse, the first wave of spermatogenesis is distinct from subsequent waves. Finally, the authors do not mention the presence of both undifferentiated spermatogonia (aka - type A) and differentiating spermatogonia (aka - type B). The premise for the study they present appears to be the implication that little is known about the dynamics of chromatin during the development of spermatogonia. However, there are published studies on this topic that have already provided much of the information that is presented in the current manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s criticism about the inaccuracy and incompleteness of some of the statements about spermatogonial cells and spermatogenesis. We will be improve the text accordingly in the reviewed manuscript. We will also clarify the premise of the study which was to complement existing datasets on spermatogonial cells by providing parallel transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility maps of high resolution from the same cell populations at early postnatal, late postnatal and adult stages collected from single individuals (for adults). These features make our datasets comprehensive and an important additional resource for people in the community. We will also revise the description of published studies to be more inclusive.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not clear which spermatogonial subtype the authors intended to profile with their analyses. On the one hand, they used PLZF to FACS sort cells. This typically enriches for undifferentiated spermatogonia. On the other hand, they report detection in the sorted population of markers such as c-KIT which is a well-known marker of differentiating spermatogonia, and that is in the same population in which ID4, a well-known marker of spermatogonial stem cells, was detected. The authors cite multiple previously published studies of gene expression during spermatogenesis, including studies of gene expression in spermatogonia. It is not at all clear what the authors' data adds to the previously available data on this subject.</p>
<p>The authors analyzed cells recovered at PND 8 and 15 and compared those to cells recovered from the adult testis. The PND 8 and 15 cells would be from the initial wave of spermatogenesis whereas those from the adult testis would represent steady-state spermatogenesis. However, as noted above, there appears to be a lack of awareness of the well-established differences between spermatogenesis occurring at each of these stages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer correctly points that our samples contain both undifferentiated spermatogonial stem cells and differentiated spermatogonia, which is expected from the chosen FACS strategy. We clearly mention the fact that our populations are mixed and that our samples are 85-95% PLZF+ enriched. We also acknowledge the possible presence of contaminating cells that may influence the results and data interpretation in the section “Limitations”. We believe that this does not diminish the value of the datasets. But to further increase their usefulness and improve their interpretation, we will conduct new analyses and apply computational methods to deconvolute our bulk RNA-seq datasets in silico (PMID: 37528411) using publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Such analyses shall correct for cell-type heterogeneity and provide information about the cellular composition of our cell preparations clarifying the representation of undifferentiated and differentiated spermatogonial cells and the possible presence of somatic cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In general, the authors present observational data of the sort that is generated by RNA-seq and ATAC-seq analyses, and they speculate on the potential significance of several of these observations. However, they provide no definitive data to support any of their speculations. This further illustrates the fact that this study contributes little if any new information beyond that already available from the numerous previously published RNA-seq and ATAC-seq studies of spermatogenesis. In short, the study described in this manuscript does not advance the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that RNA-seq and ATAC-seq datasets like ours are observational and that their interpretation can be speculative. Nevertheless, our datasets represent an additional useful resource for the community because they are comprehensive and high resolution, and can be exploited for instance, for studies in environmental epigenetics and epigenetic inheritance examining the immediate and long-term effects of postnatal exposure and their dynamics. The depth of our RNA sequencing allowed detect transcripts with a high dynamic range, which has been limited with classical RNA sequencing analyses of spermatogonial cells and with single-cell analyses (which have comparatively low coverage). Further, our experimental pipeline is affordable (more than single cell sequencing approaches) and in the case of adults, provides data per animal informing on the intrinsic variability in transcriptional and chromatin regulation across males. These points will be discussed in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The phenomenon of epigenetic priming is discussed, but then it seems that there is some expression of surprise that the data demonstrate what this reviewer would argue are examples of that phenomenon. The authors discuss the &quot;modest correspondence between transcription and chromatin accessibility in SCs.&quot; Chromatin accessibility is an example of an epigenetic parameter associated with the primed state. The primed state is not fully equivalent to the actively expressing state. It appears that certain histone modifications along with transcription factors are critical to the transition between the primed and actively expressing states (in either direction). The cell types that were investigated in this study are closely related spermatogenic, and predominantly spermatogonial cell types. It is very likely that the differentially expressed loci will be primed in both the early (PND 8 or 15) and adult stages, even though those genes are differentially expressed at those stages. Thus, it is not surprising that there is not a strict concordance between +/- chromatin accessibility and +/- active or elevated expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is right that a strict concordance between chromatin accessibility and transcription is not necessarily expected. The text of the revised manuscript will be modified accordingly. However, we would like to note that our data strengthen the observations made by others that in cells from the same lineage, the global landscape of chromatin accessibility is more stable than their transcriptional programs over developmental time.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The objective of this study from Lazar-Contes et al. is to examine chromatin accessibility changes in &quot;spermatogonial cells&quot; (SCs) across testis development. Exactly what SCs are, however, remains a mystery. The authors mention in the abstract that SCs are undifferentiated male germ cells and have self-renewal and differentiation activity, which would be true for Spermatogonial STEM Cells (SSCs), a very small subset of total spermatogonia, but then the methods they use to retrieve such cells using antibodies that enrich for undifferentiated spermatogonia encompass both undifferentiated and differentiating spermatogonia. Data in Fig. 1B prove that most (85-95%) are PLZF+, but PLZF is known to be expressed both by undifferentiated and differentiating (KIT+) spermatogonia (Niedenberger et al., 2015; PMID: 25737569). Thus, the bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data arising from these cells constitute the aggregate results comprising the phenotype of a highly heterogeneous mixture of spermatogonia (plus contaminating somatic cells), NOT SSCs. Indeed, Fig. 1C demonstrates this by showing the detection of Kit mRNA (a well-known marker of differentiating spermatogonia - which the authors claim on line 89 is a marker of SCs!), along with the detection of markers of various somatic cell populations (albeit at lower levels).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that our spermatogonial cell populations are mixed and include undifferentiated and differentiated cells, hence the name of spermatogonia (SCs), and probably also contain some somatic cells. We acknowledge that this is a limitation of our isolation approach. To circumvent this limitation, we will conduct in silico deconvolution analysis using publicly available single cell RNA sequencing datasets to obtain information about markers corresponding to undifferentiated and differentiated spermatogonia cells, and somatic cells. These additional analyses will provide information about the cellular composition of the samples and clarify the representation of undifferentiated and differentiated spermatogonial cells and other cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This admixture problem influences the results - the authors show ATAC-seq accessibility traces for several genes in Fig. 2E (exhibiting differences between P15 and Adult), including Ihh, which is not expressed by spermatogenic cells, and Col6a1, which is expressed by peritubular myoid cells. Thus, the methods in this paper are fundamentally flawed, which precludes drawing any firm conclusions from the data about changes in chromatin accessibility among spermatogonia (SCs?) across postnatal testis development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises concern about the lack of correspondence between chromatin accessibility and expression observed for some genes, arguing that this precludes drawing firm conclusions. However, a dissociation between chromatin accessibility and gene expression is normal and expected since chromatin accessibility is only a readout of protein deposition and occupancy e.g. by transcription factors, chromatin regulators, nucleosomes, at specific genomic loci that does not give functional information of whether there is ongoing transcriptional activity or not. A gene that is repressed or poised for expression can still show clear signal of chromatin accessibility at regulatory elements. The dissociation between chromatin accessibility and transcription has been reported in many different cells and conditions (PMID: 36069349, PMID: 33098772) including in spermatogonial cells (PMID: 28985528) and in gonads in different species (PMID: 36323261). Therefore, the dissociation between accessibility and transcription is not a reason to conclude that our data are flawed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, there already are numerous scRNA-seq datasets from mouse spermatogenic cells at the same developmental stages in question.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is true but full transcriptomic profiling like ours on cell populations provides different transcriptional information that is deeper and more comprehensive. Our datasets identified &gt;17,000 genes while scRNA-seq typically identifies a few thousands of genes. Our analyses also identified full length transcripts, variants, isoforms and low abundance transcripts. These datasets are therefore a valuable addition to existing scRNA-seq.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, several groups have used bulk ATAC-seq to profile enriched populations of spermatogonia, including from synchronized spermatogenesis which reflects a high degree of purity (see Maezawa et al., 2018 PMID: 29126117 and Schlief et al., 2023 PMID: 36983846 and in cultured spermatogonia - Suen et al., 2022 PMID: 36509798) - so this topic has already begun to be examined. None of these papers was cited, so it appears the authors were unaware of this work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for not mentioning these studies in our manuscript, we will do so in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors' methodological choice is even more surprising given the wealth of single-cell evidence in the literature since 2018 demonstrating the exceptional heterogeneity among spermatogonia at these developmental stages (the authors DID cite some of these papers, so they are aware). Indeed, it is currently possible to perform concurrent scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq (10x Genomics Multiome), which would have made these data quite useful and robust. As it stands, given the lack of novelty and critical methodological flaws, readers should be cautioned that there is little new information to be learned about spermatogenesis from this study, and in fact, the data in Figures 2-5 may lead readers astray because they do not reflect the biology of any one type of male germ cell. Indeed, not only do these data not add to our understanding of spermatogonial development, but they are damaging to the field if their source and identity are properly understood. Here are some specific examples of the problems with these data:</p>
<p>1. Fig. 2D - Gata4 and Lhcgr are not expressed by germ cells in the testis.</p>
<p>1. Fig. 3A - WT1 is expressed by Sertoli cells, so the change in accessibility of regions containing a WT1 motif suggests differential contamination with Sertoli cells. Since Wt1 mRNA was differentially high in P15 (Fig. 3B) - this seems to be the most likely explanation for the results. How was this excluded?</p>
<p>1. Fig. 3D - Since Dmrt1 is expressed by Sertoli cells, the &quot;downregulation&quot; likely represents a reduction in Sertoli cell contamination in the adult, like the point above. Did the authors consider this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that concurrent scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq analyses have been done by others but our datasets add to these analyses by providing concurrent chromatin and expression analyses at high resolution in spermatogonial populations at 2 postnatal stages and in adulthood and from individual males (for adult cells). This provides a set of information that adds to the current literature. Doing such analyses in single cells is not tractable financially so we offer an economical alternative that delivers high resolution datasets for these different time points. Our analyses were not meant to study spermatogenesis but to provide a thorough and comprehensive profiling of chromatin accessibility and transcription in postnatal and adult spermatogonial cells.</p>
<p>Our data need careful interpretation to avoid any misleading conclusions. Fig. 2D does not show expression but accessibility which does not tell if a particular locus or gene is expressed or not. Thus, candidates like Gata4 and Lhcgr shown in Fig. 2D are simply associated with DARs but this does not mean that they are expressed. Likewise in Fig. 3A, motifs refer to decreased accessibility and not to expression. Fig. 1C indicates that PND15 cells have low to no expression of 3 Sertoli cells markers (Vim, Tspan17 and Rhox), suggesting little contamination by Sertoli cells. The presence of WT1 in PND15 cells will however be examined more carefully and re-analysed by in silico deconvolution methods using single cell datasets for the revised manuscript. In Fig. 3D, differential contamination by Sertoli cells is possible, this will also be examined by deconvolution methods.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Lazar-Contes and colleagues aimed to determine whether chromatin accessibility changes in the spermatogonial population during different phases of postnatal mammalian testis development. Because actions of the spermatogonial population set the foundation for continual and robust spermatogenesis and the gene networks regulating their biology are undefined, the goal of the study has merit. To advance knowledge, the authors used mice as a model and isolated spermatogonia from three different postnatal developmental age points using a cell sorting methodology that was based on cell surface markers reported in previous studies and then performed bulk RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing. Overall, the technical aspects of the sequencing analyses and computational/bioinformatics seem sound but there are several concerns with the cell population isolated from testes and lack of acknowledgment for previous studies that have also performed ATAC-sequencing on spermatogonia of mouse and human testes. The limitations, described below, call into question the validity of the interpretations and reduce the potential merit of the findings.</p>
<p>I suggest changing the acronym for spermatogonial cells from SC to SPG for two reasons. First, SPG is the commonly used acronym in the field of mammalian spermatogenesis. Second, SC is commonly used for Sertoli Cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and will rename SCs into SPGs in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>The authors should provide a rationale for why they used postnatal day 8 and 15 mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will provide a rationale for the use of postnatal 8 and 15 stages in the revised manuscript. Briefly, these stages are interesting to study because early to mid postnatal life is a critical window of development for germ cells during which environmental exposure can have strong and persistent effects. The possibility that changes in germ cells can happen during this period and persist until adulthood is an important area of research linked to disciplines like epigenetic toxicology and epigenetic inheritance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The FACS sorting approach used was based on cell surface proteins that are not germline-specific so there were undoubtedly somatic cells in the samples used for both RNA and ATAC sequencing. Thus, it is essential to demonstrate the level of both germ cell and undifferentiated spermatogonial enrichment in the isolated and profiled cell populations. To achieve this, the authors used PLZF as a biomarker of undifferentiated spermatogonia. Although PLZF is indeed expressed by undifferentiated spermatogonia, there have been several studies demonstrating that expression extends into differentiating spermatogonia. In addition, PLZF is not germ-cell specific and single-cell RNA-seq analyses of testicular tissue have revealed that there are somatic cell populations that express Plzf, at least at the mRNA level. For these reasons, I suggest that the authors assess the isolated cell populations using a germ-cell specific biomarker such as DDX4 in combination with PLZF to get a more accurate assessment of the undifferentiated spermatogonial composition. This assessment is essential for the interpretation of the RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data that was generated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is right that our cell populations likely contain undifferentiated and differentiated spermatogonial cells and a small percentage of somatic cells including Sertoli cells. As suggested, we examined the expression of the germ-cell marker Ddx4 in our datasets and observed that Ddx4 is highly expressed. It is indeed more highly expressed than the SSC marker Id4 (average log2CPM of 5 vs 8, respectively). We will include this information in the revised manuscript. Further, the deconvolution analyses that will be conducted are expected to clarify the cellular composition of our cell populations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A previous study by the Namekawa lab (PMID: 29126117) performed ATAC-seq on a similar cell population (THY1+ FACS sorted) that was isolated from pre-pubertal mouse testes. It was surprising to not see this study referenced in the current manuscript. In addition, it seems prudent to cross-reference the two ATAC-seq datasets for commonalities and differences. In addition, there are several published studies on scATAC-seq of human spermatogonia that might be of interest to cross-reference with the ATAC-seq data presented in the current study to provide an understanding of translational merit for the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this study as well as other studies in human spermatogonia. We will cross-reference all of them in the revised manuscript.</p>
