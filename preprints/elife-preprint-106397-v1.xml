<title>Abstract</title><p>Endogenous intracellular allosteric modulators of GPCRs remain largely unexplored, with limited binding and phenotype data available. This gap arises from the lack of robust computational methods for unbiased cavity identification, cavity-specific ligand design, synthesis, and validation across GPCR topology. Here, we developed Gcoupler, an AI-driven generalized computational toolkit that leverages an integrative approach combining <italic>de novo</italic> ligand design, statistical methods, Graph Neural Networks, and Bioactivity-based ligand prioritization for rationally predicting high-affinity ligands. Using Gcoupler, we interrogated intracellular metabolites that target and regulate the GPCR-Gα interface (Ste2p-Gpa1p), affecting pheromone-induced programmed cell death in yeast. Our computational analysis, complemented by experimental validations, including genetic screening, multi-omics, site-directed mutagenesis, biochemical assays, and physiological readouts, identified endogenous hydrophobic metabolites, notably sterols, as direct intracellular allosteric modulators of Ste2p. Molecular simulations coupled with biochemical signaling assessment in site-directed Ste2p mutants further confirmed metabolites binding to GPCR-Gα obstruct downstream signaling, possibly via cohesive effect. Finally, by utilizing isoproterenol-induced, GPCR-mediated human and neonatal rat cardiac hypertrophy models, we observed elevated metabolite levels attenuate hypertrophic response, reinforcing the evolutionary relevance of this mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical regulators of cellular processes and thus represent prime drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). While traditional GPCR-targeted therapies focus on orthosteric sites, recent advances have revealed allosteric sites offering novel therapeutic avenues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Although exogenous synthetic allosteric modulators are known, endogenous counterparts remain poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Developing high-affinity endogenous modulators requires integrating structure-based design, artificial intelligence (AI), and assays, yet traditional approaches like SAR analysis are hampered by limited GPCR allosteric modulator data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). While experimental techniques like FRET and BRET can validate allosteric compounds, their use in high-throughput screening for novel intracellular modulators is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Identifying endogenous GPCR allosteric modulators is further complicated by factors like incomplete GPCR topology data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and vast chemical space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). This necessitates a hybrid computational approach combining allosteric site prediction, <italic>de novo</italic> ligand synthesis, and efficient screening, potentially enhanced by AI. Existing <italic>de novo</italic> drug design tools often lack practical applicability for this purpose due to computational limitations and high technical demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>).</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, we developed Gcoupler, a software suite (available as a Python package and Docker image) that integrates structural biology, statistical methods, and deep learning to identify GPCR allosteric modulators. We demonstrated the usability and applicability of Gcoupler in identifying novel endogenous modulators of GPCRs by exploiting the α-pheromone (α-factor)-induced mating or programmed cell death (PCD) pathway of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Notably, it is well documented that the highly elevated, non-physiological levels of α-factor trigger PCD in less than half of the MATa population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Moreover, an equivalent concentration of α-factor triggers distinct PCD kinetics across distinct laboratory strains; for example, BY4741 is more resistant than the W303 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that a subset of pheromone-resistant cells might regulate the Ste2p-mediated PCD signaling via the endogenous intracellular metabolites by operating at the Ste2-Gα binding interface. Using Gcoupler, we identified a subset of intracellular metabolites that could potentially bind to Ste2p (GPCR) at the Gpa1 (Gα) binding interface and obstruct the downstream signaling. Our computational results further suggest that hydrophobic ligands such as sterols strengthen the Ste2p-Gpa1p binding and might trigger a cohesive response that potentially obstructs downstream signaling. Experimental evidence further supported these findings that the elevated intracellular levels of these metabolites rescue the pheromone-induced PCD. To evaluate the evolutionary conservation and possible clinically relevant translation of this mechanism, we tested these metabolites on human and rat isoproterenol-induced, GPCR-mediated cardiac hypertrophy model systems and observed attenuated response in the cardiomyocytes pretreated with GPCR-Gα-protein interface modulating metabolites.</p>

<title>Development and validation of Gcoupler</title>
<p>Designing novel target molecules by integrating the topological, chemical, and physical attributes of protein cavities necessitates advanced neural networks. While existing approaches like Bicyclic Generative Adversarial Networks (BicycleGANs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) have demonstrated potential, end-to-end standalone tools for GPCR-specific ligand design remain scarce. To address this, we developed Gcoupler, a Python package and Docker image for structure-based, cavity-dependent <italic>de novo</italic> ligand design, employing advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and robust statistical methods. Gcoupler consists of four interconnected modules, i.e., Synthesizer, Authenticator, Generator, and BioRanker, all together offering an intuitive workflow for ligand design, screening, and prioritization.</p>
<p>The Synthesizer module identifies putative cavities in protein structures, providing users with flexibility to select cavities based on druggability scores or user-supplied critical residues. Leveraging LigBuilder V3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), it generates cavity-specific ligands influenced by topology and pharmacophores, outputting SMILES, cavity coordinates, and other requisite files to downstream modules for further steps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). By default, it synthesizes 500 molecules using a hybrid Growing-Linking mode optimized through genetic algorithms though it can also be user-defined. Notably, the fragment library of LigBuilder, comprising of 177 distinct molecular fragments in Mol2 format, allows the selection of multiple seed structures and extensions that best complement the cavity pharmacophores throughout multiple iterative runs. The Synthesizer module of Gcoupler enhances LigBuilder V3 for GPCR ligand design but lacks user-defined library screening, and proposes synthetically challenging molecules, and often requires post-processing to isolate high-affinity binders from a broad affinity range of synthetically designed compounds.</p>

</fig>
<p>To address these challenges, we developed Authenticator which validates Synthesizer outputs by segregating high-and low-affinity binders (HABs and LABs) <italic>via</italic> virtual screening using the AutoDock Vina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) and statistically testing the differences in the binding energies distributions using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Epps-Singleton, and Anderson-Darling Test. This module refines synthetic ligand pools by analyzing binding energy distributions, facilitating informed segregation while allowing user-defined thresholds and hypothesis testing for flexibility. The Generator, the third module, employs state-of-the-art GNN models such as Graph Convolution Model (GCM), Graph Convolution Network (GCN), Attentive FP (AFP), and Graph Attention Network (GAT) to construct predictive classifiers using Authenticator-informed classes. With automated hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation, it ensures robust model training and minimizes overfitting. Notably, by default, Gcoupler employs three-fold cross-validation, but users can adjust this parameter.</p>
<p>Finally, BioRanker, the last module prioritizes ligands through statistical and bioactivity-based tools. The first level ranking offered by BioRanker is composed of a statistical tool that encompasses two distinct algorithms, namely G-means and Youden’s J statistics, to assist users in identifying the optimal probability threshold, thereby refining the selection of high-confidence hit compounds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 1a</xref>). Additionally, bioactivity embeddings computed via Signaturizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) enable multi-activity-based ranking using a modified PageRank algorithm. Taken together, Gcoupler is a versatile platform supporting user-defined inputs, third-party tools for cavity selection, and customizable statistical analyses, enhancing its adaptability for diverse ligand design and screening tasks. This integrated framework streamlines cavity-specific ligand design, screening, and ranking, providing a comprehensive solution for GPCR-targeted drug discovery.</p>
<p>To evaluate Gcoupler’s performance, we tested its modules across five GPCRs (AA2AR, ADRB1, ADRB2, CXCR4, and DRD3) using experimentally validated ligands and matched decoys from the DUD-E dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Gcoupler accurately identified orthosteric ligand-binding sites and additional allosteric cavities across all targets, validating its <italic>de novo</italic> cavity detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 1b</xref>). For orthosteric sites, the Synthesizer module generated ∼500 compounds per GPCR, and the Authenticator module classified these into high- and low-affinity binders using thresholds optimized for each GPCR (-7 kcal/mol for AA2AR, CXCR4, DRD3; -8 kcal/mol for ADRB1, ADRB2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 1c</xref>). Statistical validation confirmed significant separation between these groups (p &lt; 0.0001), enabling the Generator module to construct graph-based classification models with high values of AUC-ROC (&gt;0.95), sensitivity, and specificity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure d-e</xref>). These models reliably distinguished ligands from decoys, demonstrating Gcoupler’s accuracy in identifying high-affinity ligands. We extended this validation to allosteric sites using three GPCR-ligand complexes (β2AR-Cmpd-15PA, CCR2-CCR2-RA-[R], CCR9-Vercirnon) from the PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Gcoupler successfully identified allosteric binding sites and generated classification models for synthetic compounds with consistently high AUC-ROC values (&gt;0.95) <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 2a-c</xref>). Projection of experimentally validated ligands onto these models further confirmed their predictive accuracy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>), underscoring Gcoupler’s robustness and versatility for orthosteric and allosteric ligand discovery. We next benchmarked Gcoupler’s efficiency against AutoDock using the alpha-1A adrenergic receptor (993 agonists from ChEMBL31). Gcoupler was 13.5 times faster, leveraging its deep learning-based Generator module and AutoDock Vina’s efficiency. Both methods provided comparable predictions for active compounds, demonstrating Gcoupler’s speed and accuracy, making it ideal for large-scale ligand design and drug discovery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 3a-h</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally we used Gcoupler to evaluate the ligand space conservation (functional conservation) of the GPCR-Gα interface. We analyzed multiple human GPCR-Gα complexes from the PDB (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), identifyed conserved motifs (DRY, CWxL, NPxxY) and binding pockets through sequence and structural analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>). Structural conservation was quantified by normalized RMSD values (mean: 1.47 Å; median: 0.86 Å), confirmed robust topological similarity at the GPCR-Gα interfaces (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h-j</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 3i-k, Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Using Gcoupler, ∼50 ligands per GPCR were synthesized, with physicochemical property analysis (via Mordred) and revealed high cosine similarity, which further supports the functional conservation of GPCR-Gα interface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h, k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 3l, Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In summary, we used Gcoupler to systematically evaluate and analyze the ligand profiles of the GPCR-Gα-protein interface and observed a higher degree of sequence, topological, and functional conservation.</p>

<title>Gcoupler reveals endogenous, intracellular Ste2p allosteric modulators</title>
<p>We next utilized Gcoupler to test the hypothesis that the intracellular metabolites could potentially and directly regulate the GPCR signaling by directly interacting with the GPCR-Gα-protein interaction interface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1l</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we utilized a well-characterized yeast mating pathway mediated via the Ste2p-Gpa1p interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). Gcoupler was employed to screen metabolites from the Yeast Metabolome Database (YMDB) against the yeast phospholipid bilayer-embedded molecular dynamics simulated cryo-EM structure of Ste2p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 4b-i</xref>). This led to the identification of 17 potential surface cavities on Ste2p, with two intracellular regions, IC4 and IC5, accounting for over 95% of the Ste2p-Gpa1p interface <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 4j-n</xref>). Conservation analysis of these cavities across 14 yeast species further confirmed their structural significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 4o</xref>). We independently ran Gcoupler for IC4 and IC5, compared their chemical diversity to ligands for the extracellular cavity (EC1), revealing distinct pharmacophore properties, and confirmed cavity-specific chemical spaces through principal component analysis (PCA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 5a-e</xref>). We further assessed the reproducibility of the Gcoupler by synthesizing 100 in silico compounds per run across five runs for the Ste2p IC4 cavity.

<p>Post these performance/reproducibility checks of Gcoupler, we finally generated high-affinity (HABs) and low-affinity (LABs) binders, screened yeast metabolites using a hyperparameter-tuned Graph Neural Network (Attentive FP), and predicted potential binders to IC4 and IC5 with a &gt;0.5 binding probability. AutoDock-based molecular docking of YMDB metabolites against the cavities further refined our list, revealing metabolites with consensus binding energies ≤ -7 kcal/mol and binding probabilities &gt;0.5 <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c-f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 6a-f, Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Furthermore, HAMs (High-Affinity Metabolites) and LAMs (Low-Affinity Metabolites) displayed distinct atomic fingerprints, with enriched functional groups, including R2NH, R3N, ROPO3, ROH, and ROR, observed in HAMs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 6g-h</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis identified metabolites involved in steroid, sesquiterpenoid, and triterpenoid biosynthesis, along with folate pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref>). BioRanker module further pinpointed sterols, including zymosterol (ZST), ubiquinone 6 (CoQ6), and lanosterol (LST), as top candidates, exhibiting high prediction probabilities (&gt;0.99) and structural similarity to HABs <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 6i-j</xref>). To validate Gcoupler-identified allosteric modulators, we performed control analyses of the Authenticator and Generator modules and blind docking of YMDB metabolites with Ste2p. Removing HAB and LAB labels from IC4 cavity compounds and applying random data splitting yielded poor model performance compared to Authenticator-guided splitting, confirming its robustness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 6k</xref>). Increasing training data size (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) improved model accuracy for YMDB metabolite projections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 6l-m</xref>). Blind docking using AutoDock failed to distinguish HAM and LAM, unlike cavity-specific analysis via AutoDock and Gcoupler, which showed clear segregation (binding energy cutoff: -7 kcal/mol, Gcoupler probability: 0.5; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 6n</xref>). All these rigorous control analyses and blind docking validated the reliability of Gcoupler’s predictions, confirming its robustness in identifying cavity-specific modulators.</p>
<p>To experimentally validate the role of Gcoupler-predicted metabolites in Ste2p signaling, we performed a genetic screen of metabolic mutants. Mapping the predicted metabolites to KEGG and MetaCyc pathways revealed key enzymes involved in their metabolism. Screening 53 single metabolic deletion mutants showed that most deletion mutants resisted α-factor-induced PCD, with some displaying accelerated growth, suggesting a metabolic modulation of Ste2 signaling <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i-k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 7a-c, Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Notably, the <italic>STE2</italic> knockout mutant (<italic>ste2</italic>Δ) displayed no significant PCD induction, validating the importance of Ste2p in this process. To further investigate the metabolic pathways associated with PCD resistance, we conducted high-resolution metabolomics on yeast cells exposed to varying α-factor concentrations. Survivors of PCD induction exhibited differential metabolite profiles, with CoQ6 and ZST showing consistent enrichment across conditions <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2l-n</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 7d-j, Supplementary Table 6</xref>). Pathway analysis of these metabolites indicated involvement in glyoxylate, dicarboxylate, purine, and vitamin B6 metabolism (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 7k</xref>). These findings, in conjunction with the genetic screen, highlight the interplay between metabolism and Ste2 signaling, with computationally predicted metabolites like ZST and CoQ6 potentially conferring resistance to α-factor-induced PCD.</p>

<title>Elevated Endogenous Metabolic levels selectively inhibit GPCR signaling</title>
<p>To evaluate the stability of the interactions of zymosterol (ZST), lanosterol (LST), and ubiquinone 6 (CoQ6) at the Ste2p-Gpa1p interface, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (100 ns) for Ste2p-metabolite complexes.

To gain further insight into the contributing residues from the MD simulations, we performed a residue-wise decomposition analysis that provides information about the energy contributions from the different residues to total binding free energies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 9a</xref>). These results suggest that IC4 and IC5 specific residues predominantly contribute to the total binding free energies.

<p>To gain deeper insight into the mode of action of these metabolites in inhibiting Ste2p signaling, we first analyzed their impact at the orthosteric site, i.e., α-factor binding. We performed protein-peptide docking of Ste2p and α-factor and observed that metabolite-binding at the Ste2p-Gpa1p interface favors the α-factor interaction, as inferred from the binding free energies ΔG (kcal/mol) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 9b-c</xref>). We also analyzed protein-protein interaction between the Ste2p (GPCR) and miniGpa1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) by selecting GPCR configurations with and without metabolite-induced altered cavity topologies (IC4 and IC5), respectively (frames output from the aforementioned Ste2p-metabolite complex simulations) and computed the dissociation constant (Kd), binding affinity (ΔG) and the structural changes in the overall Ste2p topology <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d-e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 9b-d</xref>). These computational analyses revealed that in contrast to metabolite-free Ste2p-Gpa1p interaction, referred to as wild-type (WT) condition, the Kd value is multi-fold lower in the presence of metabolite, indicating a cohesive response induced by these metabolites. A multi-fold lower Kd value further indicates and potentially explains that the metabolites binding favors Ste2p (GPCR) and miniGpa1-protein interaction and enables the establishment of a stable complex that might influence the shielding of the effector-regulating domains of the Gpa1p or influence its binding with the Ste4p (Gβ)-Ste18p (Gγ) complex.</p>
<p>We next asked whether the observed resistance toward α-factor-induced PCD in single metabolic mutants might be the direct consequence of the identified metabolites or a pleiotropic response due to an altered genome. To test this, we next exogenously elevated ZST, CoQ6, and LST levels (prediction probability &gt; 0.99 and post-filtration using BioRanker) in wild-type yeast and observed selective modulation of Ste2p signaling. Pre-loaded cells exhibited rescue from α-factor-induced PCD across growth kinetics, PI-based viability, and FUN<sup>TM</sup>1 assays while maintaining α-factor specificity over acetic acid-induced PCD <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 10a-c</xref>). Mating assays further supported reduced Ste2p signaling in metabolite-preloaded cells, with CoQ6 showing no significant effects, consistent with its instability observed in molecular dynamics simulations <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 10d</xref>). Further, we evaluated the deactivation of the pathway at the MAPK signaling level, where the α-factor-induced p-Fus3 levels were suppressed by ZST and LST (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3i</xref>) but not CoQ6 (data not shown). Moreover, by using the P<italic><sub>FUS1</sub></italic>-eGFP-CYC1 strain-based reporter assays, metabolite pre-treatment confirmed the inhibition of α-factor signaling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3j</xref>). These findings suggest endogenous metabolites as modulators of Ste2p signaling by stabilizing Ste2p-Gpa1p interactions.</p>

<p>Next, we performed experimental validation by generating site-directed mutants and confirmed these computational predictions. Mutants (S75A, L289K, T155D) expressed in a <italic>ste2</italic>Δ background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 11b</xref>) exhibited no rescue from α-factor-induced PCD upon pre-treatment with their respective metabolites, as shown by fluorometry-based cell death assays, FUN<sup>TM</sup>1 staining, and p-Fus3 signaling analysis by mapping MAPK pathway activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c-e</xref>). The lack of rescue highlights the direct role of metabolite binding at the Ste2p-Gpa1p interface in regulating downstream signaling. Interestingly, S75A mutants showed no α-factor-induced effects, likely due to significant structural disruptions. Shmoo formation assays further corroborated these findings, with no rescue effects observed in the mutants despite metabolite pre-loading (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 11c-e</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain mechanistic insights, we performed RNA sequencing on LST-preloaded and untreated (control) cells with and without α-factor exposure. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression of genes implicated in PCD and mating responses, including <italic>GSY1</italic>, whose downregulation was linked to α-factor resistance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4f-g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 12a-c, Supplementary Tables 7-10</xref>). Loss-of-function studies using knockout strains validated the involvement of key transcripts in metabolite-mediated rescue, particularly <italic>YCR095W-A</italic>, which exhibited a pronounced phenotype loss (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 12d-f</xref>). These results collectively suggest that metabolite binding at the Ste2p-Gpa1p interface directly drives rescue responses, with secondary contributions from differentially expressed genes in attenuating α-factor-induced cell death.</p>
<p>Finally, we explored whether intracellular allosteric modulators such as ubiquinone 6 (CoQ6), zymosterol (ZST), lanosterol (LST), fucosterol (FST), and ubiquinone 10 (CoQ10) modulate GPCR signaling in higher vertebrates such as human and rat beta 1/2-adrenergic receptors signaling. Notably, computational docking at the GPCR-Gα interface revealed strong binding affinities for these metabolites, similar to Ste2p-metabolite interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 13a-b</xref>). Sequence conservation analysis of the GPCR-Gα interface across yeast Ste2p and adrenergic receptors in humans and rats further confirmed a high degree of evolutionary conservation at the metabolite-binding residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 13c</xref>). Finally, to test this functional relevance, we evaluated the effect of these metabolites on isoproterenol-induced adrenergic receptor-mediated cardiac hypertrophy in human AC16 cardiomyocytes and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Preloading cells with these metabolites significantly attenuated hypertrophic responses, as evidenced by reduced single-cell surface area in quantitative assessments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h-j</xref>). Notably, to further evaluate the evolutionary conservation of this phenomenon, we also analyzed 75 unique GPCR-Gα complex structures from six species, selected from the PDB database. Dynamic docking was performed using five metabolites (CoQ6, ZST, LST, FST, and CoQ10) identified by Gcoupler as potential allosteric modulators and five negative controls predicted as poor binders. Results revealed significantly lower docking scores (&lt;-7 kcal/mol) for Gcoupler-recommended metabolites compared to negative controls, irrespective of GPCR type or species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure 13d-h</xref>). These findings demonstrate that intracellular metabolite modulation of GPCR activity is a conserved mechanism extending beyond yeast to higher vertebrates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the last few decades, extensive research has focused on identifying allosteric modulators of GPCRs due to their relevance in drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Most known modulators are exogenous and target extracellular sites, while intracellular allosteric sites, identified recently through structural biology, offer novel avenues for regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). These sites, overlapping with G-protein and β-arrestin coupling regions, highlight the potential for intracellular allosteric modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Intracellular modulators, including chemically diverse agents like auto-antibodies and sodium ions, remain poorly understood, emphasizing the need for systematic exploration of these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). However, the lack of data on intracellular modulators limits the feasibility of conventional computational approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>).</p>
<p>To address this gap, we developed Gcoupler, a computational framework integrating <italic>de novo</italic> cavity identification, ligand synthesis, statistical analysis, graph neural networks, and Bioactivity-based ligand prioritization. Unlike existing tools, Gcoupler does not require cavity-specific experimentally validated compounds for model training. Gcoupler’s precision in cavity mapping, flexibility for user-defined queries, and ability to screen large chemical libraries make it a versatile and efficient tool. Additionally, Gcoupler’s generic design allows application beyond GPCRs, contrasting with existing platforms that often have limitations in modularity, precision, or open-source availability. Noteworthy, in contrast to other known allosteric sites identification tools for GPCRs, such as Allosite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), AllositePro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), AlloReverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), that largely leverage the ML-based models or require orthosteric ligand-bound structure as input, the cavity detection feature of Gcoupler (LigBuilderV3), a critical step for the entire workflow, is not limited to only the allosteric sites; instead, it identifies all possible cavity-like regions on the protein surface, which then gets classified into druggable, undruggable, or amphibious based on their individual scoring and ligandability, thus making it unbiased and more specific towards query protein. Notably, the rationale for opting for LigBuilder V3 for cavity identification over similar tools such as Fpocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) is that the former uses a hydrogen atom probe, moving along the protein surface grid of 0.5 Å for cavity detection, being much more precise in detecting cavity boundaries, in both breadth and depth mapping; in contrast, the latter considers clusters of alpha spheres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, only a few methods leverage generative AI models for cavity/pocket-based drug design. Gcoupler is an open-source, end-to-end platform integrating Ligand-Based Drug Design (LBDD) and Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) for drug design and large-scale screening. Unlike Pocket Crafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), which requires proprietary tools (e.g., MOE QuickPrep) and lacks predictive model-building modules, Gcoupler offers comprehensive functionality. Similarly, DeepLigBuilder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) and Schrodinger’s AutoDesigner are either closed source or limited in features compared to Gcoupler. Comparative analysis highlights Gcoupler’s unique advantages in precision, flexibility, and functionality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Table 11</xref>).</p>
<p>Using Gcoupler, we investigated the molecular basis of innate resistance to α-factor-induced programmed cell death (PCD) in yeast. Unlike humans, yeast possess only two GPCR systems, making their pheromone-sensing pathway ideal for focused study. Previous research predominantly identified downstream regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>); however, our findings suggest an upstream, receptor-level regulation via endogenous intracellular metabolites. Computational and experimental evidence pinpointed specific metabolites binding to the Ste2p-miniGpa1 interface, modulating signaling. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the functional relevance of these metabolite-interacting residues. Of note, previous mutagenesis experiments also revealed multiple critical amino acid residues that overlap with IC4 and IC5, suggesting their functional relevance in Ste2p downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Table 12</xref>). Despite these advances, certain limitations remain, including the potential pleiotropic effects in metabolic gene knockouts and challenges in replicating natural metabolite concentrations. Mechanistic insights into sterol biosynthesis mutants (<italic>erg</italic>Δ) revealed impaired mating responses due to heterogeneous defects, such as reduced sterol accumulation and shmoo formation, impaired membrane fusion, and decreased <italic>FUS1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). This highlights a novel role for sterols in GPCR regulation and their broader implications for yeast microbial factories and stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Sterols and other endogenous metabolites were shown to modulate GPCR activity by targeting conserved Gα-binding sites, reinforcing the evolutionary conservation of this mechanism across species, as demonstrated in human and rat hypertrophy models in this study.</p>
<p>In summary, our work uncovers a novel regulatory mechanism for GPCRs mediated by intracellular metabolites and presents a computational framework, Gcoupler, to explore unexplored allosteric sites. The proposed model suggests that selective metabolites binding to GPCR-Gα interfaces induce local conformational changes, stabilizing GPCR-G-protein complexes and potentially obstructing downstream signaling. Alternative mechanisms, such as orthosteric site modulation, kinase/arrestin interaction interference, or alterations in membrane dynamics, remain to be explored, warranting further investigation. A critical limitation of our study is the absence of direct binding assays to validate the interaction between the metabolites and Ste2p. While our results from genetic interventions, molecular dynamics simulations, and docking studies strongly suggest that the metabolites interact with the Ste2p-Gpa1 interface, these findings remain indirect. Direct binding confirmation through techniques such as surface plasmon resonance, isothermal titration calorimetry, or co-crystallization would provide definitive evidence of this interaction. Another critical limitation of our findings is its reliance on tools like AutoDock and PRODIGY for preliminary binding affinity estimates, which lack the thermodynamic precision of advanced methods. To address this, we employed MD simulations with MM/GBSA, incorporating factors like protein flexibility and solvation effects for more accurate ΔG calculations. While computationally intensive approaches were beyond this study’s scope, we ensured reported ΔG values reflected system conformational flexibility by basing them on pre-simulated docked structures from molecular dynamics simulations. Further, our results suggest that the metabolite binds to the Ste2p-Gpa1 interface and modulates receptor activity upon pheromone stimulation, as supported by various assays. However, the precise sequence of interactions between Ste2p, the metabolite, and Gpa1 remains unexplored, as it requires sequential experiments beyond this study’s scope. Taken together, addressing these limitations in future work would significantly strengthen our conclusions and provide deeper insights into the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypic effects.</p>

<title>Backend code for the Gcoupler</title>
<p>The back-end code for Gcoupler is implemented entirely in Python (3.8) and comprises four modules: Synthesizer, Authenticator, Generator, and BioRanker. Synthesizer employs LigBuilder V3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) for <italic>de novo in silico</italic> ligand synthesis, identifying protein cavities likely to be active or allosteric sites using a hybrid GROW-LINK approach with a Genetic Algorithm. The module autonomously selects one cavity for ligand synthesis based on user-defined residue positions. Using the CAVITY function of LigBuilder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), it classifies 3D grid points around the protein into occupied, vacant, and surface points and integrates geometric and physicochemical properties to identify binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Synthesizer outputs ligand structures in SMILES and PDBQT formats, alongside cavity grid coordinates for downstream modules. Authenticator validates the synthesized ligands using AutoDock Vina (1.2.3) for virtual screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Binding energy calculations classify ligands into High-Affinity Binders (HABs) and Low-Affinity Binders (LABs), preserving balance for subsequent deep learning analysis. The default energy threshold is set to -7 kcal/mol, but users can explore alternative cutoffs, visualize distributions, and perform statistical comparisons within the workflow. These steps ensure precise identification and prioritization of ligand candidates for further analysis. The Authenticator uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), Anderson-Darling test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), and Epps-Singleton test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) for hypothesis testing for the comparison of the distributions. The Authenticator module visualizes ligand distributions using overlapping density plots and Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) curves. If the default threshold fails to produce statistically meaningful separation, users can supply alternative negative datasets, such as decoys generated via Gcoupler’s inbuilt RDKit Chem module or custom datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). The Generator module builds deep learning-based classification models using the DeepChem (2.6.1) library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). It accepts High-Affinity Binders (HABs) and Low-Affinity Binders (LABs)/decoys from the Authenticator module to train four graph-based models: Graph Convolution Model (GCM), Graph Convolution Network (GCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), Attentive FP (AFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>), and Graph Attention Network (GAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). Class imbalance is addressed through upsampling techniques. Generator tests all models using default hyperparameters, returning performance metrics for user selection. Hyperparameters can be tuned via manual settings or using default values followed by k-fold cross-validation. The final optimized model, trained on the complete synthetic dataset (HAB + LAB/decoys), enables large-scale screening of user-supplied compounds based on their SMILES representations. The BioRanker module performs post-prediction analysis for functional activity-based compound screening. Positively predicted compounds are selected using a stringent probability threshold or adaptive methods such as G-means and Youden’s J statistic, which optimize sensitivity and specificity. The selected compounds are projected into biological activity spaces (Chemistry, Targets, Networks, Cells, Clinics) by comparing their biological activity descriptor vectors with those of HABs using cosine similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). A modified PageRank algorithm ranks compounds based on activity-specific scores, with support for multi-activity ranking to refine results based on user-defined biological properties, ensuring precise and context-relevant compound prioritization.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors introduce Gcoupler, a Python-based computational pipeline designed to identify endogenous intracellular metabolites that function as allosteric modulators at the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) - Gα protein interface. Gcoupler is comprised of four modules:</p>
<p>I. Synthesizer - identifies protein cavities and generates synthetic ligands using LigBuilder3</p>
<p>II. Authenticator - classifies ligands into high-affinity binders (HABs) and low-affinity binders (LABs) based on AutoDock Vina binding energies</p>
<p>III. Generator - trains graph neural network (GNN) models (GCM, GCN, AFP, GAT) to predict binding affinity using synthetic ligands</p>
<p>IV. BioRanker - prioritizes ligands based on statistical and bioactivity data</p>
<p>The authors apply Gcoupler to study the Ste2p-Gpa1p interface in yeast, identifying sterols such as zymosterol (ZST) and lanosterol (LST) as modulators of GPCR signaling. Our review will focus on the computational aspects of the work. Overall, we found the Gcoupler approach interesting and potentially valuable, but we have several concerns with the methods and validation that need to be addressed prior to publication/dissemination.</p>
<p>(1) The exact algorithmic advancement of the Synthesizer beyond being some type of application wrapper around LigBuilder is unclear. Is the grow-link approach mentioned in the methods already a component of LigBuilder, or is it custom? If it is custom, what does it do? Is the API for custom optimization routines new with the Synthesizer, or is this a component of LigBuilder? Is the genetic algorithm novel or already an existing software implementation? Is the cavity detection tool a component of LigBuilder or novel in some way? Is the fragment library utilized in the Synthesizer the default fragment library in LigBuilder, or has it been customized? Are there rules that dictate how molecule growth can occur? The scientific contribution of the Synthesizer is unclear. If there has not been any new methodological development, then it may be more appropriate to just refer to this part of the algorithm as an application layer for LigBuilder.</p>
<p>(2) The use of AutoDock Vina binding energy scores to classify ligands into HABs and LABs is problematic. AutoDock Vina's energy function is primarily tuned for pose prediction and displays highly system-dependent affinity ranking capabilities. Moreover, the HAB/LAB thresholds of -7 kcal/mol or -8 kcal/mol lack justification. Were these arbitrarily selected cutoffs, or was benchmarking performed to identify appropriate cutoffs? It seems like these thresholds should be determined by calibrating the docking scores with experimental binding data (e.g., known binders with measured affinities) or through re-scoring molecules with a rigorous alchemical free energy approach.</p>
<p>(3) Neither the Results nor Methods sections provide information on how the GNNs were trained in this study. Details such as node features, edge attributes, standardization, pooling, activation functions, layers, dropout, etc., should all be described in detail. The training protocol should also be described, including loss functions, independent monitoring and early stopping criteria, learning rate adjustments, etc.</p>
<p>(4) GNN model training seems to occur on at most 500 molecules per training run? This is unclear from the manuscript. That is a very small number of training samples if true. Please clarify. How was upsampling performed? What were the HAB/LAB class distributions? In addition, it seems as though only synthetically generated molecules are used for training, and the task is to discriminate synthetic molecules based on their docking scores. Synthetic ligands generated by LigBuilder may occupy distinct chemical space, making classification trivial, particularly in the setting of a random split k-folds validation approach. In the absence of a leave-class-out validation, it is unclear if the model learns generalizable features or exploits clear chemical differences. Historically, it was inappropriate to evaluate ligand-based QSAR models on synthetic decoys such as the DUD-E sets - synthetic ligands can be much more easily distinguished by heavily parameterized ligand-based machine learning models than by physically constrained single-point docking score functions.</p>
<p>(5) Training QSAR models on docking scores to accelerate virtual screening is not in itself novel (see here for a nice recent example: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-025-00777-x">https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-025-00777-x</ext-link>), but can be highly useful to focus structure-based analysis on the most promising areas of ligand chemical space; however, we are perplexed by the motivation here. If only a few hundred or a few thousand molecules are being sampled, why not just use AutoDock Vina? The models are trained to try to discriminate molecules by AutoDock Vina score rather than experimental affinity, so it seems like we would ideally just run Vina? Perhaps we are misunderstanding the scale of the screening that was done here. Please clarify the manuscript methods to help justify the approach.</p>
<p>(6) The brevity of the MD simulations raises some concerns that the results may be over-interpreted. RMSD plots do not reliably compare the affinity behavior in this context because of the short timescales coupled with the dramatic topological differences between the ligands being compared; CoQ6 is long and highly flexible compared to ZST and LST. Convergence metrics, such as block averaging and time-dependent MM/GBSA energies, should be included over much longer timescales. For CoQ6, the authors may need to run multiple simulations of several microseconds, identify the longest-lived metastable states of CoQ6, and perform MM/GBSA energies for each state weighted by each state's probability.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mohanty et al. present a new deep learning method to identify intracellular allosteric modulators of GPCRs. This is an interesting field for e.g. the design of novel small molecule inhibitors of GPCR signalling. A key limitation, as mentioned by the authors, is the limited availability of data. The method presented, Gcoupler, aims to overcome these limitations, as shown by experimental validation of sterols in the inhibition of Ste2p, which has been shown to be relevant molecules in human and rat cardiac hypertrophy models.</p>
<p>
They have made their code available for download and installation, which can easily be followed to set up software on a local machine.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- Clear GitHub repository</p>
<p>- Extensive data on yeast systems</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- No assay to directly determine the affinity of the compounds to the protein of interest.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors present an interesting new method to identify allosteric inhibitors of GPCRs, which can easily be employed by research labs. Whilst their efforts to characterize the compounds in yeast cells, in order to confirm their findings, it would be beneficial if the authors show their compounds are active in a simple binding assay.</p>
