<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cardiac lymphatics play an important role in myocardial edema and inflammation. This study integrated single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points post-myocardial infarction (MI), and identified four transcriptionally distinct subtypes of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and localized them in space. Interestingly, LECs subgroups was found to be localized in different zones of infarcted heart related to different functions. Additionally, LEC capillary III(LEC ca III) may be involved in the direct regulation of myocardial injuries in infarcted zone from the perspective of metabolic stress, while LEC ca II may be related to the rapid immune inflammatory responses of the border zone in the early stage of MI. LEC ca I, as well as LEC collection mainly participate in the regulation of myocardial tissue edema resolution in the middle and late stages post-MI. Cell trajectory and Cell-Chat analyses further identified that LECs may regulate myocardial edema through Aqp1, and might affect the infiltration of macrophages through the Galectin9-CD44 pathway. Collectively, our study revealed the dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity distribution of LECs in different regions of the infarcted heart, in detail; these LECs formed different functional subgroups, that might exhibit different bioeffects in myocardial tissue post-MI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The lymphatic vasculature, which accompanies the blood vasculature in most organs, is indispensable for maintaining of tissue fluid homeostasis, immune surveillance and lipid uptake and transport(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alitalo, Tammela, &amp; Petrova, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huang, Elvington, &amp; Randolph, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Petrova &amp; Koh, 2020</xref>). In contrast to circulatory blood vessels, lymphatic vessels are structurally blind-ended segments, that are designed to absorb interstitial fluid and immune cells. These lymphatic capillaries converge onto deeper lymphatic structures called collecting vessels, which are equipped with valves and a muscular wall that promote unidirectional transport and drain extravascular fluid, macromolecules and immune cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alitalo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Oliver, Kipnis, Randolph, &amp; Harvey, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The cardiac lymphatic vasculature was first described in the 17<sup>th</sup> century(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Tammela &amp; Alitalo, 2010</xref>). To date, studies have demonstrated the role of the lymphatic system only in embryonic heart development and cardiac health in adults(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brakenhielm &amp; Alitalo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Heron, Ratajska, &amp; Brakenhielm, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>). Cardiac lymphatics can take up inter-tissue fluid and transport immune cells through highly branched, blunt, open-ended lymphatic capillaries, to the lymph nodes near the thoracic ducts and, finally, into the superior vena cava(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Huang, Lavine, &amp; Randolph, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most important cardiovascular diseases. Myocardial edema and inflammation are the two dominant pathological processes in the early stages of MI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anzai, Ko, &amp; Fukuda, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bulluck, Dharmakumar, Arai, Berry, &amp; Hausenloy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen, Zhao, &amp; Yan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Nahrendorf, Pittet, &amp; Swirski, 2010</xref>). Many preclinical studies have revealed severe remodeling of lymphatic system during MI in animal models(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ishikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Shimizu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vuorio et al., 2018</xref>). The stimulation of cardiac lymphangiogenesis by adrenomedullin or vascular endothelial growth factor C can ameliorate myocardial edema following MI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Henri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Trincot et al., 2019</xref>). However, owing to the extremely low number of lymphatic vessels in the myocardial tissue, there is still a lack of comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying myocardial injury and prognostic progression after MI.</p>
<p>With the rapid development of single-cell transcriptome sequencing and spatial single-cell transcriptome sequencing technologies, researchers can explore cell subpopulations, heterogeneity, function, metabolism, and cell-cell interactions at the single-cell level(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Grün &amp; van Oudenaarden, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Vandereyken, Sifrim, Thienpont, &amp; Voet, 2023</xref>). In order to further elucidate the effects and regulatory mechanisms of the lymphatic vessels in the repair process of myocardial injury following MI, this study integrated single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points after MI from publicly available data (E-MTAB-7895, GSE214611) in the ArrayExpress and gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases. By reanalyzing these data, this study revealed dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity and spatial localization differences in regenerated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in heart tissue after MI. Different subpopulations of LECs appear at different times and locations during the process of myocardial post-MI, and perform different biological functions. Furthermore, we validated two key regulatory molecules that play important regulatory roles in myocardial edema and lymphatic immune regulation after MI.</p>

<title>Dynamic Changes of Cardiac Lymphatics in Cardiac Tissue post-MI</title>
<p>To explore the physiological and pathological functions of cardiac lymphatic vessels after myocardial infarction (MI), we established an MI mouse model by ligating the anterior descending branch of the coronary artery (n=32) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1</xref>-figure supplement 1A). Heart function was evaluated by micro-ultrasound, and mouse hearts were harvested at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after MI (n=5-7/ per time-point) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1</xref>-figure Supplement 1B). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was performed using antibodies against Prospero homeobox 1 (Prox1, nuclear protein), the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan recetor-1 (Lyve1, membrane protein) and podoplanin(Pdpn, membrane protein), all of which specifically labeled the LECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1</xref>-Figure Suppl-1C-E). Since the membrane protein Lyve1 and Pdpn can present lymphatic vessel morphology more clearly than Prox1, Lyve1 and Pdpn were used for lymphatic vessel co-staining at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after MI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Figure1-Figure Suppl-2A). There were significant differences in the morphology and distribution of the newly formed lymphatic vessels in different regions of the heart tissue post-MI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Three days post-MI, lymphatic vessels in the infarcted zone (IZ) and border zone (BZ) were significantly lost. However, on the 7th day, a large number of newly formed and dilated continuous lymphatic vessels appeared in the BZ. In the IZ, only a small number of lymphatic capillaries with discontinuous walls were observed. On the 14th and 28th days following the infarction, the number of lymphatic capillaries in the IZ significantly increased. Continuous large lymphatic collecting vessels were observed in the epicardium of the IZ, and the number of large lymphatic collecting vessels in the BZ did not decrease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1</xref>-figure Supplement 2B). In addition, there were no significant changes in the distribution and morphology of cardiac lymphatic vessels in the unaffected normal myocardial area (remote zone, RZ) at any time (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1</xref>-figure Supplement 2A). These results suggest that lymphatic regeneration may be involved in the regulation of myocardial damage following MI.</p>

<title>Identification of Four Transcriptionally Distinct Subtypes of Regenerated Lymphatic Endothelial Cells in Myocardial Tissue post-MI via Single-Cell Sequence</title>
<p>To further clarify why the regenerated cardiac LECs mapped to a particular distribution during cardiac repair post-MI, a set of published single-cell sequencing data (E-MTAB-7895) was selected from the ArrayExpress database of mouse MI models at different time points (days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28). Using specific marker proteins as cell-clustering markers, the cluster dimensionality reduction analysis of the 44, 839 single cells (excluding myocardial cells) in this experimental dataset was recalculated. First, we classified these cells into five categories based on specific genes: endothelial cells (Cdh5, Pecam1, and Vwf), fibroblasts (Dcn, Col1a1, and Gsn), immune cells (Ptprc, and C1qa), myocardial fibroblasts (Cthrc1, and postn), smooth muscle cells and pericytes (Myh11, Tagln, Acta2, Rgs5, Abcc9, and Kcnj8) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Subsequently, the endothelial cells (Cdh5, Pecam1, and Vwf) were further clustered into five sub-clusters, including angiogenic endothelial cells (Col4a2, Apln, Sparcl1, and Aplnr), arterial endothelial cells (Fbln5, Hey1, Sema3g, and Efnb2), capillary endothelial cells (Kdr, Rgcc, Aqp1, and Endou), venous endothelial cells (Mgp, Cfh, Bgn, Vwf, and Plvap), and LECs (Lyve1, Cldn5, and Prox1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). To further characterize LECs, we examined the expression of Foxp2, Ackr4, Cavolin-1(Cav1), Nt5e, Pdpn and Lyve1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Takeda et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this report, the collecting LEC marker Cav1 was expressed in the clusters LEC collecting (LEC co), LEC capillary I (LEC ca I), and LEC capillary III (LEC ca III) clusters, whereas Foxp2 and Ackr4 were expressed almost exclusively in LEC co clusters. Capillary markers Pdpn and Lyve1 were expressed in four subsets, but showed the highest expression in LEC ca III, and the lowest in LEC co (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Together, these results indicate significant transcriptional heterogeneity in the regenerated cardiac LECs post-MI.</p>

<title>Relationship Between the Spatial Localization and Function of LEC Subpopulations post-MI</title>
<p>To elucidate the biological functions of LECs subgroups in myocardial tissue post-MI, we first observed dynamic changes in the number and proportion of LECs subsets after MI. Consistent with the results of IF staining, the number of LECs was significantly reduced in the early phases of MI (D1 and D3). From D7, the number of cells gradually increased and returned to normal levels within 14 days. The four LECs subtypes differ in their proliferation potential, with CaI and CaIII appearing to proliferate faster than Co and CaII. Normal myocardial tissues are mainly composed of LEC ca I, LEC ca II, and LEC co, with a small amount of LEC ca III. In the early stages of myocardial infarction (D1 and D3), the number of LECs decreased sharply. The number of LECs gradually increasing from day 7 and returning to normal levels by day 14 after MI. Moreover, from day 14 onwards, the number and proportion of Ca I type LECs significantly increased. Twenty-eight days post-MI, the number and proportion of the three capillary LECs had returned to normal, except for a small proportion of LEC co in the group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p>

<p>To validate whether these LEC subpopulations are involved in the repair of myocardial injury following MI, we retrieved published single-cell nuclear transcriptomic and spatial transcriptomic data (GSE214611) of mouse MI models from the GEO database. In early MI (D3), LEC ca I, ca III and LEC co were mainly distributed in the IZ and BZ, with LEC ca III being significantly higher in the IZ. In contrast, LEC ca II was mainly distributed in the BZ and RZ, and was significantly reduced in the IZ. As the morphology of the infarcted area gradually became clear, on D7, LEC ca I continued to increase in the IZ region, LEC ca III was still mainly distributed in the IZ, LEC co migrated from the BZ to the IZ, and LEC ca II showed no significant spatial localization or expression differences, but were still highly expressed in the BZ and RZ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, Figure3-figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>KEGG functional enrichment analysis was conducted on the genes of the four LEC subtypes. LEC ca III, the LEC subgroup with the highest proportion expressed in the IZ during the early stage of MI, was found to primarily participate in energy metabolism such as oxidative phosphorylation, thermogenesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, antigen presentation, cell morphology and migration related functions. Although ca I and ca III have similar spatial localization after MI, their expression levels were lower than that of LEC ca III on D3, but significantly increased in the IZ on D7. LEC ca I was found primarily participate in the activation of infection, apoptosis, mitophagy, and water absorption related regulation of vasopressin. LEC co showed partial similarity in biological functions with ca I, and were mainly involved in fluid regulation and flow, such as renin, saliva secretion, and inflammation. LECs are inconsistently is involved in the regulation of RNA transport, degradation, and ferroptosis. LEC ca II, which significantly reduced in IZ, while sustaining high expression in the BZ and RZ, is mainly related to NFκB is associated with the regulation of chemokine signaling pathways and cytokine interactions between ligands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, based on the pathological changes in myocardial tissue, as well as the regeneration ratio, spatial localization, and functional differences of LEC subgroups after MI, we deduced that LEC ca III may be involved in the direct regulation of myocardial injury in the IZ from the perspective of metabolic stress, whereas LEC ca II may be related to the rapid immune inflammatory response in the BZ in the very early stages of MI. LEC ca I and LEC co primarily participate in the regulation of myocardial tissue edema resolution in the middle and late stages post-MI.</p>

<title>Single-Cell Trajectories of LECs Subsets post-MI</title>
<p>How do LEC subgroups regenerate and evolve after MI? To answer this question, we used cell trajectory analysis to characterize LECs development and determine lineage differentiation. From the pseudo-time plot and phenotype-based trajectory plot, we learn that, in the early stage after MI, the main LEC subgroup is still LEC ca II and III, which is consistent with the spatial transcriptome localization results. LEC ca II was significantly upregulated in the BZ and RZ of the infarcted area, and Ca III was significantly upregulated in the IZ. During the mid-to-late stages, we found that LEC ca II gradually differentiated into two orientations. One group was mainly composed of ca I, which may regulate immune and metabolic outcomes, while the other group jointly involved ca I, ca III, and co, which may be mainly involved in cell death, inflammation and edema regression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures. 4A</xref>-C). These results further suggest that ca II and III mainly participate in the early stages of myocardial infarction, whereas ca I and co are involved in the regulation of injury repair in the middle and late stages after MI.</p>

<p>What are the main regulatory molecules in these LEC subgroups during pseudo-time post-MI? Subsequently, we screened and performed KEGG functional enrichment analysis on temporally expressed genes during MI and obtained four gene sets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). Interestingly, these genes corresponded well with the ratios of different LEC subgroups during MI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Gene set 1, similar to LEC ca III, which is highly expressed at the very early stages of MI and then gradually decreases, is mainly related to oxidative phosphorylation, diabetic cardiomyopathy, cholesterol metabolism, thermogenesis, and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), cyclic guanosine 3’, 5’-monophosphate (cGMP) - Protein Kinase G (PKG) signaling pathway. The expression of gene sets 2 and 3 was lower during MI, significantly increased in the early and middle stages, and gradually decreased thereafter. These genes are primarily involved in the regulation of programmed cell death, apoptosis, amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Gene set 4 showed lower expression in the early stage of myocardial infarction, but gradually increased in the middle and showed the highest expression in the late stages post-MI. These genes are mainly involved in cardiac regeneration, renin secretion, bicarbonate reabsorption, salivary and bile secretion, as well as parathyroid and growth hormone synthesis and secretion. These results imply that LECs are mainly involved in the stress regulation of cell metabolism, inflammation, and death in the very early stages of MI, while regeneration and repair functions are mainly involved in the late stages.</p>

<title>Assessment of Cell-Cell Communication between LECs and immune cells</title>
<p>To explore how LECs and immune cells interact to regulate metabolic inflammation in the early stages of MI, we conducted further clustering analysis on immune cells from the RAW Data (E-MTAB-7895). As shown in Figure5 -figure Supplement 1A and 1B, seven immune cell types were identified: neutrophils (S100a8 and S100a9), monocytes I (Chil3 and Plac8) and II (Saa3 and Arg1), macrophages (C1qa and Cd68), dendritic cells (H2ab1 and Cd74), B cells (Cd79a and Igkc), and natural killer T cells (Nkg7 and Ms4a4b). The R Package “CellChat” was used to investigate the communication and interaction between these cells and LEC subpopulations. As expected, the communication strength of all significant signaling pathway analyses showed that the highest level of communication probability occured between LEC ca I, NKT and B cells in normal heart tissue, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>. During the early phase of MI, that is, between D1 and D3, the highest interaction numbers and strength found were between LEC ca I and ca III, as well as monocytes and macrophages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, correlation analysis was conducted on the strength of the receptor-ligand of LEC and immune cells, except for the classical APP-CD74 pathway (MHCII, expressed by activated APC cells); the interaction was found to be more active in the Galectin9-CD44 and CD45, as well as Collagen-CD44, and ICAM1-ITGβ2 pathways, between the LEC ca I and III, as well as monocytes type I or macrophages (P&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure5</xref>-figure Supplement 1C and 1D). This indicates that monocytes and macrophages may be the key immune inflammatory cells that regulate LEC immune presentation during the early phases of MI.</p>

<title>Aqp1 in LEC is correlated with myocardial edema occurrence and resolution post-MI</title>
<p>In this study, we reveal that fluid retention, one of the basic functions of lymphatic vessels, occurs in LEC ca I and LEC co in the middle-late phase of MI(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, we explored all molecules that may have important regulatory effects on edema regression. Through localization and temporal expression analysis of KEGG pathway genes in the LEC subpopulation, the expression of Aquaporin 1(Aqp1) in LEC was found to be significantly correlated with temporal changes in edema occurrence and resolution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, the score of the degree of tissue edema in cardiac tissue post-MI, was analyzed and the mouse heart was found to rapidly develop edema on D1 after MI, with the edema reaching its maximum on D3. The edema gradually decreased on D7, and returned to normal on D14 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). This was negatively correlated with the expression level of Aqp1 in LEC after myocardial infarction(Figure6-figure supplement 1A). IF co-staining of Aqp1 and LEC in heart tissue also revealed that the expression of Aqp1 was significantly reduced in the early phase of MI D1 and D3, and markedly increased expressed in MI D7 and D14 post-MI (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure6</xref>-figure supplement 1B). mLECs (mouse LEC cell line) was used and CoCl<sub>2</sub> intervention (simulated hypoxia stimulation) was found to reduce the expression of Aqp1 at both the transcriptional and expression levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures. 6E-6J</xref>). These results suggest that Aqp1 may be involved in the regulation of lymphatic edema metabolism after MI. Early intervention or increased gene expression may improve cardiac function in MI.</p>

<title>Galectin9 expressed by LEC can affect macrophage migration</title>
<p>To clarify whether the Galectin9(Gal9)-CD44 axis is involved in the regulation of the interaction between LECs and monocyte-macrophages in the early stages of MI, we looked for the temporal expression changes of Gal9 in LECs post-MI. Consistent with the results of the bioinformatics analysis, Gal9 was highly expressed in LECs D3 and D7(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), whereas CD44 expression gradually decreased from D1(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Further in vitro studies have found that Gal9 expression was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in IFNγ-stimulated cultured mLECs but not hypoxia-stimulated cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7C-7E</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure7</xref>-figure supplement 1A-D). Moreover, intervention with recombinant Gal9 significantly induced macrophage migration in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures. 7F-7H</xref>). In contrast, the inhibition of Gal9 expression significantly inhibited interferon regulated macrophage migration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures. 7I-7M</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cardiac lymphatics play an important role in myocardial edema and inflammation. This study, for the first time, integrated single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points post-MI, and identified four transcriptionally distinct subtypes of LECs and their dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity distribution in different regions of myocardial tissue post-MI. These subgroups of LECs were shown to form different function involved in the inflammation, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and water absorption related regulation of vasopressin during the process of myocardial repair after MI.</p>
<p>The lymphatic system plays an essential role in interstitial fluid balance and immune cell hemostasis in many organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Petrova &amp; Koh, 2020</xref>), including the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brakenhielm &amp; Alitalo, 2019</xref>). Stimulating lymphangiogenesis post-MI was found to alleviate myocardial edema and improve heart function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Henri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Houssari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Trincot et al., 2019</xref>). Henri et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Henri et al., 2016</xref>) observed lymphangiogenesis and heart function on the 4 or 12-weeks post-MI, and found reduced myocardial edema and fibrosis in VEGFC stimulated mice as compared to the control group. However, lymphangiogenesis in the natural pathological process post-MI, especially in the early-stage post-MI, was not observed in this study. Generally, myocardial edema and inflammation are occurred in MI early stage, what does cardiac lymphatics changed simultaneously caught our interest. So we established mice MI model to observe the physiological and pathological changes in cardiac lymphatics. Interestingly the rate and morphology of lymphatic vessel neogenesis were found to vary in different zone of the infarcted heart, and several large, dilated, continuous Lyve1-labeled lymphatic vessels appeared along the middle myocardium quickly in the border zone in D7 post-MI,which was mainly observed in epicardium and endocardium in the normal heart, this abnormal remolding indicate their new role in this pathological scenario.</p>
<p>Takeda et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Takeda et al., 2019</xref>) have unveiled LEC heterogeneity and their function in human lymphatics, dividing LEC into six subtypes, and found that CD209 on medullary sinuses LECs mediates neutrophil adhesion in the human lymphatic node medulla. Lymphatic vessels LECs, however, have been teeny elaborated. In this study, LECs of lymphatic vessels were clustered into one collecting LEC and three capillary LEC, and, after localized them in space, found that each subtype focuses on different functions in infarcted heart. LEC ca II and III mainly participate in inflammation in the early phase of post-MI in the RZ and IZ, while ca I and co are involved in the regulation of myocardial edema in the middle and late stages after MI in the BZ and IZ. In addition to these traditional roles in immune regulation and interstitial fluid hemostasis, LEC capillaries, especially LEC ca III, also participate in metabolic regulation (glycolysis and gluconeogenesis), which might provide energy for immune cell migrantion or myocardium survival(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Guak &amp; Krawczyk, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zuurbier et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that lymphangiogenesis stimulation post-MI can suppress T-cell infiltration and reduce infarct thinning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Houssari et al., 2020</xref>), and that activated LECs penetrating the infarcted heart increase the number of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells, thereby inhibiting the expansion of NKT cells and promoting reparative macrophage expansion to facilitate post-MI repair(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). This provides a clue for the treatment of lymphatics in infarcted heart.</p>
<p>Herein, we also identified some interesting findings from the Cell-chat analysis between LECs and immune cells. We found that LECs were mainly involved in the chemotactic function of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages during the early stages of MI. Macrophage chemotaxis not only participates in the inflammatory response after myocardial infarction, but may also serve as an important immune presenting cell involved in the immune regulation of LEC in myocardial tissue after MI. Second, we found that LEC could regulate monocyte and macrophage infiltration through the Galectin9-CD44 pathway. Galectin9 release from LEC in hypoxia is reduced, which slows macrophage migration, increased Galectin9 in the medium of the macrophage can accelerates its migration. Galectin 9 is one of the β-galactoside binding lectins known for its immunomodulatory role in various microbial infections(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Moar &amp; Tandon, 2021</xref>), it has been reported that serum Galectin 9 levels are associated with the severity of coronary artery disease, and the ST-segment elevation MI patients have the lowest serum level of Galectin9, followed by the non-ST segment elevation MI group and the stable angina groups(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, galectin9 may be a potential molecule involved in regulating the inflammation response post-MI.</p>
<p>Moreover, we screened out a key edema regulated gene, Aqp1, which is highly expressed in LEC subsets in the middle and late phases of MI. Aqp1 is expressed in many tissues, and its primary function is transmembrane water flux(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Trillo-Contreras, Toledo-Aral, Echevarría, &amp; Villadiego, 2019</xref>). A previous study showed that the knockout of the Aqp1 gene can result in impaired urine concentration(Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Qiu, Jiang, Li, Wang, &amp; Yang, 2023</xref>) and lung edema(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bai et al., 1999</xref>) in mouse model. We showed that Aqp1 expression decreased at both the RNA and protein levels in mouse LECs under hypoxic stimulation, and that its expression was negatively correlated with myocardial edema in LECs post-MI. This suggests that Aqp1 may be an essential factor in myocardial edema and needs to be elucidated, along with the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>In conclusion, LECs play an important role in regulating myocardial edema and inflammation post-MI, and stimulation of lymphangiogenesis or promotion of LEC function may become new targets for future clinical improvement of cardiac function post-MI. One limitation of this study is that the single-cell sequencing data that were analyzed for each time point was derived from a single sample, which resulted in resultant LEC counts being too small. This might have resulted in bias in the analyses. In future studies, multiple samples should be utilized to improve the yield of trace cells like LEC for single cell sequencing. Therefore, further validation tests must be designed and implemented.</p>

Marker genes for each cell type were obtained using the Seurat function FindAllMarkers, in which only markers with positive log2-transformed fold changes were considered. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each cluster were then identified using the Wilcoxon test.</p>
<p>To characterize the process of LEC cell development and determine lineage differentiation among diverse LEC cells, cell trajectory analysis was conducted using single-cell pseudo-time trajectories constructed with the Monocle2 package (v2.22.0),(X. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>) according to the provided documentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/">http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/</ext-link>). UMI counts were modeled as a negative binomial distribution; ordering genes were identified as having high dispersion across cells (mean_expression≥0.01; dispersion_empirical≥1). The discriminative dimensionality reduction with trees (DDRTree) method was used to reduce data to two dimensions. Gene sets identified from the destination analysis were clustered and visualized using the plot_genes_in_pseudotime function.</p>
<p>The differences in putative cell-cell communication modules between cell types were analyzed for the samples at each stage. The Cellchat (v1.6.1) package includes a comprehensive signaling molecule interaction database that considers the known structural composition of receptor-ligand interactions, such as multimeric receptor-ligand complexes, soluble agonists and antagonists, as well as stimulatory and inhibitory membrane-bound coreceptors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). The inference of cell-cell interactions includes the identification of differentially expressed signaling genes, calculation of ensemble average expression and intercellular communication probability, as well as identification of statistically significant intercellular communications. The single-cell transcriptomic data was divided into seven parts according to the stages and the differences in ligand-receptor interactions and signaling pathways, were explored across these seven stages.</p>

<title>Spatial Localization of LEC Cells</title>
<p>Single nucleus and spatial transcriptome data at 1h, 3 days, and 7days were downloaded (GSE214611). We conducted spatial transcriptome data analysis using the deconvolution algorithm. The deconvolution algorithm refers to the application of feature genes to infer the full matrix information of single-cell transcriptome of cell subclusters. We then compared and anchored the matrix information of the single-cell transcriptome with the information of each SPOT in the spatial transcriptome, predicting cell types based on the similarity between the two sets of information.</p>

<title>Statistic analysis</title>
<p>Data are presented as mean±standard error of mean (SEM). All data were analyzed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), and graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). Differences between two groups were evaluated using an unpaired Student’s t-test. Differences among three or more groups were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at P&lt;0.05.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>useful</bold> albeit preliminary findings on transcriptome changes in cardiac lymphatic cells after myocardial infarction in mice. Despite revision, the conclusions of the authors remain uncertain as sample sizes in general are very low, and even sometimes too low to allow for valid statistical comparisons. Accordingly, there are concerns regarding statistical robustness, raised by both the editors and the reviewers. While the single-cell transcriptomic data were analyzed using <bold>solid</bold> advanced methodology, too few cells were included in the scRNA-seq data set and the spatial transcriptomics analyses. Thus, this study rather represents more a collection of preliminary transcriptomic data than a full scientific report that would definitively advance the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Assessment of cardiac LEC transcriptomes post-MI may yield new targets to improve lymphatic function. scRNAseq is a valid approach as cardiac LECs are rare compared to blood vessel endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Extensive bioinformatics approaches employed by the group</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Too few cells included in scRNAseq data set and the spatial transcriptomics data that was exploited has little relevance, or rather specificity, for cardiac lymphatics. This study seems more a collection of preliminary transcriptomic data than a true scientific report to help advance the field.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>Thank you for the revision that helps clarify some outstanding questions.</p>
<p>(1) I still have questions relating to the relevance of the spatial maps generated and shown in fig 3C. They are supposedly generated using a 'molecular finger print' specific to each sub-cluster of LECs. However, given that at early stages postMI most populations are exceedingly rare in your analyses, could you please explain or comment on the relevance of the spatial maps?</p>
<p>(2) Fig 3 s1 would indicate that the population CaII is the majoritarian one in healthy hearts, while quantifications in Fig 3A show that rather the LEC Co subpopulation is majoritarian. Further, in mouse hearts histological analyses have demonstrated that cardiac lymphatics are restricted to the outer layers of the heart. This is not seen in your spatial maps. This seems to be the case only for the LEc Co population in healthy hearts, but not for other subpopulation signatures. Please explain.</p>
<p>(3) Further, the population of CaI, with 1 cell analysed in d3, but appears very prevalent in the spatial maps at d3. Please explain.</p>
<p>(4) In your list of 12 genes used as matrix anchors to identify LEC subpopulations in your screens, it is not apparent how LEC CaI, II and III differ so much as to allow selective detection of subpopulations. This similitude of profiles is supported by Fig 2F, and further explanations are needed to explain how the spatial maps of LEC ca subpopulations appear as distinct as shown in fig 3 S1 and Fig 3C.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study integrated single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points post-MI. They identified four transcriptionally distinct subtypes of lymphatic endothelial cells and localized them in space. They observed that LECs subgroups are localized in different zones of infarcted heart with functions. Specifically, they demonstrated that LEC ca III may be involved in directly regulating myocardial injuries in the infarcted zone concerning metabolic stress, while LEC ca II may be related to the rapid immune inflammatory responses of the border zone in the early stage of MI. LEC ca I and LEC collection mainly participate in regulating myocardial tissue edema resolution in the middle and late stages post-MI. Finally, cell trajectory and Cell-Chat analyses further identified that LECs may regulate myocardial edema through Aqp1, and likely affect macrophage infiltration through the galectin9-CD44 pathway. The authors concluded that their study revealed the dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity distribution of LECs in different regions of the infarcted heart and that LECs formed different functional subgroups that may exert different bioeffects in myocardial tissue post-MI.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses a significant clinical challenge, and the results are of great translational value. All experiments were carefully performed, and their data support the conclusion.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Q1: In response to reviewers you noted totally 292 sequenced LECs, however in reviewer figure 3 B the numbers seem to add up to 221. Please include mention of the total number of LEC sequences. Please mention line 119, page 4 the total number of explored LEC transcriptomes</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your carefully review. We have updated Fig 2A, 2C and 2E. It was 242 (not 292) LECs included in our initial analysis, which contains the sample of d5 post MI in raw data (E-MTAB-7895). We dropped d5 in our subsequent analysis because the change in d5 did not significant differ from d3. Therefore, we included 221 LECs in our final analysis as we updated in Fig2A, 2C and 2E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q2-1: Figure 3A supposedly shows % of LEC subpopulations relative to their numbers found in day 0 samples. However, there seem to be some errors, because for example the subpop LEC Cap I include 13 cells day 1 and 6 cells day 1, which corresponds to 46% of initial numbers. However, from your graph 3B the blue population seems to occupy 10%. Please revise or explain how these relative % were calculated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. In the Figure 3A, each column was calculated by dn/d0*100%, that is d0=57/57*100%=100%, and d1= 21/57*100%=36.84%, d3=9/57*100%=15.79%, d7, d14, d28...Therefor, Cap I in d0 (13 cells) is 13/57*100%=22.81%, and Cap I in d1(6 cells) is 6/57*100%= 10.53%.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q2-2: Further, based on the relative % of LEC subpopulations, using the numbers mentioned in Fig 3B, it would appear that the relative frequency LEC cap II population is actually stable at around 20-30% of all LECs per time point throughout the study (except day 1 drop). This contrasts with line 136 p. 4 statement. I would also urge caution for interpreting too much into the variation of relative levels of LEC co, as these represent exceeding rare cells in your samples, and could reflect technical issues rather than true biological variation (total LEC co numbers analyzed ranging from 1-24 cells/ time point). The same could be said of LEC cap II and cap III.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We strongly agree with your comment on the proportion of LEC cell subtypes post MI. As you pointed out, we have revised the result description on Page 4, line 137-143 as followed.</p>
<p>“In the early stages of myocardial infarction (D1 and D3), the quantity of LECs decreased sharply. The number of LECs gradually increasing from day 7 and returning to normal levels by day 14 after MI. Moreover, from day 14 onwards, the number and proportion of Ca I type LECs significantly increased.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q3: Please list in supplement the gene features used to identify in spatial transcriptomics the different LEC subpopulations, as their profiles (notably for capillary LECs) don't appear to be very different based on data in Fig 2F.</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>Q4: In section 2.7 you refer to Gal9 secretion. Please replace with expression as no measure of protein levels from LECs has been described in your study.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion, we have replaced secretion with expression.</p>

<p>Q5: The updated method to exclude non-lymphatic cells from lymphatic vessel analyses by incorporating pdpn as an additional marker ('present costained areas wherever possible' line 350 p 10)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your correction. We have updated the description as follows and lighted them in the manuscript: rabbit anti-Lyve1 (1:300, ab14917, Abcam, UK), [Syrian hamster anti-Podoplanin (1:100, 53-5381-82, Thermo, USA), rabbit anti-Prox1(1:300, ab199359, Abcam, UK), both anti-podoplain and anti-prox1 are additional markers co-stained with Lyve1 to exclude non-lymphatic cells from lymphatic vessel].</p>

<p>Q6: Fig 1B, it is highly surprising to see the lymphatic density in the BZ go from 25 um² at day 3 to more than 1000 um² only four days later (day 7). Is it possible that your day 3 measurements were in the infarct area, and not BZ area? The H&amp;E image shown in Fig1a for d3 sample would seem to indicate the analysis was done in a dead area, rather than BZ. Please revise (perhaps select similar zone as shown for d1 in fig 6D, adjusted for subepicardial region and not mid-myocardial as seems to be the case currently), and also provide lymphatic area measures in healthy myocardium for day 0 samples. The unit used (um²) also would depend on the size of the area examined. Is this unit per image? If so please report total imaged area as a reference.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A6: Thank you for your reminding and advises. We have labeled each zone on H&amp;E and IF images in Fig1-supplementary Fig2B, and updated a clearer histological photo taken at 3 days post MI in Fig1A. Furthermore, we recalculated the lymphatic vessel area ratio as you suggested by calculating the ratio of LEC co-stained area to total imaged area under 100-fold magnification.</p>

<p>Q7: The mention that CD68 antibody isn't compatible with lyve1 antibody could easily have been bridged by using other macrophage markers, such as F4/80, which is readily available and often used marker for macs in mice and comes notably as a rat anti-mouse F4-80. It would have added much more relevant information to exclude Lyve1-/F4/80+ cells as compared to the current analysis, which may indeed include in area measures Lyve1+ /Pdpn- single cells erroneously spotted as 'lymphatic vessels'</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your excellent suggestion. We co-stained the sample with F4/80 and LYVE1 and supplied in the Fig1-supplementary Figure 1E, as shown in Author response image 1.</p>

<p>Q1: Language expression must be improved. Many incomplete sentences exist throughout the manuscript. A few examples: Line 70-71: In order to further elucidate the effects and regulatory mechanisms of the lymphatic vessels in the repair process of myocardial injury following MI. Line 71-73. This study, integrated single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different timepoints after MI from publicly available data (E-MTAB-7895, GSE214611) in the ArrayExpress and gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases. Line 88-89: Since the membrane protein LYVE1 can present lymphatic vessel morphology more clearly than PROX1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your correction. We have carefully inspected and corrected the whole manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q2: The type of animal models (i.e., permanent MI or MI plus reperfusion) included in Array Express and gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases must be clearly defined as these two models may have completely different effects on lymphatic vessel development during post-MI remodeling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your excellent suggestion. The animal models used in both E-MTAB-7895 and GSE214611 are permanent MI. We have modified the model information in the methodology section (page 12, line 400-401).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q3: Line 119-120: Caution must be taken regarding Cav1 as a lymphocyte marker because Cav1 is expressed in all endothelial cells, not limited to LEC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for your reminding. Cav 1 used in our clustering is one of the marker gene for its different expression in sub-types of LECs, referred in article PMID: 31402260</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q4: Figure 1 legend needs to be improved. RZ, BZ, and IZ need to be labeled in all IF images. Day 0 images suggest that RZ is the tissue section from the right ventricle.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have labeled and updated the regions of RZ, BZ, and IZ in H&amp;E and IF image in Figure1-Figure supplement 2B.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q5: The discussion section needs to be improved and better focused on the findings from the current study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your good comment. Based on your suggestion, we have revised the first paragraph of the discussion from lines 250-256 (Page 7) as followed:</p>
<p>Cardiac lymphatics play an important role in myocardial edema and inflammation. This study, for the first time, integrated single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points of post-MI, and identified four transcriptionally distinct subtypes of LECs and their dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity distribution in different regions of myocardial tissue post-MI. These subgroups of LECs were shown to form different function involved in the inflammation, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and water absorption related regulation of vasopressin during the process of myocardial repair after MI.</p>
