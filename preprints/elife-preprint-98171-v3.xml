<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Over the past decade, several studies have demonstrated that idiosyncratic animal behaviors remain consistent over long time periods. The consistency of individually variable behaviors over time is often referred to as an animal’s individuality, or if consisting of multiple traits personality. However, most experimental studies have focused on individuality in a single, well-defined environmental context, whereas it is well-established from population studies that animal behavior is highly context-dependent. The ‘person-situation debate’ in humans and decades of observations of animal individuality under intrinsically variable natural conditions raise the question of whether and to what extent animal behavior remains stable across different situations, such as changing environmental contexts. For instance, one individual might be generally more visually guided than another, or rely only on one particular visual cue, or even on this very cue only in a specific environmental context. Here, we use a combination of both well-established and novel behavioral assays to demonstrate the relationship between individual behavior and variable environmental context under tightly controlled laboratory conditions in the model system <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The consistency of three individual traits (termed exploration, attention, and anxiety) was investigated under changing environmental contexts (temperature, visual cues, arena shape), in both walking and flying flies. We find that individuality is highly context-dependent, but even under the most extreme environmental alterations tested, consistency of behavioral individuality always persisted in at least one of the traits. Furthermore, our quantification reveals a hierarchical order of environmental features influencing individuality. We confirmed this hierarchy using a generalized linear model and a hierarchical linear mixed model. In summary, our work demonstrates that, similar to humans, fly individuality persists across different contexts, and individual differences shape behavior across variable environments, thereby making the underlying developmental and functional mechanisms amenable to genetic dissection.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In this version, we now clarify how the direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of specific coefficients reflect the influence of different environmental factors on the persistence of individual behavioral traits. To make this accessible to readers from diverse backgrounds, we explicitly outline the criteria we used to evaluate whether the GLM results support our hypothesis about the hierarchical influence of environmental context, namely, whether the structure and strength of effects align with the patterns predicted from our prior correlation analysis
We have also incorporated a hierarchical linear mixed-effects model into our analysis (now presented in Figure 10), accompanied by a new supplementary table (Table T3). We also updated the Methods (line 433+), Results (line 637+), and Discussion (line
746+) sections to describe the rationale, implementation, and implications of the mixed-model analysis.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animal species display enormous interindividual differences in behavior. The temporal consistency of these interindividual differences allows for defining these idiosyncrasies as animal individuality, also called animal temperament, behavioral syndrome, or if the entirety of trait differences between individuals is meant, even animal personality (Andrew <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Sih et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gosling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Reale et al., 2007</xref>). Animal individuality has been described for numerous species and behaviors, including: mouse exploration behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Freund et al., 2013</xref>), great tit feeding preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Partridge, 1976</xref>), octopus threat responses and feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mather &amp; Anderson, 1993</xref>), pea aphid threat responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schuett et al., 2011</xref>), as well as vinegar fly handedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ayroles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>), olfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Honegger et al., 2020</xref>), phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kain et al., 2012</xref>), and object orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>). The temporal consistency of individuality allows for discriminating it from short-term behavioral changes, like internal state variations. Furthermore, temporal consistency of behavior allows modifications by learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kahsai &amp; Zars, 2011</xref>) and behavior-based natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lapiedra et al., 2018</xref>). Historically, the ‘nature vs. nurture’ debate (i.e., genome vs. environment) has shaped our understanding of the origins of behavioral individuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Galton, 1875</xref>). Stochastic developmental processes are a more recently found factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Honegger &amp; de Bivort, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>), providing an additional layer to gene-environmental interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Traynor &amp; Singleton, 2010</xref>). Most experimental studies on animal individuality have focused on a single behavior set in a singular environment, yet commonly used definitions of animal individuality in predominantly field-based disciplines such as behavioral ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Reale et al., 2007</xref>), and the definition of human personality entail behavioral consistency across situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mischel, 1968</xref>). Similar to humans, animals will never re-encounter the exact same situation under natural conditions, and animal personality can be an important factor in determining the ecological success of an animal and, as a consequence, its entire population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Takola &amp; Schielzeth, 2022</xref>). It is, therefore, crucial to understand how an animal’s personality or individuality in specific traits interacts with variable environments. Despite decades of interest in animal individuality across situations, the experimental evidence remains insufficient, and the results are contradictory, with studies arguing for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Briffa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Herborn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kralj-Fišer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mowles et al., 2012</xref>) and against (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coleman &amp; Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">D’Eath &amp; Burn, 2002</xref>) individuality in animals across situations with many finding mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boissy &amp; Bouissou, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Spoolder et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Werkhoven et al., 2021</xref>). Here we sought to systematically investigate the consistency of individual behavioral differences across situations using laboratory-controlled variable environmental conditions.</p>
<p>There is ample evidence for the consistency of human personality and animal individuality over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Weisbuch et al., 2010</xref>). Intuitively, humans attribute consistent personalities to other humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ross, 1977</xref>). The consistency of human behavior across situations, including environmental context, nevertheless remains highly debated, with several studies arguing for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fleeson, 2001</xref>) and against it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hartshorne &amp; May, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mischel, 1968</xref>). Summarized as the ‘person-situation debate’, psychologists have argued for over a century about the relationship between personality and the situational environment, placing this question at the core of personality psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mischel, 1968</xref>). Animal models for behavioral consistency across situations provide an opportunity to address this question. In our study, the situation is the sum of all environmental features where a specific behavioral task is performed. The work presented here establishes a quantitative animal model to investigate this and related questions about behavioral consistency across environmental situations.</p>
<p>The vinegar fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> provides an enormous toolset for studying individuality and its origins across multiple scales, from neurons to circuits, to behavior. This comprises a rapidly unfolding connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dorkenwald et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), an extensive collection of cell type-specific, binary expression systems (Luan, Peabody, et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>), and a similarly extensive collection of tools for manipulating neuronal function, including neuronal silencers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baines et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sweeney et al., 1995</xref>), activators (Luan, Lemon, et al., 2006), and thermogenetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) and optogenetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pulver et al., 2009</xref>) effectors. Hence, the availability of tools and reagents for manipulating small, defined sets of neurons is no longer a major limitation in answering questions about individual behavioral differences. Instead, what has been missing is an integrative approach combining different high-throughput behavioral assays, which would allow for behavioral screening and classification of large quantities of individual flies for several different behavioral parameters across a variety of environmental contexts.</p>
<p>In recent years, mainly low-throughput, single-fly visual assays like the classical two-stripe Buridan assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bülthoff et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Götz, 1980</xref>), arenas for tethered walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Seelig et al., 2010</xref>) or virtual flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mathejczyk &amp; Wernet, 2020</xref>) have been used to study behavioral individuality in vison-based tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Mathejczyk &amp; Wernet, 2019</xref>). In Buridan’s paradigm, flies walk between two inaccessible visual targets (two vertical high-contrast stripes). The stripes are presented in a homogenously illuminated surrounding with no other visual or non-visual cues. Apart from work on individuality involving Dorsal Cluster Neurons (DCNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hassan et al., 2000</xref>), also known as Lobula Columnar Neuron 14 (LC14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Otsuna &amp; Ito, 2006</xref>), Buridan’s paradigm has been used to show the importance of the central complex for normal walking speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Strauss et al., 1992</xref>) and for studying photoreceptor function or development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kiral et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Strauss et al., 2001</xref>), and visual memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Neuser et al., 2008</xref>). Other circular arenas have been frequently used to study locomotory activity without visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Branson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Robie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Valente et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to these low throughput assays, high throughput assays for studying the behavioral responses of large amounts of animals have been used primarily for genetic screens. Examples include apparatuses to study phototaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hirsch &amp; Boudreau, 1958</xref>), geotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hirsch, 1959</xref>), olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Quinn et al., 1974</xref>), and circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Konopka &amp; Benzer, 1971</xref>). The Ethoscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>) and MARGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Werkhoven et al., 2019</xref>) are recent additions to this repertoire that offer several additional high-throughput assays. Except for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> activity monitors (DAM, Trikinetiks), Ethoscope, and MARGO, these group assays cannot distinguish individual behavioral differences. Only the Ethoscope and MARGO provide some visual modules. Hence, progress towards understanding individuality in visually guided behaviors in a high-throughput fashion remains meager, with few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ayroles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kain et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the influence of the environment on the consistency of visually guided individuality and, to systematically quantify individuality across many behavioral traits and their dependency on the environment in walking flies, we built a new multi-parameter assay called Indytrax. Indytrax is a compact and affordable Mathworks MATLAB-based modular assay and tracker for high-throughput individual ethological quantification. The assay includes swappable modules for multiple high-throughput Buridan paradigms, a Y-maze choice assay for studying the decision-making and locomotor handedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>), and a simple setup to quantify locomotor activity in large groups of flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Branson et al., 2009</xref>). We used this tracker to determine the relative contribution of various environmental features (temperature, visual cues, arena shape) to the consistency of individual behavior. Our results show that identically defined visual stimuli (stripe color, width, and length) do not necessarily evoke the same behavior in an individual when presented in different environments. Conversely, we find that specific individual behavioral traits (attention, exploration, and anxiety, categorized via multiple behavioral parameters) remain stable even in different environments. Finally, using an LED-based virtual flight arena, we show that attention towards a stimulus remains stable even across different modalities of locomotion (walking versus flying) when using the same Buridan-type visual stimulus. Hence, we find stable behavioral traits across situations in our fly model, in analogy to what has been demonstrated for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fleeson, 2001</xref>). Altogether, our results provide the foundation for understanding the complex interaction between individuality and the environment, including the question of why individual behavior is more unpredictable in variable naturalistic conditions, much like the consistency across situations in human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mischel, 1968</xref>).</p>

<title>Assay and fly number overview</title>
<p>We tested flies across three main behavioral assays and systematically altered five environmental context parameters, but not all flies could be subjected to all environmental context modifications. In the “classical” Buridan assay, we tested 60 flies over three days, 57 different flies with three different stripe numbers, and 54 different flies with three different background illuminations. In the high-throughput assay, we tested 400 flies, with each fly tested in two different temperatures, with light on/off, and in two different arena shapes. In the flight simulator, we tested 30 flies, with each fly tested across two days and three contrast conditions. Furthermore, we tested with 73 different flies in the flight simulator first and then in the “classical” Buridan assay.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments were performed using one week old wild-type <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (CantonS (Source: Bassem Hassan) and TopBanana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Warren et al., 2018</xref>)) reared on a standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> yeast cornmeal medium (7.5g Agar, 64g cornmeal, 160g yeast, 85.5ml sugar cane syrup in 1L of water) at 25°C and 50% relative humidity under a 12/12 light/dark rhythm. Individual flies were placed into the behavioral arenas using a fine brush and were allowed to accommodate for about 10 minutes before any experiment. The behavioral arenas and flies were cooled on ice for Y-maze experiments before gently loading single flies into the chambers using a fine brush. For experiments with clipped wings, the wings were clipped close to the hinge under CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia, and flies were tested after being allowed to recover within individual vials for at least two days.</p>

Flies were walking on a circular platform (diameter 12cm) between two opposing black vertical stripes (angular extent 12° horizontal and 90° vertical measured from the center of the platform). A trench of water surrounded the platform to prevent the flies from escaping (type A) or a clear plastic hemispherical dome coated with Sigmacote (Sigma-Aldrich, SL2-25ML) from the inside (type B). Single-fly walking behavior was recorded at 25°C and 50% relative humidity for 15 minutes (450×450, 8-bit greyscale, 20 Hz, AVI, Mjpeg compression, 90% quality). Before changing an experimental condition, flies were placed back into single vials for recovery.</p>

<p>Data was analyzed either in real-time using previously described code (type A, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colomb et al., 2012</xref>)) or offline using a custom-written MATLAB code (type B, available for download from github.com/LinneweberLab/Mathejczyk_2024_eLife_Individuality, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">supplemental Fig. S1c</xref>), respectively. Thresholded video frames and overlaying trajectories are displayed continuously in a separate window to allow the experimenter to assess tracking quality. The MATLAB code works as follows: the circular region of interest (ROI) is automatically detected based on adaptive thresholding and subsequent filtering of the thresholded ROI based on area. Once the ROI is detected, a background image is generated by calculating the maximum intensity between a recorded video’s first and last frames. All flies that moved between those frames will not appear in this background-only image. During tracking, the background image is subtracted from each consecutive frame to simplify the thresholding of the fly. For each frame, the centroid of these thresholded pixels is stored. Should more than one object be detected within a ROI (e.g., through pixel noise), the x-/y-coordinates of the object closest to the fly’s position in the previous frame are stored. If a fly is lost, the tracker keeps the last known position of the fly until it is detected again.</p>

<title>Data output</title>
<p>Once tracking is completed, the raw tracking results are converted to real-world units (mm) and saved into a .mat-file. Before further analysis, minimal movements are filtered out by only updating the fly’s position if a certain walking threshold (0.8mm/frame) is detected. For each fly, a figure can be saved, allowing for a quick overview of the walking trajectory, and a variety of behavioral parameters are also saved into a separate .txt-file to simplify further data analysis. For a detailed explanation of calculated parameters, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">supplemental table 1</xref>. For an in-depth analysis of Buridan data, sophisticated data analysis routines describing many behavioral parameters were previously developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colomb et al., 2012</xref>). To simplify data integration and compatibility, the raw trajectories can also be saved to a pair of .TXT and .DAT files, which can later be read and analyzed by previously available software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colomb et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Setup 2: IndyTrax multi-arena platform</title>
<sec id="s3b1">
<title>Assay</title>
<p>To allow for high-throughput behavioral quantification under various tightly controlled environmental contexts, we designed the novel assay system IndyTrax. In short: single flies are transferred to an array of small behavioral arenas. They are filmed from below against near-infrared (850nm + Lee filters 87C IR-pass filter on camera objective) LED illumination (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Compared to published Buridan assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colomb et al., 2012</xref>), this allows tracking flies in the absence of visible light, but also has the advantage that flies cannot see the camera lens which might otherwise appear as a high-contrast object from within the arena. The assay was designed to allow for the tracking of flies in various possible arena shapes and numbers. We created three different 3D-printable arena types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplemental Fig. S4e-g</xref>), which can be downloaded from github.com/LinneweberLab/Mathejczyk_2024_eLife_Individuality. For individuality analysis, we used the multi-Buridan and Y-maze arenas. The setup was built from commercially available and 3D-printed parts. For a part list, see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">supplemental table 2</xref>. All 3D-printed parts and behavioral assays were printed on a Prusa i3 mk3 printer using black or white PLA filament (Verbatim 55318) and can be downloaded from github.com/LinneweberLab/Mathejczyk_2024_eLife_Individuality. Similarly, the MATLAB code for tracking and data analysis can be downloaded from there. For detailed instructions on how to install and run the code, see the supplemental information. With a computer running MATLAB already available, we estimate the building cost for a complete, temperature-and humidity-controlled enclosure, including all behavioral assays, at about 3500€.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b2">
<title>Temperature- and humidity-controlled enclosure</title>
<p>Behavioral arenas are located within a black, climate-controlled metal enclosure. Temperature and humidity within the enclosure can be regulated using two 3D-printed humidifiers and a heating plate (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplemental Fig. S4a</xref>). Ambient temperature and humidity can be set at any desired value using this configuration and kept stable over a long time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplemental Fig. S4c</xref>). Since small, enclosed arenas are prone to heat build-up, we placed all temperature- and humidity-sensors within the center arena (arena 13) for Buridan experiments and close to the flies in Y-maze experiments. For Buridan experiments, this limits the number of simultaneously trackable arenas to 24 but allows more accurate climate control within the chambers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b3">
<title>Small-scale Buridan-stimuli arrays</title>
<p>We modified the basic design of previously published behavioral arenas optimized for Buridan object orientation behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colomb et al., 2012</xref>) by implementing changes in four major areas to allow for high throughput tracking: Firstly, we reduced the arena diameter to allow for filming an array (5×5) of optically isolated Buridan arenas with only a single camera (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Secondly, flies are walking on circular translucent acrylic plates (49mm diameter) which allows for filming flies from below against infrared back-illumination, hence avoiding problems with dead angles that would arise when filming cylindrical arrays from above. Thirdly, during experiments, flies are contained on their respective acrylic platform by clear hemispherical plastic domes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). This removes the necessity of cutting the flies’ wings before experiments and saves space by making the water-filled moats of the original design superfluous. Plastic domes were coated with Sigmacote (Sigma-Aldrich, SL2-25ML) from the inside to prevent the flies from sitting on the dome surface. Fourthly, to provide a scalable, homogeneously illuminated white background for optical stimulus presentation, the fluorescent tubes of the original design were replaced with electroluminescent (el-)foil wrapped around translucent acrylic cylinders (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Such el-foils can be cut to size and have low heat emission. They emit light evenly over the whole surface, minimizing unwanted intensity cues within the arenas. El foils are driven at 2 kHz, thus providing virtually flicker-free white illumination to the flies. For creating the Buridan object orientation stimulus, thin black stripes (12° wide as measured from the arena center) were 3D printed and glued vertically to the inside of the arena walls 180° apart, thereby creating high-contrast objects against a uniform white background (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Individual arenas were fitted into a 5×5 array. Every other arena within the array was rotated by 90° counter-clockwise to increase the robustness of behavioral readouts by canceling out possible directional artifacts created within the enclosure.</p>
<p>Walking behavior was recorded at 50% relative humidity for 15 minutes (1200×1200 pixel, 8-bit greyscale, 15 Hz, AVI, Mjpeg compression, 90% quality) with either the el-foil-illumination on, in darkness, at 23°C or 32°C, respectively. After being tested in the Buridan assay, the flies were put back into single vials overnight to allow for recovery before testing them in the Y-maze assay the next day around the same time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b4">
<title>Y-maze array</title>
<p>We constructed a modular 3D-printable Y-maze array (144 arenas, 300×300×2mm) based on a previously published design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Werkhoven et al., 2019</xref>). The Y-maze plates were placed between two 320×320×3mm borosilicate glass plates. The bottom side of the upper glass plate was coated three times using Sigmacote (Sigma-Aldrich, SL2-25ML) to prevent the flies from walking on the upper plate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Directly below the arenas and above the upper glass plate, we placed a layer of white paper (Evercopy premium 80g, Ref. 1902C) for light diffusion and to restrict the view of the flies outside of the arenas. For individuality experiments, we covered the outer arenas with black tape and tracked flies only within 100 arenas located in the center. This made keeping track of individual fly identities easier when switching between the different behavioral assays. Videos of walking flies were recorded at 50% relative humidity for 30 minutes (1200×1200 pixel, 8-bit greyscale, 15 Hz, AVI, Mjpeg compression, 90% quality) under white light illumination, in darkness, at 23°C or 32°C, respectively. For white light illumination, we placed a 30×30cm LED panel (Tween Light 30 x 30 cm LED panel, 4000k, 16W) on top of the arenas and temporarily removed the infrared-pass filter from the camera objective. Y-maze experiments were all done consecutively on the same day (light on 23°C, light off 23°C, light on 32°C, light off 32°C).</p>

<sec id="s3b5">
<title>Automated tracking procedure</title>
<p>We developed a fully-automated MATLAB-based tracking code that allows users to adjust parameters like arena number and size and generates output data for all videos within a user-selectable folder. The code assumes only one fly per region of interest. This saves processing time and increases tracking robustness by not having to match multiple fly identities between frames. Before running the code, the experimenter must create a camera calibration file using the MATLAB camera calibration toolbox (see supplemental information). This allows for more accurate tracking results by correcting lens distortions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplemental Fig. S4d</xref>). If the camera stays immobile, this procedure must be done only once, usually in only a few minutes. As long as the arenas filmed are arranged in rows and columns, the code can handle virtually any shape or number of arenas, making it ideal for tracking flies across different behavioral assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplemental Fig. S4e-g</xref>). Regions of interest (ROIs) are detected based on adaptive thresholding and subsequent filtering of thresholded ROI-objects based on the area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplemental Fig. S4e-g</xref>, middle). Once the ROIs are detected and sorted, a background-subtracted image is generated, allowing the user to determine a detection threshold, above which all pixels will be interpreted as foreground objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplemental Fig. S4e</xref>, third from left). During tracking, background subtraction and object thresholding is performed for each frame, and for each ROI the centroid of the thresholded fly is extracted and saved. Thresholded pixels and trajectories are displayed continuously in a separate window to allow the experimenter to assess tracking quality. If more than one object is detected within a ROI (e.g. through pixel noise), the x-/y-coordinates of the object closest to the fly’s position in the previous frame is stored. If a fly is lost, the tracker keeps the last known position of the fly until it is detected again. The average tracking speed for 24 ROIs/flies was about 20hz with MATLAB running on an Intel i5 3Ghz CPU. For tracking 400 ROIs/flies average tracking speed was about 5hz.</p>

<title>Setup 3: Virtual flight simulator</title>
<sec id="s3c1">
<title>Assay</title>
<p>We designed a novel, easy-to-assemble, and easy-to-use virtual flight simulator using affordable 3D-printable and off-the-shelf parts (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-c</xref>) to quantify behavioral responses during flight. For a detailed description of the setup and custom code, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">supplemental Fig. S9</xref>. In short, using a tethering station (for description, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mathejczyk &amp; Wernet, 2020</xref>)), flies were cooled down for immobilization and glued to a steel pin (0.1mm diameter, 10mm length, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.entosphinx.cz">www.entosphinx.cz</ext-link>) using UV-cured glue (Bondic). Once tethered, single flies were put between two neodymium magnets (magneto-tether; upper magnet: diameter 5mm, lower magnet: ring, outer diameter 10mm, inner diameter 5mm). Once the appropriate distance between the magnet is found (about 20mm), the magnetic field allows the flies to rotate freely around their yaw-axis while keeping the steel pin in place (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The tip of the steel pin is inserted into a V-shaped sapphire bearing (1mm diameter) to reduce friction. For re-initiation of flight, air puffs can be delivered from below via a membrane pump. A panoramic LED matrix surrounding the magneto-tether was used for Buridan stimulus presentation (RGB, 256×128 pixels, 120Hz frame rate, 5kHz refresh rate, pixel size 1.4°, angular extent 360° horizontal x 100° vertical, stripe width: 12°). The LED matrix controller is connected to a computer via HDMI, allowing an easy and flexible stimulus creation and presentation (Novastar mctrl 660 pro, 120Hz, &lt; 1ms Pixel update latency). Flies were filmed from below under near-infrared illumination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), and each fly’s heading was tracked in real-time (90 Hz) using a custom-written MATLAB code (available for download from github.com/LinneweberLab/Mathejczyk_2024_eLife_Individuality). Before starting the experiment, each fly was tested for 120s with an optomotor stimulus (rotating stripe pattern, 120°/s, 40x CW and 40x CCW, respectively) to assess the flies’ ability to rotate smoothly (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>, left). After this, flies were presented with the Buridan stimulus with varying contrast (100%, 50%, 100% inverted; stripe width 30°), and their heading was tracked for 3×4 min. Flies were then carefully separated from the steel pin and transferred into single vials for overnight recovery before being re-tethered and tested the following day around the same time. For flight vs. walking experiments, flies were tested for 10 min while flying under a 100% contrast Buridan stimulus (stripe width 12° from a fly’s perspective) before being gently separated from the steel pin and being transferred into the LED Buridan assay (Type B), where they were tested for 15min under a 100% contrast Buridan stimulus (stripe width 12° from a fly’s perspective).</p>

<title>Automated tracking procedure</title>
<p>The code for tracking a fly’s heading in 360° can be downloaded from github.com/LinneweberLab/Mathejczyk_2024_eLife_Individuality. Flight tracking is done in real-time at 90fps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">supplemental Fig. S9c</xref>). A timestamp is created for each incoming camera frame, and two different thresholded images are computed with different Gaussian filter settings. A strong filter setting blurs out the legs of the fly and allows for thresholding only the fly’s body and calculating a heading angle between 0° and 180° through ellipse fitting. By subtracting the thresholded body pixels from a weaker filtered version of the same frame, the limbs and wings (visible when the fly stops flying) can also be tracked separately if the experimenter wants. To calculate the heading between 0° and 360°, the centroid of thresholded body pixels is set to (0,0) within a fictive coordinate system (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">supplemental Fig. S9c</xref>), and the body axis is aligned with the x-axis. The head region is assigned based on the sum of pixels within the 4-axis quadrants (smallest area of either I+IV or II+III, respectively). Once the heading is calculated, it is stored together with the original video frame for additional offline data analysis, if desired. When a fly stops flying (wings get detected in the video), a command is sent to a connected Arduino, which controls a relay to switch on a membrane pump and provide an air puff to reinitiate flight. During tracking, the thresholded video is displayed together with the computed heading to allow the experimenter to assess tracking quality.</p>

<p>All data analysis was performed with MATLAB. For angular calculations, we used algorithm presented in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berens, 2009</xref>). After a test for normality (Shapiro-Wilk-Test), behavioral data between groups was compared using the paired T-test. For correlating individual data, we calculated Pearson correlation coefficients. For walking data, an arena’s center region (edge-corrected area) was defined as the circular area around the center with a radius of 80% of the arena radius. The maximum color value (red) for generating heatmaps was set to the 95%-quantile of the count distribution to increase data visibility. Flies that did not move during the experiment were excluded from the analysis.</p>

<title>Generalized Linear Model (GLM)</title>
<p>To summarize and generalize the findings from all experiments in this study (using individual rank differences upon changing one or more environmental parameters), a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was trained using the environmental parameters as predictors (0 when environmental parameter was not changed and 1 if it was changed for any given experimental group) and the resulting individual rank differences as the response variable. Since the five environmental parameters are not fully statistically independent (e.g., arena and vision were altered only in walking experiments and not in flight), we employed ridge regression to mitigate collinearity among these predictors and to control for overfitting. In contrast to stepwise or LASSO regression, ridge regression allowed us to keep all environmental parameters as part of the model. A range of regularization parameters (λ) was tested using 5-fold cross-validation over a log-spaced grid (10⁻⁶ - 10⁶) to identify the optimal value that minimized the mean squared error (MSE). Z-scoring was applied to the predictor variables prior to model fitting for data normalization. To estimate coefficient variability and assess significance, bootstrapping was applied. For each of the 1,000 bootstrap iterations, predictors and response data were resampled with replacement, and the ridge regression model was refit using the optimal λ. Coefficients and intercept values from each bootstrap sample were stored, and their distributions were used to calculate the mean coefficients, standard errors (SEs), and p-values for coefficients based on t-statistics derived from bootstrapped SEs.</p>

<title>Hierarchical linear mixed-model</title>
<p>We collected behavioral data from all tested walking and flight assays and summarized the five previously quantified behavioral traits under different environmental contexts for walking and flight behaviors, respectively. For each trait, we fitted a hierarchical linear mixed-effects model in Matlab (using the fit lme function) with environmental context as a fixed effect and fly identity (ID) as a random intercept. Fixed effects were included to account for systematic differences due to the different environmental contexts whenever multiple context levels were tested for that trait. This controls for behavioral population-level shifts caused by changing the day, temperature, visual conditions, or the arena shape. Such a model partitions variance into within-fly and between-fly components. We computed the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) from each model as the between-fly variance divided by total variance. ICC, therefore, quantified repeatability across environmental contexts. We estimated 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ICC using non-parametric bootstrapping (flies were resampled with replacement across contexts, and models were refitted 1000 times).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The goal of our study was to understand to what extent animal individuality is influenced by situational changes in the environment, i.e., how much of an animal’s individuality remains after one or more environmental features change. Based on our previous work on animal individuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>), we started our analysis in the multiparametric two-stripe Buridan’s paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">supplemental Fig. S1</xref> for technical details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colomb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>). As expected, we measured interindividually variable, yet remarkably consistent behavioral responses, both on the individual (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">supplemental Fig. S3a</xref>) and mean group level (average of all individuals in the same situation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2a</xref>), when tested in the exact same situation with all environmental features kept the same. This was true for the five representative behavioral parameters (out of 20 parameters total, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">supplemental Table T1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">supplemental Fig. S8</xref>), defined in three behavioral traits: exploration (% of time walked, walking speed), attention (vector strength, angular velocity), and anxiety (centrophobicity). The exploration trait is characterized by parameters describing activity. Parameters related to attention reflect heightened responses to visual cues, but unlike commonly used metrics such as angle or stripe deviations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Colomb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>), they can be calculated in the absence of visual cues. Lastly, the parameter centrophobicity, used as an indicator of the trait anxiety, is linked to the open-field test in mice, where the ratio of wall-to-open-field activity is frequently calculated as a measurement of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carter &amp; Shieh, 2015</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Modifying the visual stimulus within the Buridan arena (0, 1, and 2 stripes were tested, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3b</xref>) significantly affected the mean group behavior across all three behavioral traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2b</xref>). Especially, the means of the three parameters (% of time walked, vector strength, and centrophobicity) were strongly affected by the stimulus modification. Surprisingly, despite this change in group means, we observed only a minor effect on individuality when testing the same fly in different situations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, measured by a high Pearson correlation coefficient and a consistent rank within the distribution). The individuality for the traits exploration and anxiety persisted even upon modulation (variation of stripe number) and after removing visual cues from the arena. Only those parameters describing the fly’s attention towards visual cues showed an unsurprising reduction in behavioral consistency upon removal of the visual stimuli (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that individuality persisted after stimulus modifications within the same arena, even when the modifications resulted in altered group responses.</p>
<p>To further characterize the surprising relationship between individuality and group means upon situational changes, we modified the homogeneity of background illumination in the Buridan arena using two different diffuser materials (paper and acryl-based covers of fluorescent ring lights) and compared these conditions to a newly designed Buridan LED arena displaying the same visual stimulus (stripes of the same color, width, and height) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3c</xref>). We measured no significant differences between the group means of the two diffuser conditions and only minor group-based changes compared to the LED Buridan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2c</xref>). We then tested the correlation of individual behavior across these conditions, as a measurement of behavioral consistency, expecting high correlations. Indeed, the different diffusers within the same arenas only had minor effects on the behavior of individual flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Conversely, the individual response changed dramatically when the same fly was tested again in the LED arena, albeit presenting the same stimulus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). A fly’s attention and anxiety parameters quantified within the original arena did not allow for any prediction for the LED arena (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Significant correlations between the LED arena and the original arenas were only measured for exploration parameters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). This unpredictability of individual fly behavior across situations was once again particularly surprising since group-based performances remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2c</xref>). Finally, a detailed comparison of males and females revealed only quantitative but no qualitative differences across all parameters between the two sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">supplemental Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the surprising result that individuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gosling, 2008</xref>) of visual orientation behavior is more strongly influenced by the arena type (despite producing very similar group responses) and, only to a lesser degree, dependent on the visual cue (despite strong differences in the group response), we set out to characterize the contribution of environmental situations to individuality even more quantitatively. We therefore built a multiplatform high-throughput assay (Indytrax) to quantitatively study the behavior of the same individual flies in different environmental situations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, technical details <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplemental Fig. S4</xref>).</p>

<p>Using Indytrax, we compared the behavioral parameters of each fly in eight different environmental situations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">supplemental Fig. S6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">S8</xref>). The flies were tested in two independent arenas (Buridan and Y-maze) at two different temperatures (23°C and 32°C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">supplemental Fig. S5</xref>) and under both light and dark conditions. Our analysis showed that temperature significantly affected exploration parameters on the group mean level. As expected, most animals tested were more explorative at higher than at lower temperatures ((reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gibert et al., 2016</xref>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">supplemental Fig. S6</xref>). Despite these group changes, individuals kept their rank within the group independent of the changed baseline activity. For example, fly #1 was the least explorative, fly #2 exploration performance ranked medium, and fly #3 the highest (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). The graphical analysis of exploration parameters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) confirmed that most individuals maintain their rank in the distribution under different temperatures and light-dark conditions, whereas the individual distribution rank changed between the different arena types. This relationship was less pronounced for attention parameters. The detailed correlative analysis between individuals underscores these observations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">supplemental Fig. S7</xref> and full analysis <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">supplemental Fig. S8</xref>): Amongst the exploration parameters, the percentage of time walked significantly correlated between individuals (Pearson r=0.263-0.398) independently of temperature, illumination, and arena. Walking speed was highly correlated between individuals (Pearson r=0.81, 0.825) under temperature and illumination changes but uncorrelated in different arena types (Pearson r=0.091). Vector strength was the most correlated attention parameter. The individual correlations ranged from Pearson r=0.533 to −0197. Angular velocity significantly correlated for temperature and illumination (Pearson r=0.246, 0.354) but not in different arenas (Pearson r=0.087). The same is true for anxiety measured through centrophobicity (Pearson r=0.694, 0.740, 0.033). In summary, these data revealed that individuality measured in three traits is mostly unaffected by temperature and illumination but strongly affected by the arena type. Our analysis confirmed that even in situations with a large effect on the mean group behavior (like temperature), individual behavioral consistency of idiosyncrasies remained high, while conversely, other environmental situations like the arena type had little impact on the mean but a massive effect on individual behavioral consistency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6</xref>). Qualitatively similar results leading to the same conclusions were obtained for both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7a</xref>) and two different genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7b</xref>)</p>

<p>Next, we drastically modified the behavioral situation while keeping the visual stimulus as constant as possible. We, therefore, decided to investigate the influence of a fly’s modality of locomotion (walking versus flying) on individuality. To do this, we designed a new virtual flight arena for tethered flight utilizing the exact same LED panels as were used in the LED Buridan arena (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-c</xref> and supplemental S9 for technical details), to maximize the similarity of the visual context. This flight simulator tracked a fly’s heading in real-time in response to dynamic or static panoramic visual stimuli with high resolution (1.4° pixel size). This allowed us to quantitatively compare the visual decisions of both walking and flying flies in response to standard optomotor and Buridan-like stimuli (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d-e</xref>). We first tested individuality in flying flies over time under the same and a set of modified visual stimuli (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">supplemental Fig. S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">S11</xref>). Each fly was tested over two consecutive days under three different visual conditions (dark stripes on a bright background with either 50% or 100% contrast, and an inverted Buridan with bright stripes on a dark background and 100% contrast) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Overall, the flies showed some individuality in visual attention across days and contrast. This was also true for the inverted Buridan stimulus, in which the flies oriented themselves toward the dark areas, similar to previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Han et al., 2021</xref>). To allow a quantitative comparison across behavioral traits between walking and flight behavior, we derived an adapted set of parameters for exploration and attention quantification (exploration parameters: # of pauses, Absolute angular velocity; attention parameters: Vector strength, Angular velocity, and Median heading axial, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). The resulting analyses revealed individuality in flying flies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Only the inversion of the Buridan stimulus resulted in variable angles towards the black background on different days. However, it is remarkable that on a given day, each fly selected an arbitrary heading that was kept for the entire experimental length (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Again, the quantitative analysis between males and females did not reveal qualitative differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Fig. S11</xref>).</p>

<p>After confirming that individuality also existed in flying flies, we tested how different locomotion modalities affected a given animal’s behavioral individuality. Behavioral parameters of both walking and flying flies were quantified in response to the same panoramic LED screen displaying an identical two-stripe Buridan stimulus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">supplemental Fig. S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">S13</xref>). We expected one of three possible outcomes: 1. There is no consistency of individual behavioral traits across flying and walking, 2. Only some behavioral traits are similar across flying and walking. 3. The fly’s individuality remains stable across the same visual cue, independent of the locomotive modality. Subsequent quantitative analysis indeed revealed a significant correlation for angular velocity between flying and walking flies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>), indicating that a fly’s attention towards a visual object is, to some degree, preserved independent of the locomotor modality. In contrast, we found no statistically significant correlations for any of the exploration parameters between flying and walking. Finally, a more detailed analysis revealed mostly comparable results for male and female data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">supplemental Fig. S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">S13</xref>).</p>

<p>The data presented here reveal a hierarchical influence of different parameters within the environmental context on individuality (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>): First, we conclude that time (at least within the frame of days) has a negligible influence on individual behavioral responses (the basis of the definition of animal individuality in a single situation), since we found consistency of individual behavioral traits and parameters over time in both locomotor modalities, walking and flying. Second, temperature had the second weakest impact on individuality (although only tested for walking behavior). This contrasts the dramatically altered group mean responses, a difference that can be explained by scaled individual responses in which individuals keep the rank in the group. Third, the nature of the visual input appears to influence the individual orientation responses but has little impact on the exploration parameters. Finally, we identified the most critical situational environmental features that determine individual responses as both the arena type and the locomotor modality (walking vs. flying). Therefore, we conclude that the individuality of visually guided behaviors persists specifically in some traits across situations, but the environmental context plays a prominent role in defining individual behavioral responses.</p>

<p>To verify the results of our multiple correlative analyses, we took advantage of a generalized linear model (GLM, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). We first analyzed the effect of time, temperature, vision, and arena on the mean group responses analogous to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>, <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">S10</xref>, S12, (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9a</xref>). Our reanalysis of the walking data confirmed the temperature dependency of activity parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6</xref>). It also revealed effects on the group means by vision and arena particularly for walking speed. The orientation parameter vector strength was similarly affected by temperature vision and arena (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6</xref>), while the position parameter centrophobicity was strongest affected by the arena (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">supplemental Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6</xref>). For flight parameters, the reanalysis of mean data revealed a strong effect of vision on the orientation parameter vector strength and the heading parameter median heading axial (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">supplemental Fig. S10</xref>). Our reanalysis, therefore, confirmed our previous analysis of mean group data.</p>

<p>The next step of our reanalysis was to compare the rank changes of our flies across situations analogous to the correlation analysis we had done (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Our reanalysis revealed significant changes in activity parameters and the orientation parameter vector strength. In these parameters, the effect on the rank of each individual increases from time over temperature, vision, and arena to the behavioral state. Confirming the data we found in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, and 8. Also, the lack of a significant effect of the behavioral state for angular velocity confirms our correlation analysis of <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we generated a GLM with ridge regression to show the effect of changing environmental situations on individual rank differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig, 9c</xref>). First, we converted the individual mean values for every behavioral trait to within-group ranks (0 to 100). We then used the GLM to predict the average change in rank for a fly when altering a single environmental context. Each bar in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9c</xref> represents the predicted influence of changing a certain environmental parameter on the persistence of each behavioral trait, where larger values indicate a larger influence on rank persistence and smaller values indicate less influence of the respective environmental context on rank persistence. Due to the response variable being in rank-points, the predicted rank shift due to changing the respective environmental context is the height of a bar in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9c</xref> added to the indicated intercept values. Based on our correlative analysis, we predicted a spectrum of context-dependencies of individual behavioral stability, where behavioral state &gt; arena &gt; vision &gt; temperature &gt; time in their ability to alter the persistence of individuality. The output of the GLM analysis supports that hypothesis, since calculated coefficients also indicate such a spectrum from rather stabilizing (e.g., time, temperature) to rather disruptive (arena, behavioral state). Our analysis shows that the effect was statistically significant for most environmental parameters.</p>
<p>For the activity parameters, time, temperature, and vision significantly stabilized individual phenotypical rank. In contrast, the arena and behavioral state significantly had a negative effect on rank stability. For the orientation parameter vector strength, we could fully replicate our previous findings that time had the strongest positive effect on consistency, followed by temperature. Vision had no significant impact. In contrast, the arena had a small negative effect consistency, while the behavioral state had a strong negative effect on behavioral consistency. In the second orientation parameter (angular velocity), a significant destabilizing effect was only found for the behavioral state. and for the positional parameter (centrophobicity), only vision had a significant effect on behavioral consistency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as an additional step in our reanalysis, a hierarchical linear mixed-model analysis confirmed the findings of the previous analyses while providing a more complete and accessible overview of the influence of different environmental contexts on behavioral traits and the individual stability (repeatability) of these traits across environmental contexts. For walking as well as flight, the majority of behavioral traits showed significant repeatability across different contexts with ICCs on the order of about 0.1-0.6 for walking and 0.2-0.4 for flight (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">supplementary table T3</xref>). When analyzing walking data, the highest ICCs were measured for activity and orientation-related traits, indicating that flies tend to keep their relative rank for these traits across environmental contexts. In contrast, centrophobicity as a measure for anxiety showed much lower repeatability across different contexts (ICC near 0). The pattern of repeatability was similar for flight traits, with high repeatability for activity traits and low repeatability for the exploratory trait (heading). Both vector strength and the heading showed only low ICCs across different contexts during flight, since the inversion of contrast had a very strong effect on the flies’ orientational choices (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), reducing rank stability in these traits. Although the flight assays showed slightly lower ICCs overall, possibly reflecting greater trial-to-trial noise, our key finding that individual behavioral traits are stable across different environmental contexts was robust across behavioral modalities (walking vs flight). Group-level behavior was shifted by environmental manipulations (e.g., increasing the temperature led to an increase in mean activity in walking and flight assays). However, individual differences were not erased by these shifts. E.g., in each context, flies that were relatively less active than the average in one environmental context remained so in other environmental contexts, therefore preserving rank order. Most environmental context effects appeared as shifts in the intercept (group means) rather than changes in the rank order of individual differences.</p>
<p>In summary, using three independent mathematical approaches, we have established a hierarchy of different environmental situations on behavioral consistency. This data demonstrates that temporal consistency is also prevalent in animals. Like humans also animals have significant consistency across situations, but similar to humans different situations evoke different behavioral responses, masking some measurable behavioral consistency.</p>

<sec id="s5">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our work presented here focused on the question of whether the combination of stable behavioral parameters ranging across different traits and therefore defining an animal’s individuality are invariable across situations or whether they are re-shaped by different environmental contexts. This question is closely related to the questions in the human ‘person-situation debate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mischel, 1968</xref>). Until now, in the neurosciences, individuality across situations has been largely ignored since many commonly used definitions of animal individuality only refer to the repeatability of behavior over time in a single environmental situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gosling, 2008</xref>). The contrary is true for mainly field and observation-based sciences such as ethology and behavioral ecology that have since decades acquired observations for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boissy &amp; Bouissou, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Spoolder et al., 1996</xref>) or against (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Coleman &amp; Wilson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">D’Eath &amp; Burn, 2002</xref>) behavioral consistency across situations, with some of the most convincing work probably found in hermit crabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Briffa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mowles et al., 2012</xref>), blue tits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Herborn et al., 2010</xref>), and geese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kralj-Fišer et al., 2007</xref>). Our work establishes animal individuality across situations under several tightly controlled laboratory conditions, revealing that animal individuality shares remarkable similarities to what has been described in human personality research. In agreement with Vansteelandt, 2004 our results are in line with the concept of the personality triad, emphasizing the interplay of individual, situation, and behavior (in humans: person, situation, and behavior) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Vansteelandt &amp; Van Mechelen, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results confirm that under the same environmental situation and stimulus, animals produce inter-individually variable, but extremely consistent behavioral responses when being retested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bell et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, consistent and individually variable behaviors likely result from individual brain properties that persist over long timescales (in this paper days as shown in previous papers months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>)), contrasting random behavioral variations like sudden internal state variations. Hence, when presented with the same stimulus in the same situation, each individual responds variably but repetitively so, pointing towards a deterministic and hardwired basis of individual properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The variability of the situational environmental context makes individual animal behavior in the wild much less predictable than that under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Briffa &amp; Greenaway, 2011</xref>). In opposition to the vast human literature on the ‘person-situation debate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Diener &amp; Larsen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fleeson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mischel, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Vansteelandt &amp; Van Mechelen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Weisbuch et al., 2010</xref>), the importance of environmental context in shaping individual animal behavior remains descriptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kralj-Fišer et al., 2007</xref>) and experimentally largely unexplored, with few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Briffa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mowles et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Versace et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Werkhoven et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we closed this gap in knowledge by quantitatively demonstrating how situational environmental and locomotor context changes individual behavior and individuality in animals. Our results demonstrate that situational environmental context has a pronounced effect on individual behavioral responses, be it an alternative stimulus representation, a different arena, or another locomotive modality.</p>
<p>Similar to the human literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mischel, 1968</xref>), the correlation coefficients are lower across situations than in the same situation or environmental context. From this, we can conclude that under more natural conditions with varying contexts, the consistency of individual traits measured by behavioral parameters will be reduced but remain measurable; therefore, for each situational context, the brain computes the appropriate behavior. This is like the situation-behavior profile of the individual in the personality psychology literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mischel &amp; Shoda, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mischel &amp; Shoda, 1998</xref>). Each time the individual is placed in the same situational context, the same behavior will be evoked, in a different context, a modified behavior. But despite these modifications, the individual brain properties computing the response remain the same. In line with lower but measurable behavioral consistency across situations, a vast literature demonstrates the importance of animal individual differences for ecological communities under natural conditions (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sih et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Takola &amp; Schielzeth, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Our quantitative analysis of the effect of environmental and locomotor context on behavioral consistency revealed a hierarchy. As expected from animal and human studies, the time frame of days had little effect on the behavioral outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mischel, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pantoja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Ross, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schuett et al., 2011</xref>). The hierarchy revealed by our experiments argues for differences in the relevance of environmental features for the traits we measured, which aligns with Mischel’s strong or weak situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mischel, 1973</xref>). Therefore, it is unsurprising that exploration can be best measured across situations within experiments of walking flies, and attention towards a stimulus can be measured across movement modalities. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that situational context can be the most significant factor in determining the individual behavioral outcome, even in a per-design visual assay. This argues that individual behavior is determined by the entirety of the situation consisting of both the stimulus and the environmental context. For each situation, each individual manifests its individual behavior.</p>
<p>In the future, it will be important to investigate which individual neurophysiological responses change when tested under exactly the same stimulus, but different situations. A systematic analysis of relevant circuit elements for different behaviors will allow for determining the exact neuronal substrates underlying individual behavioral computations within a fly’s or other animals’ brains. This future research on animal models will provide important new insight into the ‘person-situation debate‘.</p>
<p>On a more practical level, the importance of the situational environmental context for shaping individual behavioral outcomes is also very important when comparing the results of different research groups when using similar behavioral paradigms. In many instances, it is impossible to replicate all components of a specific assay, let alone the conditions of the experimental room. Our results show that such details substantially impact individual behavioral responses and contribute to errors in replicating the results from another lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Crabbe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lithgow et al., 2017</xref>). Only meticulous and detailed reporting of as many environmental features as possible will hopefully alleviate some of these problems in the future. Also, in terms of statistics, using well-established approaches can be an advantage. The hierarchical mixed-model analysis provides a more complete and accessible overview of the findings in our study, making it more comparable to previous findings in behavioral ecology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dingemanse &amp; Dochtermann, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our work confirms that animals, including flies, have, like humans, individuality across situations. Similar to humans, animal individuality across situations is also marked by lower correlation coefficients than repetitions of a single situation. The individual is stable across situations producing individualistic behavior through an interaction with the situation. This involves a hierarchy of influence of different environmental features on the predictability of behavior across situations.</p>

<p>There is a growing interest in understanding the individuality of animal behaviours. In this <bold>important</bold> article, the authors build and use an impressive array of high throughput phenotyping paradigms to examine the 'stability' (consistency) of behavioural characteristics in a range of contexts and over time. The results show that certain behaviours are individualistic and persist robustly across external stimuli while others are less robust to these changing parameters. The data supporting their findings is extensive and <bold>convincing</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors state the study's goal clearly: &quot;The goal of our study was to understand to what extent animal individuality is influenced by situational changes in the environment, i.e., how much of an animal's individuality remains after one or more environmental features change.&quot; They use visually guided behavioral features to examine the extent of correlation over time and in a variety of contexts. They develop new behavioral instrumentation and software to measure behavior in Buridan's paradigm (and variations thereof), the Y-maze, and a flight simulator. Using these assays, they examine the correlations between conditions for a panel of locomotion parameters. They propose that inter-assay correlations will determine the persistence of locomotion individuality.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The OED defines individuality as &quot;the sum of the attributes which distinguish a person or thing from others of the same kind,&quot; a definition mirrored by other dictionaries and the scientific literature on the topic. The concept of behavioral individuality can be characterized as: (1) a large set of behavioral attributes, (2) with inter-individual variability, that are (3) stable over time. A previous study examined walking parameters in Buridan's paradigm, finding that several parameters were variable between individuals, and that these showed stability over separate days and up to 4 weeks (DOI: 10.1126/science.aaw718). The present study replicates some of those findings, and extends the experiments from temporal stability to examining correlation of locomotion features between different contexts.</p>
<p>The major strength of the study is using a range of different behavioral assays to examine the correlations of several different behavior parameters. It shows clearly that the inter-individual variability of some parameters is at least partially preserved between some contexts, and not preserved between others. The development of high-throughput behavior assays and sharing the information on how to make the assays is a commendable contribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The definition of individuality considers a comprehensive or large set of attributes, but the authors consider only a handful. In Supplemental Fig. S8, the authors show a large correlation matrix of many behavioral parameters, but these are illegible and are only mentioned briefly in Results. Why were five or so parameters selected from the full set? How were these selected? Do the correlation trends hold true across all parameters? For assays in which only a subset of parameters can be directly compared, were all of these included in the analysis, or only a subset?</p>
<p>The correlation analysis is used to establish stability between assays. For temporal re-testing, &quot;stability&quot; is certainly the appropriate word, but between contexts it implies that there could be 'instability'. Rather, instead of the 'instability' of a single brain process, a different behavior in a different context could arise from engaging largely (or entirely?) distinct context-dependent internal processes, and have nothing to do with process stability per se. For inter-context similarities, perhaps a better word would be &quot;consistency&quot;.</p>
<p>The parameters are considered one-by-one, not in aggregate. This focuses on the stability/consistency of the variability of a single parameter at a time, rather than holistic individuality. It would appear that an appropriate measure of individuality stability (or individuality consistency) that accounts for the high-dimensional nature of individuality would somehow summarize correlations across all parameters. Why was a multivariate approach (e.g. multiple regression/correlation) not used? Treating the data with a multivariate or averaged approach would allow the authors to directly address 'individuality stability', along with the analyses of single-parameter variability stability.</p>
<p>The correlation coefficients are sometimes quite low, though highly significant, and are deemed to indicate stability. For example, in Figure 4C top left, the % of time walked at 23{degree sign}C and 32{degree sign}C are correlated by 0.263, which corresponds to an R2 of 0.069 i.e. just 7% of the 32{degree sign}C variance is predictable by the 23{degree sign}C variance. Is it fair to say that 7% determination indicates parameter stability? Another example: &quot;Vector strength was the most correlated attention parameter... correlations ranged... to -0.197,&quot; which implies that 96% (1 - R2) of Y-maze variance is not predicted by Buridan variance. At what level does an r value not represent stability?</p>
<p>The authors describe a dissociation between inter-group differences and inter-individual variation stability, i.e. sometimes large mean differences between contexts, but significant correlation between individual test and retest data. Given that correlation is sensitive to slope, this might be expected to underestimate the variability stability (or consistency). Is there a way to adjust for the group differences before examining correlation? For example, would it be possible to transform the values to in-group ranks prior to correlation analysis?</p>
<p>What is gained by classifying the five parameters into exploration, attention, and anxiety? To what extent have these classifications been validated, both in general, and with regard to these specific parameters? Is increased walking speed at higher temperature necessarily due to increased 'explorative' nature, or could it be attributed to increased metabolism, dehydration stress, or a heat-pain response? To what extent are these categories subjective?</p>
<p>The legends are quite brief and do not link to descriptions of specific experiments. For example, Figure 4a depicts a graphical overview of the procedure, but I could not find a detailed description of this experiment's protocol.</p>
<p>Using the current single-correlation analysis approach, the aims would benefit from re-wording to appropriately address single-parameter variability stability/consistency (as distinct from holistic individuality). Alternatively, the analysis could be adjusted to address the multivariate nature of individuality, so that the claims and the analysis are in concordance with each other.</p>
<p>The study presents a bounty of new technology to study visually guided behaviors. The Github link to the software was not available. To verify successful transfer or open-hardware and open-software, a report would demonstrate transfer by collaboration with one or more other laboratories, which the present manuscript does not appear to do. Nevertheless, making the technology available to readers is commendable.</p>
<p>The study discusses a number of interesting, stimulating ideas about inter-individual variability, and presents intriguing data that speaks to those ideas, albeit with the issues outlined above.</p>
<p>While the current work does not present any mechanistic analysis of inter-individual variability, the implementation of high-throughput assays sets up the field to more systematically investigate fly visual behaviors, their variability, and their underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>While the incorporation of a hierarchical mixed model (HMM) appears to represent an improvement over their prior single-parameter correlation approach, it's not clear to me that this is a multivariate analysis. They write that &quot;For each trait, we fitted a hierarchical linear mixed-effects model in Matlab (using the fit lme function) with environmental context as a fixed effect and fly identity (ID) as a random intercept... We computed the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) from each model as the between-fly variance divided by total variance. ICC, therefore, quantified repeatability across environmental contexts.&quot;</p>
<p>Does this indicate that HMM was used in a univariate approach? Can an analysis of only five metrics of several dozen total metrics be characterized as 'holistic'?</p>
<p>Within Figure 10a, some of the metrics show high ICC scores, but others do not. This suggests that the authors are overstating the overall persistence and/or consistency of behavioral individuality. It is clear from Figure S8 that a large number of metrics were calculated for each fly, but it remains unclear, at least to me, why the five metrics in Figure 10a are justified for selection. One is left wondering how rare or common is the 0.6 repeatability of % time walked among all the other behavioral metrics. It appears that a holistic analysis of this large data set remains impossible.</p>
<p>The authors write: &quot;...fly individuality persists across different contexts, and individual differences shape behavior across variable environments, thereby making the underlying developmental and functional mechanisms amenable to genetic dissection.&quot; However, presumably the various behavioral features (and their variability) are governed by different brain regions, so some metrics (high ICC) would be amenable to the genetic dissection of individuality/variability, while others (low ICC) would not. It would be useful to know which are which, to define which behavioral domains express individuality, and could be targets for genetic analysis, and which do not. At the very least, the Abstract might like to acknowledge that inter-context consistency is not a major property of all or most behavioral metrics.</p>
<p>I hold that inter-trial repeatability should rightly be called &quot;stability&quot; while inter-context repeatability should be called &quot;consistency&quot;. In the current manuscript, &quot;consistency&quot; is used throughout the manuscript, except for the new edits, which use &quot;stability&quot;. If the authors are going to use both terms, it would be preferable if they could explain precisely how they define and use these terms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors repeated measured the behavior of individual flies across several environmental situations in custom-made behavioral phenotyping rigs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study uses several different behavioral phenotyping devices to quantify individual behavior in a number of different situations and over time. It seems to be a very impressive amount of data. The authors also make all their behavioral phenotyping rig design and tracking software available, which I think is great and I'm sure other folks will be interested in using and adapting to their own needs.</p>
<p>Weaknesses/Limitations:</p>
<p>I think an important limitation is that while the authors measured the flies under different environmental scenarios (i.e. with different lighting, temperature) they didn't really alter the &quot;context&quot; of the environment. At least within behavioral ecology, context would refer to the potential functionality of the expressed behaviors so for example, an anti-predator context, or a mating context, or foraging. Here, the authors seem to really just be measuring aspects of locomotion under benign (relatively low risk perception) contexts. This is not a flaw of the study, but rather a limitation to how strongly the authors can really say that this demonstrates that individuality is generalized across many different contexts. It's quite possible that rank-order of locomotor (or other) behaviors may shift when the flies are in a mating or risky context.</p>
<p>I think the authors are missing an opportunity to use much more robust statistical methods. It appears as though the authors used pearson correlations across time/situations to estimate individual variation; however far more sophisticated and elegant methods exist. The problem is that pearson correlation coefficients can be anti-conservative and additionally, the authors have thus had to perform many many tests to correlate behaviors across the different trials/scenarios. I don't see any evidence that the authors are controlling for multiple testing which I think would also help. Alternatively, though, the paper would be a lot stronger, and my guess is, much more streamlined if the authors employ hierarchical mixed models to analyse these data, which are the standard analytical tools in the study of individual behavioral variation. In this way, the authors could partition the behavioral variance into its among- and within-individual components and quantify repeatability of different behaviors across trials/scenarios simultaneously. This would remove the need to estimate 3 different correlations for day 1 &amp; day 2, day 1 &amp; 3, day 2 &amp; 3 (or stripe 0 &amp; stripe 1, etc) and instead just report a single repeatability for e.g. the time spent walking among the different strip patterns (eg. figure 3). Additionally, the authors could then use multivariate models where the response variables are all the behaviors combined and the authors could estimate the among-individual covariance in these behaviors. I see that the authors state they include generalized linear mixed models in their updated MS, but I struggled a bit to understand exactly how these models were fit? What exactly was the response? what exactly were the predictors (I just don't understand what Line404 means &quot;a GLM was trained using the environmental parameters as predictors (0 when the parameter was not change, 1 if it was) and the resulting individual rank differences as the response&quot;). So were different models run for each scenario? for different behaviors? Across scenarios? what exactly? I just harp on this because I'm actually really interested in these data and think that updating these methods can really help clarify the results and make the main messages much clearer!</p>
<p>I appreciate that the authors now included their sample sizes in the main body of text (as opposed to the supplement) but I think that it would still help if the authors included a brief overview of their design at the start of the methods. It is still unclear to me how many rigs each individual fly was run through? Were the same individuals measured in multiple different rigs/scenarios? Or just one?</p>
<p>I really think a variance partitioning modeling framework could certainly improve their statistical inference and likely highlight some other cool patterns as these methods could better estimate stability and covariance in individual intercepts (and potentially slopes) across time and situation. I also genuinely think that this will improve the impact and reach of this paper as they'll be using methods that are standard in the study of individual behavioral variation</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors state the study's goal clearly: &quot;The goal of our study was to understand to what extent animal individuality is influenced by situational changes in the environment, i.e., how much of an animal's individuality remains after one or more environmental features change.&quot; They use visually guided behavioral features to examine the extent of correlation over time and in a variety of contexts. They develop new behavioral instrumentation and software to measure behavior in Buridan's paradigm (and variations thereof), the Y-maze, and a flight simulator. Using these assays, they examine the correlations between conditions for a panel of locomotion parameters. They propose that inter-assay correlations will determine the persistence of locomotion individuality.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The OED defines individuality as &quot;the sum of the attributes which distinguish a person or thing from others of the same kind,&quot; a definition mirrored by other dictionaries and the scientific literature on the topic. The concept of behavioral individuality can be characterized as: (1) a large set of behavioral attributes, (2) with inter-individual variability, that are (3) stable over time. A previous study examined walking parameters in Buridan's paradigm, finding that several parameters were variable between individuals, and that these showed stability over separate days and up to 4 weeks (DOI: 10.1126/science.aaw718). The present study replicates some of those findings and extends the experiments from temporal stability to examining correlation of locomotion features between different contexts.</p>
<p>The major strength of the study is using a range of different behavioral assays to examine the correlations of several different behavior parameters. It shows clearly that the inter-individual variability of some parameters is at least partially preserved between some contexts, and not preserved between others. The development of high-throughput behavior assays and sharing the information on how to make the assays is a commendable contribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The definition of individuality considers a comprehensive or large set of attributes, but the authors consider only a handful. In Supplemental Fig. S8, the authors show a large correlation matrix of many behavioral parameters, but these are illegible and are only mentioned briefly in Results. Why were five or so parameters selected from the full set? How were these selected? Do the correlation trends hold true across all parameters? For assays in which only a subset of parameters can be directly compared, were all of these included in the analysis, or only a subset?</p>
<p>The correlation analysis is used to establish stability between assays. For temporal re-testing, &quot;stability&quot; is certainly the appropriate word, but between contexts it implies that there could be 'instability'. Rather, instead of the 'instability' of a single brain process, a different behavior in a different context could arise from engaging largely (or entirely?) distinct context-dependent internal processes, and have nothing to do with process stability per se. For inter-context similarities, perhaps a better word would be &quot;consistency&quot;.</p>
<p>The parameters are considered one-by-one, not in aggregate. This focuses on the stability/consistency of the variability of a single parameter at a time, rather than holistic individuality. It would appear that an appropriate measure of individuality stability (or individuality consistency) that accounts for the high-dimensional nature of individuality would somehow summarize correlations across all parameters. Why was a multivariate approach (e.g. multiple regression/correlation) not used? Treating the data with a multivariate or averaged approach would allow the authors to directly address 'individuality stability', along with the analyses of single-parameter variability stability.</p>
<p>The correlation coefficients are sometimes quite low, though highly significant, and are deemed to indicate stability. For example, in Figure 4C top left, the % of time walked at 23{degree sign}C and 32{degree sign}C are correlated by 0.263, which corresponds to an R2 of 0.069 i.e. just 7% of the 32{degree sign}C variance is predictable by the 23{degree sign}C variance. Is it fair to say that 7% determination indicates parameter stability? Another example: &quot;Vector strength was the most correlated attention parameter... correlations ranged... to -0.197,&quot; which implies that 96% (1 - R2) of Y-maze variance is not predicted by Buridan variance. At what level does an r value not represent stability?</p>
<p>The authors describe a dissociation between inter-group differences and inter-individual variation stability, i.e. sometimes large mean differences between contexts, but significant correlation between individual test and retest data. Given that correlation is sensitive to slope, this might be expected to underestimate the variability stability (or consistency). Is there a way to adjust for the group differences before examining correlation? For example, would it be possible to transform the values to in-group ranks prior to correlation analysis?</p>
<p>What is gained by classifying the five parameters into exploration, attention, and anxiety? To what extent have these classifications been validated, both in general, and with regard to these specific parameters? Is increased walking speed at higher temperature necessarily due to increased 'explorative' nature, or could it be attributed to increased metabolism, dehydration stress, or a heat-pain response? To what extent are these categories subjective?</p>
<p>The legends are quite brief and do not link to descriptions of specific experiments. For example, Figure 4a depicts a graphical overview of the procedure, but I could not find a detailed description of this experiment's protocol.</p>
<p>Using the current single-correlation analysis approach, the aims would benefit from re-wording to appropriately address single-parameter variability stability/consistency (as distinct from holistic individuality). Alternatively, the analysis could be adjusted to address the multivariate nature of individuality, so that the claims and the analysis are in concordance with each other.</p>
<p>The study presents a bounty of new technology to study visually guided behaviors. The Github link to the software was not available. To verify successful transfer or open-hardware and open-software, a report would demonstrate transfer by collaboration with one or more other laboratories, which the present manuscript does not appear to do. Nevertheless, making the technology available to readers is commendable.</p>
<p>The study discusses a number of interesting, stimulating ideas about interindividual variability and presents intriguing data that speaks to those ideas, albeit with the issues outlined above.</p>
<p>While the current work does not present any mechanistic analysis of interindividual variability, the implementation of high-throughput assays sets up the field to more systematically investigate fly visual behaviors, their variability, and their underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>I want to express my appreciation for the authors' responsiveness to the reviewer feedback. They appear to have addressed my previous concerns through various modifications including GLM analysis, however, some areas still require clarification for the benefit of an audience that includes geneticists.</p>
<p>(1) GLM Analysis Explanation (Figure 9)</p>
<p>While the authors state that their new GLM results support their original conclusions, the explanation of these results in the text is insufficient. Specifically:</p>
<p>The interpretation of coefficients and their statistical significance needs more detailed explanation. The audience includes geneticists and other nonstatistical people, so the GLM should be explained in terms of the criteria or quantities used to assess how well the results conform with the hypothesis, and to what extent they diverge.</p>
<p>The criteria used to judge how well the GLM results support their hypothesis are not clearly stated.</p>
<p>The relationship between the GLM findings and their original correlationbased conclusions needs better integration and connection, leading the reader through your reasoning.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important point. We have revised the Results section in the reviseed manuscript to include a more detailed explanation of the GLM analysis. Specifically, we now clarify the interpretation of the model coefficients, including the direction and statistical significance, in relation to the hypothesized effects. We also outline the criteria we used to assess how well the GLM supports our original correlation-based conclusions—namely, whether the sign and significance of the coefficients align with the expected relationships derived from our prior analysis. Finally, we explicitly describe how the GLM results confirm or extend the patterns observed in the correlation-based analysis, to guide readers through our reasoning and the integration of both approaches.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Documentation of Changes</p>
<p>One struggle with the revised manuscript is that no &quot;tracked changes&quot; version was included, so it is hard to know exactly what was done. Without access to the previous version of the manuscript, it is difficult to fully assess the extent of revisions made. The authors should provide a more comprehensive summary of the specific changes implemented, particularly regarding:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We were equally confused to learn that the tracked-changes version was not visible, despite having submitted one to eLife as part of our revision.</p>
<p>Upon contacting the editorial office, they confirmed that we did submit a trackedchanges version, but clarified that it did not contain embedded figures (as they were added manually to the clean version).  The editorial response said in detail: “Regarding the tracked-changes file: it appears the version with markup lacked figures, while the figure-complete PDF had markup removed, which likely caused the confusion mentioned by the reviewers.” We hope this answer from eLife clarifies the reviewers’ concern.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2)  Statistical Method Selection</p>
<p>The authors mention using &quot;ridge regression to mitigate collinearity among predictors&quot; but do not adequately justify this choice over other approaches. They should explain:</p>
<p>Why ridge regression was selected as the optimal method</p>
<p>How the regularization parameter (λ) was determined</p>
<p>How this choice affects the interpretation of environmental parameters' influence on individuality</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful question regarding our choice of statistical method. In response, we have expanded the Methods section in the revised manuscript to provide a more detailed justification for the use of a GLM, including ridge regression. Specifically, we explain that ridge regression was selected to address collinearity and to control for overfitting.</p>
<p>We now also describe how the regularization parameter (λ) was selected: we used 5-fold cross-validation over a log-spaced grid (10<sup>⁻⁶</sup> - 10<sup>⁶&lt;/sup) to identify the optimal value that minimized the mean squared error (MSE).</sup></p>
<p>Finally, we clarify in both the Methods and Results sections how this modeling choice affects the interpretation of our findings.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript is a continuation of past work by the last author where they looked at stochasticity in developmental processes leading to inter-individual behavioural differences. In that work, the focus was on a specific behaviour under specific conditions while probing the neural basis of the variability. In this work, the authors set out to describe in detail how stable individuality of animal behaviours is in the context of various external and internal influences. They identify a few behaviours to monitor (read outs of attention, exploration, and 'anxiety'); some external stimuli (temperature, contrast, nature of visual cues, and spatial environment); and two internal states (walking and flying).</p>
<p>They then use high-throughput behavioural arenas - most of which they have built and made plans available for others to replicate - to quantify and compare combinations of these behaviours, stimuli, and internal states. This detailed analysis reveals that:</p>
<p>(1) Many individualistic behaviours remain stable over the course of many days.</p>
<p>(2) That some of these (walking speed) remain stable over changing visual cues. Others (walking speed and centrophobicity) remain stable at different temperatures.</p>
<p>(3) All the behaviours they tested fail to remain stable over spatially varying environment (arena shape).</p>
<p>(4) and only angular velocity (a read out of attention) remains stable across varying internal states (walking and flying)</p>
<p>Thus, the authors conclude that there is a hierarchy in the influence of external stimuli and internal states on the stability of individual behaviours.</p>
<p>The manuscript is a technical feat with the authors having built many new high-throughput assays. The number of animals are large and many variables have been tested - different types of behavioural paradigms, flying vs walking, varying visual stimuli, different temperature among others.</p>

<p>Comment on Revised Manuscript</p>
<p>Recommendations for Improvement</p>
<p>(1) Expand the Results section for Figure 9 with a more detailed interpretation of the GLM coefficients and their biological significance</p>
<p>(2) Provide explicit criteria (or at least explain in detail) for how the GLM results confirm or undermine their original hypothesis about environmental context hierarchy</p>
<p>While the claims are interesting, the additional statistical analysis appears promising. However, clearer explanation of these new results would strengthen the paper and ensure that readers from diverse backgrounds can fully understand how the evidence supports the authors' conclusions about individuality across environmental contexts.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these constructive suggestions. In response to these suggestions, we have expanded both the Methods and Results sections to provide a more detailed explanation of the GLM coefficients, including their interpretation and how they relate to our original correlation-based findings.</p>
<p>We now clarify how the direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of specific coefficients reflect the influence of different environmental factors on the persistence of individual behavioral traits. To make this accessible to readers from diverse backgrounds, we explicitly outline the criteria we used to evaluate whether the GLM results support our hypothesis about the hierarchical influence of environmental context, namely, whether the structure and strength of effects align with the patterns predicted from our prior correlation analysis.</p>
<p>These additions improve clarity and help readers understand how the new statistical results reinforce our conclusions about the context-dependence of behavioral individuality.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Thanks for the revision of the paper! I updated my review to try and provide a little more guidance by what I mean about updating your analyses. I really think this is a super cool data set and I genuinely wish this were MY dataset so that way I could really dig into it to partition the variance. These variance partitioning methods are standard in my particular subfield (study of individual behavioral variation in ecology and evolution) and so I think employing them is 1) going to offer a MUCH more elegant and holistic view of the behavioral variation (e.g. you can report a single repeatability estimate for each behavior rather than 3 different correlations) and 2) improve the impact and readership for your paper as now you'll be using methods that a whole community of researchers are very familiar with. It's just a suggestion, but I hope you consider it!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the insightful and encouraging feedback and for introducing us to this modeling approach. In response to this suggestion, we have incorporated a hierarchical linear mixed-effects model into our analysis (now presented in Figure 10), accompanied by a new supplementary table (Table T3). We also updated the Methods, Results, and Discussion sections to describe the rationale, implementation, and implications of the mixed-model analysis.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this approach provides a more elegant way to quantify behavioral variation and individual consistency across contexts. In particular, the ability to estimate repeatability directly aligns well with the core questions of our study. It facilitates improved communication of our findings to ecology, evolution, and behavior researchers. We greatly appreciate the suggestion; it has significantly strengthened both the analytical framework and the interpretability of the manuscript.</p>
