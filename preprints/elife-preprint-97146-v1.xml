<title>Summary</title>
<p>Individual recognition is conceptually complex and computationally intense, leading to the general assumption that this social knowledge is solely present in vertebrates with larger brains, while miniature-brained animals in differentiating societies eschew the evolutionary pressure for individual recognition by evolving computationally less demanding class-level recognition, such as kin, social rank, or mate recognition. Arguably, this social knowledge is restricted to species with a degree of sociality (sensu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], for a review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]). Here we show the exception to this rule in an asocial arthropod species, the jumping spider (<italic>Phidippus regius</italic>). Using a habituation - dishabituation paradigm, we visually confronted pairs of spatially separated spiders with each other and measured the ‘interest’ of one spider towards the other. The spiders exhibited high interest upon initial encounter of an individual, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, but adapted towards that individual when it reoccurred in the subsequent trial, indicated by their preference of staying farther apart. In contrast, spiders exhibited a rebound from habituation, reflected in mutual approach behaviour, when a different individual occurred in the subsequent trial, indicating the ability to tell apart spiders’ identities. These results suggest that <italic>P. regius</italic> is capable of individual recognition based on long-term social memory.</p>

<title>Main text</title>
<p>Recognising individuals is a complex cognitive process requiring flexible learning and recognition memory. Arthropod species possessing the social ability of individual recognition would, thus, stand in stark contrast to the commonly accepted notion that animals with smaller brains are cognitively less advanced due to reduced computational power of nervous systems with smaller and fewer neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. And yet, there is evidence for an arthropod species displaying face learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] and long-term social memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. That is, a social wasp species (<italic>Polistes fuscatus</italic>) showed mammal-like face learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], arguably providing social benefits by reducing aggression and stabilizing social interactions. With this, being one of the few reported cases of individual recognition in arthropods (also see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]), it is considered unlikely that asocial arthropod species would evolve such complex cognitive processes. The reasons being high energy consumption, long processing times and, thus, increased predation risk that would never be outweighed by the few social encounters between individuals and the additional survival benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The general consensus, thus, is that a certain degree of sociality sensu Wilson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>] is required for the emergence of individual recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Here, we challenge this consensus: In a naturalistic experimental procedure, we put to the test the ability of individual recognition in a notoriously asocial and miniature-brained arthropod species, a member of the <italic>Salticidae</italic> family, the jumping spider (<italic>Phidippus regius</italic>).</p>
<p>In a first step, we assess the ability of <italic>P. regius</italic> to individually recognise other members of its species, commonly referred to as individual recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] or individuation of conspecifics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. For this purpose, we used a habituation - dishabituation procedure, where, in general terms, one individual habituates to the presence of another individual in its close proximity and dishabituates when, after a short phase of visual separation, another individual is present in close proximity, assuming that the one individual is capable of discriminating the identities of the two individuals it was confronted with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In other terms, with this habituation - dishabituation paradigm we expect to see that the rebound in ‘interest’ following changes in a spider’s identity is greater than the rebound in ‘interest’ following a repetition of identity. To experimentally control the animal pairs, we placed the individuals in separate containers with one side and the top panel being transparent. We then pairwise confronted the individuals by placing the containers such that the transparent sides faced each other in the following fashion:</p>
<p>Individual A and individual B were exposed to each other for 7 minutes, triggering an initial ‘interest’ in each other, and were then visually separated by means of an opaque slider for 3 minutes. Subsequently, they were either exposed to the same individual again (A vs B, <italic>habituation</italic> trial) for 7 minutes, or to a different individual (A vs C, or B vs D, <italic>dishabituation</italic> trial) for 7 minutes, followed by a 3-minute period of visual separation. The relative interest is quantified by approximating spatial distances between the spider pairs in the xy-plane, where high interest is reflected in smaller values (i.e. spiders go close) and low interest in larger values (spiders stay apart). Therefore, under the assumption that the spiders are capable of individuating each other, we predict that in the <italic>habituation</italic> condition, involving the same individuals, the relative interest in each other decreases and, hence, spiders’ distances increase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-c</xref>; ‘Habituation’, dashed line: towards maximal distance; solid line: medium distance), while in the <italic>dishabituation</italic> condition, involving a different individual, the relative interest in each other increases and spiders approach each other, hence, distances decrease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a-c</xref>; ‘Dishabituation’). We divided a total of 20 individuals into five groups of four individuals each. Each individual of each group was exposed to the three group members in both habituation and dishabituation trials, resulting in six trials per session, equivalent to one hour of recording. We repeated this procedure twice, resulting in 18 trials across three sessions and an exact repetition of a given trial (and pairing of individuals) in 1-hour intervals (for a detailed description of the procedure see Materials and Methods and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>). We found that <italic>habituation</italic> and <italic>dishabituation</italic> trials (i.e. predictor variable <italic>condition</italic>) were significantly dissociated as a function of inter-individual distances (i.e. predictor variable <italic>distance</italic>), leading to a significant improvement of model fitting the interaction of the predictors <italic>distance</italic> and <italic>condition</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="567545v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, Supplementary Table 1): <italic>dishabituation</italic> trials (blue discs) showed a greater proportion of close-distance values than <italic>habituation</italic> trials (red discs), whereas <italic>habituation</italic> trials showed a greater proportion of far-distance values. The interaction between the predictors <italic>distance</italic> and <italic>condition</italic> further significantly interacted with the predictor <italic>session</italic>, modulating the level of the dissociative effect of <italic>condition</italic> over the progression of the testing period, showing the strongest modulation in session 1 and the weakest modulation in session 3 (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="567545v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, Supplementary Table 1, exemplar trial: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 d-f</xref>). The systematic dissociation of distance values between <italic>habituation</italic> and <italic>dishabituation</italic> trials suggests that <italic>P. regius</italic> possesses the ability to individuate conspecifics (see Video 1 and Supplementary videos 1, 2 in the OSF repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/gpnct/">https://osf.io/gpnct/</ext-link>)).</p>

<p>The question arises whether <italic>P. regius</italic>’s decreasing interest over session repetitions is caused by a general fatigue effect due the prolonged testing procedure or whether, in later testing sessions, <italic>P. regius</italic> actually recognises the current individual after having seen it before at least once (when encountering it again in session 2) or twice (when encountering it again in session 3) and, thus, would not dishabituate any longer. Such recognition capability would further emphasise the role of long-term memory representations in the individuation of conspecifics, due to the prolonged retention interval beyond the minute range into the hours. In a second step, we therefore assessed the extent to which a presentation of an individual novel and unseen across the three experimental sessions would trigger a rebound in interest at the end of session 3, henceforth referred to as <italic>dishabituation [long-term]</italic> trials, as opposed to the <italic>dishabituation</italic> trials of sessions 1-3, henceforth referred to as <italic>dishabituation [short-term]</italic> trials (see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). If such rebound occurs, we conclude that the habituation across sessions is the result of recognition of repeatedly presented individuals and not the result of a fatigue effect due to prolonged testing procedures. In other words, such rebound would suggest a ‘cognitive’ fatigue towards seeing the same ‘old’ individuals, subserved by long-term memory formation, rather than a ‘physical’ fatigue effect. To this end, we re-ran the experiment in an additional 16 spiders, arranged to four groups and added a memory <italic>dishabituation [long-term]</italic> trial at the end of session 3. The memory <italic>dishabituation [long-term]</italic> trials were generated by cross-combining individuals from two groups (group 1: A, B, C, D; group 2: E, F, G, H; <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), which were run in parallel, at the end of session 3, resulting in novel pairings (A - E, B - G, C - F, D - H). We replicated our previous results and found a dissociation of the factors <italic>distance</italic> and <italic>condition</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="567545v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, Video 2 and Supplementary videos 3, 4 in the OSF repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/gpnct/">https://osf.io/gpnct/</ext-link>), Supplementary Table 2), showing a greater proportion of close-distance values for dishabituation (blue discs) than for habituation trials (red discs) and a greater proportion of far-distance values for habituation than for dishabituation trials. Critically, we also found that the <italic>dishabituation [long-term]</italic> trials at the end of session 3 elicited a rebound in interest that exceeded the rebound in the <italic>dishabituation [short-term]</italic> trials of session 3 by far, reflected in the interaction of <italic>condition</italic> (i.e. <italic>dishabituation [short-term]</italic> vs <italic>dishabituation [long-term]</italic>) and <italic>distance</italic> (<italic>F</italic> (3,127) = 3.91, sum sq. = 0.92, mean sq. = 0.31, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> (right subfigure, white diamonds; exemplar trials: <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g-i, j-l</xref>, Videos 3 - 5 and Supplementary videos 5, 6 in the OSF repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/gpnct/">https://osf.io/gpnct/</ext-link>)). Thus, the habituation across sessions reflects a decrease in interest for the same repeatedly presented individuals on the basis of long-term memory capabilities.</p>

<p>Our findings show, firstly, that <italic>P. regius</italic> recognised individuals to which it was exposed to for a short period of 7 minutes and that reoccurred after a visual separation period of 3 minutes. Secondly, <italic>P. regius</italic> habituated in the long-term, i.e. 1 hour and 2 hours after initial presentation of a given individual. Thirdly, despite long-term habituation, <italic>P. regius</italic> showed an unprecedented rebound in interest towards an entirely novel individual, ruling out a physical fatigue effect in favour of a cognitive fatigue on the basis of long-term social memory capabilities. For these reasons, our results are the first to suggest that <italic>P. regius</italic>, an asocial arthropod species, possesses long-term memory, which allows it to individuate conspecifics and recognise novel individuals.</p>
<p>Recognising members of one’s own species is crucial for survival and a requirement for various social behaviours. Individual recognition allows the receiver animal to distinguish between friend and foe, to identify a mating partner, its offspring or a kin member. Individual recognition is achieved via the production of individually-distinct features (e.g. visual) or signals (e.g. acoustic) by the sender and extracting those features and signals by the receiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Individual recognition bears particular significance for <italic>social</italic> animal species mainly in three contexts: territoriality, aggressive competition and parental care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. However, jumping spiders, as many other spider species, are solitary and aggressive towards conspecifics, raising the question about the biological relevance of individual recognition in <italic>P. regius</italic>: One of the few social instances in the life of a jumping spider occurs during reproductive communication, encompassing a complex visual courtship display of coordinated movement patterns of the body and bodily features. It is believed that the typical colouration of the appendages (<italic>Chelicerae</italic>) and the colouration and facial hair characteristics serve as important features for species and sex classification in jumping spiders and as a general indicator about the quality of an individual as a mating partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Hence, colouration (sender) and the ability to distinguish certain colours (receiver) seem to be sufficiently beneficial to sexual selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Similarly, in aggressive interactions, often due to territorial disputes, fighting abilities are largely associated with the size and colour of the <italic>Chelicerae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], rendering territoriality and aggressive competition needless as an ultimate explanation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] for individual recognition in <italic>P. regius</italic>. Some jumping spiders exhibited parental care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>], protecting the nest through the spiderlings’ first molt. One particular jumping spider (<italic>Toxeus magnus</italic>) has been documented to provide a nutritious milk-like substance to the spiderlings, which compares functionally and behaviourally to lactation in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Whether individual recognition solves a survival problem in this context, is however questionable. The remaining solitary behaviours of <italic>P. regius</italic> give little additional reason to predict that individual recognition is a requirement for survival, setting the minimal recognition needs (<italic>Minimum needs hypothesis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]) at the basic-level of classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], e.g. colour-based distinction, size assessment of <italic>Chelicerae</italic>. Moreover, the neural implementation of a subordinate-level classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>] system that operates at the level of abstraction required for a more detailed classification, such as individual recognition, involves specialised processing in dedicated neural correlates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. For all these reasons it is therefore more likely to assume that the ability of recognising conspecifics is related to <italic>P. regius</italic>’s general learning capabilities via pleiotropy, also referred to as the ‘generalised learning hypothesis’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. For example, salticids’ rather complex foraging and navigation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], requiring high degrees of learning and adaptability, may translate into the flexible learning ability required for recognising conspecifics, at a level of abstraction more fine-grained than their minimum recognition needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. In other words, while for <italic>social</italic> animal species, including social arthropod species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], there is an ultimate explanation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] addressing the function (or adaptation) of individual recognition, we cannot conclusively infer the survival benefits gained by individual recognition in <italic>P. regius</italic>. Instead we put forward the idea that individual recognition in <italic>P. regius</italic> is a byproduct of fairly sophisticated cognitive processing capabilities. Critically, individual recognition relies on recognition memory, a form of long-term memory, where a previously encountered event or entity, here an individual, stored as memory representation is neuronally activated upon re-experiencing that event or entity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Such memory representation might well serve as guidance to <italic>Portia fimbriata</italic>, allegedly the most intelligent jumping spider, when, after scanning the access route to a prey target, it follows the path to the prey under lack of visual control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. In our study, we demonstrated retrieval of information from memory representations in various ways: First, <italic>P. regius</italic>’s dissocative behavioural responses upon perceiving an individual for a second time in succession as opposed to perceiving a different individual suggests recognition of individually distinct characteristics or cues, which manifest in solid memory representations. Moreover, <italic>P. regius</italic> systematically reduced the overall interest over a series of repeated exposure to the same individuals at a 1-hour presentation interval to the point where it became indifferent to the presented individual, suggesting that <italic>P. regius</italic> successfully retrieves memory-stored information at least one hour after memory consolidation. Thirdly, <italic>P. regius</italic>’s interest in novelty was restored at the end of session 3 upon perception of individuals that had not been encountered before, highlighting that the loss of interest in the long-term was not due to a general physical fatigue, but a ‘cognitive’ fatigue, i.e. to literally perceive the same individuals over and over again. A novel individual, consequently, did not activate memory representations of individuals, and led, as a response, to dishabituation, a fortiori amplifying the notion of memory representation in <italic>P. regius</italic>.</p>
<p>Together, our study challenges the notion of spiders being stimulus-response driven automata, by not only contributing to an increasing body of evidence that spiders and saliticids in particular produce a wide spectrum of intelligent behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>], but by pinpointing the presence of two fundamentally important mechanisms for any higher cognitive processing: flexible learning and recognition memory. The key building blocks of these mechanisms are representations, mental images of external entities, that are not present to the sense organs, allowing more elaborate information processing, such as in complex decision making and goal-directed behaviour. The existence of which in arthropods in general and spiders in particular triggers rethinking of miniature brain cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Our subjects were 36 jumping spiders (<italic>Phidippus regius</italic>), kept individually in enclosures (7 x 7 x 12 cm) at room temperature (21 - 25°C) and supplied with a moist water-pad, exchanged every other day, and two small-sized cockroaches (<italic>Shelfordella lateralis</italic>) per week. All spiders were adult laboratory-bred and had no direct encounters with conspecifics during adulthood. Behavioural enrichment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] was provided by means of climbing and nesting structures (i.e., natural wood branch) and by interaction with human caretakers and experimenters during handling and maintenance procedures. In Experiment 1, spiders were assigned to five experimental groups, three of which contained females, two of which males; in Experiment 2, spiders were assigned to four experimental groups, i.e. two groups per sex.</p>

<title>Apparatus</title>
<p>In the following we describe how pairs of spiders were brought into direct visual contact under controlled conditions and in a manner that allows to reassign individuals easily and without interruption to form novel pairings. To this end, we built a cubical experimental arena of 60 by 46 bx 65cm dimensions (L x W x H), consisting of white polypropylene plastic panels, mounted in a frame of T-slotted aluminium profiles (20 Series; Misumi Group Inc., Bunkyo City, Tokyo, Japan). Two LED light sources (Mettle®SL400, 45W, 2100lm, 350 x 250mm surface area, Mettle Photographic Equipment Corporation, Changzhou, China) were placed outside the cubicle at 25cm distance from the side panels of the cubicle, illuminating the inside of the cubicle uniformly. We also mounted two FLIR® 1.3MP, Mono Blackfly USB3 cameras with a 1/2” CMOS sensor (BFS-U3-13Y3M-C, FLIR® Integrated Imaging Solutions, Inc, 12051 Riverside Way, Richmond, BC, Canada) equipped with 8mm UC Series lenses from Edmund Optics® (Stock #33-307, Edmund Optics®, Barrington, New Jersey, USA) on T-slotted aluminium profiles, facing downwards onto the arena surface at a distance of 60cm. For each spider we 3D-printed a white container with outer dimensions (L x W x H) of 7 x 7 x 5cm and inner dimensions of 6.3 x 6.3 x 4.5cm. The upper side of the container and one of the four side walls were made of a transparent .5mm thick acrylic sheet. While the acrylic sheet on the upper side of the container was screwed onto the side walls of the container, the acrylic sheet on one of the sides of the container can be lifted up to open the container, allowing easier transfer of the spider from the home enclosure.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>In Experiment 1, each group involved four same-sex spiders, with each spider being placed inside a container prior to the experiment. During the experiment, the spiders remained in their own container. We allowed the spiders sufficient time (10-15min) to get used to the new environment. We then placed the containers of the four spiders such that the transparent side walls of two containers were facing each other, resulting in two pairs of spiders with direct visual contact to each other. During the process of arranging the containers and prior to the initiation of every new trial, visual contact was prevented by an occluder slid between the transparent side walls of the containers. Each trial was initiated by removing this occluder, allowing visual contact. For simplicity, let the four individuals be symbolised by the letters ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, and ‘D’: An arrangement of trials where each individual is opposed to each other individual is described in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. To tease apart, whether or not <italic>P. regius</italic> was capable of visually discriminating other individuals two types of trials were required: (a) a <italic>habituation</italic> trial, where the same individual was presented in the trial preceding the current trial, and (b) a <italic>dishabituation</italic> trial, where a different individual was presented in the trial preceding the current trial. Therefore, every <italic>dishabituation</italic> trial followed a <italic>habituation</italic> trial, forming a <italic>habituation</italic> or <italic>dishabituation</italic> phase, respectively, as shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A trial, e.g. A - B (and in parallel C - D), lasted for 7 minutes allowing the spiders to visually inspect each other, before isolating the spiders visually for 3 minutes with a non-transparent white occluder, fully covering the transparent side wall. After the occluder phase, another exposure phase of 7 minutes was initiated, which consisted of either the same individual (<italic>habituation</italic> trial) or another individual (<italic>dishabituation</italic> trial) than the individual in the preceding trial. During each trial, the individuals distance to each other was quantified at 10Hz temporal resolution, and taken as a measure reflecting the ‘interest’ in each other: Short distances between individuals signal greater ‘interest’ in each other, while large distances signal reduced ‘interest’ in each other. We predict a dissociation of distances between <italic>habituation</italic> and <italic>dishabituation</italic> trials. With the outlined procedure (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), we can form sequences of exposure phases, where each first of two exposure phases is a habituation phase, and every second of those exposure phases is a dishabituation phase and at the same time a habituation phase for the subsequent exposure phase. In this manner, we created a trial list, containing 12 trials in total, six of which result in <italic>habituation</italic> phases and six of which result in <italic>dishabituation</italic> phases (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This session of trials was repeated twice, resulting in a total of 36 trials per experiment. Each experiment lasted 180 min, where each trial contained 7 min exposure and 3 min visual separation. Each group of spiders was subjected to this protocol. Two amendments were introduced in Experiment 2: (a) We ran two groups of four individuals in parallel, and (b) additional <italic>cross-group</italic> trials were introduced at the end of session 3. This resulted in a modified procedure described in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Data logging and analysis</title>
<p>Camera control and image acquisition were done using Matlab (Mathworks®, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) and the image acquisition and processing toolboxes. The frame rate was set to 10Hz. Cameras were placed perpendicular to the xy-plane at a distance of about 60cm from the ground. The lens aperture was set to f/4, allowing a sufficient depth of field. Analysis was done with Matlab (Mathworks®, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). We pre-processed the video recordings by segmenting the spider body from the background in each frame using functions for image intensity adjustment, image enhancement, image binarization and image properties measurement to extract the largest available ‘region’, the spider body, and its centroid. For each trial we approximated the distance between the individuals in the xy-plane as a function of time, using the Euclidean distance weight function based on the centroid coordinates of the two individuals. We then pooled the distance values of each trial into 4 equally-sized and non-overlapping bins (bin centers [mm]: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, 60, 100, 140]; bin size 40mm; maximal distance « 160mm) and calculated the proportion of time spent at a given distance. Each bin was normalised by the total number of events. Differences between proportions were then calculated for every trial comparison according to <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>: For instance, the proportions of time spent at a given distance for individual A in trial 1 was subtracted from the proportions of time spent at a given distance for individual A in trial 2, resulting in an assessment for the relative rebound of interest following a repetition of exposure to the same spider B (<italic>habituation</italic>). Subsequently, the proportions of time spent at a given distance for individual A in trial 2 was subtracted from the proportions of time spent at a given distance for individual A in trial 3, resulting in an assessment for the relative rebound of interest following changes in spider’s identity (<italic>dishabituation</italic>). We used linear mixed-effects models, where the differences in proportions served as the dependent variable. We fitted two separate models for each experiment (<italic>Full model 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>), and followed a commonly accepted model fitting procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]: To fully account for the dependent variable, we fitted three predictor variables: (1) The bin number ([1 to 4]), reflecting a discretised distance measure and henceforth referred to as factor <italic>distance</italic> ([1 to 4]), (2) the <italic>session</italic> of comparisons ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]), as outlined in the Procedure above (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and (3) the <italic>condition</italic>, referring to whether the given comparison was a <italic>habituation</italic> or <italic>dishabituation</italic> comparison. We also fitted all two-way interactions between the three main predictors: <italic>distance</italic>:<italic>session, distance</italic>:<italic>condition</italic>, and <italic>session</italic>:<italic>condition</italic>, as well as the three-way interaction <italic>distance</italic>:<italic>session</italic>:<italic>condition</italic>. Of particular interest are the two-way interaction between the factors <italic>distance</italic> and <italic>condition</italic>, since we predict a modulation of <italic>distance</italic> values by <italic>condition</italic> as a function of <italic>distance</italic>, and the three-way interaction between the factors <italic>distance, condition</italic> and <italic>session</italic>, since we predict a modulation of <italic>condition</italic> as a function of <italic>distance</italic> which becomes weaker over time and repetitions, i.e. <italic>session</italic>. We further defined <italic>sex</italic> of the subjects and <italic>subject</italic> as random factors in all models. We fitted a linear mixed-effects model (fitlme function in Matlab) with normal error structure and identity link function to our data set. We then created a null model for each corresponding full model, which consisted of the similar structure as the full model, however leaving only <italic>distance</italic> as fixed effect, while preserving all random effects. Using likelihood ratio test (LRT), we compared the null models with the corresponding full models. Assuming a significant improvement for the full model over the null model, the non-significant interaction terms were removed from the full model, reaching a model containing only significant interaction terms and both significant and non-significant main effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], henceforth referred to as the final model. Evaluation of fixed effect were on the basis of the final models and are referred to as the <italic>Final model 1</italic> (Experiment 1), and <italic>Final model 2</italic> (Experiment 2). This procedure resulted in the following models (Wilkinson notation):</p>
<p><italic>Final model 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> :</p>
<p>‘Response ∼ 1 + Distance + Session + Condition + Distance:Condition + …</p>
<p>Distance:Session:Condition + (1|Sex) + (1|Subject)’</p>
<p>An additional analysis of variance was performed comparing the <italic>dishabituation [long-term]</italic> trials at the end of session 3 with the <italic>dishabituation [short-term]</italic> trials from session 3 (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) as a function of <italic>distance</italic>. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper sets out to examine the social recognition abilities of a 'solitary' jumping spider species. It demonstrates that based on vision alone spiders can habituate and dishabituate to the presence of conspecifics. The data support the interpretation that these spiders can distinguish between conspecifics on the basis of their appearance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study presents two experiments. The second set of data recapitulates the findings of the first experiment with an independent set of spiders, highlighting the strength of the results. The study also uses a highly quantitative approach to measuring relative interest between pairs of spiders based on their distance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study design is overly complicated, missing key controls, and the data presented in the figures are not clearly connected to the study. The discussion is challenging to understand and appears to make unsupported conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) Study design: The study design is rather complicated and as a result, it is difficult to interpret the results. The spiders are presented with the same individual twice in a row, called a habituation trial. Then a new individual is presented twice in a row. The first of these is a dishabituation trial and the second is another habituation trial (but now habituating to a second individual). This is done with three pairings and then this entire structure is repeated over three sessions. The data appear to show the strong effects of differences between habituation and dishabituation trials in the first session. The decrease in differential behavior between the so-called habituation and dishabituation trials in sessions 2 and 3 is explained as a consequence of the spiders beginning to habituate in general to all of the individuals. The claim that the spiders remember specific individuals is somewhat undercut because all of the 'dishabituation' trials in session 2 are toward spiders they already met for 14 minutes previously but seemingly do not remember in session 2. In session 3 it is ambiguous what is happening because the spiders no longer differentiate between the trial types. This could be due to fatigue or familiarity. A second experiment is done to show that introducing a totally novel individual, recovers a large dishabituation response, suggesting that the lack of differences between 'habituation' and 'dishabituation' trials in session 3 is the result of general habituation to all of the spiders in the session rather than fatigue. As mentioned before, these data do support the claim that spiders differentiate among individuals.</p>
<p>The data from session 1 are easy to interpret. The data from sessions 2 and 3 are harder to understand, but these are the trials in which they meet an individual again after a substantial period of separation. Other studies looking at recognition in ants and wasps (cited by the authors) have done a 4 trial design in which focal animal A meets B in the first trial, then meets C in the second trial, meets B again in the third trial, and then meets D in the last trial. In that scenario trials 1, 2, and 4 are between unfamiliar individuals and trial 3 is between potentially familiar individuals. In both the ants and wasps, high aggression is seen in species with and without recognition on trial 1, with low aggression specifically for trials with familiar individuals in species with recognition. Across different tests, species or populations that lack recognition have shown a general reduction in aggression towards all individuals that become progressively less aggressive over time (reminiscent of the session 2 and 3 data) while others have maintained modest levels of aggression across all individuals. The 4 session design used in those other studies provides an unambiguous interpretation of the data while controlling for 'fatigue'. That all trials in sessions 2 and 3 are always with familiar individuals makes it challenging to understand how much the spiders are habituating to each other versus having some kind of associative learning of individual identity and behavior.</p>
<p>The data presentation is also very complicated. How is it the case that a negative proportion of time is spent? The methods reveal that this metric is derived by comparing the time individuals spent in each region relative to the previous time they saw that individual. At the very least, data showing the distribution of distances from the wall would be much easier to interpret for the reader.</p>
<p>(2) &quot;Long-term social memory&quot;: It is not entirely clear what is meant by the authors when they say 'long-term social memory', though typically long-term memory refers to a form of a memory that requires protein synthesis. While the precise timing of memory formation varies across species and contexts, a general rule is that long-term memory should last for &gt; 24 hours (e.g., Dreier et al 2007 Biol Letters). The longest time that spiders are apart in this trial setup is something like an hour. There is no basis to claim that spiders have long-term social memory as they are never asked to remember anyone after a long time apart. The odd phrasing of the 'long-term dishabutation' trial makes it seem that it is testing a long-term memory, but it is not. The spiders have never met. The fact that they are very habituated to one set of stimuli and then respond to a new stimulus is not evidence of long-term memory. To clearly test memory (which is the part really lacking from the design), the authors would need to show that spiders - upon the first instance of re-encountering a previously encountered individual are already 'habituated' to them but not to some other individuals. The current data suggest this may be the case, but it is just very hard to interpret given the design does not directly test the memory of individuals in a clear and unambiguous manner.</p>
<p>(3) Lack of a functional explanation and the emphasis on 'asociality': It is entirely plausible that recognition is a pleitropic byproduct of the overall visual cognition abilities in the spiders. However, the discussion that discounts territoriality as a potential explanation is not well laid out. First, many species that are 'asocial' nevertheless defend territories. It is perhaps best to say such species are not group living, but they have social lives because they encounter conspecifics and need to interact with them. Indeed, there are many examples of solitary living species that show the dear enemy effect, a form of individual recognition, towards familiar territorial neighbors. The authors in this case note that territorial competition is mediated by the size or color of the chelicerae (seemingly a trait that could be used to distinguish among individuals). Apparently, because previous work has suggested that territorial disputes can be mediated by a trait in the absence of familiarity has led them to discount the possibility that keeping track of the local neighbors in a potentially cannibalistic species could be a sufficient functional reason. In any event, the current evidence presented certainly does not warrant discounting that hypothesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated whether a salticid spider, Phidippus regius, recognizes other individuals of the same species. The authors placed each spider inside a container from which it could see another spider for 7 minutes, before having its view of the other spider occluded by an opaque barrier for 3 minutes. The spider was then either presented with the same individual again (habituation trial) or a different individual (dishabituation trial). The authors recorded the distance between the two spiders during each trial. In habituation trials, the spiders were predicted to spend more time further away from each other and, in dishabituation trials, the spiders were predicted to spend more time closer to each other. The results followed these predictions, and the authors then considered whether the spiders in habituation trials were generally fatigued instead of being habituated to the appearance of the other spider, which may have explained why they spent less time near the other individual. The authors presented the spiders with a different (novel) individual after a longer period of time (which they considered to be a long-term dishabituation trial), and found that the spiders switched to spending more time closer to the other individual again during this trial. This suggested that the spiders had recognized and had habituated to the individual that they had seen before and that they became dishabituated when they encountered a different individual.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider individual recognition by Phidippus regius. Other work on individual recognition by an invertebrate has been, for instance, known for a species of social wasp, but Phidippus regius is a different animal. Importantly and more specifically, P. regius is a salticid spider, and these spiders are known to have exceptional eyesight for animals of their size, potentially making them especially suitable for studies on individual recognition. In the current study, the results from experiments were consistent with the authors' predictions, suggesting that the spiders were recognizing each other by being habituated to individuals they had encountered before and by being dishabituated to individuals they had not encountered before. This is a good start in considering individual recognition by this species.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The experiments in this manuscript (habituation/dishabituation trials) are a good start for considering whether individuals of a salticid species recognize each other. I am left wondering, however, what features the spiders were specifically paying attention to when recognizing each other. The authors cited Sheehan and Tibbetts (2010) who stated that &quot;Individual recognition requires individuals to uniquely identify their social partners based on phenotypic variation.&quot; Also, recognition was considered in a paper on another salticid by Tedore and Johnsen (2013).</p>
<p>Tedore, C., &amp; Johnsen, S. (2013). Pheromones exert top-down effects on visual recognition in the jumping spider Lyssomanes viridis. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 216, 1744-1756. doi: 10.1242/jeb.071118</p>
<p>In this elegant study, the authors presented spiders with manipulated images to find out what features matter to these spiders when recognizing individuals.</p>
<p>Part of the problem with using two living individuals in experiments is that the behavior of one individual can influence the behavior of the other, and this can bias the results. However, this issue can be readily avoided because salticids are well known, for example, to be highly responsive to lures (e.g. dead prey glued in lifelike posture onto cork disks) and to computer animation. These methods have already been successful and helpful for standardizing the different stimuli presented during many different experiments for many different salticid spiders, and they would be helpful for better understanding how Phidippus regius might recognize another individual on the basis of phenotypic variation. There are all sorts of ways in which a salticid might recognize another individual. Differences in face or body structure, or body size, or all of these, might have an important role in recognition, but we won't know what these are using the current methods alone. Also, I didn't see any details about whether body size was standardized in the current manuscript.</p>
<p>For another perspective, my thoughts turn to a paper by Cross et al.</p>
<p>Cross, F. R., Jackson, R. R., &amp; Taylor, L. A. (2020). Influence of seeing a red face during the male-male encounters of mosquito-specialist spiders. Learning &amp; Behavior, 48, 104-112. doi: 10.3758/s13420-020-00411-y</p>
<p>These authors found that males of Evarcha culicivora, another salticid species that is known to have a red face, become less responsive to their own mirror images after having their faces painted with black eyeliner than if their faces remained red. In all instances, the spiders only saw their own mirror images and never another spider, and these results cannot be interpreted on the basis of habituation/dishabituation because the spiders were not responding differently when they simply saw their mirror image again. Instead, it was specifically the change to the spider's face which resulted in a change of behavior. The findings from this paper and from Tedore and Johnsen can help give us additional perspectives that the authors might like to consider. On the whole, I would like the authors to further consider the features that P. regius might use to discern and recognize another individual.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Jumping spiders (family Salticidae) have extraordinarily good eyesight, but little is known about how sensitive these small animals might be to the identity of other individuals that they see. Here, experiments were carried out using Phidippus regius, a salticid spider from North America. There were three steps in the experiments; first, a spider could see another spider; then its view of the other spider was blocked; and then either the same or a different individual spider came into view. Whether it was the same or a different individual that came into view in the third step had a significant effect on how close together or far apart the spiders positioned themselves. It has been demonstrated before that salticids can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar individuals while relying on chemical cues, but this new research on P. regius provides the first experimental evidence that a spider can discriminate by sight between familiar and unfamiliar individuals.</p>
<p>Clark RJ, Jackson RR (1995) Araneophagic jumping spiders discriminate between the draglines of familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics. Ethology, Ecology and Evolution 7:185-190</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work is a useful step toward a fuller understanding of the perceptual and cognitive capacities of spiders and other animals with small nervous systems. By providing experimental evidence for a conclusion that a spider can, by sight, discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar individuals, this research will be an important milestone. We can anticipate a substantial influence on future research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The conclusions should be stated more carefully.</p>
<p>(2) It is not clearly the case that the experimental methods are based on 'habituation (learning to ignore; learning not to respond). Saying 'habituation' seems to imply that certain distances are instances of responding and other distances are instances of not responding but, as a reasonable alternative, we might call distance in all instances a response. However, whether all distances are responses or not is a distracting issue because being based on habituation is not a necessity.</p>
<p>(3) Besides data related to distances, other data might have been useful. For example, salticids are especially well known for the way they communicate using distinctive visual displays and, unlike distance, displaying is a discrete, unambiguous response.</p>
<p>(4) Methods more aligned with salticids having extraordinarily good eyesight would be useful. For example, with salticids, standardising and manipulating stimuli in experiments can be achieved by using mounts, video playback, and computer-generated animation.</p>
<p>(5) An asocial-versus-social distinction is too imprecise, and it may have been emphasised too much. With P. regius, irrespective of whether we use the label asocial or social, the important question pertains to the frequency of encounters between the same individuals and the consequences of these encounters.</p>
<p>(6) Hypotheses related to not-so-strictly adaptive factors are discussed and these hypotheses are interesting, but these considerations are not necessarily incompatible with more strictly adaptive influences being relevant as well.</p>
