<title>Abstract</title><p>Amino acid biosynthesis is vital for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) proliferation and tuberculosis pathogenesis. However, it is not clear how amino acids are transported in Mtb, particularly the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) that contribute to the production of the cell-wall lipid component precursors such as acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA.</p>
<p>While performing the screening of an FDA-approved repurposed library of small molecule inhibitors against the auxotrophic strain Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206, which lacks <italic>leuC-leuD</italic> and <italic>panC-panD</italic> genes, we identified a molecule namely semapimod, which exclusively inhibits growth of the auxotrophic strain, whereas no effect is observed against the wild-type Mtb H<sub>37</sub>Rv. Interestingly, 24 h of exposure of Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 to semapimod causes massive transcriptional reprogramming with differential expression of &gt;450 genes associated with a myriad of metabolic activities. By performing a series of experiments, we affirm that semapimod indeed inhibits the L-leucine uptake in Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 by targeting a protein involved in the cell-wall lipid biosynthesis pathway. Remarkably, semapimod treatment of mice infected with Mtb H<sub>37</sub>Rv causes a significant reduction of bacterial load in lungs and spleen, despite showing no efficacy against the pathogenic strain <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Overall findings of our study reveal that together with an endogenous pathway for L-leucine biosynthesis, a well-orchestrated machinery for its uptake is functional in Mtb which is important for intracellular survival of the TB pathogen.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is the leading cause of death due to microbial infections. As per the recent estimates, approximately 25% of the global population is asymptomatically infected with Mtb and about 11 million people developed the disease annually resulting in the loss of ∼1.25 million lives. In 2023, eight countries accounted for more than two thirds of the global total burden, with India leading the count<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>TB is curable and the usual treatment of pulmonary TB (PTB) cases involves 4 antibiotics (isoniazid (H), rifampicin(R), pyrazinamide (Z) and ethambutol (E)) for the first 2 months followed by four months of treatment with R and H<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, due to multiple reasons such as delayed or mis-diagnosis, inadequate availability of drugs in resource-limited settings, poor administration, and noncompliance to the prolonged toxic drug regimen, TB becomes resistant to these drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) is classified under five categories: H-resistant TB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, R-resistant TB (RR-TB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) which is resistant to both H and R, pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB) which is resistant to H, R and any fluoroquinolone or any of the second-line injectables such as amikacin, capreomycin, and kanamycin, and XDR-TB which is resistant to H, R, any fluoroquinolone, and a second-line injectable or at least one of the recently developed drugs bedaquiline and linezolid. Treatment of DR-TB involves lengthy treatment with a course of second-line drugs for 6-18 months, causing huge socioeconomic burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. DR-TB continues to be a threat to the public health system as number of people developing MDR/RR-TB remains stable since 2020. Globally, ∼400,000 MDR/RR-TB cases were reported in 2023, with about one fourth of the global MDR-TB cases reported from India alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Considering the grim situation of everlasting DR-TB cases and emergence of resistance to newly developed drugs, there is a pressing need to explore novel therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>With advancements in the medicinal chemistry, large numbers of new chemical entities (NCEs) have been synthesized over the last three decades that were evaluated for antimicrobial activity by the target-based and the phenotypic screening approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, only a few of the newly developed antibiotics that got approval for human use exhibit a novel mechanism of action (MoA), whereas majority are the derivatives of the existing antibiotic classes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Evaluation of the antibiotic potential of the existing drugs that are approved for human use by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) for other diseases, also known as drug repurposing, has emerged as an alternative approach to expedite treatment of infectious diseases including TB, as it avoids much of the hurdles at the early phases of drug development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Herein, we report that a new anti-inflammatory molecule– semapimod, identified from a screen of the repurposed library of FDA-approved drugs, kills Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 (a leucine and pantothenate auxotroph) at a reasonably low concentration of 20nM. To our great surprise, semapimod fails to inhibit other mycobacterial species including pathogenic Mtb H<sub>37</sub>Rv. These unexpected findings led us to identify a functional L-leucine uptake system in Mtb, which is blocked by the newly-identified compound. We show that semapimod targets an enzyme, PpsB, involved in the synthesis of the cell-wall phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), and influences Mtb virulence during host infection.</p>

<title>Screening of FDA-approved library of molecules against Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206</title>
<p>In this study we screened a repurposed library (MedChemExpress) consisting of 3614 FDA-approved small molecule inhibitors against Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206, which is commonly used as a surrogate strain for pathogenic Mtb H<sub>37</sub>Rv<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These molecules primarily target microbial infections (790), GPCR/G Protein (646), apoptosis (371), metabolic enzyme (including protease) (355), membrane transporter (236), autophagy (210), cell cycle/DNA damage (157), immunology/inflammation (109), protein tyrosine kinase/RTK (99) and a large number of molecules targeting other miscellaneous pathways (402) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>). The library contains a versatile set of molecules targeting different diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, endocrinology, infection, inflammation/immunology, metabolic disease and neurological disease (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. 1b</xref>). While these are intended for human use, 66% of the molecules have recently been launched, whereas remaining inhibitors are at different phases of trial, as depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>. Of these, we identified 422 molecules showing complete inhibition of growth at 50µM concentration. As anticipated, majority (158) of the Mtb-inhibitors show anti-infection activity. However, several other compounds acting on host metabolic pathways, such as GPCR/G protein (68), apoptosis (45), autophagy (24), cell cycle/DNA damage (18), metabolic enzyme/protease (18), protein tyrosine kinase/RTK (17), JAK/STAT signaling (14) and membrane transporter (13), substantially inhibit <italic>in vitro</italic> growth of Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we determined minimum concentration of newly identified anti-mycobacterial compounds at which ∼90% growth is suppressed (MIC<sub>90</sub>), by using plate-based resazurin assay. Our results reveal 300 molecules showing an MIC<sub>90</sub> of ≥12.5 µM, whereas remaining 122 molecules exhibit MIC<sub>90</sub> values ranging from 6.25 to ≤0.025µM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Surprisingly, out of the eight molecules which inhibit growth at &lt;0.025µM, we find an anti-inflammatory molecule namely semapimod which demonstrates anti-microbial activity against Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206. Notably, semapimod is an inhibitor of proinflammatory cytokine production, which suppresses the production of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and its anti-mycobacterial activity has never been reported to the best of our knowledge.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Semapimod shows bactericidal activity against Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 under extra- and intracellular growth conditions</title>
<p>To corroborate the findings from initial screen, we tested the effect of the fresh batch of semapimod against Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206, which reveals complete inhibition of mycobacterial growth at ∼15nM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The colony forming unit (CFU) estimation further shows a bactericidal activity of this molecule which causes 88% reduction of bacterial viability on day 2 and &gt;99% reduction after 5 days of incubation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In addition to its effect on <italic>in vitro</italic> growth, we also find a substantial reduction in viable bacterial counts during macrophage infection. Incubation of Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206-infected THP1 macrophages with different doses of semapimod reveals 60% reduction (<italic>p</italic> &lt;0.005) in intracellular CFU counts after 6 days of incubation with 1µM inhibitor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). Notably, no cytotoxic effect was observed at this concentration against THP1, thus ruling out the possibility of cell lysis by semapimod.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Global transcriptional profile of Mtb in response to semapimod treatment</title>
<p>To gain mechanistic insights into the effect of semapimod on Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206, we analysed the global transcriptional profile of the bacterium in response to this drug. Bacterial cultures in the logarithmic growth phase (OD600 of ∼0.4) were treated with 50nM semapimod, equivalent to ∼3x MIC, and total RNAs were harvested from semapimod-treated and untreated bacteria after 24 h of incubation, as described in the Materials and Methods. RNA samples from three biological replicates were subsequently used in RNA sequencing (RNASeq), which reveals differential expression of 482 genes by ≥2.0-fold (false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted <italic>p</italic> value of ≤ 0.01). While 251 genes are downregulated by semapimod treatment, expression of 231 genes is induced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary Dataset 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Remarkably, the effect of semapimod was consistent across three biological replicates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Genes, prominently affected by semapimod, primarily belong to intermediary metabolism and respiration (n=124), cell-wall and cell processes (n=98), lipid metabolism (n=50) and those encoding for regulatory proteins (n=31) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Expression of some of the representative genes was also validated by qRT-PCR using gene-specific primers, which shows a similar pattern of expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), thus confirming the specificity of the RNASeq data.</p>

<p>Our results show that genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation such as <italic>atpF</italic>, <italic>atpH</italic>, <italic>atpG</italic>, <italic>atpD</italic>, <italic>cydB</italic>, <italic>cydA</italic>, <italic>Rv1812c</italic> and <italic>qcrC</italic> as well as several <italic>nu</italic>o operon genes (<italic>nuoB</italic>, <italic>nuoC</italic>, <italic>nuoD</italic>, <italic>nuoE</italic>, <italic>nuoF</italic>, <italic>nuoG</italic>, <italic>nuoI</italic>, <italic>nuoJ</italic>, <italic>nuoL</italic>, <italic>nuoM</italic> and <italic>nuoN</italic>) are downregulated in the drug-treated bacteria. Not only expression level of these respiratory genes is perturbed, but also a significant reduction in the cellular ATP levels is observed upon semapimod treatment of Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Furthermore, we find several genes that encode for subunits of RNA polymerase (<italic>rpoA</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic>) and ribosome (<italic>rplJ</italic>, <italic>rplL</italic>, <italic>rplC</italic>, <italic>rplD</italic>, <italic>rplW</italic>, <italic>rplB</italic>, <italic>rpmC</italic>, <italic>rpsN1</italic>, <italic>rpsH</italic>, <italic>rplF</italic>, <italic>rplR</italic>, <italic>rpmD</italic>, <italic>rplT</italic> and <italic>rpsD</italic>) exhibiting distinct upregulation in response to the drug treatment, which indicate perturbation of transcription and translation machineries in the drug-treated bacteria. Notably, semapimod treatment also interferes with expression of a number of genes associated with metabolism of amino acids such as branched-chain amino acids (<italic>ilvC</italic>, <italic>ilvB1</italic>, <italic>ilvN</italic>, <italic>leuA</italic>, <italic>bkdB</italic>, <italic>bkdA</italic>, <italic>Rv2499c</italic>, <italic>accA1</italic> and <italic>accD1</italic>), cysteine (<italic>csd</italic>, <italic>cysM</italic>, <italic>cysO</italic>, <italic>cysE</italic>, <italic>cysK1</italic> and <italic>sahH</italic>), lysine (<italic>pcd</italic>, <italic>lat</italic>, <italic>lysA</italic>), methionine (<italic>metZ</italic>, <italic>metK</italic> and <italic>metH</italic>), threonine (<italic>thrB</italic>, <italic>thrC</italic> and <italic>thrA</italic>), glutamate (<italic>gdh</italic>), glutamine (<italic>glnA1</italic>) and tryptophan (<italic>trpA</italic>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we find that semapimod treatment modulates expression of genes encoding a variety of regulatory proteins such as kinases (<italic>pknA</italic>, <italic>pknG</italic> and <italic>pknD</italic>), WhiB-family transcription regulators (<italic>whiB2</italic>, <italic>whiB3</italic> and <italic>whiB7</italic>), hypoxia regulators (<italic>Rv0081</italic>, <italic>dosS</italic> and <italic>dosR</italic>), regulators of lipid transport (<italic>Rv0302</italic> and <italic>mce1R</italic>), a regulator of MCC genes (<italic>regX3</italic>) and a leucine-responsive transcription regulator (LrpA).</p>

<title>Semapimod treatment interferes with L-leucine uptake in Mtb</title>
<p>To validate the effect of semapimod on the virulent Mtb, we sought to determine its MIC against Mtb H<sub>37</sub>Rv. Surprisingly, the drug was found ineffective against virulent Mtb strain. Similar to virulent Mtb strain, no effect was observed against other mycobacterial species such as <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG, <italic>M. abscessus</italic> and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). These results pointed out the effect of semapimod on uptake of leucine and/or pantothenate that are indispensable for growth of the auxotrophic strain. Altered expression of a set of LrpA-regulated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> by semapimod treatment indicates perturbation of leucine uptake. To test this hypothesis, we cultured Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 in the absence of pantothenate and L-leucine (PL- ), pantothenate (P-) or L-leucine (L-) for 24 h followed by analysis of the expression of some of the leucine-responsive genes such as <italic>lat</italic>, <italic>leuA</italic>, <italic>lrpA</italic> and <italic>icl1</italic> as surrogate markers. Interestingly, all of these genes exhibit marked increase in expression under PL- and L-, but not under P- conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). A similar expression profile of these genes is observed in semapimod-treated bacteria by RNASeq, thus suggesting the interference of L-leucine uptake. To corroborate these findings, the intracellular leucine concentrations were estimated in the untreated and semapimod-treated Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 by mass-spectrometry. Our results show ∼45% reduction (p &lt;0.05) in the leucine levels in bacteria exposed to semapimod (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Next, we examined the effect of semapimod against Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206, expressing <italic>leuC-leuD</italic> and <italic>panC-panD</italic>, respectively, under a constitutive promoter. Remarkably, expression of <italic>leuC-leuD</italic>, and not of <italic>panC-panD</italic> genes, alleviates the growth-inhibitory effect of semapimod (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c-e</xref>). Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206::<italic>leuCD</italic> exhibits comparable growth in the presence and the absence of semapimod (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).

In contrast, Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206::<italic>panCD</italic> exhibits a similar level of inhibition by semapimod, as observed with the Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206.

<title>Intracellular survival of Mtb H<sub>37</sub>Rv pathogen in the organelles of infected BalB/C mice is decreased upon semapimod treatment</title>
<p>Although, endogenous leucine biosynthesis is extremely essential for bacterial survival and virulence, there is no study describing underlying mechanism of L-leucine uptake from extracellular environment and its importance in mycobacterial virulence during animal infections. To examine if L-leucine uptake is critical for intracellular survival of the pathogenic Mtb H<sub>37</sub>Rv strain with intact endogenous leucine biosynthesis, we tested the effect of semapimod treatment on intracellular burden of Mtb H<sub>37</sub>Rv during mouse infection. Infection was performed via aerosol route as described in the Materials and Methods. After 21 days of infection, a group of 3 mice were treated with 5mg/kg dose of semapimod, whereas another group of 3 mice were treated with vehicle (1x phosphate buffered saline) by daily oral gavaging for 4 weeks, typically as shown in the schematic. Bacterial load was examined in lungs and spleen of animals from both the groups by colony forming unit (CFU) estimation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Conventional approaches of drug discovery involve screening of NCEs against either the validated ‘drug target’ (target-based screen) or the pathogen as a whole (phenotypic screen)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The aim is to identify inhibitor(s) showing a novel MoA. However, any promising NCE faces a multitude of barriers to reach to market launch from initial development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Repurposing offers the possibility of identifying new MoA of the existing drugs that are already approved for human use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, it bypasses the traditional drug discovery and development pipeline involving <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of NCEs. Several non-antibiotic drugs that are currently approved or under development may inhibit microbial pathogens, and therefore can be explored as novel antimicrobials, either alone or in combination with the existing antibiotics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The present study was designed with the aim to identify novel TB inhibitors using the FDA-approved repurposed library comprising of over 3600 molecules. Remarkably, in addition to the known anti-TB drugs, we found several novel hit molecules that were developed against non-communicable diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological diseases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a-b</xref>) that can be explored as novel anti-TB drugs in future. Notably, one of the top hits, namely semapimod, which inhibited Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 growth at less than 20nM concentration, has never been reported for antibiotic activity. We show that this drug, not only kills Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 <italic>in vitro</italic>, but also significantly reduces bacterial growth during macrophage infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c-e</xref>). Surprisingly, semapimod did not exhibit growth inhibition of other mycobacteria including the pathogenic Mtb H37Rv (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), which was used to develop the auxotroph by deletion of <italic>leuC-leuD</italic> and <italic>panC-panD</italic> genes. Remarkably, we demonstrate that growth inhibition by semapimod is due to blockage of L-leucine availability in Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). We rule out the possibility of L-leucine quenching or modification by semapimod, as both the <italic>leuC-leuD</italic>-expressing and the Sem<sup>R</sup> strains of Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 continue to metabolize exogenous L-leucine in the presence of drug. Instead, our results suggest that semapimod restricts L-leucine uptake in Mtb. As a consequence, this drug is not effective against other mycobacterial species with the functional endogenous leucine biosynthesis pathway.</p>

The two best characterized amino acid transport systems are the high-affinity periplasmic binding protein-(BP) dependent transport system for leucine, isoleucine, and valine (LIV-I and LIV-II) in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the high-affinity histidine transport system in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Although, Mtb is able to synthesize all 20 amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, however, to ensure constant supply of amino acids under a wide variety of environments, the TB pathogen must be equipped for their transport. Genome analysis of the fast-growing soil organism, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> reveals 15 genes spread across three different loci that are putatively involved in BCAA transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). However, homologues of none of these are found in Mtb. Although, intracellular Mtb exploits multiple host-derived amino acids as nitrogen sources including BCAAs during growth in macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, thus far, it remains unclear how amino acids are transported across the cell envelope of Mtb. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providing evidence for the presence of a functional transport system for a BCAA in Mtb. We show that semapimod, which is an anti-inflammatory drug, targets a polyketide synthase involved in the cell-wall PDIM biosynthesis, and selectively kills <italic>in vitro</italic> the leucine auxotroph by blocking the L-leucine uptake, possibly by modulating the PDIM architecture. The cell-wall PDIM regulates uptake of nutrients and provides barrier to large molecule inhibitors. PDIM tends to shed during culturing of Mtb in the presence of ionic detergents, thus providing better access to nutrients and large molecules such as vancomycin. As a consequence, Mtb strains lacking</p>
<p>PDIM not only grow faster, but also become more susceptible to vancomycin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Remarkably, the Sem<sup>R</sup> strain which accumulates mutation in the PpsB near acetyltransferase domain, exhibits both the phenotypes, i.e., a dramatic increase in its susceptibility to vancomycin and faster growth rate compared to the wild-type Mtb, despite culturing in the presence of the non-ionic detergent. Loss of PDIM in the drug-resistant strain is further confirmed by TLC analysis of the PDIM, whereas other lipids such as triacyl glycerol (TAG) or mycolic acids remain unaltered (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). Most importantly, susceptibility to semapimod is restored in the Sem<sup>R</sup> Mtb mc<sup>2</sup> 6206 by overexpression of <italic>ppsB</italic>. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate for the first time the involvement of the cell-wall PDIM in L-leucine uptake in Mtb (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). At present, it is not understood how PDIM selectively facilitates movement of L-leucine, and whether other apolar hydrophobic molecules follow the same route for their transport across the mycobacterial cell membrane. Since, PDIM is an important virulence factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, understanding its role in the transport of other metabolites including amino acids will shed important light on virulence strategies employed by Mtb.</p>

<p>Semapimod treatment interferes with the expression of more than 10% of protein-coding genes of Mtb involved in a variety of functions. A careful analysis of the transcriptional profile further provides evidence corroborating the deviation of leucine levels in the cell by semapimod treatment. For instance, <italic>lrpA</italic>, which encodes for a transcriptional regulator of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, is upregulated by 9.25-fold. It has been shown that binding of Mtb LrpA with the target promoters is influenced by amino acids and vitamins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Not only LrpA, but also some of its regulons such as <italic>lat</italic> (94.01-fold), <italic>whiB2</italic> (0.33-fold), <italic>pks2</italic> (12.58-fold), and <italic>gid</italic> (0.37-fold) also show significant modulation.</p>
<p>Among other differentially expressed gene sets, the most notable ones are those involved in energy and lipid metabolism. Since, leucine is catalyzed into acetyl-CoA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, we hypothesize that in the presence of semapimod, level of acetyl-CoA is perturbed in the cell. Acetyl-CoA, being the precursor of energy metabolism, subsequently impacts the overall energy state, as evidenced by &gt;80% reduction in ATP following drug treatment. In other bacteria such as Salmonella, L-leucine supplementation stimulates the TCA cycle, causing increased intracellular NADH and ATP concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, which further substantiates the contribution of intracellular leucine in energy production in mycobacteria.</p>
<p>Strikingly, semapimod-treated Mtb exhibits significant upregulation of genes that encode for proteins involved in MCC such as methylcitrate synthase PrpC (19.48-fold), methylcitrate dehydratase PrpD (92.5-fold), the regulator of <italic>prpC</italic> and <italic>prpD</italic> genes– PrpR (28.55-fold), and an enzyme, Icl1 (68.69-fold). Icl1 of Mtb exhibits both the isocitrate lyase activity involved in the glyoxylate shunt, and methylisocitrate lyase activity which is responsible for catalysing the last reaction of the MCC, resulting in the production of succinate and pyruvate that are routed into the TCA cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Although, MCC is responsible for metabolizing the toxic intermediates produced from catabolism of odd-chain fatty acids (OCFAs) such as cholesterol, which is the primary source of nutrient during host infection , it has been observed that both the glyoxylate shunt and MCC are functional in wild-type Mtb, even in the presence of glycolytic carbon source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Icl1-deficient Mtb undergoes a progressive depletion of TCA cycle intermediates, which in-turn impair Mtb’s respiratory activity. Although, excess of leucine in the extracellular environment is lethal, intracellular leucine production is critical as it provides an alternative pool for acetyl-CoA biosynthesis which feeds into the respiratory and lipid metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We believe that decline in intracellular leucine together with reduced expression of genes involved in its catabolism (<italic>accD1</italic>, <italic>bkdA</italic> and <italic>bkdB</italic>) triggers the induction of alternate pathway such as MCC to maintain the cellular acetyl-CoA pool.</p>
<p>The complex cell-wall lipids of Mtb provide a hydrophobic barrier around the bacterium. These can be esterified with multiple methyl-branched (MB) long chain fatty acids such as PDIM, sulfolipid-1, and di-, tri-, and poly-acyl trehalose. These MB lipids are synthesized by individual polyketide synthase (PKS) complexes requiring malonyl-CoA and methyl malonyl-CoA (MMCoA), which are derived from acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, respectively. PDIM is an important virulence factor, and controls the movement of nutrients and large molecule inhibitors such as vancomycin across the bacterial cell membrane. While genes involved in synthesis of phthiocerol moiety of PDIM such as <italic>ppsB</italic>, <italic>ppsC</italic> and <italic>ppsD</italic> are downregulated, those involved in biosynthesis of SL-1 (<italic>papA1</italic> and <italic>pks2</italic>) and poly-acyl trehalose (<italic>pks3</italic>, <italic>pks4</italic>, <italic>papA3</italic>, and <italic>fadD21</italic>) are highly upregulated in drug-treated bacteria. Since, both PDIM and SL-1 biosynthetic pathways share a common precursor, MMCoA, it has been observed that reduction of PDIM synthesis favours SL-1 production due to increased flux of MMCoA to the SL-1 biosynthetic pathway, and <italic>vice versa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Intrigued with these observations, we speculate that semapimod induces remodelling of cell-wall lipids, restricting L-leucine uptake by an unknown mechanism (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Targeting of PpsB by semapimod further supports the above hypothesis and warrants future studies to identify alterations in the cell envelope which impose restriction on L-leucine transport.</p>
<p>Uptake of host-derived nutrients including amino acids supports bacterial viability during infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Targeting the amino acid transport system offers a novel strategy to curtail the supply of host-derived nutrients to the pathogens, which are metabolically quiescent during intracellular stay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Semapimod, which has been found to inhibit the L-leucine uptake in Mtb, may not be the preferred choice of L-leucine inhibitor owing to its anti-inflammatory effect. It inhibits production of proinflammatory cytokine such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. Also, it has been reported that semapimod interferes with the TLR4 signalling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. These cytokines play a critical role in providing protection to the host against active TB infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, despite its anti-inflammatory activity which may promote bacterial proliferation, semapimod is able to reduce the intracellular burden of virulent Mtb H37Rv strain in lungs and spleen of the infected mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). These findings provide an indirect evidence of the importance of L-leucine uptake for Mtb virulence during host infection.</p>
<p>Advancements in the genetic manipulation tools such as CRISPR-Cas technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> has significantly contributed to enhancing our understanding of metabolic networks in mycobacteria. Screening of inhibitors against other Mtb auxotrophic strains is expected to provide novel insights into transport mechanisms of essential metabolites in Mtb that can be explored as novel anti-TB drug targets.</p>

<title>Cloning, expression and purification of PpsB</title>
<p>Full-length <italic>ppsB</italic> ORF fragment was obtained from pGEMT-<italic>ppsB</italic> by <italic>Nde I-Hind III</italic> digestion and cloned at the same sites in pET28b (Novagen) to express the recombinant protein with 6x His tags at the N-terminus <italic>in E. coli</italic>. For this, pET28b-<italic>ppsB</italic> was transformed in <italic>E. coli</italic> C43(DE3) cells and recombinant clones were selected on LB agar containing kanamycin. Single colony of <italic>E. coli</italic>::pET28b-<italic>ppsB</italic> was inoculated in 10ml of LB broth medium containing kanamycin and culture was grown to turbidity at 37 °C with shaking at 200rpm. Secondary culture was subsequently inoculated from the seed culture in one liter of LB broth medium with kanamycin. Expression of 6XHis-PpsB was induced by adding 1mM IPTG in the culture at OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.80. After overnight incubation with IPTG at 18 °C, culture was pelleted and washed twice with 1x PBS. Induced culture pellet was suspended in 50ml of lysis buffer (50mM Tris, pH 8.0, 50mM NaCl and 5% glycerol) and cell lysis was performed by using French press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and clarified cell lysate was incubated with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were subsequently transferred into an empty column and unbound proteins were allowed to pass through. Beads immobilized with 6XHis-PpsB were washed with 5 bed volumes of the lysis buffer, followed by washing with 5 bed volumes of wash buffer (lysis buffer containing 20mM imidazole). Immobilized 6XHis-PpsB was subsequently eluted with elution buffers (lysis buffer containing 100-300mM imidazole). The purity of eluted protein in different elution fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions showing &gt;90% purity of PpsB were pooled and dialyzed against lysis buffer. The purified proteins were stored in small aliquots at -80°C for subsequent use.</p>

<title>Protein-drug interaction by BLI-Octet</title>
<p>Optical interference-based Bio layer interferometry (BLI) from Octet system by ForteBIO was used to ascertain the interaction of semapimod with Mtb PpsB. Briefly, purified 6xHis-tagged PpsB protein was dialyzed in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 3.9, followed by immobilization onto the amine reactive group sensor (2nd-generation) (AR2G) up to a level of 2.1 nm. Different concentrations of semapimod were prepared in water and used to acquire differential graded response. Binding constant was calculated as per the standard steps of baseline (60 s), association (180 s) and dissociation (180 s).</p>

<title>Extraction of lipids</title>
<p>To obtain the apolar lipids, bacterial cultures equivalent to OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼150 were pelleted, washed with 10ml of water and suspended in 2 mL methanol-0.3% NaCl (10:1) and 1 mL petroleum ether. After mixing vigorously to emulsify the organic and the aqueous layers, samples were centrifuged at a speed of 2000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes to allow mixture to separate. The upper organic layer was collected in the microcentrifuge tubes, and the extraction was repeated by adding 1 mL petroleum ether to the lower aqueous phase and stirred for another 30 min. The organic layer was collected as described above and combined with the previous extracts. Petroleum ether was subsequently evaporated by vacuum drying at the room temperature and the resulting apolar lipids were stored at -80 °C for analysis by thin layer chromatography (TLC).</p>
<p>To prepare MAMES, culture pellets equivalent to OD<sub>600</sub> of ∼150 were suspended in 1ml of 20% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and incubated at 100 °C for overnight. After overnight incubation, 0.4 mL of dichloromethane and 50µl of iodomethane were added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The biphasic mixture was separated by centrifugation at 2000 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 minutes, and lower organic layer containing MAMES was collected in the microcentrifuge tubes. The MAMES fraction was completely dried and suspended in 1 mL of diethyl ether. The supernatant was collected in a new tube and vacuum dried. The dried fraction was suspended in 0.2ml of toluene and 0.1ml of acetonitrile, and after complete dissolution 0.2ml more acetonitrile was added. Samples were chilled at -20 °C for overnight and the MAMES were collected by centrifugation at 10000 x <italic>g</italic> for 20 minutes. MAMES present in the pellet fraction were stored at -80 °C for further analysis by TLC.</p>

<title>Analysis of lipids by TLC</title>
<p>Both the apolar lipids and MAMES were detected on aluminum-backed silica gel 60F254 plates (Merck). Dried lipid pellets were suspended in dichloromethane and equal volume of samples from both the strains were spotted on the TLC plates. Apolar lipids were resolved by two dimensional-TLC (2D-TLC) using petroleum ether:ethyl acetate solvent (98: 2) for 3 times in the first dimension, and petroleum ether:acetone mixture (98: 2) for one time in the second dimension. MAMES were resolved by one dimensional-TLC using petroleum ether:diethyl ether (95:5) solvent for 6 times. After complete run, TLC plates were air dried and sprayed with 5% phosphomolybdic acid solution, prepared in ethanol. Lipids were visualized on the TLC plates after charring at 100°C for 2-5 minutes.</p>

<title>Mice infection</title>
<p>Mice infection was performed as per the guidelines by the committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals (CPCSEA, India). Animal infection experiment was performed after receiving approval from the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of THSTI. Briefly, 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were infected with single cell suspension of mouse-passaged Mtb H<sub>37</sub>Rv at ∼5×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml via aerosol route in a closed aerosol chamber in the biosafety level 3 laboratory. To check the establishment of infection, bacterial load in lungs were examined at day 1 post-infection and the disease progression was assessed at day 21 post-infection, by CFU plating on selective 7H11-OADS agar plates containing 100µg/ml carbenicillin, 22µg/ml trimethoprim, 22µg/ml amphotericin B, 11µg/ml vancomycin, 27.5µg/ml polymyxin B and 0.88µg/ml cycloheximide. At day 21, mice were divided into two groups; one group was given semapimod (5mg/kg in 5% sucrose) by daily oral gavaging whereas the other half was given equal dose of 5% sucrose. CFUs were enumerated at day 28 post-semapimod or sucrose treatment to examine bacterial burden in lungs, and in spleen for dissemination.</p>

<p>By performing a chemical screen of an FDA-approved library of small molecules against a leucine-dependent Mtb strain, this work discovered that semapimod inhibits Mtb growth by impairing leucine import. The work is <bold>useful</bold> because it connects leucine uptake with the cell wall lipids in Mtb; however, it remains <bold>incomplete</bold> as the evidence supporting semapimod's ability to target leucine uptake needs more substantial proof. The work requires significant experimental evidence to identify leucine transporter(s) and determine how PDIM participates in leucine uptake.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors used a leucine/pantothenate auxotrophic strain of Mtb to screen a library of FDA-approved compounds for their antimycobacterial activity and found significant antibacterial activity of the inhibitor semapimod. In addition to alterations in pathways, including amino acid and lipid metabolism and transcriptional machinery, the authors demonstrate that semapimod treatment targets leucine uptake in Mtb. The work presents an interesting connection between nutrient uptake and cell wall composition in mycobacteria.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The link between the leucine uptake pathway and PDIM is interesting but has not been characterized mechanistically. The authors discuss that PDIM presents a barrier to the uptake of nutrients and shows binding of the drug with PpsB. However it is unclear why only the leucine uptake pathway was affected. We still do not know what PpsB actually does for amino acid uptake - is it a transporter? Does semapimod binding affect its activity? Does the auxotrophic Mtb have lower PDIM levels compared to wild-type Mtb?</p>
<p>(2) The authors show an interesting result where they observed antibacterial activity of semapimod against H37Rv only in vivo and not in vitro. Why do the authors think this is the basis of this observation? It is possible semapimod has an immunomodulatory effect on the host since leucine is an essential amino acid in mice. The authors could check pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in infected mouse lungs with and without drug treatment.</p>
<p>(3) The authors show that the semapimod-resistant auxotroph lacks PDIM. The conclusions would be further strengthened by including validations using PDIM mutants, including del-ppsB Mtb and other genes of the PDIM locus, whether in vivo this mutant would be more susceptible (or resistant) to semapimod treatment.</p>
<p>(4) Prolonged subculturing can introduce mutations in PDIM, which can be overcome by supplementing with propionate (Mullholland et al, Nat Microbiol, 2024). Did the authors also supplement their cultures with propionate? It would be interesting to see what mutations would result in Semr strains with propionate supplementation along with prolonged semapimod treatment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have summarized the limitations above in my comments. Overall, it would be helpful to provide more mechanistic details to study the connection between leucine uptake and PDIM.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This important study uncovers a novel mechanism for L-leucine uptake by M. tuberculosis and shows that targeting this pathway with 'Semapimod' interferes with bacterial metabolism and virulence. These results identify the leucine uptake pathway as a potential target to design new anti-tubercular therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The authors took numerous approaches to prove that L-leucine uptake of M. tuberculosis is an important physiological phenomenon and may be effectively targeted by 'Semapimod'. This study utilizes a series of experiments using a broad set of tools to justify how the leucine uptake pathway of M. tuberculosis may be targeted to design new anti-tubercular therapy.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The study does not explain how L-leucine is taken up by M. tuberculosis, leaving the mechanism unclear. Even though 'Semapimod' binds to the PpsB protein, the relevant connection between changes in PDIM and amino acid transport remains incomplete. Also, the fact that the drug does not function on WT bacteria makes it a weak candidate to consider its usefulness for a therapeutic option.</p>

<p>Agarwal et al identified the small molecule semapimod from a chemical screen of repurposed drugs with specific antimycobacterial activity against a leucine-dependent strain of M. tuberculosis. To better understand the mechanism of action of this repurposed anti-inflammatory drug, the authors used RNA-seq to reveal a leucine-deficient transcriptomic signature from semapimod challenge. The authors then measured a decreased intracellular concentration of leucine after semapimod challenge, suggesting that semapimod disrupts leucine uptake as the primary mechanism of action. Unexpectedly, however, resistant mutants raised against semapimod had a mutation in the polyketide synthase gene ppsB that resulted in loss of PDIM synthesis. The authors believe growth inhibition is a consequence of decreased accumulation of leucine as a result of an impaired cell wall and a disrupted, unknown leucine transporter. This study highlights the importance of branched-chain amino acids for M. tuberculosis survival, and the chemical genetic interactions between semapimod and ppsB indicate that ppsB is a conditionally essential gene in a medium depleted of leucine.</p>
<p>The conclusions regarding the leucine and PDIM phenotypes are moderately supported by experimental data. The authors do not provide experimental evidence to support a specific link between leucine uptake and impaired PDIM production. Additional work is needed to support these claims and strengthen this mechanism of action.</p>
<p>(1) Since leucine uptake and PDIM synthesis are important concepts of the manuscript, experiments would benefit from exploring other BCAAs to know if the phenotypes observed are specific to leucine, and adding additional strains to the 2D TLC experiments to provide confidence in the absence of the PDIM band.</p>
<p>(2) The intriguing observation that wild-type H37Rv is resistant to semapimod but the leucine-auxotroph is sensitive should be further explored. If the authors are correct and semapimod does inhibit leucine uptake through a specific transporter or disrupted cell wall (PDIM synthesis), testing semapimod activity against the leucine-auxotroph in various concentrations of BCAAs could highlight the importance of intracellular leucine. H37Rv is still able to synthesize endogenous leucine and is able to circumvent the effect of semapimod.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>n this manuscript, the authors used a leucine/pantothenate auxotrophic strain of Mtb to screen a library of FDA-approved compounds for their antimycobacterial activity and found significant antibacterial activity of the inhibitor semapimod. In addition to alterations in pathways, including amino acid and lipid metabolism and transcriptional machinery, the authors demonstrate that semapimod treatment targets leucine uptake in Mtb. The work presents an interesting connection between nutrient uptake and cell wall composition in mycobacteria.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The link between the leucine uptake pathway and PDIM is interesting but has not been characterized mechanistically. The authors discuss that PDIM presents a barrier to the uptake of nutrients and shows binding of the drug with PpsB. However it is unclear why only the leucine uptake pathway was affected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observe interference of L-leucine, but not of pantothenate, uptake in mc2 6206 strain upon semapimod treatment. At present, we do not have any clue whether PDIM presents a barrier exclusively to the uptake of L-leucine. Further studies may shed a light on underlying mechanism(s) by which L-leucine uptake is modulated by this small molecule.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>We still do not know what PpsB actually does for amino acid uptake - is it a transporter?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>By BLI-Octet we do not find any interaction between L-leucine and PpsB. Therefore, we doubt that PpsB is a transporter of L-leucine.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Does semapimod binding affect its activity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our study suggests that semapimod treatment alters PDIM architecture which becomes restrictive to L-leucine. However, at present the exact mechanism is not clear. Further studies are required to thoroughly examine the effect of semapimod on Mtb PpsB activity and alterations in PDIM by mass spectrometry.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Does the auxotrophic Mtb have lower PDIM levels compared to wild-type Mtb?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As per the published report by Mulholland et al, and by vancomycin susceptibility phenotype in our study, both the strains appear to have comparable PDIM levels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>Semapimod inhibits production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, which would indeed help pathogen establish chronic infection. However, a significant reduction in bacterial loads in lungs and spleen upon semapimod treatment despite inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines clearly indicates bacterial dependence on host-derived exogenous leucine during intracellular growth.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>PDIM is a virulence factor, and plays an important role in the intracellular survival of the TB pathogen. Mtb strains lacking PDIM are expected to show attenuated growth during infection, even without semapimod treatment. In such a case, it might be difficult to draw any conclusions about the effect of semapimod against PDIM(-) strains in vivo.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Considering the fact that extensive subculturing may result in loss of PDIM, we avoided prolonged subculturing of bacteria. As presented in Fig. 6b, the WT bacteria retain PDIM. While performing the initial screening of drugs, we did not anticipate such phenotype, and hence bacteria were cultured in regular 7H9-OADS medium without propionate supplementation.</p>
<p>A comprehensive future study would help examining the effect of propionate on generation of semapimod resistant mutants in Mtb mc2 6206.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>While Leucine uptake involves specific transporters in other bacteria, such transport system is not known in Mtb. By screening small molecule inhibitors, we came across a molecule, semapimod, which selectively kills the leucine auxotroph (mc2 6206), but not the WT Mtb. To understand the underlying mechanism of differential susceptibility of the WT and auxotrophic strains to this molecule, we evaluated the effect of restoration of <italic>leuCD</italic> and <italic>panCD</italic> expression on susceptibility of the auxotrophic strain to semapimod. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that upon endogenous expression of <italic>leuCD</italic> genes, mc2 6206 strain becomes resistant to killing by semapimod. In contrast, no effect of <italic>panCD</italic> expression was observed on semapimod susceptibility of mc2 6206. These findings were further substantiated by gene expression analysis of semapimod treated mc2 6206, which exhibits differential regulation of a set of genes that are altered upon leucine depletion in Mtb as well as in other bacteria. Overall results thus provide first evidence of perturbation of L-leucine uptake by semapimod treatment of the leucine auxotroph.</p>
<p>To further gain mechanistic insights into the effect of semapimod on leucine uptake in Mtb, we generated the semapimod resistant strain which exhibits point mutation in 4 genes including <italic>ppsB</italic>. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type <italic>ppsB</italic>, but not of other genes, restored susceptibility of the resistant bacteria to semapimod. Our observations that semapimod interacts with PpsB, and semapimod resistant strain accumulates mutation in PpsB resulting in loss of PDIM together support the involvement of cell-wall PDIM in regulation of L-leucine transport in Mtb.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we anticipate that semapimod treatment brings about certain modifications in PDIM which becomes more restrictive to L-leucine. A comprehensive future study will be helpful to examine the effect of semapimod on Mtb physiology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, the fact that the drug does not function on WT bacteria makes it a weak candidate to consider its usefulness for a therapeutic option.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that semapimod is not an appropriate drug candidate against TB owing to its inhibitory effect on production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 that help pathogen establish chronic infection. However, a significant reduction in bacterial loads in lungs and spleen upon semapimod treatment despite inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines clearly indicates bacterial dependence on host-derived exogenous leucine during intracellular growth. Therefore targeting L-leucine uptake can be a novel therapeutic strategy against TB.</p>
