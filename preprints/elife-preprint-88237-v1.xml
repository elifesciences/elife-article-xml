<title>Abstract</title>
<p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) containing intrinsically disordered domains undergo liquid-liquid phase separation to form nuclear bodies under stress conditions. This process is also connected to the misfolding and aggregation of RBPs, which are associated with a series of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains elusive how folding states of RBPs changes upon the formation and maturation of nuclear bodies. Here, we describe SNAP-tag based imaging methods to visualize the folding states of RBPs in live cells via time-resolved quantitative microscopic analyses of their micropolarity and microviscosity. Using these imaging methods in conjunction with immunofluorescence imaging, we demonstrate that RBPs, represented by TDP-43, initially enters the PML nuclear bodies in its native state upon transient proteostasis stress, albeit it begins to misfolded during prolonged stress. Furthermore, we show that heat shock protein 70 co-enters the PML nuclear bodies to prevent the degradation of TDP-43 from the proteotoxic stress, thus revealing a previously unappreciated protective role of the PML nuclear bodies in the prevention of stress-induced degradation of TDP-43. In summary, our imaging methods described in the manuscript, for the first time, reveal the folding states of RBPs, which were previously challenging to study with conventional methods in nuclear bodies of live cells. This study uncovers the mechanistic correlations between the folding states of a protein and functions of nuclear bodies, in particular PML bodies. We envision that the imaging methods can be generally applied to elucidating the structural aspects of other proteins that exhibit granular structures under biological stimulus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An emerging aspect in the structural organization of the cell nucleus is that a wide variety of cellular processes are organized by subnuclear compartments, collectively referred to as nuclear bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> Unlike other membrane-bound organelles, nuclear bodies are not membrane-bound, but able to remain coherent structures by assembling specific nuclear proteins and/or RNAs to initiate distinct biochemical functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> The example includes, but not limited to, nucleolus, nuclear speckle, nuclear stress body, paraspeckle, and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> Numerous studies have revealed that they exhibit dynamic properties and steadily exchange their components with the surrounding nucleoplasm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is an emerging body of evidence showing that these structures are formed and regulated by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A commonly shared feature of proteins that are associated with nuclear bodies is that they contain low complexity domains, which are intrinsically disordered and prone to misfolding and aggregation under stress in cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> In particular, the cell nucleus is rich with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that contain prion-like domains (PLDs), such as TDP-43, FUS, and TAF15.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> PLDs are low complexity domains enriched in uncharged polar amino acid residues with compositional similarity to yeast prion proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Misfolding and aggregations of such proteins have been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), demonstrating the importance of understanding the misfolding and aggregation of RBPs in cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> Nevertheless, despite considerable progress having been made in their purifications and structural characterizations, understanding their physiological and pathological behaviors of RBPs within live intact cells remains a challenge.</p>
<p>Recent studies indicate that several RBPs with PLDs are susceptible to environmental stresses or inhibition of signaling pathways, leading to the formation of nuclear puncta. For instance, TDP-43 has been shown to form granular structures in the nucleus under proteotoxic, oxidative, and heat stresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> Likewise, FUS has been reported to form granular structures in the nucleus upon inhibition of arginine methylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> While these findings suggest that RBPs are prone to form granular structures in response to stress, it remains unclear whether RBPs enter nuclear bodies in either native states or soluble misfolded oligomer states. This question led us to consider two working models of how RBPs enter nuclear bodies under stress (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). RBPs may enter nuclear bodies under transient stress either in their native states (Model 1) or in their soluble oligomer states (Model 2). After prolonged stress, the recruited RBPs may misfold and aggregate in nuclear bodies. However, it has been difficult to distinguish these models using conventional methods based on fluorescent protein fusion, because both native states and soluble oligomeric states exhibit diffuse fluorescent signal. Thus, these methods would result in the same signal change from diffuse to punctate in both models. Herein, we set out to test these models by utilizing the AggTag method that is developed in our labrotory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> Combined with multi-mode imaging strategies, this method allows us to visualize the folding states of RBPs and to estimate their micropolarity and microviscosity in live cells. We show that RBPs such as FUS and TAF15 enter the nucleolus without misfolding upon inhibition of methyltransferases. Similarly, upon proteotoxic stress, TDP-43 initially enters the PML nuclear bodies in a native state, although it begins to misfold in the nuclear bodies under prolonged stress. We further find that HSPA1A, a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, is involved in the association of TDP-43 with the PML nuclear bodies in a native state to prevent the degradation of TDP-43 from the proteotoxic stress. Taken together, our findings indicate that the PML nuclear bodies play a previously unknown protective role in the prevention of degradation of proteins against stresses.</p>

<title>RBPs with PLDs enter nuclear bodies by inhibition of specific cellular pathways</title>
<p>Previous studies have reported that bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)–copper (CuET) inhibits the p97 segregase pathway by targeting to its adaptor protein NPL4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> As the p97 segregase is a central component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, CuET treatment was shown to induce proteotoxic stress in cells, causing TDP-43 to form granular structures in the nucleus (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> In order to establish the identity of such granular structures, we generated a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cell line that can stably express SNAP-tag fused TDP-43 (SNAPf–TDP-43) by doxycycline induction, using the PiggyBac XLone system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> SNAP-tag, a small self-labeling protein tag that covalently and specifically reacts with <italic>O</italic><sup>6</sup>-benzylguanine (BG) moiety,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> was chosen to label RBPs due to its relatively small size and minimal perturbation on phase separation behaviors of RBPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>We hypothesized that TDP-43 may enter nuclear bodies upon proteotoxic stress induced by CuET. To test this, we performed immunofluorescence imaging experiments using antibodies against the nuclear body markers. After stably expressing SNAPf–TDP-43 by doxycycline treatment and labeling the fusion protein with SNAP-Cell Oregon Green, the cell line was further treated, or not, with CuET to induce the TDP-43 granular structures. Subsequently, the cell line was stained with the antibodies against several different nuclear body markers, including NPM1 (for the nucleolus), SFPQ (for the paraspeckles), HSF1 (for the nuclear stress bodies), PML (for the PML nuclear bodies), or SC35 (for the nuclear speckles) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1a</xref></bold>). After screening with several nuclear body markers, we identified that the TDP-43 granular structures were colocalized with PML (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref></bold>). Without CuET treatment, TDP-43 remained diffuse in the nucleus while PML formed nuclear foci that were indicative of the PML nuclear bodies. Upon treatment with CuET for 1 or 3 hours, TDP-43 formed the granular structures, and they were colocalized with PML. This result indicates that TDP-43 enters the PML nuclear bodies upon proteotoxic stress induced by CuET. On the other hand, the TDP-43 granular structures were not colocalized with SC35, HSF1, NPM1, or SFPQ, indicating that the recruitment of TDP-43 is specific to the PML nuclear bodies (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Figure S1b-c</xref></bold>). When we used Airyscan microscopy and z-stack analysis to confirm the colocalization, the PML nuclear bodies were found to reside in the core of the TDP-43 granular structures (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d-e</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Figure S2</xref></bold>). In addition, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we found that the initially formed TDP-43 granular structures by CuET treatment showed minimal fluorescence recovery following photobleaching. This suggests that upon incorporation into PML nuclear bodies, TDP-43 become immobile, possibly due to the specific and relatively strong interaction that form the PML nuclear bodies, in comparison to the non-specific, multivalency, and weak interactions used to form liquid droplets (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Figure S3</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adenosine dialdehyde (AdOx) has been used to indirectly inhibit a family of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> It has been shown that treatment with AdOx causes FUS to be in its hypomethylated states and to form nuclear granular structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> We then generated a doxycycline-inducible HEK293T cell line stably expressing SNAP-tag fused FUS (FUS–SNAPf), and conducted the same immunofluorescence imaging experiments using the antibodies against the nuclear body markers. After the cell line of FUS–SNAPf was pretreated with AdOx, doxycycline and SNAP-Cell Oregon Green were added to express and label the fusion protein. The cells were then stained with the antibodies against the different nuclear body markers (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4a</xref></bold>). Among several nuclear body markers, the FUS granular structures were found to be colocalized with NPM1 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref></bold>). While FUS remained diffuse in the nucleus when not pretreated with AdOx, pretreatment with AdOx caused FUS to form the granular structures that were colocalized with NPM1, but not with SC35, HSF1, PML, or SFPQ, indicating that FUS in its hypomethylated state only entered nucleolus (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4b-c</xref></bold>). The Airyscan and z-stack imaging experiments confirmed that FUS resided within the nucleolus in cells pretreated with AdOx (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Figure S5</xref></bold>). As revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, FUS and NPM1 exhibited dynamic properties in the nucleolus, suggesting that the phase separation of FUS may mediate the entering of FUS to the nucleolus (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Figure S6</xref></bold>). Given the structural similarity among the RBP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> we then chose TAF15 to investigate the identity of its nuclear body formation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Figure S7a</xref></bold>). As expected, we found that the TAF15 granular structures were colocalized with NPM1 among several different nuclear body markers in cells that were pretreated with AdOx (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7b-c</xref></bold>). This result indicates that, similar to FUS, TAF15 also enters the nucleolus when pretreated with AdOx. This was further confirmed by the Airyscan and z-stack imaging experiments, showing that TAF15 resided inside the nucleolus when cells were pretreated with AdOx (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8</xref></bold>). Taken together, these results indicate that when specific cellular pathways are inhibited by chemicals, RBPs with PLDs enter nuclear bodies, such as PML nuclear bodies for TDP-43 and the nucleolus for FUS and TAF15.</p>

<title>Triple-color imaging assay visualizes folding states of TDP-43 entering the PML nuclear bodies during proteotoxic stress</title>
<p>While the conventional methods to visualize RBPs can monitor their localization into the nuclear bodies during cellular stress, they do not reveal whether the nuclear bodies recruit RBPs in native or misfolded oligomeric states because both states can exhibit diffuse characteristics in cells. In this regard, we set out to investigate the folding states of the RBPs when they initially enter the nuclear bodies under stress conditions. To this end, we utilized the previously reported AggTag method to monitor the misfolding and aggregation of a protein of interest (POI) by a turn-on of fluorescence in live cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> In this method, an environment-sensitive fluorophore is conjugated to the POI via a self-labeling protein tag, and it remains fluorescently quenched when POI is folded. The formation of misfolded oligomers and insoluble aggregates of POI then buries the fluorophore in the aggregates to elicit its turn-on of fluorescence.</p>
<p>To utilize the AggTag method in visualizing the folding states of SNAP-tag fused TDP-43 in live cells, we synthesized three SNAP-tag substrates (<bold>P0</bold>, <bold>P1</bold>, and <bold>P2</bold>) and devised a triple-color imaging assay (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref></bold>). <bold>P0</bold> contains 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin whose blue emission is constitutive, reporting RBPs in all the conformational states. <bold>P1</bold> contains a molecular rotor derived from the Kaede chromophore, which is previously reported to activate its red fluorescence in response to soluble misfolded oligomers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> <bold>P2</bold> contains a molecular rotor derived from the green fluorescent chromophore which is previously shown to activate its green fluorescence toward insoluble oligomers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> Thus, in this triple-color imaging assay, we expected that proteins in native states could be visualized by <bold>P0</bold> fluorescence but no <bold>P1</bold> or <bold>P2</bold> fluorescence, whereas soluble oligomers and insoluble aggregates of RBPs could be detected by a sequential appearance of <bold>P1</bold> and <bold>P2</bold> fluorescence, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref></bold>). <bold>P1</bold> and <bold>P2</bold> are spectrally orthogonal, and the viscosity sensitivity values of <bold>P1</bold> and <bold>P2</bold> were determined to be 0.20 and 0.54, which are comparable to those of the previously reported chromophores (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Figure S9</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup></p>

<p>As previously reported, treatment with CuET causes proteotoxic stress in cells, as supported by the western blot analysis of the cell lysates treated with CuET using anti-polyubiquitin antibody (linkage-specific K48) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> We then conducted the triple-color imaging assay to test whether TDP-43 enters the PML nuclear bodies in native or misfolded oligomer states upon proteotoxic stress. The SNAPf–TDP-43 stable cell line was treated with doxycycline and the identical concentrations of the triple probes (<bold>P0</bold>, <bold>P1</bold>, and <bold>P2</bold>) for its inducible expression and equal labeling, respectively. After 24 hours, the cells were treated with CuET for different time periods and subsequently visualized by confocal microscopy.</p>
<p>In the absence of CuET, cells exhibited nuclear diffuse fluorescence from <bold>P0</bold>, but no fluorescence from <bold>P1</bold> or <bold>P2</bold>, indicating that TDP-43 remains in its native state in the absence of stress (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>, (-) CuET panel). In cells treated with CuET for 30 minutes to an hour, we observed that the diffuse <bold>P0</bold> fluorescence started to convert its punctate fluorescence, indicating the recruitment of TDP-43 into the nuclear bodies induced by CuET. Interestingly, we did not observe significant increase in <bold>P1</bold> or <bold>P2</bold> fluorescence (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>, (+) CuET, 0.5 h and 1 h panels). These imaging results suggest that, although CuET induces proteotoxic stress that causes protein misfolding, TDP-43 may stay in its native state at least initially while entering into the nuclear bodies. When we treated the cells with CuET for the longer time of 3 or 8 hours, we observed that they exhibited punctate <bold>P1</bold> fluorescence that was colocalized with punctate <bold>P0</bold> fluorescence (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref></bold>, (+) CuET, 3 h and 8 h panels). These observations suggest that the recruited TDP-43 may undergo misfolding within the nuclear bodies under persistent stress. The overall triple-color imaging assay results for TDP-43 led us to suggest that TDP-43 may stay in its native state during entering the PML nuclear bodies by transient stress for 30 minutes to an hour, albeit persistent stress longer than 3 hours may cause TDP-43 to misfold within the nuclear bodies (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>FLIM imaging assays estimate micropolarity and microviscosity of TDP-43 entering PML nuclear bodies during proteotoxic stress</title>
<p>The triple color imaging assay is based on measuring the fluorescence intensity of molecular rotors by conventional confocal microscopy. However, relying on fluorescence intensity changes may cause biased results, as the fluorescence intensity can also be affected by several parameters, including the local concentration changes of fluorescent species, photobleaching, and laser intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Thus, we turned to using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), an imaging technique to measure the fluorescence lifetime of individual fluorophores at each pixel of an image.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> As the fluorescence lifetime is dependent on the environment of a fluorophore but not dependent on external factors, we reasoned that FLIM would be more robust and quantitative than the intensity-based method to study folding states of RBPs in live cells. In particular, by utilizing an environment-sensitive fluorophore that is either polarity- or viscosity-sensitive, we envisioned to establish a FLIM imaging assay that is able to estimate the local micropolarity or microviscosity of RBPs in live cells, respectively. This would also allow us to confirm the results from the triple-color imaging assay, as soluble misfolded oligomers have lower micropolarity and higher microviscosity than proteins in their native states.</p>
<p>To design the FLIM imaging assay for estimating the local micropolarity of RBPs, we synthesized a new SNAP-tag substrate, <bold>P3</bold>, which contains 7-dimethylamino-4-sulfamonyl-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (SBD) fluorophore (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref></bold>). The SBD is a solvatochromic fluorophore whose lifetime is sensitive to the polarity of the local microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> To correlate its fluorescence lifetime with dielectric constant, the fluorescence lifetimes of <bold>P3</bold> were measured in several different organic solvents with various dielectric constants by FLIM (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Figure S10</xref></bold>). As the dielectric constant of the solvent tested decreased from 33 (ethylene glycol) to 12.5 (tert-butanol), the fluorescence lifetime of <bold>P3</bold> in solutions linearly increased from 2.72 ns to 7.85 ns. This result confirmed its polarity-dependent fluorescence lifetime and provided a correlation equation, which enabled us to estimate the local micropolarity of RBPs in live cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref></bold>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then performed the FLIM imaging assay with <bold>P3</bold> to estimate the local micropolarity of TDP-43 during proteotoxic stress by CuET. To this end, the stable cell line of SNAPf–TDP-43 was treated with doxycycline and <bold>P3</bold> for the inducible expression and labeling of the fusion protein by the probe. After treating with CuET for different time periods, we subsequently conducted the FLIM imaging experiments under live cell settings (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Figure S11a</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs15">S15a</xref></bold>). A prediction from this assay was that if TDP-43 remains in their native state upon stress, the micropolarity of TDP-43 would not significantly change before and after the stress. On the other hand, its micropolarity would start to decrease considerably when TDP-43 becomes misfolded due to the exposure of hydrophobic residues during misfolding. In cells that were not treated with CuET, the average fluorescence lifetime of <bold>P3</bold> was determined to be 5.13 ± 0.26 ns (n = 19 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Figure S11</xref></bold>), which corresponds to the dielectric constant value of 27.3 ± 1.2, consistent to the notion that the surface of a folded globular protein exhibits dielectric constant of ∼30 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c-e</xref></bold>). Upon treatment with CuET for 30 minutes and an hour, its average lifetimes were calculated to be 5.67 ± 0.24 ns (n = 16 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Figure S12</xref></bold>) and 6.06 ± 0.16 ns (n = 19 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Figure S13</xref></bold>), corresponding to the dielectric constants of 24.7 ± 1.1 and 22.9 ± 0.8, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c-e</xref></bold>). These results are compatible with our triple-color imaging assay suggesting that TDP-43 may remain in its native state by the transient stress of CuET, as the micropolarity of TDP-43 was not significantly changed at these time points. On the other hand, when the cells were treated with CuET for the longer duration of 3 and 8 hours, the lifetime of <bold>P3</bold> further increased to 6.81 ± 0.32 ns (n = 21 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Figure S14</xref></bold>) and 8.33 ± 0.22 ns (n = 23 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs15">Figure S15</xref></bold>), which were converted into the dielectric constants of 19.2 ± 1.5 and 12.0 ± 1.0, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c-e</xref></bold>). While these lifetime values were still lower than the lifetime value (10.7 ns) obtained from the insoluble aggregates of purified <bold>P3</bold>•SNAPf–TDP-43 conjugates (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs16">Figure S16</xref></bold>), these results indicate that as the duration of CuET treatment increases, the local micropolarity of TDP-43 decreases, and agrees with the triple color imaging assay data suggesting that TDP-43 may begin to misfold upon prolonged treatment with CuET.</p>
<p>To enable the FLIM imaging assay to estimate the local microviscosity of RBPs, we also synthesized a SNAP-tag substrate, <bold>P4</bold>, that contains phenyl-substituted boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) molecular rotor whose lifetime is known to be dependent on the local microviscosity (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref></bold>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> To generate a calibration curve between its lifetime and viscosity, the lifetimes of <bold>P4</bold> were measured in binary mixtures of glycerol and ethylene glycol at different volume fractions whose viscosity values are previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> The lifetime of <bold>P4</bold> increased from 1.52 ns to 3.82 ns when the glycerol contents increased from 60% (corresponding to the viscosity of 140 cP) to 100 % (corresponding to the viscosity of 947 cP) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs17">Figure S17</xref></bold>), confirming its viscosity-dependent lifetime. By plotting and fitting the data, a correlation was derived to estimate the local microviscosity of RBPs in live cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We then carried out the FLIM imaging assay using <bold>P4</bold> to predict the local microviscosity of TDP-43 when the cells were under proteotoxic stress. To conduct the imaging assay, SNAPf–TDP-43 was stably expressed in the presence of <bold>P4</bold> for its labeling, and then the cell line was treated with CuET for different time periods (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs18">Figure S18a</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs22">S22a</xref></bold>). Without CuET treatment, the average lifetime of <bold>P4</bold> was calculated to be 2.79 ± 0.06 ns (n = 22 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs18">Figure S18</xref></bold>), which was equivalent to the viscosity of 415 ± 22 cP (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h-j</xref></bold>). In cells that were treated with CuET for 30 minutes and an hour, its average lifetimes were determined to be 2.84 ± 0.04 ns (n = 21 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs19">Figure S19</xref></bold>) and 2.86 ± 0.03 ns (n = 17 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs20">Figure S20</xref></bold>), corresponding to the viscosity values of 431 ± 15 cP and 439 ± 12 cP, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h-j</xref></bold>). Because the microviscosity of TDP-43 was not considerably changed before and after CuET treatment to an hour, these results are consistent with our triple-color imaging assay suggesting that TDP-43 may remain in its native state by the transient stress of CuET. On the other hand, when the cell line was further treated with CuET for the longer duration of 3 and 8 hours, the average lifetimes of <bold>P4</bold> increased to 3.08 ± 0.03 ns (n = 24 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs21">Figure S21</xref></bold>) and 3.26 ± 0.05 cP (n = 22 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs22">Figure S22</xref></bold>), respectively. These lifetime values were converted into the viscosity values of 530 ± 11 cP and 610 ± 24 cP, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h-j</xref></bold>), and they were still lower than the lifetime value (3.5 ns) obtained from the insoluble aggregates of purified <bold>P4</bold>•SNAPf–TDP-43 conjugates (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs23">Figure S23</xref></bold>). Because misfolded proteins have higher microviscosity than proteins in their native states,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> this suggests that TDP-43 may become misfolded by the prolonged stress of CuET. Taken together, the overall results from the triple-color and FLIM imaging assays for TDP-43 suggest that TDP-43 may remain in its native state when initially entering PML nuclear bodies by transient stress, while persistent stress may lead to misfolding of TDP-43 in the nuclear bodies.</p>

<title>FUS and TAF15 enter the nucleolus in their native states upon inhibition of methyltransferases</title>
<p>The earlier triple-color and FLIM imaging assays with the SNAPf–TDP-43 stable cell line suggest that TDP-43 may stay in its native state when initially entering the nuclear bodies. We then sought to examine whether this observation is generalizable to other RBPs entering nuclear bodies by asking what the folding states of FUS and TAF15 are when they enter the nucleolus. To this end, we used the stable cell line of SNAP-tag fused FUS or TAF15 to conduct the triple-color and FLIM imaging assays with or without AdOx pretreatment (experimental procedures depicted in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs24">Figure S24a</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs27">S27a</xref></bold>). In the absence of AdOx, the cell line stably expressing FUS–SNAPf exhibited diffuse <bold>P0</bold> fluorescence but no <bold>P1</bold> or <bold>P2</bold> fluorescence, indicating that FUS remains in its native state outside the nucleolus (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref></bold>, left panel).

The observed lack of <bold>P1</bold> fluorescence indicates that FUS may enter the nucleolus in its native state when the cells are pretreated with AdOx.

<p>In the FUS–SNAPf cell line labeled by <bold>P3</bold>, its fluorescence lifetimes were 4.10 ± 0.19 ns (n = 18 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs24">Figure S24</xref></bold>) without AdOx pretreatment, and 4.22 ± 0.18 ns (n = 20 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs25">Figure S25</xref></bold>) with AdOx pretreatment. These corresponded to the dielectric constant values of 32.2 ± 0.9 without AdOx pretreatment and 31.6 ± 0.8 with AdOx pretreatment, indicating that there was no significant difference in the dielectric constant of FUS between whether or not it entered the nucleolus (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b-d</xref></bold>). Furthermore, when <bold>P4</bold> was used for the FLIM imaging assay, its average lifetime values were calculated to be 2.63 ± 0.05 ns (n = 19 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs26">Figure S26</xref></bold>) without AdOx pretreatment, and 2.71 ± 0.05 ns (n = 17 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs27">Figure S27</xref></bold>) with AdOx pretreatment.

Consistent with the result using <bold>P3</bold>, the microviscosity of FUS was not significantly different between whether or not it entered the nucleolus.

<p>We then conducted the same imaging assays for TAF15 to examine what the folding state of TAF15 is when entering the nucleolus. In cells stably expressing SNAPf–TAF15 that were labeled by the triple probes (<bold>P0</bold>, <bold>P1</bold>, and <bold>P2</bold>), no significant fluorescence from either <bold>P1</bold> or <bold>P2</bold> was observed while <bold>P0</bold> was used to visualize TAF15 both in the presence and absence of AdOx (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h</xref></bold>). This result indicates that TAF15 may stay in its native state when entering the nucleolus, as adjudged by the lack of <bold>P1</bold> and <bold>P2</bold> fluorescence. In addition, the average fluorescence lifetimes of <bold>P3</bold> in the cell line stably expressing SNAPf–TAF15 were determined to be 4.94 ± 0.14 ns (n = 18 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs28">Figure S28</xref></bold>) without AdOx pretreatment, and 5.06 ± 0.12 ns (n = 16 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs29">Figure S29</xref></bold>) with AdOx pretreatment, corresponding the dielectric constant values of 28.2 ± 0.7 and 27.6 ± 0.6, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4i-k</xref></bold>). The average lifetimes of <bold>P4</bold> in the cell line stably expressing SNAPf–TAF15 were 2.60 ± 0.06 ns (n = 21 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs30">Figure S30</xref></bold>) without AdOx pretreatment, and 2.60 ± 0.04 ns (n = 19 cells, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs31">Figure S31</xref></bold>) with AdOx pretreatment, corresponding the viscosity values of 356 ± 18 cP and 356 ± 13 cP, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4l-n</xref></bold>). As there were no significant changes in the micropolarity and microviscosity of TAF15 upon pretreatment with AdOx, these results support our interpretation that TAF15 may enter the nucleolus in its native state.</p>

<title>Molecular chaperons mediate entering of TDP-43 into nuclear bodies to prevent their degradation under stress</title>
<p>The results from the imaging assays raised a question of how misfolding-prone TDP-43 remains its native state when entering the nuclear bodies. We postulated that molecular chaperons would be involved in keeping TDP-43 in its native state while entering the nuclear bodies under stress, as they are known to stabilize protein from misfolding and aggregation and thus to protect the proteome against stress. In support of this view, previous proteomics studies have shown that TDP-43 is constitutively bound to heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and 40 (DNAJ) chaperon families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> Furthermore, recent studies have reported that certain members of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), including HSPA1A, were found together with TDP-43 within the nuclear bodies induced by heat stress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> mutations on the RNA-binding domains of TDP-43,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> or by oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this regard, we conducted an immunofluorescence analysis using an anti-HSPA1A antibody in the stable cells expressing SNAPf–TDP-43 upon treatment with CuET to ask whether the TDP-43 granular structures contain endogenous HSPA1A. After the cell line was treated with doxycycline and SNAP-Cell Oregon Green to induce its expression and labeling, it was further treated, or not, with CuET, and then stained with the anti-HSPA1A antibody. Without CuET treatment, both TDP-43 and HSPA1A remained diffuse. However, upon treatment with CuET for 1 or 3 hours, the granular structures of TDP-43 were well colocalized with those of HSPA1A that were formed (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref></bold>). We further confirmed the colocalization by co-expressing EBFP– HSPA1A in the cell line expressing SNAPf–TDP-43 that was labeled by SNAP-Cell Oregon Green. Using Airyscan and intensity profile analysis, it was found that the granular signals of TDP-43 were well-overlapped with those of HSPA1A, while the PML nuclear bodies still resided in the core of the TDP-43 granular structures (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b-c</xref></bold>). In addition, members of DNAJA family, including DNAJA1 and DNAJA2, were found to colocalize with the TDP-43 granular structures formed by the proteotoxic stress when co-expressed (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d-e</xref></bold>). These observations indicate that the proteotoxic stress by CuET leads to the co-recruitment of TDP-43 and heat shock proteins into the PML nuclear bodies, and further suggest that heat shock proteins may keep TDP-43 in its native state when entering the nuclear bodies during the stress.</p>

</fig>
<p>Given the known protective role of HSPA1A,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> we further hypothesized that HSPA1A would prevent the degradation of TDP-43 that was caused by the proteotoxic stress. To test this hypothesis, we conducted pulse-chase experiments with the stable cells expressing SNAPf–TDP-43 to measure the half-lives of TDP-43 under different conditions. To this end, we utilized SNAP-Cell block, which is the blocking agent for SNAP-tag to irreversibly inactivate its labeling. After stably expressing SNAPf–TDP-43 and labeling with SNAP-Cell TMR star for 24 hours (pulse), we treated SNAP-Cell block for an hour to block the further labeling of newly synthesized fusion proteins before treating with CuET for different time periods (chase). The level of the fusion protein was then analyzed at each time point of CuET treatment by in-gel fluorescence scanning.</p>
<p>The TMR-labeled SNAPf–TDP-43 was degraded upon treatment with CuET, and its level decreased to approximately 50% in 3 hours after CuET treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f-g</xref></bold>). Using this as a control, we conducted the same pulse-chase experiment but overexpressed HSPA1A at the same time while expressing SNAPf–TDP-43, to ask whether the overexpression of HSPA1A affects the half-life of TDP-43 during the proteotoxic stress. When HSPA1A was overexpressed, the level of the TMR-labeled SNAPf–TDP-43 declined to about 60% in 3 hours after CuET treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f-g</xref></bold>). The slightly slower degradation of TDP-43 by the HSPA1A overexpression than in control indicates that the HSPA1A expression level affects the half-life of TDP-43 under the proteotoxic stress.</p>
<p>We further examined the half-life of TDP-43 when HSP70 was inhibited during the proteotoxic stress. To this end, we performed the same pulse-chase experiment but pretreating with VER155008, an ATPase inhibitor for the HSP70 family,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> at 2 hours before blocking the SNAP-tag labeling. To our surprise, the level of the labeled TDP-43 significantly declined after treatment with CuET in the cells pretreated with VER155008, leading to approximately 20% of labeled TDP-43 analyzed in 3 hours after treatment with CuET (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f-g</xref></bold>). The much faster degradation of TDP-43 under the proteotoxic stress supports the hypothesis that HSPA1A may prevent the TDP-43 degradation during the proteotoxic stress. Overall, the results indicate that the recruitment of TDP-43 and HSPA1A to the nuclear bodies may play a role in protecting TDP-43 from its degradation by the proteotoxic stress.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we aimed to answer the questions of what the folding states of the RBPs are when they associate with nuclear bodies in mammalian cells under stress conditions, and what function the nuclear bodies play in the maintenance of these proteins. Based on what is known in literature, we first devised the two working models of how RBPs enters the nuclear bodies under stress (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref></bold>). In the first model, RBPs may be initially recruited into the nuclear bodies in their native states by transient stress, and then they may be converted into their soluble oligomers under persistent stress. This model was supported by studies showing that the initially-formed, liquid-like compartments of RBPs were converted to their solid-like compartments that are reminiscent of protein aggregates in vitro or under persistent cellular stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> In the second model, RBPs may be initially sequestered into the nuclear bodies in their soluble oligomer states upon transient stress via multi-step protein aggregation process. This was supported by studies showing that the RBPs with PLDs were susceptible to misfolding and aggregation by cellular stresses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and the solid-like, stable core assemblies were observed at the early stage of the stress granule formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, with the currently available methods, it has been extremely challenging to address the question regarding the folding states of the proteins in live cells. Conventional techniques to study a protein associated with the nuclear bodies of live cells typically involve the genetic fusion of the protein to a fluorescent protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> While this method can monitor accumulation of the proteins to the nuclear bodies in live cells, it is unclear whether the proteins remain in their native states or soluble misfolded oligomer states in the nuclear bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> To overcome the limitation, we have established new imaging assays to visualize folding states of RBPs live cells with confocal microscopy and to estimate their micropolarity and microviscosity with FLIM through the synthesis of a series of SNAP-tag substrates. We have demonstrated that our imaging methods can provide efficient means to test the models in live cells. Changes in the protein folding states from native to soluble oligomer states were accompanied with the corresponding changes of fluorescence intensity or lifetime of the probes conjugated to the proteins in the nuclear bodies of live cells. In particular, the approach using FLIM provided the additional advantage of not affecting external factors, such as the local concentration of a fluorophore or laser power.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using such imaging techniques, we have shown that our results were most compatible with the first model. Our results in the triple-color imaging assay with the SNAPf–TDP-43 stable cell line showed that neither <bold>P1</bold> nor <bold>P2</bold> did not turn on their fluorescence during which TDP-43 enters the PML nuclear bodies initially (at 0.5 – 1 h after CuET treatment), and <bold>P1</bold> exhibited an increase in its fluorescence intensity only after prolonged treatment with CuET longer than 3 hours (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). In agreement with these results, our FLIM imaging assays with <bold>P3</bold> and <bold>P4</bold> showed that the micropolarity and microviscosity of TDP-43 did not significantly alter at the early time points of CuET treatment, while the prolonged treatment with CuET led to considerable changes in its micropolarity and microviscosity (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). We further showed that the heat shock proteins were involved in the recruitment of TDP-43 to the PML nuclear bodies to prevent the degradation of TDP-43 by the proteotoxic stress, suggesting the previously unknown protective role of the nuclear bodies (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref></bold>). To explain the combined results, we propose that TDP-43 enters the PML nuclear bodies initially in a native state upon proteotoxic stress. Prolonged stress may lead to the misfolding of TDP-43 in the nuclear bodies, possibly because it could exhaust the capacity of heat shock proteins to protect TDP-43 from the stress (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref></bold>). In the case of FUS and TAF15, the triple color imaging assay revealed that there was no appreciable turning on of fluorescence from <bold>P1</bold> and <bold>P2</bold> before and after they entered the nucleolus by AdOx (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). Using the FLIM assay, as assessed by the lifetimes of <bold>P3</bold> and <bold>P4</bold>, we found that the micropolarity and microviscosity of these proteins did not significantly change before and after incorporation to the nucleolus (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). We interpret these results to propose that FUS and TAF15 enter the nucleolus in their native states upon inhibition of methyltransferases (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref></bold>).</p>

<caption><title>Proposed models for how RBPs behave under stress.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Upon proteotoxic stress, TDP-43 may enter the PML nuclear bodies in its native state together with heat shock proteins, including HSPA1A and DNAJA1/2. As such, the PML nuclear bodies may play a protective role in preventing the degradation of TDP-43 under transient stress. However, the protective effect may have limited capacity that can be overwhelmed by prolonged stress, resulting in misfolding of TDP-43 within the PML nuclear bodies.

<p>Our imaging methods described in this study revealed, for the first time, the folding states of RBPs in the nuclear bodies in live cells, and they can potentially contribute to this field of research. It has been shown that the Hsp40 proteins phase separate into nuclear bodies to chaperones proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> In particular, DNAJB1 accumulates in the ubiquitin-rich nuclear bodies, and DNAJA1 is found in nucleoli. We envision that the presented imaging methods can further be extended to studying how chaperones affect the folding states of other RBPs with PLDs and their diseases-liked mutants. Other than TDP-43, FUS, and TAF15, more than 70 human RBPs have been identified to contain PLDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, their ALS-linked mutations have been shown to significantly affect the biochemical properties of the full-length proteins, such as increased misfolding and aggregation propensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup> Thus, we expect that there will be ALS-associated mutants of the RBPs that can follow the second model; they enter the nuclear bodies in soluble oligomer states when cells are stressed. In this case, the misfolded RBPs could diffuse in nucleus at the beginning of stress before the incorporation into the nuclear bodies, which could be visualized and measured by our imaging assays. Collectively, this work provides new insight into the structural aspects of RBPs that were previously challenging to obtain with conventional methods in live cells.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we design and apply SNAP-tag based imaging assays to probe the folding states of RBPs entering the nuclear bodies in live cells. The presented imaging methods were applied for three different RBPs, TDP-43, FUS and TAF15. Our imaging assay results for TDP-43 indicate that transient proteotoxic stress up to an hour causes TDP-43 to enter the PML nuclear bodies in its native state, while prolonged proteotoxic stress longer than 3 hours leads to its misfolding within the PML nuclear bodies. The imaging assay results for FUS and TAF15 show that they remain in their native states in the nucleolus upon inhibition of methyltransferases. In addition, we found that the TDP-43 nuclear puncta were colocalized with heat shock proteins, including HSPA1A, a member of HSP70 that played a role in preventing its degradation under stress. The combined results suggest that the PML nuclear bodies may play a protective role with the help of HSPA1A against transient stress by temporarily storing TDP-43 in its native states, but the prolonged stress exhausted the capacity of heat shock proteins, resulting in the misfolding of TDP-43. We envision that the presented imaging approach can be applied to other RBPs and nuclear bodies to offer the potential for studying correlations between the folding states of RBPs and functions of nuclear bodies.</p>

<p>This study presents a novel fluorescence based imaging strategy to investigate the folding status of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their association with molecular chaperones under stress. It provides <bold>fundamental</bold> findings that will potentially advance our understanding in the folding and aggregation status of RBPs in nuclear stress bodies in a significant manner. However, there is also the concern that the evidence regarding protein fate is <bold>incomplete</bold> and additional controls are needed to fully support the conclusion. The imaging methodology can be adapted to study many other proteins that undergo liquid-liquid phase separation under specific cellular conditions.</p>

<p>This manuscript sets out to implement a multi-stage fluorescence imaging essay to test two working models in understanding the folding states of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in stress-induced nuclear bodies. In conjunction with live-cell fluorescence lifetime imaging, the authors revealed and conformed a previously unclear phenomenon that the RBPs investigated in this work initially enter the nuclear bodies in native state in transient stress and then begin to misfold after prolonged stress. Comparing to conventional methods, the imaging strategy reported in this work is unique, comprehensive, and effective in surveying all three-stages (native, soluble oligomer, aggregates) of folding states for RBPs in one shot. Using this strategy, the authors then found that the heat shock protein 70 may protects RBPs from being degraded under stress. The manuscript is very well-written.</p>

<p>The authors combine the use of fluorogenic tools with fluorescence bioimaging to visualize how changes in the folding states of the RBPs TDP-43, FUS and TAF15 affect their subcellular localization and recruitment inside nuclear bodies, as well as protein fate. While the development of SNAP-tag substrates coupled with confocal microscopy in living cells (including FLIM) to monitor changes in protein folding states represents an important conceptual and technical advance for the field, I am not convinced that the authors fully achieved their aim. The authors cannot conclude on protein fate only based on the experiments performed here. Showing a correlation between a decrease in TDP-43 levels upon Hsp70 inhibition and colocalization at nuclear bodies with Hsp70 and DNAJA2 is not supporting their conclusion about protein degradation. A number of additional control experiments are needed to support their claims.</p>
<p>Yet, the optimization of these methods has unlimited potential since it may provide new ways to visualize and monitor a large variety of fundamental intracellular processes, including protein aggregation and fate.</p>

<p>This manuscript presents a novel fluorescence toolkit designed for investigating the folding states of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their association with molecular chaperones during liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the formation of nuclear bodies under stress. The strategy is to use SNAP-tag technology including cell lines stably expressing three model proteins fused with SNAP tag and a series of environmentally sensitive fluorophores that can selectively label on the SNAP proteins. The changes in the microenvironment such as microviscosity and micropolarity can be well characterized by these fluorophores to reflect the conformational states of the RBPs.</p>
<p>The strength of this method is that the SNAP protein is smaller than classic fluorescent proteins like GFP and thus its impact on the conformation and behavior of the targeted proteins is much smaller. The experiment is carefully designed and well thought-out. Overall, this work is of very high quality.</p>
<p>This method can thus be adapted by other protein systems to study the LLPS process and thus I believe it will be of great interest to cell biologists and biophysicists.</p>
