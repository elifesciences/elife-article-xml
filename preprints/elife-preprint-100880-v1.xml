<title>Abstract</title><p>The larval zebrafish is a vertebrate model for <italic>in vivo</italic> monitoring and manipulation of whole-brain neuronal activities. Tracing its neural circuits still remains challenging. Here we report an applicable methodology tailored for larval zebrafish to achieve efficient retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing from genetically defined neurons via EnvA-pseudotyped glycoprotein-deleted rabies viruses. By combinatorially optimizing multiple factors involved, we identified the CVS strain trans-complemented with advanced expression of N2cG at 36°C as the optimal combination. It yielded a tracing efficiency of up to 20 inputs per starter cell. Its low cytotoxicity enabled the viable labeling and calcium imaging of infected neurons 10 days post-infection, spanning larval ages commonly used for functional examination. Cre-dependent labeling was further developed to enable input cell-type-specific tracing and circuit reconstruction. We mapped cerebellar circuits and uncovered the ipsilateral preference and subtype specificity of granule cell-to-Purkinje cell connections. Our method offers an efficient way for tracing neural circuits in larval zebrafish.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Given the small transparent brain and accessible genetic manipulations, the larval zebrafish has been emerging as a promising animal model for systems neuroscience. Large-scale molecular, light- and electron-microscopical (LM and EM) morphological, and physiological datasets have been gathered over the past decade to decipher the identity and connectivity of its whole-brain cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Whole-brain neurons’ activities can be monitored and manipulated in awake as well as behaving zebrafish larvae, providing an unprecedented research paradigm for dissecting neural mechanisms of brain functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Further mechanistic insights into the roles of different cell types in brain-wide activities requires effective tools for dissecting underlying neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Virus-based tracing tools have opened new avenues for disentangling neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Among them, the EnvA-pseudotyped glycoprotein (G)-deleted rabies virus (RV) (RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA]) has achieved most success<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Its success derives from being a native retrograde transsynaptic tracer engineered for cell-type-specific targeting through the recognition between EnvA and its receptor TVA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and crossing only one synaptic step via trans-complementation of rabies G<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This tool has revolutionized the structural analysis of neural circuits in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and has been continually evolved to adapt to functional studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, its application in other species including zebrafish is retarded due to lack of tailored methodologies.</p>
<p>The G-deleted RV (RV<italic>d</italic>G) infection of neurons in zebrafish was first demonstrated in 2009. Ten years later, RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] was applied to trace input neurons in the adult zebrafish cerebellum, but the efficiency showed very low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Recently, the herpes simplex virus (HSV1) was used as a helper virus to deliver TVA and rabies G, leading to an increased efficiency of around one input per starter neuron in the brain of adult zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. For larval zebrafish, efforts have been focused on the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), another rhabdovirus similar to RV but with anterograde spread<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, these reported VSV tools for larval zebrafish appeared relatively high cytotoxicity and have not been iterated to utilize the EnvA-TVA system to achieve initial infection specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Therefore, developing applicable efficient viral tracing methods is still an important mission in the field, and will boost the application of larval zebrafish in systems neuroscience research.</p>
<p>In the present study, we established applicable methodologies to implement RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] for efficient retrograde trans-monosynaptic tracing from genetically defined neurons in larval zebrafish. We first demonstrated that the transient co-expression of the helper proteins TVA and rabies G in specific neurons through one-cell-stage microinjection of the GAL-UAS binary DNA plasmids could successfully help the RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] microinjected later on to infect and spread from targeted starter cells. This simple two-round microinjection procedure ensures the high feasibility of our method. Then via practicing in the cerebellar circuit, we iteratively tested key factors that influence the tracing efficiency and cytotoxicity, which include the virus strain, G protein type, G expression level, and working temperature. We discovered an optimal combinatory condition: CVSdG trans-complemented with advanced expression of N2cG at 36°C. The optimality lies in the high tracing efficiency and low cytotoxicity, embodied by a 20-fold increase in efficiency compared to previous studies in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and a long enough time window (final fish age up to 2 - 3 weeks old) for conducting functional studies in larval zebrafish. Furthermore, by using Cre-expressing RV<italic>d</italic>G, we developed a transgenic reporter framework to enable input cell-type-specific tracing and circuit reconstruction based on single-neuron morphology. As an application demonstration, we applied the method to map the monosynaptic inputs to Purkinje cells (PCs) from granule cells (GCs) in the cerebellum and revealed the wiring relationship between morphological subtypes of GCs and PCs. These endeavors prove the applicability and efficiency of our method in dissecting interested circuits in larval zebrafish.</p>

<title>Implementation of RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA]-based neural circuit tracing in larval zebrafish</title>
<p>To implement RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA]-based retrograde tracing in larval zebrafish, we first verified that larval zebrafish themselves do not express endogenous TVA. In wild type (WT) larvae without exogenous TVA expression, the injected SAD<italic>d</italic>G-mCherry[EnvA], a type of RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA], did not infect any cells (<xref rid="fig1-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The observed mCherry-positive puncta co-localized with microglia (<xref rid="fig1-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting the clearance of uninfected virus particles by microglia. These data demonstrate that, similar to mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, zebrafish do not express endogenous TVA.</p>
<p>Then we specifically expressed TVA in neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">B</xref>), and found that injected SAD<italic>d</italic>G-mCherry[EnvA] infected TVA-expressing cells around the injection site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>, dashed yellow circles). The targeted expression of TVA and the fluorescent indicator enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in neurons was achieved through transient transgene of GAL4-UAS constructs in which the GAL4 activator is driven by <italic>elavl3</italic>, a pan-neuronal marker in zebrafish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, and “<italic>UGT</italic>” in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). As the G protein is necessary for viral spread, SAD<italic>d</italic>G-mCherry[EnvA] did not spread beyond the initially infected neurons (i.e. starter cells) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C,E-G</xref>).</p>

<p>We next examined whether viral particles can spread to other cells by complementing the G protein in starter neurons. As the efficiency of virus spread is reported to be positively correlated with the level of G expression in starter neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, we generated two helper plasmids, <italic><underline>U</underline>AS:E<underline>G</underline>FP-P2A-<underline>T</underline>VA-T2A-<underline>B</underline>19G</italic> (<italic>UGTB</italic>) and <italic><underline>U</underline>AS:E<underline>G</underline>FP-P2A-<underline>B</underline>19G-T2A-<underline>T</underline>VA</italic> (<italic>UGBT</italic>), to search for a plasmid design with higher G expression while ensuring the co-expression of TVA and G (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, see Methods). The position of the RV G-protein-coding gene SAD B19G was varied in the tri-cistronic 2A constructs for adjusting its expression level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, besides starter cells (EGFP<sup>+</sup> and mCherry<sup>+</sup>, dashed yellow circles) and uninfected TVA-expressing cells (EGFP<sup>+</sup> only), we observed mCherry<sup>+</sup> only cells (arrows) of which the number increased over time, indicating the virus spread beyond the starter cells by trans-complementation with G. Notably, the traced cells included both neurons and radial glia (hereafter referred to as glia) identified by their distinct morphology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, red and gray arrows, respectively). Notably, the trans-infection of glia was also observed in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and its mechanism remains unknown.</p>
<p>Convergence index (CI), defined as the number of trans-infected cells divided by that of starter cells, was then used to estimate the tracing efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We calculated the CI of traced neurons and glia separately, and found a higher tracing efficiency in larvae expressing <italic>UGBT</italic> than those expressing <italic>UGTB</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-G</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1-2_S1">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 1.55 ± 0.29 <italic>vs</italic> 0.44 ± 0.11, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; CI<sub>glia</sub>: 4.41 ± 1.48 <italic>vs</italic> 2.50 ± 0.65, <italic>P</italic> = 0.30; mean ± SEM), suggesting that <italic>UGBT</italic> is better for G expression and tracing efficiency. Taken together, these results demonstrate that in larval zebrafish, transneuronal tracing from genetically defined cell types can be implemented by combining the injection of RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] with the co-expression of helper proteins mediated by the GAL4-UAS system.</p>

<title>Optimization and verification of the retrograde monosynaptic tracing</title>
<p>To optimize this system for high tracing efficiency and application feasibility in circuit research, we iterated it step-by-step in the cerebellum via testing different combinations of RV strains (SAD-B19 <italic>vs</italic> CVS-N2c), G proteins (SAD B19G <italic>vs</italic> CVS N2cG), and rearing temperatures (28°C <italic>vs</italic> 36°C) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).

<p>After elevating the temperature from 28°C to 36°C for rearing virus-injected larvae, the neuron tracing efficiency of SAD<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] became obvious (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1-2_S1">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 4.96 ± 1.01 <italic>vs</italic> 0.06 ± 0.03, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001); for CVS<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA] trans-complemented with N2cG, the efficiency further increased by one order of magnitude (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1-2_S1">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 11.61 ± 2.43 <italic>vs</italic> 1.02 ± 0.18, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001).

<title>Input cell-type-specific tracing and circuit reconstruction in the cerebellum</title>
<p>One important application of neural circuit tracing is to map the structural connectivity of specific neuron types to build the brain connectome atlas. As shown above, even under the optimal tracing conditions, glia still constituted around 47% on average of the traced cells (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C,E</xref>). This will certainly affect discrimination of traced neurons and their neural fibers. To confine retrograde tracing to neurons instead of glia, we generated a Cre-Switch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> transgenic reporter fish <italic>Tg(elavl3:Tetoff-DO_DIO-Hsa.H2B-mTagBFP2_tdTomato-CAAX)</italic>. This reporter expresses pan-neuronally nuclear-localized blue fluorescent protein (mTagBFP2) by default, which serves as a reference for image registration and data integration. It also achieves Cre-dependent neuron-specific labeling with tdTomato-CAAX via the <italic>elavl3</italic> promoter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, see Methods). We employed this reporter together with Cre-expressing CVS<italic>d</italic>G (CVS<italic>d</italic>G-Cre[EnvA]) to map neuronal inputs to PCs in the cerebellum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). The transgenic labeling of traced neurons showed much brighter and sharper fluorescence compared with virus-assisted labeling (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Among all 13 fish examined, we detected tdTomato-CAAX signals exclusively in neurons without any labeling of glia (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), facilitating the reconstruction of traced neural circuits (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). We noticed a relatively lower tracing efficiency of this Cre-dependent tracing system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>; CI<sub>neuron</sub>: 5.20 ± 1.09 <italic>vs</italic> 11.61 ± 2.43).

<p>To demonstrate the feasibility of our tracing system in building and analyzing brain input maps, we then generated a three-dimensional (3D) reference template brain from the transgenic reporter fish at 17 dpf (see Methods). To incorporate cerebellar expression patterns, we generated the transgenic lines <italic>Tg(2×en.cpce:tdTomato-CAAX)</italic> and <italic>Tg(cbln12:GAL4FF)</italic> to label PCs and GCs, respectively. By utilizing H2B-mTagBFP2 expression in the reporter fish as a bridge, we mapped the two cerebellar expression patterns and circuit tracing results of 13 fish mentioned above onto the common coordinate space of the reference template (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B,E</xref>, see Methods). We delineated the cerebellar brain area and reconstructed each starter PC (n = 24) and its input GCs (n = 58) with clearly visible morphology (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E,F</xref>), resulting in a digital cellular-resolution input atlas of cerebellar PCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>
<p>This input atlas clearly shows an ipsilateral preference of afferents from GCs to PCs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), which was in accordance with the summarized results of non-Cre-dependent viral tracing data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4H</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C,D</xref>). Interestingly, all reconstructed GCs also innervated contralaterally by crossing the midline. We found two morphological subtypes for both GCs and PCs in the reconstruction, and each included one local subtype with axonal projections within the cerebellar area and one long projection subtype with axons extending caudally to the dorsal hindbrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>).

<title>Helper protein expression design that guarantees high feasibility of the tracing method</title>
<p>Well-controlled spatial expression of helper proteins (i.e. TVA and G) in starter cells is critical for the application of RV<italic>d</italic>G[EnvA]-based circuit tracing. Previous studies on zebrafish expressed TVA and G through generating transgenic fish lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> or injecting helper viral vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Both approaches allow for genetic access to a specific types or groups of neurons through the GAL4-UAS system. The transgene typically results in expression in the majority of neurons of the targeted type that usually distribute in many brain areas. Virus-assisted expression depends on the distribution territory of injected virus. Restricting to specific sub-regions of the brain is quite challenging due to the small compact brain of zebrafish larvae. Our method employs the transient transgene technique in zebrafish to express helper proteins. This involves temporarily introducing GAL4-UAS binary DNA plasmids into the fish’s genome through microinjection into fertilized eggs (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). It can achieve sparse expression of TVA and G in genetically defined cell types, even in a single neuron. Tracing from a single neuron can help cell-subtype-specific circuit dissection. Furthermore, we linked the two helper protein genes with the 2A element to co-express TVA and G in the same neuron (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>). Co-expression guarantees that the tracing is monosynaptically restricted. This is because if G-expressing-only neurons exist, they may act as input cells for initially infected starter cells, resulting in further trans-complementation and spread of RV<italic>d</italic>G across the second and even more synaptic steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> Previous studies on zebrafish expressed TVA and G separately using either two transgenic lines or two viral vectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, potentially resulting in separate expression of them in different neurons.</p>
<p>Our study demonstrated that the transient expression of helper proteins effectively facilitates subsequent viral infection and trans-complementation, offering a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to generating stable transgenic lines. It also addresses the potential cytotoxicity effects associated with the use of helper viral vectors.</p>
<p>With commercially available recombinant RV tools, our method can be easily implemented by zebrafish research laboratories using three commonly used techniques: plasmid construction, microinjection (DNA constructs and recombinant RV with a 3 - 6 day interval) and live optical imaging. Additional enhancements for the helper plasmid could include the implementation of light-responsive inducible systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> to achieve both temporal and spatial control of helper protein expression.</p>

<p>To enhance RV<italic>d</italic>G tracing efficiency, we introduced the CVS-N2c rabies strain in zebrafish for the first time. It has been reported that the CVS-N2c strain exhibits significantly higher tracing efficiency in mice compared to the SAD-B19 strain, with an improvement of almost tenfold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In zebrafish larvae, CVS<italic>d</italic>G, when trans-complemented with its native N2cG, also showed an average increase close to tenfold compared to SAD<italic>d</italic>G trans-complemented with its native B19G (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1-2_S1">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>, CI<sub>neuron</sub>). This improvement may be attributed to the reduced replication and protein expression of the CVS-N2c<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This could result in decreased toxicity to host cells, longer reproductive times, and ultimately higher spread efficiency. Consistently, in zebrafish larvae, we found that neurons infected with CVS-N2c displayed lower fluorescence intensity and longer survival times compared to those infected with SAD-B19. Notably, N2cG exhibited higher tracing efficiency than B19G when they were used to trans-complement the same CVS<italic>d</italic>G (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1-2_S1">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>). This could be attributed to the greater neurotropism of N2cG compared to B19G, or potential mismatches between the cytoplasmic domain of B19G and the CVS-N2c capsid. Further investigation into the impact of different G proteins on RV<italic>d</italic>G tracing efficiency in zebrafish would benefit from the construction of chimeric G proteins for comparison<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Besides the virus strain, temperature also plays a pivotal role. Under the optimal temperature for virus replication at 36°C, the tracing efficiency of CVS-N2c increased more than tenfold in comparison with that under the standard rearing temperature for zebrafish at 28°C. This effect was more pronounced for SAD-B19, showing an increase of over 80 times (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1-2_S1">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, in line with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, we did not observe any noteworthy increase in mortality or behavioral abnormalities among zebrafish larvae exposed to elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>The expression level of G proteins is another determinant for efficient rabies tracing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Building upon the codon optimization of the G protein, we further increased the expression of N2cG by inserting the Tetoff element upstream of the N2cG gene (A-N2cG) in the UAS helper plasmid (see <xref rid="fig2-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1-2_S1">Figure 1,2—table supplement 1</xref>). This integration enables dual amplification of N2cG and TVA expression by both the GAL4-UAS and tTA-TRE binary systems. Combining the three key optimal conditions: CVS-N2c strain, 36°C temperature, and A-N2cG, we have achieved the highest tracing efficiency in zebrafish to date, with a 20-fold increase compared to previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Monosynaptic specificity of the tracing</title>
<p>The RV<italic>d</italic>G-based transneuronal labeling of radial glial cells was commonly observed in larval zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2-S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). The viral spread to glial cells may cause concerns about the synaptic specificity of RV<italic>d</italic>G spread between neurons. By employing the cerebellar circuit, we examined the complete pattern of traced neurons from PCs in larval zebrafish, and found that CVS<italic>d</italic>G was able to trace well-known presynaptic neurons of PCs, including both intra-cerebellar GCs and extra-cerebellar IOCs (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-I</xref>). Importantly, IOCs were the only labeled cells outside of the cerebellum, demonstrating the retrograde and monosynaptic specificity of this viral tracer in the zebrafish brain. We further provided functional evidence that CVS<italic>d</italic>G, even at its highest efficiency with A-N2cG, spreads retrogradely between neurons through synaptic connections (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H-L</xref>). In all experiments involving the successful activation of PCs in response to electrical stimulation of single GCs, we consistently did not observe PC activation after ablating the GCs.</p>

<title>Low cytotoxicity that enables functional experiments in a wide time window</title>
<p>We found that the CVS-N2c strain did not significantly affect the neuronal health and physiology of starter cells for at least 10 days after infection (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-L</xref>). Meanwhile, consistent with previous reports in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, the SAD-B19 strain exhibited higher cytotoxicity than CVS-N2c, resulting in more cell death of starter cells (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). It indicates that CVS-N2c is more suitable for application in zebrafish. We could observe the labeling of starter cells even one month later after CVS-N2c infection, and the infected zebrafish could be raised to adulthood. It is worth noting that enhanced G protein expression achieved through the introduction of the Tetoff element (i.e. A-N2cG) in the helper plasmid improved tracing efficiency, but also resulted in elevated levels of cytotoxicity, though lower than that induced by SAD-B19 (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This indicates an association between the expression levels of G proteins and cytotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Given the transferred RV is deficient in G, it is expected that retrogradely infected input cells will have lower cytotoxicity levels than starter cells. Therefore, input cells will survive for longer periods of time. Based on our experience, the CVS-N2c can be microinjected into zebrafish larvae between 3 and 6 dpf, and stable and viable labeling of traced circuits can be observed within 6 to 16 dpi. Therefore, the observation time window ranges from 9 to 22 dpf, spanning the larval ages commonly used for whole-brain functional imaging studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Functions and expandability of the transgenic framework</title>
<p>In the transgenic reporter framework (i.e. <italic>elavl3DoDioBR</italic>) (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), we designed three expansion motifs: 1) a promoter (<italic>elavl3</italic>) motif that allows genetic access to the expression of reporter cassettes in specific cell types, e.g. the <italic>vglut2a</italic> and <italic>gad1b</italic> gene promoters to restrict excitatory and inhibitory targeting, respectively; 2) a Cre-dependent “Switch-On” reporter (tdTomato-CAAX) motif that allows the expression of various structural and functional tools in traced neurons after viral spread, such as photoconvertible fluorescent proteins and optogenetic tools; 3) a Cre-dependent “Switch-Off” reporter (H2B-mTagBFP2) motif that allows a default reporter to be turned off specifically in infected neurons. In addition, the helper plasmid can serve as additional expansion motif that works together with the Cre-dependent transgenic reporter, allowing for full genetic visualization and dissection of neural circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we used the <italic>elavl3</italic> promoter to restrict the fluorescence reporter to neurons and the “Switch-On” reporter tdTomato-CAAX to label the membrane of traced neurons. This enables clear neuron morphology labeling (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), facilitating the reconstruction of traced neural circuits based on single-neuron morphology. We used H2B-mTagBFP2 as the default “Switch-Off” reporter to provide a reference expression pattern for registering and integrating traced circuit images from different individual fish and experiments. As an application demonstration, we applied the transgenic framework to map the monosynaptic inputs to PCs from GCs in the cerebellum of larval zebrafish at ~ 2.5 weeks old (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Interestedly, we uncovered two properties of the cerebellar circuit: 1) the ipsilateral preference of GC-to-PC connections; 2) the subtype specificity of GC-to-PC connections. Further investigation is required to elucidate the functional implications of subtype-specific GC-to-PC connections and the apparent contradiction between the bilateral projection of GC parallel fibers and the GCs’ preference for ipsilateral connections to PCs. The reference expression pattern can serve as a reference atlas to integrate other modal data from brain-wide images with information on gene expression, neurochemistry and neuronal activity. This will largely enhance our understanding of neural wiring patterns in relation to other neural characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides substantial technical development for neural circuit tracing in larval zebrafish, a widely used model for systems and developmental neurobiology, and the tool could greatly benefit neural circuit research by enabling a detailed investigation of circuit structure and function in a major model organism. The supporting evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, although a more detailed description of validation experiments would have increased confidence in the technique's utility. The work will interest zebrafish neurobiologists who are working on identifying novel neuronal connectivity patterns, provided that reagents generated in this study are made widely available; issues such as glial cell labeling, detailed toxicity analysis, and the impact of virus dose on tracing efficiency need further exploration to enhance the findings' applicability and robustness.</p>

<p>EnvA-pseudotyped glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus has emerged as an essential tool for tracing monosynaptic inputs to genetically defined neuron populations in the mammalian brain. Recently, in addition to the SAD B19 rabies virus strain first described by Callaway and colleagues in 2007, the CVS N2c rabies virus strain has become popular due to its low toxicity and high trans-synaptic transfer efficiency. However, despite its widespread use in the mammalian brain, particularly in mice, the application of this cell-type-specific monosynaptic rabies tracing system in zebrafish has been limited by low labeling efficiency and high toxicity. In this manuscript, the authors aimed to develop an efficient retrograde monosynaptic rabies-mediated circuit mapping tool for larval zebrafish. Given the translucent nature of larval zebrafish, whole-brain neuronal activities can be monitored, perturbed, and recorded over time. Introducing a robust circuit mapping tool for larval zebrafish would enable researchers to simultaneously investigate the structure and function of neural circuits, which would be of significant interest to the neural circuit research community. Furthermore, the ability to track rabies-labeled cells over time in the transparent brain could enhance our understanding of the trans-synaptic retrograde tracing mechanism of the rabies virus.</p>
<p>To establish an efficient rabies virus tracing system in the larval zebrafish brain, the authors conducted meticulous side-by-side experiments to determine the optimal combination of trans-expressed rabies G proteins, TVA receptors, and recombinant rabies virus strains. Consistent with observations in the mouse brain, the CVS N2c strain trans-complemented with N2cG was found to be superior to the SAD B19 combination, offering lower toxicity and higher efficiency in labeling presynaptic neurons. Additionally, the authors tested various temperatures for the larvae post-virus injection and identified 36{degree sign}C as the optimal temperature for improved virus labeling. They then validated the system in the cerebellar circuits, noting evolutionary conservation in the cerebellar structure between zebrafish and mammals. The monosynaptic inputs to Purkinje cells from granule cells were neatly confirmed through ablation experiments.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple of issues that this study should address. Additionally, conducting some extra experiments could provide valuable information to the broader research field utilizing recombinant rabies viruses as retrograde tracers.</p>
<p>(1) It was observed that many radial glia were labeled, which casts doubt on the specificity of trans-synaptic spread between neurons. The issues of transneuronal labeling of glial cells should be addressed and discussed in more detail. In this manuscript, the authors used a transgenic zebrafish line carrying a neuron-specific Cre-dependent reporter and EnvA-CVS N2c(dG)-Cre virus to avoid the visualization of virally infected glial cells. However, this does not solve the real issue of glial cell labeling and the possibility of a non-synaptic spread mechanism.</p>
<p>In addition, wrong citations in Line 307 were made when referring to previous studies discovering the same issue of RVdG-based transneuronal labeling radial glial cells.</p>
<p>&quot;The RVdG-based transneuronal labeling of radial glial cells was commonly observed in larval zebrafish29,30&quot;.</p>
<p>The cited work was conducted using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). A more thorough analysis and/or discussion on this topic should be included. Several key questions should be addressed:</p>
<p>Does the number of labeled glial cells increase over time?</p>
<p>
Do they increase at the same rate over time as labeled neurons?</p>
<p>
Are the labeled glial cells only present around the injection site?</p>
<p>
Can the phenomenon of transneuronal labeling of radial glial cells be mitigated if the tracing is done in slightly older larvae?</p>
<p>
What is the survival rate of the infected glial cells over time?</p>
<p>
If an infected glial cell dies due to infection or gets ablated, does the rabies virus spread from the dead glial cells?</p>
<p>
If TVA and rabies G are delivered to glial cells, followed by rabies virus injection, will it lead to the infection of other glial cells or neurons?</p>
<p>Answers to any of these questions could greatly benefit the broader research community.</p>
<p>(2) The optimal virus tracing effect has to be achieved by raising the injected larvae at 36C. Since the routine temperature of zebrafish culture is around 28C, a more thorough characterization of the effect on the health of zebrafish should be conducted.</p>
<p>(3) Given the ability of time-lapse imaging of the infected larval zebrafish brain, the system can be taken advantage of to tackle important issues of rabies virus tracing tools.</p>
<p>
a) Toxicity.</p>
<p>
The toxicity of rabies viruses is an important issue that limits their application and affects the interpretation of traced circuits. For example, if a significant proportion of starter cells die before analysis, the traced presynaptic networks cannot be reliably assigned to a &quot;defined&quot; population of starter cells. In this manuscript, the authors did an excellent job of characterizing the effects of different rabies strains, G proteins derived from various strains, and levels of G protein expression on starter cell survival. However, an additional parameter that should be tested is the dose of rabies virus injection. The current method section states that all rabies virus preparations were diluted to 2x10^8 infection units per ml, and 2-5 nl of virus suspension was injected near the target cells. It would be interesting to know the impact of the dose/volume of virus injection on retrograde tracing efficiency and toxicity. Would higher titers of the virus lead to more efficient labeling but stronger toxicities? What would be the optimal dose/volume to balance efficiency and toxicity? Addressing these questions would provide valuable insights and help optimize the use of rabies viruses for circuit tracing.</p>
<p>b) Primary starters and secondary starters:</p>
<p>
Given that the trans-expression of TVA and G is widespread, there is the possibility of coexistence of starter cells from the initial infection (primary starters) and starter cells generated by rabies virus spreading from the primary starters to presynaptic neurons expressing G. This means that the labeled input cells could be a mixed population connected with either the primary or secondary starter cells.</p>
<p>It would be immensely interesting if time-lapse imaging could be utilized to observe the appearance of such primary and secondary starter cells. Assuming there is a time difference between the initial appearance of these two populations, it may be possible to differentiate the input cells wired to these populations based on a similar temporal difference in their initial appearance. This approach could provide valuable insights into the dynamics of rabies virus spread and the connectivity of neural circuits.</p>

<p>The study by Chen, Deng et al. aims to develop an efficient viral transneuronal tracing method that allows efficient retrograde tracing in the larval zebrafish. The authors utilize pseudotyped-rabies virus that can be targeted to specific cell types using the EnvA-TvA systems. Pseudotyped rabies virus has been used extensively in rodent models and, in recent years, has begun to be developed for use in adult zebrafish. However, compared to rodents, the efficiency of the spread in adult zebrafish is very low (~one upstream neuron labeled per starter cell). Additionally, there is limited evidence of retrograde tracing with pseudotyped rabies in the larval stage, which is the stage when most functional neural imaging studies are done in the field. In this study, the authors systematically optimized several parameters of rabies tracing, including different rabies virus strains, glycoprotein types, temperatures, expression construct designs, and elimination of glial labeling. The optimal configurations developed by the authors are up to 5-10 fold higher than more typically used configurations.</p>
<p>The results are solid and support the conclusions. However, the methods should be described in more detail to allow other zebrafish researchers to apply this method in their own work.</p>
<p>Additionally, some findings are presented anecdotally, i.e., without quantification or sufficient detail to allow close examinations. Lastly, there is concern that the reagents created by the authors will not be easily accessible to the zebrafish community.</p>
<p>(1) The titer used in each experiment was not stated. In the methods section, it is stated that aliquots are stored at 2x10e8. Is it diluted for injection? Are all of the experiments in the manuscripts with the same titer?</p>
<p>1. The age for injection is quite broad (3-5 dpf in Fig 1 and 4-6 dpf in Fig 2). Given that viral spread efficiency is usually more robust in younger animals, describing the exact injection age for each experiment is critical.</p>
<p>(3) More details should be provided for the paired electrical stimulation-calcium imaging study. How many GC cells were tested? How many had corresponding PC cell responses? What is the response latency? For example, images of stimulated and recorded GCs and PCs should be shown.</p>
<p>(4) It is unclear how connectivity between specific PC and GC is determined for single neuron connectivity. In other images (Figure 4C), there are usually multiple starter cells and many GCs. It was not shown that the image resolution can establish clear axon-dendritic contacts between cell pairs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors establish reagents and define experimental parameters useful for defining neurons retrograde to a neuron of interest.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A clever approach, careful optimization, novel reagents, and convincing data together lead to convincing conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In the current version of the manuscript, the tracing results could be better centered with respect to past work, certain methods could be presented more clearly, and other approaches worth considering.</p>
<p>Appraisal/Discussion:</p>
<p>Trans-neuronal tracing in the larval zebrafish preparation has lagged behind rodent models, limiting &quot;circuit-cracking&quot; experiments. Previous work has demonstrated that pseudotyped rabies virus-mediated tracing could work, but published data suggested that there was considerable room for optimization. The authors take a major step forward here, identifying a number of key parameters to achieve success and establishing new transgenic reagents that incorporate modern intersectional approaches. As a proof of concept, the manuscript concludes with a rough characterization of inputs to cerebellar Purkinje cells. The work will be of considerable interest to neuroscientists who use the zebrafish model.</p>
