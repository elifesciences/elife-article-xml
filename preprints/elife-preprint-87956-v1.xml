<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Eukaryotic cells control cytosolic inorganic phosphate to balance its role as essential macronutrient with its negative bioenergetic impacts. Phosphate homeostasis depends on a conserved signaling pathway including inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs) and SPX receptor domains. Since cells synthesize various PP-IPs and SPX domains bind them promiscuously, it is unclear whether a specific PP-IP regulates SPX domains in vivo, or whether multiple PP-IPs act as a pool. In contrast to previous models, which postulated that phosphate starvation is signaled by increased 1-IP<sub>7</sub> production, we now show that the levels of all detectable PP-IPs of yeast, 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, strongly decline upon phosphate starvation. Among these, specifically the decline of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> triggers the transcriptional phosphate starvation response, the PHO pathway. 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> inactivates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Pho81 through its SPX domain. This stimulates the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85/Pho80 to phosphorylate the transcription factor Pho4 and repress the PHO pathway. Combining our results with observations from other systems we propose a unified model where 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> signals cytosolic phosphate abundance to SPX proteins in fungi, plants, and mammals. Its absence triggers starvation responses.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>Cytosolic P<sub>i</sub> is of prime importance for cellular bioenergetics because P<sub>i</sub> influences free energy of nucleotide hydrolysis and the metabolite fluxes through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Eukaryotic cells signal P<sub>i</sub> via SPX domains binding critical ligands, inositol pyrophosphates (IP<sub>7</sub>, IP<sub>8</sub>), which control P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis through a network of target proteins that import, export, store or detoxify P<sub>i</sub>. Studies with different systems failed to yield a coherent model on this regulation.</p>
<p>We performed the first time-resolved profiling of the full isomer spectrum of inositol pyrophosphates and dissected the isomer that is relevant to intracellular P<sub>i</sub> signaling. Our results support a unified model of P<sub>i</sub> signaling across all eukaryotic kingdoms, which is in accord with the fundamental importance of P<sub>i</sub> management for metabolism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) is an essential nutrient for all living systems. While required in large amounts for synthesis of nucleic acids, phospholipids and phosphorylated carbohydrates and proteins, an overaccumulation of P<sub>i</sub> decreases the free energy provided by P<sub>i</sub>-liberating reactions, such as nucleotide hydrolysis, which might stall metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In fungi, plants and animals, control of P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis involves <italic>myo</italic>-inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs) and a family of evolutionarily conserved SPX domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>SPX domains interact with or form part of a large variety of proteins that affect P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis by transporting P<sub>i</sub> across membranes, converting it into polyphosphates (polyP), metabolizing it, or regulating P<sub>i</sub>-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Direct regulation of an SPX-containing protein by synthetic inositol pyrophosphates was shown for the polyP polymerase VTC, the P<sub>i</sub> transporters Pho91 and the PHR transcription factors in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). A firm link suggesting the SPX domain as the receptor for inositol pyrophosphate regulation was provided by point mutants in the SPX domain that rendered VTC either independent of activation by inositol pyrophosphates, or non-responsive to inositol pyrophosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Structural analysis revealed that many of these mutations localized to a highly charged region that can bind inositol poly- and pyrophosphates with high affinity. However, this binding site discriminates poorly between different inositol polyphosphates at the level of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). By contrast, strong differences are observed in the agonist properties, leading to the suggestion that binding affinity is a poor predictor of inositol pyrophosphate specificity and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>PP-IPs that can be found in a wide variety of organisms are 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>. They are all linked to phosphate homeostasis by the fact that genetic ablation of the enzymes making them, such as IP6Ks, PPIP5Ks and IPTKs, alter the phosphate starvation response. Considerable discrepancies exist in the assignment of these PP-IPs to different aspects of P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis. In mammalian cells, IP<sub>8</sub> activates the only SPX-protein expressed in this system, the P<sub>i</sub> exporter XPR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In plants, IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>8</sub> decrease upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation and mutants lacking either of the enzymes necessary for their synthesis induce the phosphate starvation response, leaving it open whether IP<sub>7</sub>, IP<sub>8</sub>, or both, control the P<sub>i</sub> starvation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Pioneering studies on the regulation of the P<sub>i</sub> starvation program of S. cerevisiae, the PHO pathway, concluded that this transcriptional response is triggered in by an increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), whereas subsequent studies in the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans proposed 5-IP<sub>7</sub> as the necessary signaling compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Studies using the S. cerevisiae polyphosphate polymerase VTC as a model suggested that this enzyme, which is necessary for polyP accumulation under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, is stimulated by 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), whereas studies in S. pombe proposed IP<sub>8</sub> as the stimulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). S. pombe has similar enzymes for IP<sub>8</sub> synthesis and hydrolysis as S. cerevisiae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) In contrast to S. cerevisiae, genetic ablation of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>8</sub> production in S. pombe leads to hyper-repression of the transcriptional phosphate starvation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) and interferes with the induction of the transcriptional phosphate starvation response. However, the transcriptional phosphate starvation response in S. pombe organism occurs through a different set of protein mediators. For example, it lacks homologs of Pho81 and uses Csk1 instead of Pho80/Pho85 for phosphate-dependent transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). Furthermore, PHO pathway promotors in S. pombe overlap with and are strongly regulated by lncRNA transcription units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). It is hence difficult to compare the downstream events in this system to the PHO pathway of S. cerevisiae.</p>
<p>The discrepancies mentioned above could either reflect a true divergence in the signaling properties of different PP-IPs in different organisms, in which case a common and evolutionarily conserved signaling mechanism may not exist. Alternatively, the diverging interpretations could reflect limitations in the analytics of PP-IPs and in the in vivo assays for the fundamental processes of P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis. The analysis of PP-IPs is indeed very challenging in numerous ways. Their cellular concentrations are very low, the molecules are highly charged, and they exist in multiple isomers that differ only in the positioning of the pyrophosphate groups. PP-IP analysis has traditionally been performed by ion exchange HPLC of extracts from cells radiolabeled through <sup>3</sup>H-inositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). This approach requires constraining and slow labeling schemes, is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, HPLC-based approaches in most cases did not resolve isomers of IP<sub>7</sub> or IP<sub>8</sub>. These factors severely limited the number of samples and conditions that could be processed and the resolution of the experiments.</p>
<p>The recent use of capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) has dramatically improved the situation, permitting resolution of many regio-isomers of IP<sub>7</sub> and IP<sub>8</sub> without radiolabeling, and at superior sensitivity and throughput. We harnessed the potential of this method to dissect the role of the three known PP-IPs that accumulate in S. cerevisiae. We analyzed their impact on the PHO pathway, which is a paradigm for a P<sub>i</sub>-controlled transcriptional response and the regulation of phosphate homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Beyond this physiological function, however, the PHO pathway also gained widespread recognition as a model for promotor activation, transcription initiation, chromatin remodeling and nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). In the PHO pathway, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) Pho81 translates intracellular P<sub>i</sub> availability into the activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex Pho80-Pho85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). At high P<sub>i</sub>, Pho80-Pho85 phosphorylates and inactivates the key transcription factor of the PHO pathway, Pho4, which then accumulates in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). During P<sub>i</sub> starvation, Pho81 inhibits the Pho80-Pho85 kinase, leading to dephosphorylation and activation of Pho4 and the ensuing expression of P<sub>i</sub>-responsive genes (PHO genes).</p>
<p>The activation of Pho80-Pho85 through Pho81 has been explored in detail, leading to a series of highly influential studies that have gained wide acceptance in the field. These studies ascribed a critical function to 1-IP<sub>7</sub> in activating the CDK inhibitor PHO81, allowing it to inhibit Pho80-Pho85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). They reported an increase of IP<sub>7</sub> concentration upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation and concluded that this increase was necessary and sufficient to inactivate Pho80/Pho85 kinase through Pho81 and trigger the PHO pathway. The 1-IP<sub>7</sub> binding site on Pho81 was mapped to a short stretch of 80 aa, the “minimum domain” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). This domain is in the central region and distinct from the N-terminal SPX domain of Pho81. Since overexpression of the minimum domain rescued P<sub>i</sub>-dependent regulation of the PHO pathway to some degree, the key regulatory function was ascribed to this minimum domain and the SPX domain was considered as of minor importance. By contrast, earlier studies based on unbiased mutagenesis, which subsequently received much less attention, had identified mutations in other regions of PHO81 with significant impact on PHO pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). The situation is complicated by further studies, which found global IP<sub>7</sub> levels to decrease rather than increase upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The analytics used could not distinguish 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, however, leaving open the possibility that an increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub> might be masked by a decrease in the much larger pool of 5-IP<sub>7</sub>.</p>
<p>We capitalized on recent advances in the non-radioactive analysis of inositol pyrophosphates through CE-MS, offering superior resolution, sensitivity, and throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), to revisit the regulation of the PHO pathway by PP-IPs and Pho81. To this end, we combined comprehensive analyses of PHO pathway activation and PP-IP profiles in mutants of all key enzymes involved in PP-IP metabolism of yeast.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>So far, analysis of the role of PP-IPs in P<sub>i</sub> homeostasis and P<sub>i</sub> starvation responses relied mainly on the use of mutants which ablate one of the pathways of PP-IP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Yet, as shown in plants, several PP-IPs can change in a similar manner upon P<sub>i</sub> depletion or replenishment, and ablation of enzymes diphosphorylating either the 1-or 5-positions on the inositol ring induces similar P<sub>i</sub> starvation responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) This renders it difficult to distinguish a role for an individual PP-IP from the alternative hypothesis that all PP-IPs collectively contribute to signaling. To dissect this issue in yeast, we performed time course analyses of mutants in PP-IP phosphatases and kinases, in which we correlate the levels of all PP-IPs with the induction of the phosphate starvation response in yeast. The rationale was to seek for upper or lower thresholds of PP-IP concentrations during PHO pathway induction and using those to sieve out the PP-IP responsible for signaling P<sub>i</sub> starvation.</p>

<title>Cytosolic concentrations and kinetics of 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub></title>
<p>In yeast, the <italic>myo</italic>-inositol hexakisphosphate kinases Vip1 and Kcs1 generate 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, respectively, and they are both required for synthesis of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Inositol pyrophosphatases, such as Ddp1 and Siw14 dephosphorylate these compounds at the 1-and 5 position, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>).</p>
<p>We analyzed the kinetics and the role of these inositol pyrophosphates in PHO pathway activation. To this end, yeasts were cultured in synthetic liquid (SC) media to early logarithmic phase and then transferred to P<sub>i</sub>-free SC medium. The cells were extracted with perchloric acid and inositol phosphates were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Three PP-IPs were detectable: 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>. We note that the CE-MS approach does not differentiate pyrophosphorylation of the inositol ring at the 1- and 3-positions. Thus, our assignments of the relevant species as 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> are based on previous characterization of the reaction products and specificities of IP6Ks and PPIPKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>).</p>
<p>Quantitation of PP-IPs by CE-MS was facilitated by spiking the samples with synthetic, <sup>13</sup>C-labeled inositol pyrophosphate standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). The recovery rate of inositol pyrophosphates during the extraction was determined by adding known quantities of synthetic standards to the cells already before the extractions. This demonstrated that 89 % of 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 90 % of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 75 % of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> were recovered in the extract. To estimate the cellular concentrations of these compounds the volume of the cells was determined by fluorescence microscopy after staining of the cell wall with trypan blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>). This yielded an average cell volume of 42 fL. Detailed morphometric studies of yeast showed that the nucleus occupies around 8% of this volume and that all other organelles collectively account for approx. 18%</p>
<p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Taking this into account we can estimate the concentrations in the cytosolic space (including the nucleus, which is permeable to small molecules) of cells growing logarithmically on SC medium as 0.3 µM for 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 0.7 µM for 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 0.5 µM for 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). IP<sub>6</sub> is present at 3 µM.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we determined the impact of Kcs1, Vip1, Siw14 and Ddp1 on the inositol pyrophosphate levels in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). 5-IP<sub>7</sub> has not been detected in the <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> mutant and 1-IP<sub>7</sub> has been strongly reduced in the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> strain. IP<sub>8</sub> was undetectable in <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> and decreased by 75% in <italic>vip1Δ</italic>. <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> mutants also showed a 2 to 3-fold decrease in 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, suggesting that the synthesis of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> depends on 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. This might be explained by assuming that a significant source of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> is synthesis of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> through successive action of Kcs1 and Vip1, followed by dephosphorylation to 1-IP<sub>7</sub>. A systematic analysis of this interdependency will require pulse-labeling approaches, which are not yet available for inositol pyrophosphates. Therefore, this aspect was not pursued further in the framework of this study. An unexpected finding was the up to 20-fold overaccumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutant. By contrast, <italic>ddp1Δ</italic> cells showed normal levels of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> but a 10-fold increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub>. <italic>siw14Δ</italic> cells showed a 5-fold increase in 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, but similar levels of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as wildtype.</p>
<p>We performed kinetic experiments to analyze how PP-IP levels change under P<sub>i</sub> withdrawal. 5-IP<sub>7</sub> was the predominant inositol pyrophosphate species in wildtype cells growing on P<sub>i</sub>-replete media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Within 30 min of P<sub>i</sub> starvation, the concentration of all three inositol pyrophosphate species rapidly decreased by 75% for 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, by 47% for 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, and by 40% for 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. This decline continued, so that 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> became undetectable and only 3% of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> remained after 4 h, corresponding to a concentration below 50 nM. The high excess of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells also declined as soon as the cells were transferred to P<sub>i</sub> starvation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). After two hours of starvation, it was still two-fold above the concentration measured in P<sub>i</sub>-replete wildtype cells. Even after 3.5-4 h, P<sub>i</sub>-starved <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells had just reached the 5-IP<sub>7</sub> concentration of P<sub>i</sub>-replete wildtype cells.</p>
<p>Taken together, P<sub>i</sub> starvation leads to a virtually complete depletion of all three inositol pyrophosphate species, with 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> reacting faster than 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. Furthermore, inositol pyrophosphatase mutants provide the possibility to generate relatively selective increases in 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1-IP<sub>7</sub>. We used this information to dissect the impact of 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> on control of the PHO pathway.</p>

<title>1,5-IP8 signals cytosolic P<sub>i</sub> levels to the PHO pathway</title>
<p>To this end, we correlated the measured inositol pyrophosphate concentrations to the induction of the PHO pathway. We assayed a key event of PHO pathway activation, partitioning of the fluorescently tagged transcription factor Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> between the cytosol and the nucleus. Pho4 shuttles between nucleus and cytosol and its phosphorylation through Pho85/Pho80 favors Pho4 accumulation in the cytosol. The relocation of Pho4 can hence serve as an in vivo indicator of PHO pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>). It provides a readout for Pho85/Pho80 activity. PHO4 was tagged at its genomic locus, making Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> the sole source of this transcription factor. Pho4 relocation was assayed through automated image segmentation and analysis. The artificial intelligence-based segmentation algorithm recognized more than 90% of the cells in a bright-field image and delimited their nuclei based on a red-fluorescent nuclear mCherry marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>). This segmentation allows quantitative measurements of Pho4 distribution between the cytosol and nucleus in large numbers of cells. In addition, we assayed PHO pathway activation through fluorescent yEGFP reporters expressed from the PHO5 (prPho5-yEGFP) and PHO84 (prPho84-yEGFP) promotors. These are classical assays of PHO pathway activation, but their output is further downstream and hence comprises additional regulation, e.g. at the level of chromatin or RNA, or the direct activation of Pho4 through metabolites such as AICAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). Upon P<sub>i</sub> withdrawal, both promotors are induced by the PHO pathway but the PHO84 promotor reacts in a more sensitive manner and is induced more rapidly than the PHO5 promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). In wildtype cells grown under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> was cytosolic and the PHO5 and PHO84 promotors were inactive, indicating that the PHO pathway was repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Within 30 min of starvation in P<sub>i</sub>-free medium, Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> relocated into the nucleus and PHO84 and PHO5 were strongly induced. By contrast, <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> cells showed Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> constitutively in the nucleus already under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, and PHO5 and PHO84 were activated. These cells have strongly reduced 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, and 50% less 1-IP<sub>7</sub> than the wildtype, Thus, a decline of PP-IPs not only coincides with the induction of the P<sub>i</sub> starvation program, but the genetic ablation of these compounds is sufficient for a forced triggering of this response in P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions. Therefore, we explored the hypothesis that inositol pyrophosphates repress the PHO pathway, and that their loss upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation creates the signal that activates the starvation response.</p>

<p>In this case, we must explain the behavior of the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutation, which strongly reduces 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and maintains the PHO pathway repressed in P<sub>i</sub>-replete medium. Upon withdrawal of P<sub>i</sub>, <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells did not show nuclear relocation of Pho4 after 30 min and, even after 4h of starvation, PHO5 was not expressed. PHO84 remained partially repressed in comparison with the wildtype. These results are at first sight consistent with the proposal that 1-IP<sub>7</sub> activates the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Several further observations draw this hypothesis into question, however. First, all three inositol pyrophosphate species strongly decline upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation instead of showing the increase postulated by Lee et al. Second, <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells show a more than 15-fold overaccumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. Genetic ablation of this pool by deleting KCS1 is epistatic to the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutation. A <italic>kcs1Δ vip1Δ</italic> double mutant constitutively activates the PHO pathway already in presence of P<sub>i</sub>, despite its strong reduction of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and the complete absence of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>. Third, <italic>ddp1Δ</italic> cells, which show a 10-fold quite selective increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub> under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, did not induce the PHO84 and PHO5 promotors, nor did they show Pho4 accumulation in the nucleus in P<sub>i</sub>-replete medium. Thus, even a strong increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub> is not sufficient to activate the PHO pathway, while reductions of inositol pyrophosphates do this.</p>
<p>The data described above argues against a diminution of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as a critical factor for induction of the PHO pathway because <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells, which have virtually no 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, do not constitutively activate the PHO pathway. By contrast, <italic>vip1Δ kcs1Δ</italic> double mutants, which have similarly low levels of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> but also strong reductions of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, show constitutive PHO pathway activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). We hence tested the hypothesis that a decline of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> might trigger the PHO pathway. To define the critical concentration at which this happens in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells, we assayed the induction of the PHO pathway over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). While Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> was cytosolic in wild-type cells under high P<sub>i</sub> supply, a large fraction of it rapidly relocated into the nucleus within the first 15 min of P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A,B</xref>). In <italic>vip1Δ</italic>, Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> relocation followed a sigmoidal curve. The nuclear/cytosolic ratio strongly increased after 1 h, reaching a plateau after 3 h. Thus, relocation was stimulated when the 20-fold exaggerated 5-IP<sub>7</sub> levels of the <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells had declined below 5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>), which is 6 to 7 times above the maximal concentration observed in P<sub>i</sub>-replete wildtype cells. Since 5-IP<sub>7</sub> is the only PP-IP that exists in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells in significant amounts, this observation places the critical concentration of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> that can repress the PHO pathway at 5 µM. In P<sub>i</sub>-replete wildtype cells, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> never reaches 5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>) and, therefore, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> is unlikely to be a physiological repressor of the PHO pathway in wildtype cells. The 5-IP<sub>7</sub>-dependent PHO pathway repression in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells must then be considered as a non-physiological reaction resulting from the strong overaccumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in these cells.</p>

<p>This interpretation is also consistent with the phenotype of <italic>siw14Δ</italic> cells. Although these cells accumulate 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, they accumulate it 4-fold less than <italic>vip1Δ</italic>, remaining below the 5 µM threshold where we should expect non-physiological repression of the PHO pathway. However, <italic>siw14Δ</italic> cells contain the same concentration of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> as the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>), degrade it upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation as the wildtype, and relocalize Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> with similar kinetics as the wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>). Taken together with the evidence presented above, 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> thus ends up being the only PP-IP that correlates with the activation of the PHO pathway in all mutants and conditions. This points to 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> as the controller of the PHO pathway.</p>

<title>The PHO pathway is controlled by the SPX domain of Pho81</title>
<p>Our results strongly argue against an increase of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as the key factor for inactivating the CDK Pho80-Pho85 through the CDK inhibitor Pho81. This prompted us to also re-evaluate the regulation of Pho81 because previous studies had proposed a small peptide from the central region of Pho81, called the minimum domain (amino acids 645-724), as a receptor for 1-IP<sub>7</sub> that triggers the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). This model rests mainly on results with the isolated minimum domain used in vitro or, in highly overexpressed form, in vivo. This expression of the minimum domain outside its normal molecular context may be problematic because earlier work had suggested that the N-and C-terminal portions of Pho81 could provide competing inhibitory and stimulatory functions for Pho81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>
<p>We targeted the N-terminal SPX domain of Pho81 through various mutations, leaving the rest of Pho81 and its minimum domain intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). First, we asked whether Pho81 lacking the N-terminal 200 amino acids, corresponding to a deletion of its SPX domain, could still activate the PHO pathway. This Pho81<sup>ΔSPX</sup> is likely to be folded because a yEGFP-tagged version of Pho81<sup>ΔSPX</sup> localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5C, D</xref>), and this nuclear localization requires Pho81 to interact with Pho80-Pho85 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). We tested the effect of Pho81<sup>ΔSPX</sup> on relocation of Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A, B</xref>). Whereas wild-type cells efficiently relocated Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> to the nucleus upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation, <italic>pho81<sup>ΔSPX</sup></italic> cells partially maintained Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> in the cytosol. Thus, while the SPX domain is not essential for nuclear targeting of Pho81, it is required for efficient nuclear relocation of Pho4 and the induction of the PHO pathway under P<sub>i</sub> starvation.</p>

<p>Several lysines located on α-helix 4 of SPX domains form part of an inositol pyrophosphate binding patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). Substituting them by alanine severely reduces the affinity of the domains for inositol pyrophosphates and can thus mimic the inositol pyrophosphate-free state. We determined the corresponding lysines in Pho81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3</xref>), created a point mutation in the genomic PHO81 locus that substitutes one of them, K154, by alanine, and investigated the impact on the PHO pathway. Pho81<sup>K154A-yEGFP</sup> should be correctly folded because it concentrates in the nuclei of the cells, which requires its interaction with Pho80-Pho85. <italic>pho81<sup>K154A</sup></italic> cells constitutively activated the PHO pathway because Pho4<sup>yEGFP</sup> accumulated in their nucleus already under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). This constitutive activation was also observed in a <italic>pho81<sup>K154A</sup> vip1Δ</italic> double mutant, confirming that 1-IP<sub>7</sub> synthesis by Vip1 is not necessary for PHO pathway induction. Since, as shown above, <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells over-accumulate 5-IP<sub>7</sub> 20-fold and thereby repress the PHO pathway, this result underlines the efficiency of the K154A substitution in preventing PP-IP binding to the Pho81 SPX domain. Induction of the PHO pathway through SPX mutations is further illustrated by Pho81 expression, which itself is under the control of the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5E, F</xref>). Western blots of protein extracts from cells grown under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions showed increased levels of Pho81 in pho81<sup>K154A</sup> cells, like those observed in other strains with constitutively active PHO pathway, such as <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> and <italic>vip1Δ/kcs1Δ</italic>. They were significantly higher than in cells that do not constitutively activate the PHO pathway, such as wildtype or <italic>vip1Δ</italic>. In sum, these results suggest that the PHO pathway is regulated through binding of PP-IPs to the SPX domain of Pho81.</p>

<title>Inositol pyrophosphate binding to the SPX domain labilizes the Pho81-Pho80 interaction</title>
<p>The effect of inositol pyrophosphates on PHO pathway activation could be further investigated exploiting Pho80 substitutions (<italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic>) that labilize the interaction between Pho80 and Pho81 and render it P<sub>i</sub>-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). We introduced these labilizing Pho80 substitutions into our inositol pyrophosphate mutants, which in addition expressed a fluorescent Pho81<sup>yEGFP</sup>. Under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, wild-type cells expressing the <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> or <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> alleles as the sole source of Pho80 showed Pho81<sup>yEGFP</sup> in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). They accumulated the protein in the nucleus only upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation. This accumulation was more pronounced in <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> than in <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic>, suggesting that <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> affects the interaction with Pho81 more severely than <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic>. Pho81<sup>K154A-yEGFP</sup>, with a substitution inactivating its PP-IP binding site, accumulated in the nucleus of <italic>pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> cells already under P<sub>i</sub> replete conditions, i.e., it behaved constitutively as under P<sub>i</sub> starvation. <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutants behaved like the wildtype, accumulating Pho81<sup>yEGFP</sup> in the nucleus <italic>of pho80<sup>R121K</sup></italic> and <italic>pho80<sup>E154V</sup></italic> cells upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation. These observations favor a model in which binding of inositol pyrophosphates to the SPX domain of Pho81 decreases the affinity between Pho81 and Pho80 and thereby relieves the inhibition of the Pho80/85 complex by Pho81. The SPX domain itself may contribute to the interaction with Pho80 because Pho81<sup>ΔSPX-yEGFP</sup>, which lacks this SPX domain, could not even accumulate in nuclei upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). An interesting side-observation is that P<sub>i</sub>-starved cells showed Pho81<sup>yEGFP</sup> not only in the nucleus but also in small speckles which line the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). In pho80<sup>E154V</sup> cells, they were already visible under P<sub>i</sub>-replete conditions, suggesting that binding to nuclear Pho80 competes with the recruitment of Pho81 into peripheral speckles. The nature of these speckles is unknown and was not pursued further in this study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The transcriptional response of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to varying P<sub>i</sub> supply is an important model system for studying gene regulation, promotor structure, and the impact of chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>). However, identification of the inositol pyrophosphates relaying phosphate availability to this PHO pathway has been challenging. This is mainly due to limitations in analytics. The recent development of a CE-MS method has provided a potent tool, allowing PP-IP analysis without radiolabeling and under any physiological condition. The improved separation, higher throughput and lower cost of this approach led us to re-investigate the role of PP-IPs in PHO pathway regulation. The results inspire a revised model differing from the traditional model in three aspects: We propose that P<sub>i</sub> scarcity is signaled by a decrease in PP-IPs rather than by an increase; a critical function is ascribed to the loss of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> instead of 1-IP<sub>7</sub>; and we postulate that the N-terminal SPX domain of Pho81 rather than the central minimum domain is the primary receptor mediating PP-IP-control over the PHO pathway.</p>
<p>Our observations reveal an effect that misled the interpretation of several preceding studies. This concerns our own work on the activation of the polyphosphate polymerase VTC. Our in vitro activity assays had shown a clear order of potency of PP-IPs in stimulating VTC, with 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> showing an apparent EC<sub>50</sub> 30-fold below that of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 50-fold below that of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In this work, we nevertheless dismissed 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> as a physiological stimulator of the VTC SPX domains based on the argument that a <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutant, which lacks the enzyme for 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> synthesis, shows quite normal polyP accumulation in vivo. We proposed 5-IP<sub>7</sub> for this role because a <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> mutant, which lacks the IP6K making this compound, also lacks polyP. The PP-IP analyses that we present now call for a re-interpretation of this model. The presence of polyP in a <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutant can well be explained by the 20-fold over-accumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in this mutant, which can compensate for the lower EC<sub>50</sub> and permit stimulation of VTC through 5-IP<sub>7</sub>. In wildtype cells, however, where 5-IP<sub>7</sub> is only twice as abundant as 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> should be the relevant activator of VTC for polyP synthesis when P<sub>i</sub> is abundant. Then, the situation is also compatible with results from S. pombe, where ablation of the Vip1 homolog Asp1 impairs polyP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>The transcriptional phosphate starvation response in S. pombe depends also on PP-IPs. However, the downstream executers differ from those present in S. cerevisiae. Fission yeast contains no homologs of Pho81, and the responsible transcription factor is not controlled through a Pho80/Pho85-like kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Nevertheless, important basic properties of the IP6K/PPIP5K system are conserved. Like in baker’s yeast, deletion of the Vip1 homolog Asp1 leads to a strong increase in IP<sub>7</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Characterization of the purified enzyme showed that P<sub>i</sub> stimulates net production of IP<sub>8</sub> by inhibiting the phosphatase domain of Asp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Thus, we must expect a decreased production of IP<sub>8</sub> upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation in vivo also in S. pombe. As for Vip1 in baker’s yeast, genetic ablation of Asp1 does not interfere with the induction of the phosphate-regulated gene PHO1 by P<sub>i</sub> starvation, suggesting that 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> are not essential for this transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In P<sub>i</sub>-replete media, however, ablation of Asp1 hyper-represses PHO1, and putative overproduction of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and/or 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> by inactivation of the Asp1 phosphatase domain induces this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>). It appears likely that this discrepancy also originates from a similar disequlibration of IP<sub>7</sub> species as in Saccharomyces because ablation of Asp1 increases the IP<sub>7</sub> pool 4-to 5-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). This can be judged better once the changes of the different IP<sub>7</sub> isomers will have been dissected under different P<sub>i</sub> regimes in these mutants.</p>
<p>The PHO pathway in Cryptococcus neoformans, a pathogenic yeast, shares many protein components with that of S. cerevisiae and might hence be expected to function in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>). Yet a recent study on this organism proposed 5-IP<sub>7</sub> as the critical inducer of the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This model relies on the observation that <italic>kcs1Δ</italic> mutants, which lack 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, cannot induce the PHO pathway in this yeast. This is the opposite behavior compared to S. cerevisiae. It was hence concluded that, despite an experimentally observed moderate decline in 5-IP<sub>7</sub> upon short P<sub>i</sub> starvation, the remaining pool of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> was required for PHO pathway activity. Substitution of basic residues in the PP-IP-binding pocket of C. neoformans Pho81 interfered with PHO pathway activation, lending further support to the conclusion. However, the same study also showed that Pho81 was lacking completely from kcs1Δ mutants. When the Pho81 PP-IP binding site was compromised by amino acid substitutions the Pho81 protein level was significantly reduced, and the protein almost vanished upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation. This offers an alternative explanation of the effects because absence of the critical inhibitor Pho81 activates Pho85/80 kinase and represses the PHO pathway independently of P<sub>i</sub> availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Destabilization of the Pho81 will then mask effects of PP-IPs. Thus, it remains possible that the PHO pathway in C. neoformans is controlled as in S. cerevisiae, i.e. that P<sub>i</sub> starvation is signaled by a decline of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>. We analyzed the inositol pyrophosphates of C. neoformans by CE-MS. Upon shifting the cells from P<sub>i</sub>-replete to P<sub>i</sub>-starvation medium, all inositol pyrophosphates disappeared within 2 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). As in S. cerevisiae, 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> showed a faster and more profound response, becoming undetectable already after 20 min of P<sub>i</sub>-starvation. Therefore, we consider it as likely that the loss of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> signals P<sub>i</sub> starvation also in C. neoformans.</p>
<p>Our results revise the widely accepted model of increased 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as the trigger of the PHO pathway and the minimum domain of Pho81 as its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). This model rests upon the increase of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation, a reported constitutive activation of the PHO pathway in a <italic>ddp1Δ</italic> mutant, and upon the lack of rapid PHO pathway induction in a <italic>vip1Δ</italic> mutant. A later study from this group revealed that <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells finally induced the PHO pathway after prolonged P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>), but this did not lead to a revision of the model. Our results rationalize the strong delay of <italic>vip1Δ</italic> in PHO pathway induction by the overaccumulation of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> in this mutant, which leads to aberrant PHO pathway silencing through this compound. Under P<sub>i</sub> starvation, it takes several hours longer to degrade this exaggerated pool, which provides a satisfying explanation for the delayed PHO pathway induction in <italic>vip1Δ</italic> cells. Even though earlier studies of O’Shea and colleagues, due to the limited resolution of the radio-HPLC approach, could not differentiate between 1-and 5-IP<sub>7</sub>, these studies reported an increase in the IP<sub>7</sub> pool upon P<sub>i</sub> starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Other studies using a similar radio-HPLC approach suggested a decline of the IP<sub>7</sub> pool upon long P<sub>i</sub> withdrawal, but they analyzed only a single timepoint and could not exclude an earlier increase in 1-IP<sub>7</sub> as a trigger for the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In our CE-MS analyses, we consistently observed strong, continuous declines of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and, upon several hours of P<sub>i</sub> starvation, their almost complete disappearance. Furthermore, we could not confirm the reported constitutive activation of the PHO pathway in a <italic>ddp1Δ</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), although this mutant did show the expected increased 1-IP7 concentration. These observations argue against a role of 1-IP<sub>7</sub>, 5-IP<sub>7</sub> or 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> as activators for Pho81 and the PHO pathway.</p>
<p>The link between 1-IP<sub>7</sub> and Pho81 activation relied mainly on the use of the 80 amino acid minimum domain from the central region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). This domain was used in <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, where 1-IP<sub>7</sub> stimulated binding of the minimum domain to Pho80, thereby inhibiting Pho85/Pho80. Given that 1-IP<sub>7</sub> disappears under P<sub>i</sub> starvation it appears unlikely that this in vitro effect is physiologically relevant. Furthermore, the apparent dissociation constant for the complex of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> with the minimum domain and Pho80/Pho85 was determined to be 20 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The minimum domain is thus unlikely to respond to 1-IP<sub>7</sub> in the cells because its K<sub>d</sub> is almost 50-fold above the cellular concentrations of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> in P<sub>i</sub>-replete medium (0.5 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>), and at least 3 orders of magnitude above the concentration remaining on P<sub>i</sub> starvation media (&lt; 20 nM). Another discrepancy is that the <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of Pho80/Pho85 by the minimum domain was reported to be specific for 1-IP<sub>7</sub> whereas 5-IP<sub>7</sub> had no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). This contrasts with the in vivo situation, where we find that even massive overaccumulation of 1-IP<sub>7</sub> by ablation of Ddp1 cannot trigger the PHO pathway, but where suppression of 5-IP<sub>7</sub> and 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> production by ablation of Kcs1 does activate it constitutively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>An argument supporting a role of the minimum domain in mediating P<sub>i</sub>-responsiveness was provided by in vivo experiments in a pho81Δ mutant, where P<sub>i</sub>-dependent activation of the PHO pathway could be partially rescued through over-expression of the minimum domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). PHO pathway activation was assayed through PHO5 expression. This is relevant because the PHO5 promotor is not only controlled through Pho85/Pho80-mediated phosphorylation of Pho4, but also through changes in nucleosome occupancy, which substantially influence activity and activation threshold of the PHO5 promotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). It is thus conceivable that constitutive overexpression of the minimum domain reduces Pho85/Pho80 activity moderately, but sufficiently to allow regulation of PHO5 through nucleosome positioning, which changes in a P<sub>i</sub>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>).</p>
<p>Even though the minimum domain is unlikely to function as a receptor for PP-IPs this does not draw into question that the minimum domain is critical for Pho81 function. This is suggested by substitutions and deletions in this domain, introduced into full-length Pho81, which constitutively repress the PHO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). We hence explored the effects of the minimum domain by molecular modeling. Using Alphafold Multimer we generated models of Pho80 in complex with the minimum domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>). The structure predictions place the minimum domain in a groove of Pho80. This groove contains both E154 and R121, the two residues that were identified by a random mutagenesis approach as critical for the interaction between Pho80 and Pho81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Modeling a Pho81/Pho85/Pho80 complex yielded a similar result. Also here, the minimum domain is modeled as a long unstructured loop associated with the groove containing E154 and R121. In this model, the minimum domain provides the contact between Pho80 and Pho81. This readily explains why substitutions in the Pho81 minimum domain (residues 690-701) as well as in Pho80 residues E154 or R121 destabilize the association of Pho81 with Pho85/Pho80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>). The effects of substituting these residues lend credibility to this aspect of the structure prediction.</p>

</fig>
<p>If the minimum domain itself may not serve as PP-IP receptor of Pho81 but is important for regulating Pho80/Pho85 activity, how does Pho81 receive information about cytosolic P<sub>i</sub> levels? Our in vivo analyses of Pho81 regulation were performed with the full-length protein. In this context, the SPX domain exerts strong control over Pho81 activity, because a single substitution of one of the lysines in the PP-IP-binding patch, designed to mimic the PP-IP-free state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), sufficed to induce Pho4 translocation and PHO pathway activation. This critical role of the SPX domain for controlling Pho81 is consistent with the results from two random mutagenesis approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), which had received little attention in the previous model of PHO pathway regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). These random mutagenesis approaches generated multiple pho81<sup>c</sup> alleles, which constitutively activate the PHO pathway (G4D, G147R, 158-SGSG-159, E79K). All these alleles affect the SPX domain at residues in the immediate vicinity of the PP-IP binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3</xref>). Three of the alleles (G4D, G147R, 158-SGSG-159) replace small glycine residues by bulky residues or insert additional amino acids, respectively, at sites where they should sterically interfere with binding of inositol pyrophosphates (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). We hence expect them to mimic the PP-IP-free state. In sum, multiple lines of evidence support the view that the SPX domain exerts dominant, 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> mediated control over Pho81 activity in response to P<sub>i</sub> availability.</p>

</fig>
<p>Taking all these aspects together, we propose the following working model (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>): P<sub>i</sub> sufficiency in the cytosol is signaled through the accumulation of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>. Its binding to the SPX domain of Pho81 inactivates this CDK inhibitor and labilizes its interaction with Pho85/Pho80. The now un-inhibited kinase phosphorylates Pho4, triggers its relocation into the cytosol and represses the PHO pathway. P<sub>i</sub> limitation is signaled by a decline in 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>, resulting in the ligand-free form of the SPX domain and the activation of Pho81. Activation of Pho81 allows its minimum domain to bind a groove in the cyclin Pho80, which stabilizes the complex and inhibits Pho85 kinase. An obvious question arising from this model is how the availability of the minimum domain for Pho80 binding could be controlled. An attractive speculation is that this control could be exerted through an interaction with the SPX domain. This aspect will be explored in future work.</p>
<fig id="fig9" position="float" orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure">
<label>Fig. 9</label>
<caption><title>Working model on the control of the PHO pathway through 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and Pho81.</title>
<p>At high P<sub>i</sub> concentrations, inositol pyrophosphates accumulate. 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> preferentially binds the SPX domain of Pho81, which labilizes the interaction of Pho81 with Pho80 and prevents Pho81 from inhibiting Pho85/Pho80 kinase.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="528555v2_fig9.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>In low P<sub>i</sub>, 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> and other pyrophosphates decline. Liberation of the SPX domain from this ligand allows Pho81 to insert its minimum domain into a critical cleft of Pho80, binding Pho80-85 more tightly and inhibiting it. This allows dephosphorylation of Pho4, its concentration in the nucleus and activation of the PHO pathway. This inhibition is reinforced by increased expression of PHO81, which itself is a PHO pathway-controlled gene.</p>
<p>This revision of PHO pathway regulation permits to develop a coherent picture on intracellular phosphate signaling across the eukaryotic kingdoms. Phosphate abundance being indicated by the accumulation of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> is compatible with the situation in mammalian cells, where 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub> triggers P<sub>i</sub> export through the putative phosphate transporter XPR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>), and with the situation in plants where IP<sub>8</sub> are only abundant on high-P<sub>i</sub> substrate and suppresses the phosphate starvation response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Thus, we propose that phosphate scarcity in eukaryotes is generally signaled through a loss of 1,5-IP<sub>8</sub>.</p>

<p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study were all obtained by genetic manipulations from the BY4741 background described in Table S1. This strain corresponds to the wild-type of this study. For the sake of clarity, the BY4741 background was therefore not indicated in the genotype of each mutant strain.</p>

<p>All experiments were performed with a bare fused silica capillary with a length of 100 cm and 50 μm internal diameter. 35 mM ammonium acetate titrated by ammonia solution to pH 9.7 was used as background electrolyte (BGE). The sheath liquid was composed of a water-isopropanol (1:1) mixture, with a flow rate of 10 µL/min. 15 µL Inositol pyrophosphate extracts was spiked with 0.75 µL isotopic internal standards mixture (2 µM [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]1IP<sub>8</sub>, 10 µM [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]5-IP<sub>7</sub>, 10 µM [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]1-IP<sub>7</sub> and 40 µM [<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]IP<sub>6</sub>). Samples were introduced by applying 100 mbar pressure for 10 s (20 nL). A separation voltage of +30 kV was applied over the capillary, generating a constant CE current at around 19 µA.</p>
<p>The MS source parameters setting were as follows: nebulizer pressure was 8 psi, sheath gas temperature was 175 °C and with a flow at 8 L/min, gas temperature was 150 °C and, with a flow of 11 L/min, the capillary voltage was −2000 V with nozzle voltage 2000V. Negative high pressure RF and low pressure RF (Ion Funnel parameters) was 70V and 40V, respectively. Parameters for MRM transitions are in Table S4.</p>

<caption><title>Segmentation of fluorescence microscopy time-lapse experiments.</title>
<p>The subcellular localization of Pho4-yoEGFP has been quantified from time-lapse fluorescence microscopy experiments. This quantification required the segmentation of microscopy images to discriminate cytosolic and nuclear compartments. To this end, the hta2 histone of Pho4-yoEGFP strains has been tagged with mCherry. Nuclei were segmented using mCherry fluorescence images while the cell contours were segmented using brightfield images. Cell segmentation and the fluorescence quantification were performed using the General Analysis 3 module of the NIS Elements software (Nikon). (A) The brightfield and two fluorescence images of the same field are shown. Yellow lines indicate the boundaries of the cells and nuclei that have been recognized by the algorithm.

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study unifies our current understanding of phosphate homeostasis and starvation responses in different eukaryotes, in which the nutrient messenger 1,5-InsP8 binds to one or several cellular SPX receptors, which in turn regulate very different, species-specific PHO pathway components. The evidence is <bold>compelling</bold> and supported by biochemical analyses, protein localization by fluorescence, and genetic approaches, but could still be strengthened by additional experiments. The work will be of interest to a broad community working on nutrient signalling in eukaryotes.</p>

<p>Recent studies in plants and human cell lines argued for a central role of 1,5-InsP8 as the central nutrient messenger in eukaryotic cells, but previous studies concluded that this function is performed by 1-InsP7 in baker's yeast. Chabert et al now performed an elegant set of capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry time course experiments to define the cellular concentrations of different inositol pyrophosphosphates (PP-InsPs) in wild-type yeast cells under normal and phosphate (Pi) starvation growth conditions. These experiments, in my opinion, form the center of the present study and clearly highlight that the levels of all major PP-InsPs drop under Pi starvation, with the 1,5-InsP8 isomer showing the most rapid changes.</p>
<p>The analysis of known mutants in the PP-InsP biosynthetic pathways furthermore demonstrate that loss-of-function of the PPIP5K enzymes Kcs1 and Vip1 result in a loss of 1,5-InsP8 and a hyperaccumulation of 5-InsP7, respectively. In line with this, loss-of-function of known PP-InsP phosphatases Ddp1 and Swi14 result in hyperaccumulation of either 1- or 5-InsP7, as anticipated from their in vitro substrate specificities. These experiments are of high technical quality and add to our understanding of the kinetics of PP-InsP metabolism/catabolism in yeast.</p>
<p>Next, the authors use changes in subcellular localisation of the central transcription factor Pho4 to assay at which time point after onset of Pi starvation the PHO pathway becomes activated. The early onset of the response, the behavior of the kcs1D mutant and of the ksc1D/vip1D all strongly argue for 1,5-InsP8 as the central nutrient messenger. I find this part of the manuscript well argued, nicely correlating PP-InsP levels, dynamics and the different mutant phenotypes.</p>
<p>The third part of the manuscript is a structure-function study of the CDK inhibitor Pho81, basically using a reverse genetics approach. This analysis demonstrates at the genetic level that the Pho81 SPX domain is required for activation of the PHO pathway. Next, the authors design point mutations that should block either interaction of Pho81-SPX with 1,5-InsP8 or interaction of Pho81 with the Pho80/Pho85 complex. In my opinion, these data can only provide limited insight into the molecular mechanism, as no complementary in vitro binding assays / in vivo co-IP experiments with the wild-type and mutant forms of Pho81 are presented.</p>
<p>The discussion section of the manuscript contains additional data such as PP-InsP levels for C. neoformans and complex structure predictions of Pho80 - Pho81. This, in my opinion, renders the discussion section of the work overly speculative. Perhaps, these results should be presented in the results section, and ideally (in the case of the complex structure predictions), be complemented by quantitative in vitro and/or qualitative in vivo binding assays.</p>
<p>Taken together, the work by Chabert et al, reinvestigates and clarifies the activation of the yeast PHO pathway by PP-InsP nutrient messengers and their cellular SPX receptors. From this work, a more unified eukaryotic mechanism emerges, in which 1,5-InsP8 represents the central signaling molecule in different species, with conserved SPX receptors sensing this signaling molecule.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Chambert et al. describes a thorough and careful characterization of inositol pyrophosphate isomers and the PHO pathways in different genetic backgrounds in S. cerevisiae. The paper ultimately arrives at a proposed model in which the inositol pyrophosphate 1,5-IP8 signals phosphate abundance to SPX-domain containing proteins. To arrive at their conclusion, the authors rely heavily on CE-MS analysis of inositol pyrophosphates in different yeast strains, and monitoring inositol pyrophosphate depletion over time in response to phosphate starvation. This analysis is complemented by different reporter systems of PHO pathway activation, such as Pho4 translocation and Pho81 expression.</p>
<p>The experiments are well-designed and the results interpreted with care. With their findings, the authors demonstrate convincingly, that a previous study by O'Shea and co-workers (reference 15 and 16) had been misleading. Lee et al. claimed that the PHO pathway in S. cerevisiae is triggered by an increase in 1-IP7. This claim has been debated heavily in the community, and several groups were not able to reproduce this putative increase of inositol pyrophosphates (references 6, 11, 18). The confusion regarding these discrepancies has been resolved by the current study and is of significant importance to the community.</p>

<p>Summary. This study sought to clarify the connection between inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs) and their regulation of phosphate homeostasis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to answer the question of whether any of the PP-IPs (1-IP7, 5-IP7, and IP8) or only particular PP-IPs are involved in regulation. PP-IPs bind to SPX domains in proteins to affect their activity, and there are several key proteins in the PHO pathway that have an SPX domain, including Pho81. The authors use the latest methodology, capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (CE-MS), to examine the cytosolic concentrations of PP-IPs in wild-type and strains carrying mutations in the enzymes that metabolize these compounds in rich medium and during a phosphate starvation time-course for the wild-type.</p>
<p>Major strengths and weaknesses. The authors have strong premises for performing these experiments: clarifying the regulatory molecule(s) in yeast and providing a unifying mechanism across eukaryotes. They use the latest methodologies and a variety of approaches including genetics, biochemistry, cell biology and protein structure to examine phosphate regulation. Their experiments are rigorous and well controlled, and the story is clearly told. The consideration of physiological levels of PP-IPs throughout the study was critical to the interpretation of the data and the strength of the manuscript.</p>
<p>There were a few places in which a deeper discussion of the data was warranted: not discussed was an explanation for the decrease in the levels of all of the PP-IPs upon phosphate starvation, nor of the phosphate regulation of two target genes of Pho4 when Pho4 is constitutively nuclear.</p>
<p>Appraisal. The authors achieved their goal of determining the mechanistic details for phosphate regulation, revising the prior model with new insights. Additionally, they provided strong support for the idea that IP8 regulates phosphate metabolism across eukaryotes - including animals and plants in addition to fungi.</p>
<p>Impact. This study is likely to have a broad impact because it addresses prior findings that are inconsistent with current understanding, and they provide good reasoning as to how older methods were inadequate.</p>
