<title>Abstract</title><p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls the movement of molecules into and out of the central nervous system (CNS). Since a functional BBB forms by mouse embryonic day E15.5, we reasoned that gene cohorts expressed in CNS endothelial cells (EC) at E13.5 contribute to BBB formation. In contrast, adult gene signatures reflect BBB maintenance mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct cohorts of EC genes involved in BBB formation and maintenance. Here, we demonstrate that epigenetic regulator’s histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control EC gene expression for BBB development and prevent Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs. Low Wnt activity during development modifies BBB genes epigenetically for the formation of functional BBB. As a Class-I HDAC inhibitor induces adult CNS ECs to regain Wnt activity and BBB genetic signatures that support BBB formation, our results inform strategies to promote BBB repair.</p>

<title><bold>Introduction</bold></title>
<p>Central nervous system vessels possess a blood-brain barrier (BBB) that prevents toxins and pathogens from entering the brain. A leaky BBB can lead to deleterious consequences for CNS disorders, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and brain tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. No treatment options are available to sustain and/or regenerate BBB integrity. Identifying and targeting the mechanism that forms and maintains the BBB is an attractive strategy to regain BBB integrity.</p>
<p>By comparing the EC transcriptome of peripheral and brain vessels, the genomic profile that contributes to BBB was described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Further, extensive gene expression changes in CNS ECs during development were also reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, molecular mechanisms governing BBB gene transcription and how such mechanisms contribute to BBB establishment and maintenance are unresolved.</p>
<p>Epigenetic modifications of histones and chromatin-modifying enzyme activities are critical determinants of gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) associate with specific transcription factors and participate in gene repression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. HDAC inhibitors are critical experimental tools for elucidating HDAC functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and four HDAC inhibitors are FDA-approved drugs for cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. More than thirty HDAC inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Similarly, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a complex of polycomb-group proteins (such as EZH2, EED, and SUZ12), represses transcription via its methyltransferase activity that catalyzes tri-methylation of H3K27<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. An EZH2 inhibitor is FDA-approved for Follicular lymphoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) signaling is essential for establishing the BBB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, but the activity of this pathway declines gradually after that and is reported to be minimal in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Evidence linking Wnt to regulating BBB genes includes an EC-specific knockout (KO) of β-catenin that affects BBB gene expression and integrity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In CNS ECs, Wnt signaling requires binding Wnt ligands Wnt7a/7b to Frizzled receptors. This interaction stabilizes the intracellular signaling molecule β-catenin by suppressing a cytoplasmic destruction complex, which would otherwise degrade β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and regulates Wnt target gene transcription by interacting with DNA binding transcription factors TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor). The mechanisms underlying the reduced Wnt signaling and how Wnt regulates the BBB gene transcription are not established.</p>
<p>We describe the discovery of epigenetic mechanisms responsible for regulating BBB gene expression during development, how Wnt signaling is reduced, and the significance of these mechanisms for BBB development. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors activate BBB gene cohorts expressed during BBB formation, suggesting a potential therapeutic intervention.</p>

<title>Transcriptional downregulation of key BBB genes in adult cortical ECs: evidence that distinct EC gene cohorts regulate BBB establishment versus maintenance</title>
<p>An intact, non-leaky BBB forms at E15.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that the EC gene cohorts involved in BBB formation are expressed on E13.5, and 3-4 month-old adult CNS EC will express gene cohorts required for BBB maintenance. We defined transcriptomes of primary cortical ECs isolated from E13.5 and 3-4-month-old adults to test this. mRNA-seq analysis revealed strong expression of EC genes, including <italic>PECAM1</italic>, <italic>CDH5</italic>, and <italic>CLDN5,</italic> compared to perivascular cell types such as pericytes, neuronal and glial genes (S.Fig-1A). To define the gene cohorts responsible for BBB formation vs. BBB maintenance, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) expressed in natural log (fold change) in E-13.5 relative to adult mice (Fig-1A,B). DEGs with a P-value &lt; 0.05) were considered significant. Compared to E13.5, 50% of genes were upregulated, 35% were downregulated in adults and 15% were unchanged (Fig-1C).</p>
<p>GO enrichment analysis of the DEGs identified five functional categories: angiogenesis, cell-to-cell junction, transporters, extracellular matrix, and DNA binding transcription factors (Fig-1D). Except for transporters, the other categories were characterized by more downregulated vs. upregulated genes. The DEGs included important BBB genes (Fig-1E). For example, tight junction (TJ) gene <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>CLDN5</italic>, BBB transporters <italic>MFSD2A</italic>, <italic>CAV1</italic>, and BBB- related transcription factors <italic>ZIC3</italic>, <italic>FOXF2</italic>, and <italic>SOX17</italic> were differentially expressed (Fig-1E). The complete dataset is available on Geo under accession number GSE214923. Overall, the transcriptomic analysis identified EC gene cohorts that were expressed during the formation or maintenance of the BBB.</p>
<p>We validated the differential expression of important BBB and related genes (e.g., CLDN1, CLDN5, MFSD2A, ZIC3, and SOX17) at E-13.5, E-17.5, P0, P7, and in the adult. This analysis revealed that CLDN1, MFSD2A, and ZIC3 expressions were significantly downregulated by E-17.5 and subsequent developmental stages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Thus, the high expression of these genes might be required for the establishment and a baseline expression to maintain the BBB. By contrast, adult expression of CLDN5 was significantly upregulated compared to other developmental stages, and SOX17 was upregulated considerably compared to other developmental stages except for P7 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Additionally, we validated the mRNA expression of CLDN11 and FOXF2 (S. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Hupe <italic>et al</italic> ., (2017) demonstrated differentially regulated genes in brain ECs during embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. To further validate our data, we compared our transcriptome with the 1129 genes shown to be regulated during embryonic development. We found 315 of our downregulated transcripts in adults and 490 of our upregulated transcripts in adults matched with their dataset. Key overlapping genes are highlighted (S. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>HDAC2 and PRC2 mediated transcriptional regulation of BBB genes</title>
<p>Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have critical roles in development and tissue homeostasis, and HDAC inhibitors are instructive experimental tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To assess whether the transcriptional downregulation of BBB genes involves HDAC-dependent epigenetic repression, we treated adult ECs with a pan HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) for 48 hours. TSA increased <italic>CLDN1</italic> (Fig-2A) and <italic>ZIC3</italic> (S.Fig-2A) expression relative to the control. Since there are four major HDAC classes, class I (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 8), class II (HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10), class III (SIRTs 1–7), and class IV (HDAC 11), we tested whether specific HDACs mediate the repression. The class-I HDAC inhibitor MS-275 significantly upregulated <italic>CLDN1</italic>, MFSD2A and ZIC3 while downregulated <italic>CLDN5</italic> (Fig-2A, S.Fig-2A). No significant difference in CLDN1 mRNA expression was observed with class-II HDAC inhibitor (S.Fig-2A). In adult ECs, HDAC2 exhibited greater expression than other class I HDACs (Fig-2B). To analyze the HDAC2 function, we utilized siRNAs to downregulate HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC3 in adult ECs. Knockdown (KD) of HDAC2 significantly upregulated the repressed <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>MFSD2A</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic> genes and reduced <italic>CLDN5</italic> expression (Fig-2C). By contrast, HDAC1 and HDAC3 downregulation did not affect these genes (not shown). BBB genes analyzed above were selected based on their expression patterns and to represent important functional attributes of BBBs, such as tight junctions (<italic>CLDN1</italic> and <italic>CLDN5</italic>), transporters (<italic>MFSD2A</italic>), and transcription factors (<italic>ZIC3</italic>). We used ChIP-qPCR to test whether HDAC2 directly regulates BBB gene expression in E13.5 and adult cortical EC contexts. Three primers were designed ((-)500, TSS &amp; (+)500) spanning the 1 kb region on each side of the promoter. HDAC2 occupancy was detected in the (-)and(+) 500 regions of <italic>CLDN1</italic> in adults with no significant enrichment in E13.5. <italic>ZIC3</italic> showed occupancy at all three regions (1kb) in the adult stage, with E13.5 showing enrichment in TSS only (Fig-2D, G &amp;S.Fig2B). Conversely, HDAC2 occupied <italic>MFSD2A</italic> only at E13.5((-)500 &amp; TSS), and in <italic>CLDN5</italic> occupancy was detected at both E13.5 (1kb) and in adults ((-) &amp; (+) 500). These results link HDAC2 to the developmental control of BBB genes (Fig-2D,G &amp; S.Fig2B).</p>
<p>Our initial screening showed that the PRC2 inhibitor DZNEP significantly increased <italic>CLDN1</italic> expression in adult ECs (S.Fig-2A). To analyze the PRC2 function in this context, we downregulated the PRC2 subunit EZH2 from adult ECs. Compared to the control, EZH2 downregulation significantly increased <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>ZIC3</italic>, and <italic>MFSD2A</italic> expression and decreased <italic>CLDN5</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). ChiP-qPCR of PRC2 subunit EED revealed EED occupancy at various regions of <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>MFSD2A,</italic> and <italic>ZIC3</italic> at E13.5 and in the adult (Fig2F,G &amp; S.Fig-2). EED occupied <italic>CLDN5</italic> at E13.5, but not in adult ECs. Our data support a model in which HDAC2 and PRC2 are critical determinants of EC BBB transcriptomes during BBB development.</p>

<title>Distinct histone modifications delineate the transcription program of BBB genes</title>
<p>Since HDAC2 and PRC2 regulate multiple BBB genes, we sought to determine whether they share similar post-translational histone modifications. To examine this, we performed ChIP- qPCR of potentially involved histone marks, including the repressive marks H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and the activating marks H3K4me3 and H3K9ac. We have scanned approximately 1kb genomic region surrounding the TSS of <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>CLDN5</italic>, <italic>MFSD2A</italic>, <italic>ZIC3,</italic> and <italic>SOX17</italic> in E13.5 and adults. H3K9me3 ChIP-qPCR on our selected BBB genes didn’t show significant binding in either stage (S.Fig-3A). We detected abundant enrichment of repressive histone mark H3K27me3 on <italic>CLDN1</italic> (Fig-3A,C), <italic>MFSD2A</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic> (Fig-3C &amp; S.Fig-3B, C) in adult E.C.s compared to E13.5. <italic>CLDN1, MFSD2A,</italic> and <italic>ZIC</italic>3 showed significant enrichment of H3K27me3 compared to IgG in E13.5 (Fig-3A &amp; S.Fig-3B,C). While <italic>CLDN5</italic> showed significant enrichment of H3K27me3 in the 1kb region in both E13.5 and adults (Fig-3B). However, E13.5 showed abundant enrichment of H3K27me3 in the -500 region compared to adults (Fig-3B).</p>
<p>Active histone mark, H3K4me3 showed significantly increased enrichment on <italic>CLDN1</italic> (TSS), <italic>MFSD2A</italic> (1 KB), and <italic>ZIC3</italic> (-500 and +500) at E13.5 compared to adult (Fig-3A and S.Fig-3B, C). <italic>CLDN1</italic> (-)500 region didn’t show any significant binding for H3K4me3 in both stages, while the (+)500 region showed significant binding compared to IgG with no difference between E-13.5 and adult. <italic>ZIC3</italic> TSS region showed significant enrichment of H3K4me3 in the adult compared to E-13.5(S.Fig-3). Supporting its abundant expression in adults, <italic>CLDN5</italic> (1 KB) showed significant enrichment of H3K4me3 in adults compared to E13.5. Another active histone mark, H3K9ac, showed significant enrichment on <italic>CLDN1</italic> (TSS and +500) at E13.5 compared to the adult with no significant binding in the -500 region in both stages (Fig-3A &amp; S.Fig-3). <italic>ZIC3</italic> (TSS and +500) showed a significant binding for H3K9ac in E13.5 compared to the adult, while the -500 region didn’t show any enrichment in both stages. <italic>MFSD2A</italic> showed significant enrichment of H3K9ac in the -500 and +500 regions at E-13.5 compared to adults. At the same time, the TSS region showed significant enrichment in adults compared to E-13.5. Histone modifications on <italic>SOX17</italic> are shown in S.Fig-3D. These results indicate that BBB genes acquire a unique epigenetic signature during development.</p>

<title>HDAC2 activity is critical for the maturation of BBB, while PRC2 is dispensable</title>
<p>To examine the role of HDAC2 and PRC2 in BBB maturation, we knock out (KO.) <italic>HDAC2</italic> and PRC2 subunit <italic>EZH2</italic> from ECs during embryonic development. To conditionally KO <italic>HDAC2</italic> or <italic>EZH2,</italic> we used tamoxifen-inducible Cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2 mice. Tamoxifen was injected into the mother starting at E-12.5 and on alternate days until E-16.5 (Fig-4A &amp; 4E). This allowed the KO of <italic>HDAC2</italic> or <italic>EZH2</italic> before the maturation of the BBB.</p>
<p>It was observed that <italic>HDAC2 and EZH2</italic> KO embryos grew normally and were alive on the day of sacrifice E17.5. Significantly decreased mRNA expression of <italic>HDAC2</italic> in the whole brain analysis confirmed the loss of HDAC2 (S.Fig-4). Compared to WT, <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO pial vessels were dilated and showed increased angiogenesis (Fig-4B). BBB permeability was assessed in <italic>HDAC2</italic> ECKO mice using a 70KD FITC-conjugated dextran tracer. The tracer remained confined inside the vessels of E17.5 WT embryos, supporting previous findings that the BBB matures by E-15.5 (Fig-4C). Conversely, in HDAC2 ECKO, dextran leaked into the cortical parenchyma (Fig-4C). Green fluorescent intensity measurements confirmed the immature BBB in the <italic>HDAC2 ECKO</italic> (Fig-4D). A vascular analysis using angiotool determined that HDAC2 ECKO had a significantly higher vascularized brain area than WT, indicating that HDAC2 plays a key role in angiogenesis (Fig-4D). The pharmacological inhibition of class I HDAC using MS-275 in timed pregnant WT mice at E-13.5 showed significant tracer leakage into the brain parenchyma at E-15.5 compared to vehicle-treated control (S.Fig-4A). The MS-275 treated embryos also showed a thin cortex compared to the control, possibly due to the leakage of the drug into the brain which affects brain development (S.Fig-4A). These findings should be considered when considering the clinical use of MS-275 in a developing brain.</p>
<p>Compared to WT, at E-17.5 <italic>EZH2 ECKO</italic> showed dilated vessels with no evident increase in the pial vessel angiogenesis (Fig-4F). Confirming the loss of <italic>EZH2</italic>, mRNA analysis on the whole brain showed a significant reduction. BBB permeability assay showed a subtle leakage of 70KD fluorescent tracer into the brain parenchyma (Fig-4G). However, the fluorescence intensity analysis showed no significant difference (Fig-4H). Further, the mRNA analysis on the whole brain showed a significant decrease in <italic>EZH2</italic> expression with no difference in <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>MFSD2A</italic>, and <italic>CLDN5</italic> (S.Fig-4C). Together, <italic>HDAC2</italic> and <italic>EZH2</italic> ECKO data suggest that HDAC2 is critical for BBB maturation, whereas PRC2 is dispensable or a support mechanism required during later BBB development.</p>

<title>Despite Wnt pathway activity in the adult, Wnt target genes are epigenetically repressed</title>
<p>Wnt pathway has been shown to influence BBB gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, this pathway activity is reported to be minimal in adults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In our transcriptomic analysis, 67% of Wnt signaling-related genes were downregulated in adults, while 33% were upregulated (Fig-5A). Interestingly, downstream Wnt targets genes including <italic>AXIN2</italic>, <italic>LEF1</italic>, and <italic>VEGFA</italic> have downregulated in adult ECs, while the upstream Wnt pathway components like <italic>FZD4/6</italic>, <italic>LRP5</italic>, and <italic>CTNNB1</italic> were upregulated (Fig-5a). Since Wnt-regulated BBB genes such as <italic>CLDN1</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic> expression was also minimum in adults, we hypothesize that the Wnt pathway is still active in adult CNS ECs. In contrast, Wnt target genes are epigenetically repressed.</p>
<p>To test this, we activated the Wnt pathway in E13.5 and adult ECs using identical concentrations of Wnt3a ligand or GSK3B inhibitor CHIR99021. mRNA analysis revealed that Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>LEF1</italic> can be significantly activated in E13.5 ECs when treated with Wnt3a or CHIR99021, while no significant activation was observed in adults (Fig-5B). Further validating this finding, transcriptome analysis on adult ECs after Wnt3a treatment showed only activation of one Wnt target gene CD44 (Fig-5C). Intriguingly, the Wnt3a treatment downregulated 16 Wnt-related genes (Fig-5C). Next using immunohistochemistry of β-catenin in adult control and CHIR 99021 treated ECs we demonstrated that Wnt pathway activation could translocate or stabilize the Wnt transducer β-catenin into the nucleus (Fig-5D). These results indicate that the Wnt pathway is active in adult CNS ECs.</p>

<p>Next, we investigated whether Wnt target genes are epigenetically repressed. Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>LEF1</italic> were significantly upregulated in adult CNS ECs when treated with HDAC2 or EZH2 siRNA, MS-275, and in HDAC2 ECKO mutants (Fig-5E &amp; S.F-5A,B). Furthermore, the <italic>AXIN2</italic> promoter in adults showed significantly increased occupancy of HDAC2, repressive histone mark H3K27me3 in adults while active histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K9ac were reduced considerably compared to E-13.5 as analyzed by ChIP-qPCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). <italic>LEF1</italic> also showed a similar repressive histone modification (Fig-5C). Further, MS-275 and LiCl (Wnt agonist) treatment increase the AXIN2 protein expression in adult cortical vessels but not by just LiCl (S.Fig-5D). Thus, our data explain the mechanism behind the low Wnt pathway in adult CNS ECs.</p>

<title>Low Wnt signaling epigenetically modifies the BBB genes to achieve BBB maturation</title>
<p>We investigated the relevance of the low Wnt pathway to BBB development. To this, we treated primary E13.5 cortical ECs with LF3 (inhibits the interaction of β-catenin and TCF4) for 48 hours. LF3 activity was confirmed by reduced mRNA expression of the Wnt target gene <italic>AXIN2</italic> (Fig-6A). LF3 treatment induces adult/BBB maintenance-type gene expression patterns in E13.5 with a significant decrease in <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>ZIC3</italic>, and <italic>MFSD2A</italic> expression and an increase in <italic>CLDN5</italic> and <italic>SOX17</italic> expression (Fig-6A).

<p>To determine whether Wnt pathway inhibition induces epigenetic modifications on its target genes and BBB genes, we performed Chip-qPCR analysis of HDAC2, EED, and histone mark H3K27me3, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac on the promoter of Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic>, and <italic>LEF1</italic>, BBB genes <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>CLDN5</italic>, <italic>MFSD2A,</italic> and <italic>ZIC3</italic>. An increased HDAC2 occupancy was observed on AXIN2, LEF1, CLDN1, and MFSD2A promoter when E13.5 ECs were treated with LF3 (Fig-6B &amp; S.Fig-6B). <italic>ZIC3</italic> and <italic>CLDN5</italic> showed no significant difference (not shown). EED and histone mark H3K27me3 showed an increased enrichment on the <italic>AXIN2 while LEF1</italic> showed increased enrichment for H3K27me3 in the promoter after LF3 treatment (Fig-6B &amp; S.Fig-6B) with no difference in other genes analyzed (not shown). <italic>CLDN1</italic> and <italic>MFSD2A</italic> showed a significant decrease in the enrichment of active histone mark H3K4me3 after treatment with LF3, whereas <italic>CLDN5</italic> showed a significant increase (Fig-6B). Another active histone mark H3K9ac showed significantly increased enrichment on <italic>CLDN5</italic> (Fig-6B) with no difference in the promoter of other genes analyzed (not shown).</p>
<p>We then investigate the significance of the physiological reduction of Wnt signaling on BBB maturation. For this we use Ctnnb1lox(ex3)<sup>+/+</sup>; Cdh5-CreERT2 mice which are widely used to attain the inducible EC specific β-catenin gain of function (GOF) (Fig-6C). Upon tamoxifen treatment exon 3 of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> (encoding β-catenin) will be deleted, leading to the expression of a stabilized form of β-catenin protein and thereby constitutive activation of canonical Wnt signaling (Fig6C). Tamoxifen was injected into the pregnant mother, as explained in section 2.4. At E-17.5, β-catenin GOF embryos showed significantly increased pial angiogenesis (Fig-6D) compared to WT BBB permeability assay using 70KD FITC dextran revealed immature BBB in β-catenin GOF (Fig-6E &amp; F). Confirming this result, the pharmacological activation of Wnt signaling by the Wnt agonist LiCl also showed a significant BBB leakage compared to the control (S.Fig- 6C). Our data suggest that a low Wnt pathway supports BBB maturations by epigenetically modifying BBB genes.</p>
<p>Embryonic deletion of EC HDAC2 and Class-I HDAC inhibitor treatment of adult CNS ECs activate gene expression related to angiogenesis, BBB formation, and the Wnt pathway.</p>
<p>Since the E-17.5 HDAC2 ECKO showed a significant increase in vessel density and BBB leakage, we hypothesize this is due to the inefficient epigenetic repression of angiogenesis and BBB formation genes during development. To investigate this, we utilized E-17.5 HDAC2 ECKO and FACS-sorted CD31+ ECs for ultra-low mRNA sequencing (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Indicating the critical role of HDAC2 in regulating the EC gene expression 2257 genes show significant upregulation and 1723 genes showed downregulation.</p>

HDAC2 and PRC2 epigenetically repress EC gene cohorts that support BBB formation during development. Active Wnt signaling supports the expression of gene cohorts required for BBB formation. In contrast, a reduction in Wnt signaling recruits HDAC2 to these gene cohorts to support the formation of a functional or intact BBB. Inhibiting HDAC2 in adult ECs induces the reacquisition of gene cohorts that support BBB formation, thus representing a potential therapeutic opportunity to repair a damaged BBB.</p></caption>

<p>We then performed functional classification of these genes based on key endothelial functions such as angiogenesis, cell-cell junctions, extracellular matrix, transporters, DNA- binding transcription factors, and the Wnt signaling pathway. Except for extracellular matrix function, all other categories were characterized by a significant number of upregulated genes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Key differentially regulated genes are shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>. Critical angiogenesis genes, including VEGFA and ENG; tight junction proteins, including CLDN5, TJP1 (ZO-1), and OCLN; BBB transporters such as MFSD2A and GLUT1; and BBB-related transcription factors such as ZIC3, FOXF2, and SOX17 were upregulated. Further supporting the HDAC2-mediated developmental regulation of the Wnt pathway, in HDAC2 ECKO, several Wnt target genes, including AXIN2 and APCDD1, were activated in E-17.5 ECs after HDAC2 deletion. Key genes that are downregulated include APOE, PSEN1 and VEGFB.</p>
<p>To identify the potential of inhibiting HDAC2 in activating BBB and angiogenesis-related genes in adult ECs, and to obtain a detailed picture of CNS EC genes regulated by MS-275, a class-I HDAC inhibitor, we performed mRNA-seq analysis of MS-275-treated primary adult cortical ECs in culture and compared with the control. MS-275 treatment upregulated 48% of genes, downregulated 34% of genes, and did not alter the expression of 18% of genes.</p>
<p>Differentially expressed genes were grouped into six relevant categories, and all the categories showed a significant no.of differentially regulated genes (Fig-7D). Fig-7E illustrates the potential of MS-275 in regaining BBB, angiogenesis, Wnt, and transcription factors that are differentially regulated during development (E-13.5 vs Adult).</p>
<p>Pharmacologically Induced Epigenetic Changes Are Reversible and Partially Translate to Human Vessels We next assessed whether the gene expression changes acquired by adult ECs following MS-275 treatment were reversible. To this end, we treated adult ECs with MS-275 for 48 hours and collected ECs at 48 hours of treatment and seven days after treatment. As previously shown, <italic>CLDN1</italic> was significantly upregulated and <italic>CLDN5</italic> was downregulated considerably after 48 hours (Fig-8A). While the expression of <italic>CLDN1</italic> and <italic>CLDN5</italic> in adult ECs returned to normal in ECs collected seven days after the treatment (Fig-8A).</p>
<p>Finally, we examined if human vessels show similar reactivation when treated with MS-275. To this end, the human brain vessels collected from epilepsy surgery irrespective of age and gender. We tested three genes with MS-275 treatment: <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>CLDN5</italic>, and <italic>AXIN2</italic>. We found that MS-275 treatment significantly activates the expression of <italic>CLDN1</italic> and <italic>AXIN2</italic> compared to the control, with no difference in <italic>CLDN5</italic> expression (Fig-8B).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mechanisms that create and maintain the BBB are vitally important but poorly understood. We identified EC gene cohorts that differentially support BBB formation and maintenance, described the genetic and signaling mechanisms that establish the BBB, and presented an attractive strategy to activate gene cohorts involved in BBB formation that may promote BBB repair.</p>
<p><italic>MFSD2A</italic> is required for BBB formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, and the transcription factors <italic>ZIC3</italic> and <italic>FOXF2</italic> can induce BBB markers even in peripheral ECs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed that <italic>CLDN1, MFSD2A</italic> , <italic>ZIC3</italic>, and <italic>FOXF2</italic> were significantly expressed in E13.5 compared to adults, suggesting their requirement during BBB formation. Increased levels of <italic>CLDN5</italic>, <italic>PECAM</italic>, <italic>ABCG1</italic>, and <italic>SOX17</italic> in adult CNS ECs point to its significance in BBB maintenance. The results of our study partially agree with those of prior gene expression studies (S.Fig1C), but provide new concepts regarding downstream epigenetic mechanisms governing BBB gene expression. Although a high purity level is achieved in primary EC culture, we cannot exclude the possibility that transcripts from other cell populations may be identified. Even though we used similar culture conditions for both embryonic and adult cortical ECs, culture-induced changes have been reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and should be considered as a varying factor when interpreting our results.</p>
<p>It is not known how BBB gene transcription is regulated. In CNS ECs, HDAC2 and PRC2 directly regulate the transcription of important BBB genes, including <italic>CLDN1</italic>, <italic>CLDN5</italic>, <italic>MFSD2A</italic>, and <italic>ZIC3</italic>. While HDAC2 and PRC2 commonly occupy repressed genes, we detected them in both active and repressive states at BBB genes. This result is consistent with the established dual transcriptional role of this epigenetic regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we present evidence that HDAC2 is required to form a functional BBB and induce anti-angiogenic signals. Even though the loss of vascular integrity and lethality at E-13.5 was reported in non-inducible conditional EZH2 KO using Tie2 Cre-mouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, loss of <italic>EZH2</italic> from E-13.5 did not significantly affect BBB permeability. These results indicate that, during the differentiation phase, HDAC2 initiates the transcriptional control, and PRC2 functions in a supporting mechanism. However, the KD of these regulators from adult CNS ECs induces a similar gene expression pattern, indicating the possibility that PRC2 facilitates the epigenetic modification during later BBB development and maintenance.</p>
<p>Since we did not detect H3K9me3, the repression of genes involved in BBB formation is mainly mediated through H3K27me3. On varying abundance, repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and active histone mark H3K4me3 were detected in our selected BBB genes, suggesting that repressive and activating histone methylation marks modify the promoter. Bivalent histone states can correlate with genes transcribed at low levels, suggesting these genes are poised for activation. In addition, we detected H3K9ac at the active and repressed BBB genes. Bivalent promoters can harbor H3K9ac. Thus, among the five BBB genes analyzed, each gene exhibits a different epigenetic signature, defined by histone acetylation and methylation. These results systematically demonstrate the complexity of epigenetic regulation in BBB genes and the evidence of unique epigenetic signatures. The data presented here does not entirely represent all the histone modifications on BBB genes, as other essential histone modifications, such as H3K27ac and H3K14ac, have not been examined.</p>
<p>The mechanism that confers low Wnt signaling in adult CNS ECs is unknown. Our results demonstrate that Wnt pathway components are still active in adult CNS ECs, yet the Wnt target genes are epigenetically inactive. Thus, in the adult CNS ECs, Wnt pathway activation permits stabilized β-catenin to enter the nucleus. Whether this nuclear β-catenin binds to Wnt target genes is unknown. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that HDAC2 and PRC2 repress Wnt target genes. Other studies have revealed that the basal or minimal Wnt pathway maintains adult BBB integrity, but its activation also prevents stroke-induced BBB damage. This also suggests the possibility of switching Wnt-regulated genes during development. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed the Wnt-regulated adult CNS EC genes associated with BBB.</p>
<p>It is unknown how Wnt regulates BBB genes. We demonstrated that inhibiting the active Wnt pathway at E13.5 can induce the BBB gene expression pattern associated with BBB maintenance. We demonstrate that the low Wnt pathway in E13.5 causes epigenetic modifications on BBB genes mediated by HDAC2. However, the link between Wnt and epigenetic mechanisms is unclear. Since inhibiting β-catenin induces the aforementioned results, it is likely that these effects are mediated through β-catenin. In support of this model, β-catenin GOF during BBB development prevents the maturation of BBB and inhibits the differentiation of angiogenic vessels, resulting in increased brain vascularization. Similar morphological characteristics between HDAC2 ECKO and β-catenin GOF indicate its close association.</p>
<p>Wnt signaling in CNS ECs is believed to require Wnt7a and Wnt7b produced by neural progenitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Our transcriptomic data revealed significant expression of Wnt7a in E13.5 ECs with null expression in adults. Interestingly, adult CNS ECs showed considerable activation of Wnt7a mRNA with MS-275 treatment (S.Fig7A). Moreover, β-catenin KD and GOF affect the expression of Wnt7a, and β -catenin staining after MS-275 treatment showed localization of β-catenin to the nucleus. These data indicate an innate mechanism of ECs to regulate the Wnt pathway.</p>
<p>A natural consequence of targeting epigenetic regulators or the Wnt pathway is that these mechanisms regulate numerous genes. Our mRNA sequencing results on embryonic and adult ECs revealed that HDAC2 inhibition or deletion could regulate EC genes associated with critical functions, including angiogenesis, barriergenesis, and Wnt signaling. Our HDAC2 ECKO phenotypic and transcriptomic data (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref> &amp; Fig7A-C) reveal that the absence of HDAC2 impairs vascular and BBB maturation through the derepression of BBB, angiogenesis, and Wnt target genes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). The resulting increase in angiogenesis and BBB permeability in HDAC2 ECKO embryos supports our hypothesis that HDAC2-mediated epigenetic repression is essential for proper BBB and vascular development. However, our embryonic data showed no difference in CLDN1 and CLDN5 with HDAC2 deletion, which differs from the adult ECs data. This discrepancy can be attributed to developmental stage, culture-induced changes in adult ECs, pan class-I HDAC inhibitor use, heterogeneous EC population, and sequencing depth.</p>
<p>Epidrugs are attractive therapeutics since epigenetic changes are reversible, with the potential to reestablish function after treatment. Our results support this, as the expression of <italic>CLDN1</italic> and <italic>CLDN5</italic> returns to normal after seven days of treatment. Furthermore, our results illustrate the potential of MS-275 to reinstate the developmental characteristics in mice and partially in human adult CNS ECs.</p>

<p>The blood-brain barrier separates neural tissue from blood-borne factors and is important for maintaining central nervous system health and function. Endothelial cells are the site of the barrier. These cells exhibit unique features relative to peripheral endothelium and a unique pattern of gene expression. There remains much to be learned about how the transcriptome of brain endothelial cells is established in development and maintained throughout life.</p>
<p>The manuscript by Sadanandan, Thomas et al. investigates this question by examining transcriptional and epigenetic changes in brain endothelial cells in embryonic and adult mice. Changes in transcript levels and histone marks for various BBB-relevant transcripts, including Cldn5, Mfsd2a and Zic3 were observed between E13.5 and adult mice. To perform these experiments, endothelial cells were isolated from E13.5 and adult mice, then cultured in vitro, then sequenced. This approach is problematic. It is well-established that brain endothelial cells rapidly lose their organotypic features in culture (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51276">https://elifesciences.org/articles/51276</ext-link>). Indeed, one of the primary genes investigated in this study, Cldn1, exhibits very low expression at the transcript level in vivo, but is strongly upregulated in cultured ECs.</p>
<p>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36187">https://elifesciences.org/articles/36187</ext-link> ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://markfsabbagh.shinyapps.io/vectrdb/">https://markfsabbagh.shinyapps.io/vectrdb/</ext-link>)</p>
<p>This undermines the conclusions of the study. While this manuscript is framed as investigating how epigenetic processes shape BBB formation and maintenance, they may be looking at how brain endothelial cells lose their identity in culture.</p>
<p>An additional concern is that for many experiments, siRNA knockdowns are performed without validation of the efficacy of knockdown.</p>
<p>Some experiments in the paper are promising, however. For example, the knockout of HDAC2 in endothelial cells resulting in BBB leakage was striking. Investigating the mechanisms underlying this phenotype in vivo could yield important insights.</p>

<p>Sadanandan et al describe their studies in mice of HDAC and Polycomb function in the context of vascular endothelial cell (EC) gene expression relevant to the blood-brain barrier, (BBB). This topic is of interest because the BBB gene expression program represents an interesting and important vascular diversification mechanism. From an applied point of view, modifying this program could have therapeutic benefits in situations where BBB function is compromised.</p>
<p>The study involves comparing the transcriptomes of cultured CNS ECs at E13 and adult stages and then perturbing EC gene expression pharmacologically in cell culture (with HDAC and Polycomb inhibitors) and genetically in vivo by EC-specific conditional KO of HDAC2 and Polycomb component EZH2.</p>
<p>This reviewer has several critiques of the study.</p>
<p>First, based on published data, the effect of culturing CNS ECs is likely to have profound effects on their differentiation, especially as related to their CNS-specific phenotypes. Related to this, the authors do not state how long the cells were cultured.</p>
<p>Second, the use of qPCR assays for quantifying ChIP and transcript levels is inferior to ChIPseq and RNAseq. Whole genome methods, such as ChIPseq, permit a level of quality assessment that is not possible with qPCR methods. The authors should use whole genome NextGen sequencing approaches, show the alignment of reads to the genome from replicate experiments, and quantitatively analyze the technical quality of the data.</p>
<p>Third, the observation that pharmacologic inhibitor experiments and conditional KO experiments targeting HDAC2 and the Polycomb complex perturb EC gene expression or BBB integrity, respectively, is not particularly surprising as these proteins have broad roles in epigenetic regulation is a wide variety of cell types.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Reviewers' 1 and 2 concern on endothelial cells (ECs) transcription changes on culture.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now addressed this concern by FACS-sorting ECs (Fig. 7A revised) and comparing our data with previous studies (S. Fig. 1C). Our major claim was the epigenetic repression of EC genes, including those involved in BBB formation and angiogenesis, during later development. To further strengthen our claim, we knocked out HDAC2 during the later stages of development to prevent this epigenetic repression. As shown in the first version of the manuscript, this knockout results in enhanced angiogenesis and a leaky BBB.</p>
<p>In the revised version, we have FACS-sorted CD31+ ECs from E-17.5 WT and HDAC2 ECKO mice, followed by ultra-low mRNA sequencing. Confirming the epigenetic repression via HDAC2, the HDAC2-deleted ECs showed high expression of BBB genes such as ZO-1, OCLN, MFSD2A, and GLUT1, and activation of the Wnt signaling pathway as indicated by the upregulation of Wnt target genes such as Axin2 and APCDD1. Additionally, to validate the increased angiogenesis phenotype observed, angiogenesis-related genes such as VEGFA, FLT1, and ENG were upregulated.</p>
<p>Since the transcriptomics of brain ECs during developmental stages has already been published in Hupe et al., 2017, we did not attempt to replicate this. However, we compared our differentially regulated genes from E-13.5 versus adult stages with the transcriptome changes during development reported by Hupe et al., 2017. We found a significant overlap in important genes such as CLDN5, LEF1, ZIC3, and MFSD2A (S. Fig. 1C).</p>
<p>As pointed out by the reviewer, culture-induced changes cannot be ruled out from our data. We have included a statement in the manuscript: &quot;Even though we used similar culture conditions for both embryonic and adult cortical ECs, culture-induced changes have been reported previously and should be considered as a varying factor when interpreting our results.&quot;</p>

<p>Reviewer-1 Comment 3- Some experiments in the paper are promising, however. For example, the knockout of HDAC2 in endothelial cells resulting in BBB leakage was striking. Investigating the mechanisms underlying this phenotype in vivo could yield important insights.</p>

<p>We appreciate your positive comment. The in vivo HDAC2 knockout experiment serves as a validation of our in vitro findings, demonstrating that the epigenetic regulator HDAC2 can control the expression of endothelial cell (EC) genes involved in angiogenesis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation, and maturation. To investigate the mechanism behind the underlying phenotype of HDAC2 ECKO, we performed mRNA sequencing on HDAC2 ECKO E-17.5 ECs and discovered that vascular and BBB maturation is hindered by preventing the epigenetic repression of BBB, angiogenesis, and Wnt target genes (Fig. 7A). As a result, the HDAC2 ECKO phenotype showed increased angiogenesis and BBB leakage. This strengthens our hypothesis that HDAC2-mediated epigenetic repression is critical for BBB and vascular maturation.</p>

<p>Reviewer 2 Comment-2 The use of qPCR assays for quantifying ChIP and transcript levels is inferior to ChIPseq and RNAseq. Whole genome methods, such as ChIPseq, permit a level of quality assessment that is not possible with qPCR methods. The authors should use whole genome NextGen sequencing approaches, show the alignment of reads to the genome from replicate experiments, and quantitatively analyze the technical quality of the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment. While whole-genome methods like ChIP-seq offer comprehensive and high-throughput data, ChIP-qPCR assays remain valuable tools due to their sensitivity, specificity, and suitability for validation and targeted analysis. Our ChIP analysis identify the crucial roles of HDAC2 and PRC2, two epigenetic enzymes, in CNS endothelial cells (ECs). In vivo data presented in Figure 4 further support this finding through observed phenotypic differences. We concur that a comprehensive analysis of HDAC2 and PRC2 target genes in ECs is essential. A comprehensive analysis of HDAC2 and PRC2 target genes in ECs is currently underway and will be the subject of a separate publication due to the extensive nature of the data.</p>

<p>Reviewer 2 Comment-3 Third, the observation that pharmacologic inhibitor experiments and conditional KO experiments targeting HDAC2 and the Polycomb complex perturb EC gene expression or BBB integrity, respectively, is not particularly surprising as these proteins have broad roles in epigenetic regulation in a wide variety of cell types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comments from the reviewers. Our results provide valuable insights into the specific epigenetic mechanisms that regulate BBB genes It is important to recognize that different cell types possess stage-specific distinct epigenetic landscapes and regulatory mechanisms. Rather than having broad roles across diverse cell types, it is more likely that HDAC2 (eventhough there are several other class and subtypes of HDACs) and the Polycomb complex exhibit specific functions within the context of EC gene expression or BBB integrity.</p>
<p>Moreover, the significance of our findings is enhanced by the fact that epigenetic modifications are often reversible with the assistance of epigenetic regulators. This makes them promising targets for BBB modulation. Targeting epigenetic regulators can have a widespread impact, as these mechanisms regulate numerous genes that collectively have the potential to promote the vascular repair.</p>
<p>A practical advantage is that FDA-approved HDAC2 inhibitors, as well as PRC2 inhibitors (such as those mentioned in clinical trials NCT03211988 and NCT02601950, are already available. This facilitates the repurposing of drugs and expedites their potential for clinical translation.</p>
