<title>Summary</title><p>During aging, microglia – the resident macrophages of the brain – exhibit dystrophic phenotypes and contribute to age-related neuroinflammation. While numerous hallmarks of age-related microglia dystrophy have been elucidated, the progression from homeostasis to dysfunction during the aging process remains unresolved. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we undertook complementary cellular and molecular analyses of microglia in the mouse hippocampus across the adult lifespan and in the experimental aging model of heterochronic parabiosis. Single-cell RNA-Seq and pseudotime analysis revealed age-related transcriptional heterogeneity in hippocampal microglia and identified intermediate states of microglial aging that also emerge following heterochronic parabiosis. We tested the functionality of intermediate stress response states via TGFβ1 and translational states using pharmacological approaches <italic>in vitro</italic> to reveal their modulation of the progression to an inflammatory state. Furthermore, we utilized single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with an <italic>in vivo</italic> adult microglia-specific <italic>Tgfb1</italic> conditional genetic knockout mouse model, to demonstrate that microglia advancement through intermediate aging states drives inflammatory activation and associated hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microglia are one of few immune cells with long term residence in the brain parenchyma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Microglia support neural development by synaptic pruning and neurogenic function in the developing brain, followed by homeostatic maintenance in the adult brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Alternatively, in the aged brain microglia exhibit dystrophic phenotypes, aggravating perceived insults rather than responding productively to environmental signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. While microglia have been identified as principal mediators of multiple age-related neurodegenerative pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, mechanisms leading to microglia dysfunction during aging remain obscure.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have indicated that aged microglia are inflamed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, have reduced phagocytic capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and have decreased motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Microglia exhibit several hallmarks of aging that potentially contribute to their age-related dysfunction, such as shortened telomeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, altered intercellular communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, molecular alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, and a loss of proteostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, many recent studies have started to reveal the molecular changes that define microglial aging. Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analyses indicate that microglia isolated from the entire brain lose homeostasis and activate inflammatory transcriptional profiles with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Data rich studies have also revealed partial overlaps between aging microglia and those from disease models, including Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the microglial response to aging shows regional variation, as white matter-rich regions induce an interferon signature in aged microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Studies using aged plasma administration and heterochronic blood exchange demonstrate that microglia aging is in part driven by the aged systemic environment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, the genesis of age-related dystrophic microglial phenotypes has not been extensively investigated. So, we set out to characterize the progression of age-related hippocampal microglial dysfunction, aiming to uncover intermediate states that could be intrinsic to the aging process. To do so, we undertook complementary cellular and molecular analyses of microglia across the adult lifespan and in heterochronic parabiosis - an experimental model of aging in which the circulatory systems of young adult and aged animals are joined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we report that microglia in the adult mouse hippocampus, a brain region responsible for learning and memory and susceptible to age-related cognitive decline, advance through intermediate states that drive inflammatory activation during aging. We utilize scRNA-Seq across the adult lifespan to identify intermediate transcriptional states of microglial aging that emerge following exposure to an aged systemic environment. Functionally, we tested the role of these intermediate states using <italic>in vitro</italic> microglia approaches and an <italic>in vivo</italic> temporally controlled adult microglia-specific <italic>Tgfb1</italic> conditional genetic knockout mouse model to demonstrate that intermediates represent checkpoints in the progression of microglia from homeostasis to inflammatory activation, with functional implications for hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline.</p>

<title>Single-cell transcriptional analysis reveals the dynamics of hippocampal microglia aging</title>
<p>Previously, single-cell transcriptional profiling of microglia uncovered a diversity of responses during development and in response to pathology aggregated over multiple brain regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Microglia have region-specific transcriptional states, so we decided to focus our analyses on the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, a region with well-reported functional differences during aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Correspondingly, we investigated age-related transcriptional heterogeneity by performing scRNA-Seq on hippocampal CD11b-positive cells isolated from mice at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months of age using a commonly employed pooling strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (n = 1 pool of 5 biological replicates for each age) to reveal the dynamics of microglia aging. 82% of cells isolated with CD11b were identified as microglia using canonical markers with a small subset being proliferative (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A-C</xref>). Dimensionality reduction revealed that non-proliferative microglia were grouped into interconnected clusters that contained homeostatic, transition, and activated states, along with a semi-distinct cluster with interferon activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D-G</xref>). Overlaying microglia ages onto the clusters revealed progression from a homeostatic state in younger microglia to an activated state in old microglia, suggesting that gradual transcriptional changes occur during microglial aging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1H</xref>). Furthermore, the heterogeneity of microglial transcriptional programs increased with age (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1I</xref>). Expression of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Itgam</italic> exemplified the homeostatic state, while <italic>B2m</italic>, <italic>Apoe</italic>, <italic>Cd48</italic>, and <italic>Lyz2</italic> depict the activated state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, several immediate early genes (<italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Klf2</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>), as well as the purinergic receptor gene <italic>P2ry12</italic>, exhibited transient increases in expression at middle-age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Alternatively, the interferon cluster represents a small proportion of the overall microglia population with little age-related changes in the number of these cells, but augmented expression of interferon genes during aging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A,C,D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G</xref>). Thus, gene expression changes exhibited unique patterns during aging, with certain genes showing age-related decreases (e.g. <italic>Tgfbr1</italic>) or increases (e.g. <italic>Apoe</italic>), while a subset of genes (e.g. <italic>Tgfb1</italic>) have peaks of expression at middle age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,E,G</xref>; Table S1). Several complement genes implicated in age-related synaptic loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>(e.g. <italic>C1q</italic> and <italic>C3</italic>) demonstrated progressive age-related transcriptional increases, and the increased complement activity in microglia was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E,F</xref>).</p>

<p>The effects of aging on microglia could be progressive or sudden, so we investigated if we could find evidence of early aging of hippocampal microglia. We observe relatively few differentially genes between 6- and 12-month (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G,H</xref>, Table S1). The number of differentially expressed genes gradually increased through the 24-month time point (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-J</xref>, Table S1), suggesting that hippocampal microglia progressively accumulate aged-related expression changes. Furthermore, when investigating the outcome for genes with significant changes for each age, we find that genes that are differentially expressed at 12 months lose their expression change, while genes that change at later ages show progressive expression differences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). GO analysis of the microglia from 6- and 12-month-old mice revealed that activation and translational programs are modestly enriched in genes with increased expression during early aging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). The latter stages of aging display more prominent enrichment of immune activation and translation processes in genes with increased expression, while revealing that genes that regulate transcriptional processes exhibit decreased expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J,K</xref>). We corroborated the progressive increase in microglial activation by immunohistochemical analysis for CD68 and p65 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1J,K</xref>). Thus, microglia progressively age with subsets of cells at each age group being forerunners towards inflammatory activation or refractory to aging by remaining homeostatic. This analysis further suggests that microglia could pass through transitory states during aging.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Trajectory analysis indicates that aging microglia pass through intermediate states</title>
<p>To determine the transcriptional progression of microglia aging towards an inflammatory state, we performed pseudotime analysis of the scRNA-Seq data and observed several trajectories (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We find that the pseudotime trajectories progressed along the biological ages of the mice, indicating the suitability of this analysis for modeling aging progression in microglia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We focus our analysis on one trajectory with two semi-distinct subbranches that terminated in inflammatory activation, since the alternate branch had minimal transcriptional differences between the beginning and end of the trajectory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>). To gain insight into the transcriptional states of microglial aging along this inflammatory trajectory, we used spatial autocorrelation analysis and identified five expression modules of coregulated genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,C</xref>, Table S2). We named these modules according to the most enriched GO pathways and known roles of prominent genes for microglia. This trajectory proceeds from high expression of homeostatic genes and mitochondrial processes (module 1) to transient expression of stress response genes and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> (module 2), of which TGFβ signaling is critical for microglia development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. A concerted increase in expression of ribosomal genes (module 3) precedes one subbranch of inflammatory activation (module 4), while the other myeloid activation subbranch (module 5), characterized by <italic>B2m</italic> and <italic>C1qc</italic> expression, proceeds independently of increased ribosomal gene expression. GO analysis of genes specifically upregulated at 12-months showed an enrichment of stress response pathways (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A,B</xref>), corroborating the findings of the pseudotime analysis that intermediate stages of microglial aging pass through stress response pathways. Thus, pseudotime trajectory analysis identifies a progression of intermediate states of microglial aging with potential involvement in age-related maladaptive inflammation.</p>

<p>The gene level dynamics of microglia aging are further revealed when interrogating the modules at each timepoint. Expression of several genes in the homeostatic cluster, including <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr1</italic>, progressively decline throughout the aging timeline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Stress response gene expression peaks at early timepoints during aging, while those genes in the translation module have coherent upregulation at 24-months of age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The top ranked genes in the inflammation module gradually increase their expression throughout aging in a consistent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Alternatively, several genes in the myeloid activation module have expression peaks at 12-(<italic>Cst3</italic>, <italic>Selplg</italic>) <italic>or</italic> 18-months (<italic>Ctss</italic>, <italic>Cd9</italic>) of age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). When the modules are collapsed into metagenes, we observe that homeostatic module is reduced early on in aging, while the stress response module follows later (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-G</xref>). The ribosomal and inflammatory modules display augmented expression at latter ages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-G</xref>). Alternatively, the myeloid activation consistently has slightly increased expression throughout aging. These results suggest that with advancing age microglia lose homeostatic and stress response functions, while increasing their translational and inflammatory capacity.</p>
<p>Next, we utilized a publicly available scRNA-Seq datasets of pro-aging systemic interventions and age-related neurodegenerative disease models to determine their impact on hippocampal microglia aging trajectories. We used the heterochronic parabiosis model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> to investigate whether exposure to an aged systemic environment could promote progression of young adult microglia along the identified aging trajectory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). First, using immunohistochemistry for IBA1 and CD68, we reveal that an aged systemic environment activates microglia (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref>). Next, we find that hippocampal microglia from young adult heterochronic parabionts have decreased expression of homeostatic genes (module 1), while having increased expression of ribosomal genes (modules 3), inflammatory activation genes (module 4) and myeloid activation genes (module 5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>). We used the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> transgenic mouse model at 12 months of age to determine the effects of Alzheimer’s disease pathology on microglial aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). We observe exaggerated advancement along the aging trajectory in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice compared to controls, as expression is shifted towards the age-associated modules (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E,F</xref>). These shift in gene expression posit that the aged systemic and diseased environments drive adult microglia advancement along an aging-associated inflammatory trajectory.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to corroborate microglial age-related molecular changes associated with individual intermediate states in the aging hippocampus by RNAscope and immunohistochemical analysis.

<p>To complement hippocampal aging analysis, we assessed the impact of the aging systemic milieu on both the TGFβ pathway and translational components in the young adult hippocampus following heterochronic parabiosis. We observed a decrease in microglia <italic>Tgfb1</italic> and TGFβ pathway expression in young adult heterochronic parabionts compared to age-matched young adult isochronic controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>). Additionally, expression of the translation module in microglia increases following exposure to an aged systemic environment in the heterochronic parabiosis model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate the role of the intermediate stress response (module 2) and translation (module 3) modules in mediating advancement through microglial activation states, we used an <italic>in vitro</italic> approach. Primary microglia were treated with LPS, which induced gene expression changes with a significant overlap to aging, as well as expression changes in aging modules genes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3E,F</xref>; Table S3). We administered TGFB1 to activate TGFβ signaling (module 2) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and CX-5461 to inhibit RNA Pol I synthesis and interfere with translation (module 3) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) in the context of microglial activation. TGFB1 treatment modified the transcriptional states of LPS-treated microglia (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3G</xref>) and caused decreased expression of inflammatory immune processes after LPS stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). TGFB1 treatment reduced expression of later aging modules (modules 2, 3 and 4) and restored expression of the homeostatic gene <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E,F</xref>), suggesting that TGFBβ signaling acts as an aging checkpoint during microglial stress response. Targeting translation (module 3) with CX-5461 attenuated expression of immune processes after LPS stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>; Table S3), as well as decreased expression of genes in modules 2, 3, and 4, while restoring expression of homeostatic genes in module 1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K,L</xref>). Interestingly, CX-5461 treatment had no effect on genes in module 5, which is located on an independent myeloid activation trajectory from altered translational gene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K,L</xref>).

<title>Mimicking age-related changes in microglia-derived TGFB1 promotes microglial advancement along an aging-associated inflammatory trajectory <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Having uncovered roles for intermediate states in advancing microglia along aging-associated inflammatory trajectories <italic>in vitro</italic>, we next investigated the role of individual aging modules in adult microglia <italic>in vivo</italic>. We elected to disrupt the transition from homeostasis to inflammatory activation by targeting microglia-derived TGFB1, a key marker of the stress response intermediate state (module 2). While TGFB1 is critical for microglia development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, the role of microglia-derived TGFB1 in regulating microglia homeostasis during aging remains to be defined.</p>
<p>We generated <italic>Tgfb1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>, <italic>Tgfb1<sup>flox/wt</sup></italic>, and <italic>Tgfb1<sup>wt/wt</sup></italic> mice carrying an inducible <italic>Cx3cr1-Cre-ER</italic> gene, in which <italic>Tgfb1</italic> is excised specifically in adult microglia upon tamoxifen administration (<italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO, <italic>Tgfb1</italic> Het, and WT, respectively) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To disrupt the age-related increase in microglia <italic>Tgfb1</italic> observed between mature and middle-age (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), mature adult mice were administered tamoxifen and molecular changes were assessed two months later (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We find that microglia activation, as measured by CD68/IBA1 immunohistochemistry, exhibited genotype-dependent effects (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). We performed scRNA-Seq on microglia isolated from WT, <italic>Tgfb1</italic> Het and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO mature mice (n = 2 pools of 3 animals per genotype), and detected genotype-dependent changes in <italic>Tgfb1</italic>expression levels, as well as effectors of TGFB1 signaling (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). Dimensionality reduction and clustering of cells from scRNA-Seq revealed readily identifiable clusters based on marker expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Composition of these clusters were dependent on the microglia genotype, with WT microglia representing the largest fraction of the homeostatic cluster and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO microglia representing the largest fraction of the activated cluster (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>). Next, we assessed whether deletion of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> in mature adult microglia impacted advancement along aging-associated inflammatory trajectories. Interestingly, when we analyze the effects of <italic>Tgfb1</italic> dosage on the aging modules, we find that the loss of a single <italic>Tgfb1</italic> allele reduces expression of homeostatic genes (module 1), while increasing expression of translation-related genes (module 3) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,E</xref>). In addition to a decrease in expression of homeostatic genes (module 1), loss of both <italic>Tgfb1</italic> alleles caused a greater increase in expression of translation-related genes (module 3), and led to a profound increase in inflammatory activation genes (module 4) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D,F</xref>). Results were corroborated in an independent cohort of mature <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO mice, in which we detected altered levels of immune- and age-related cell surface markers (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D,E</xref>), transcriptional alterations that significantly overlapped with aging (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F-H</xref>; Table S4), and progression along the aging-associated inflammatory trajectories (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4I,J</xref>). These data indicate that microglia-derived TGFB1 is both necessary for expression of youth-associated homeostatic genes and prevents aberrant microglia inflammatory activation, further suggesting that TGFBβ signaling acts as a checkpoint in mediating advancement along aging-associated inflammatory trajectories.</p>

<title>Mimicking age-related changes in microglia-derived TGFB1 impairs hippocampal-dependent cognitive function</title>
<p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that microglia interact with other cell types in the brain to influence cognitive function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Given loss of microglia-derived TGFB1 promoted microglia progression along aging-associated inflammatory trajectories, we next investigated its functional consequence on cognition. We assessed hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in WT, <italic>Tgfb1</italic> Het and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO mature mice using novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning - behavioral paradigms that are sensitive to age-related impairments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. During novel object recognition testing, WT mice were biased toward a novel object relative to a familiar object while neither <italic>Tgfb1</italic> Het or <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO mice showed any preference (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>). During contextual fear conditioning testing, <italic>Tgfb1</italic> Het and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO mice exhibited less freezing compared to WT controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>). Alternatively, we assessed amygdala-dependent fear memory by cued fear conditioning (Figure S4K)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and short-term spatial reference memory by Y maze (Figure S4L)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, and observed no differences across genotypes. As a control, we also profiled general health using an open field paradigm and observed no differences in total distance traveled or time spent in the center of the open field, indicative of normal motor and anxiety functions (Figure S4M). These behavioral data indicate that loss of microglia-derived TGFB1 not only impacts aging-associated inflammatory trajectories but also promote hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments characteristic of age-related functional decline.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cumulatively, we demonstrate that microglia aging in the hippocampus advances through intermediate states that precede inflammatory activation, with functional implications for age-related cognitive decline. These transient states, such as activation of the stress response and TGFβ signaling, act as checkpoints on further age-related activation. Furthermore, microglia asynchronously progress through this inflammatory aging trajectory that is in turn influenced by the systemic environment and neurodegenerative disease states.</p>
<p>Analysis of our scRNA-Seq data elucidate cryptic, but necessary, intermediate states of microglia progression to age-related inflammatory activation. These states are present in middle-aged mice and constitute stress response pathways likely responsive to internal and external cellular insults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Pseudotime analysis suggests a highly plausible sequence of molecular alterations that lead to age-related inflammatory activation of hippocampal microglia. First, mitochondrial dysfunction triggers a stress response, and products of this stress response (e.g. TGFB1) attempt to return microglia to homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Here, chronic activation of the stress response leads to subsequent increased translational capacity that promotes inflammatory activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Alternatively, another branch of microglial activation advances independently of increased translational capacity, evidenced by translational inhibition having little effect on its activation following LPS stimulation. Thus, we find that increases in translational capacity predicate age-related inflammatory phenotypes, identifying potential targets to counter microglial aging. Analysis of scRNA-Seq data further identify intermediate states of microglial aging in young adult heterochronic parabionts, suggesting a pivotal role for the aged systemic environment in driving advancement towards age-related inflammatory activation.</p>
<p>While we find evidence of the beginnings of inflammatory activation in the hippocampus by middle age (12 months), consistent with the timing recently reported in the whole brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, it should be noted that scRNA-Seq analysis of the whole brain did not observe intermediate stages in microglial aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. These disparate observations could likely be the result of analyzing multiple regions with highly differentiated transcriptional programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> that could obfuscate regional aging trajectories. This further underscores the need for both temporal and regional specificity in aging studies, given the level of cellular heterogeneity observed across ages and brain regions. Moreover, studying microglia - or other cell types - at early stages of aging in a region-specific manner could also represent useful models to investigate the ontogeny of aging without the confounding effects of accumulated functional deficits.</p>
<p>Of note, we find that an inflammatory trajectory of microglia aging can be mitigated <italic>in vitro</italic> by environmental TGFβ signaling, while loss of microglia-derived TGFB1 promoted progression along aging-associated inflammatory trajectories <italic>in vivo</italic>. Together, these data indicate that TGFβ signaling is necessary for maintaining youth-associated homeostasis and represents a checkpoint in mediating advancement along aging-associated inflammatory trajectories. Functionally, loss of microglia-derived TGFB1 resulted in hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairments, suggesting that advancement through aging-associated inflammatory trajectories may facilitate age-related cognitive decline. TGFβ likely acts in an autocrine fashion to return microglia to a homeostatic state after encountering stressful stimuli. Given that a transient increase in <italic>Tgfb1</italic> expression is observed in middle-aged microglia, it is possible that maintaining stress response-mediated signaling into older ages may also provide a means to delay age-related microglial dysfunction and maintain cognitive function. Alternatively, TGFβ signaling impairs microglial responses to Alzheimer’s disease pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, suggesting that the dynamic regulation of TGFβ signaling in response to aging-associated pathologies is necessary for tuning microglial responses.</p>
<p>While microglia have been demonstrated to mediate the establishment of cognitive function during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and play prominent roles in neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, little is known about how age-related changes in microglia affect cognitive function. The specificity of the cognitive deficits that we observe in <italic>Tgfb1</italic> Het and <italic>Tgfb1</italic> cKO mice suggests that age-related changes in microglia-derived TGFB1 predominantly impacts hippocampal-dependent cognitive decline. Furthermore, the deficits observed in <italic>Tgfb1</italic> heterozygous mice point to the importance of maintaining youthful levels of microglia-derived TGFB1 to counteract stressors that accrue during aging.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results highlight the need to investigate aging across the lifespan in a region-specific manner to reveal necessary cellular intermediates in the aging process. While the present study focuses on age-related changes in microglia, our findings have broad implications for other studies in determining the extent to which aging sequelae are conserved across different cell types in the hippocampus. Furthermore, therapeutic interventions targeting intermediate states in the aging process hold far reaching potential to counteract the development of age-related pathologies, including those promoting cognitive dysfunction.</p>

<p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the UCSF IACUC. Animals were housed in SPF barrier facilities and provided continuous food and water along with environmental enrichment. Aging characterizations were performed on an inhouse C57BL/6J mouse colony where 2-month-old mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Stock 000664) and aged in the UCSF Parnassus barrier facility.

<p>Parabiosis surgery followed previously described procedures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Mirror-image skin incisions at the left and right flanks were made through the skin, and shorter incisions were made through the peritoneum. The peritoneal openings of the adjacent parabionts were sutured together with chromic gut suture (MYCO Medical, GC635-BRC). Apposing elbow and knee joints from each parabiont were sutured together (Coated VICRYL Suture, Ethicon, J386) and the skin of each mouse was stapled (9-mm Autoclip, Clay Adams, 427631) to the skin of the adjacent parabiont. Each mouse was injected subcutaneously with Carpofen, Enrofloxacin, and Buprenex as directed for pain and monitored during recovery. For overall health and maintenance behavior, several recovery characteristics were analyzed at various times after surgery, including pair weights and grooming behavior.</p>

Data was imported from Seurat analysis and a Monocle dataset was generated. The dataset was preprocessed with normalization of the data and PCA generation. Next, the preprocessed data underwent further non-linear dimensionality reduction using UMAP. Cells were clustered, and trajectories were determined for cells within a cluster. For determining “pseudotime” aging of microglia, the root node of the pseudotime trajectory was manually placed in the cluster of 6-month cells. The graph segments of the pseudotime trajectories resulting in inflammatory activation were chosen for further analysis. Graph autocorrelation analysis was performed on the inflammatory trajectory using Moran’s I, which determines if genes are expressed in focal regions of graph space. A cutoff q-value of 0.005 was set as significant for focal expression. Subsequently, coregulated modules were determined using Louvain community analysis at an optimized resolution of 0.0078. The modules were then overlaid onto the UMAP plot to determine the region of the trajectory with focal expression of the module.

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Mice were sedated with ketamine followed by perfusion with 30mL of ice-cold PBS. Brains were collected from PBS perfused mice and fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were washed with PBS and immersed in 30% sucrose (in PBS), and then stored at 4°C until the brains sank. 40μM coronal sections were sliced using a microtome at -20°C. Sections were stored in cryopreservation buffer (40% PB Buffer (0.02 M Sodium Phosphate Monobasic, 0.08 M Sodium Phosphate Dibasic, pH 7.4), 30% Glycerol, 30% Ethylene Glycol) at -20°C until staining. Hippocampal sections were washed three times in TBST. Sections were permeabilized in pretreatment buffer (0.1% Triton-X in TBST) with rocking for 1 hour at room temperature. After three washes in TBST, sections were blocked in 5% goat serum for 2 hours (for IBA1/CD68 double stain) or 5% donkey serum (NFKB/Iba1 and C1q/C3/Iba1 stains). Blocking buffer was replaced with primary antibody mixture and incubated overnight at 4°C with rocking. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-IBA1 (1:1000, Wako, Cat# 019-19741, RRID:AB_839504), rat anti-CD68 (1:250, Bio-Rad, Cat# MCA1957, RRID:AB_322219), rabbit anti-NFKB p65 (1:500, Santa Cruz, Cat# sc-372, RRID:AB_632037), guinea pig anti-Iba1 (1:1000, Synaptic Systems, Cat# 234-004, RRID:AB_2493179), rabbit anti-C1q (1:1000, Abcam, Cat# ab182451, RRID:AB_2732849), rat anti-C3 (1:1000, Abcam, Cat# ab11862, RRID:AB_2066623), and rabbit anti-S6 (1:500, Cell Signaling, Cat# 2217, RRID:AB_331355). The sections were washed three times with TBST. Subsequently, secondary antibody solution was added to the sections, and incubated at room temperature with rocking for two hours. The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 (Life Technologies, Cat# A-11008, RRID:AB_143165), goat anti-rat AlexaFluor 555 (Life Technologies, Cat# A-21434, RRID:AB_2535855), donkey anti-guinea pig AlexaFluor 488 (Jackson Immuno, Cat# 706-545-148, RRID:AB_2340472), donkey anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 555 (Life Technologies, Cat# A-31572, RRID:AB_162543), and donkey anti-rat AlexaFluor 647 (Jackson Immuno, Cat# 712-606-150, RRID:AB_2340695). The sections were washed three times with TBST, with the first wash containing Hoescht 33342 (Invitrogen, H3570) at a concentration of 1μg/mL. The sections were transferred to phosphate buffer and mounted on frosted slides. Coverslips were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade (Thermo Fisher, P10144) reagent after the sections were dried. Slides were imaged at 20x magnification on a Zeiss LSM 800 or LSM900 for a final resolution of 0.312μM/pixel. 8-9 z-planes were imaged at 3μM intervals. The hippocampus was imaged, and the tiled images were stitched together with Zeiss ZenPro software. 2-3 hippocampal sections were imaged from each sample.</p>
<p>Images were analyzed with FIJI. Maximum intensity projections of Z-stacked images were constructed. Images were converted to 8-bit images and consistent adjustments were made for each channel within an experiment. The Iba1 channel was used to quantify microglia using the particle counter function in FIJI and the counts were validated by manual visual counting. The presence of CD68, NFKB(p65), C3, or C1q in microglia was determined by creating ROIs within the microglia in a field using the create selection function on the Iba1 images. The ROIs of the hippocampal subregions and the microglia were combined, and CD68 puncta meeting a minimum particle size threshold (100 pixels, equating to 31.2μM) within microglia determined if the microglia were activated (CD68+IBA1+), while the measure function determined the intensity of NFKB(p65), C3, or C1q. To determine percent activation of microglia with IBA1/CD68 staining, we divided the number of microglia that were activated (CD68+IBA1+) by the total number of microglia (IBA1+) in the analyzed regions and multiplied by 100.</p>

<title>Contextual fear conditioning</title>
<p>In this task, mice learned to associate the environmental context (fear conditioning chamber) with an aversive stimulus (mild foot shock; unconditioned stimulus, US) during the training phase enabling testing for hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning. To also assess amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning, the mild foot shock was paired with a light and tone cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) during the training phase. Conditioned fear was displayed as freezing behavior. Specific training parameters are as follows: tone duration is 30 seconds; level is 70 dB, 2 kHz; shock duration is 2 seconds; intensity is 0.6 mA. This intensity is not painful and can easily be tolerated but will generate an unpleasant feeling. More specifically, on day 1 each mouse was placed in a fear-conditioning chamber and allowed to explore for 2 min before delivery of a 30-second tone (70 dB) and light ending with a 2-second foot shock (0.6 mA). Two minutes later, a second CS-US pair was delivered. On day 2, each mouse was first placed in the fear-conditioning chamber containing the same exact context, but with no CS or foot shock. Freezing was analyzed for 2 minutes and represented as the percentage of time that the mouse froze over the 2 minutes. One hour later, the mice were placed in a new context containing a different odor, floor texture, chamber walls and shape. Animals were allowed to explore for 2 minutes before being re-exposed to the CS. Freezing was analyzed for 30 seconds following the CS and represented as the percentage of time that the mouse froze over those 30 seconds. Determination of freezing behavior was performed using FreezeScan video tracking system and software (Cleversys, Inc).

<p>The novel object recognition task was adapted from a previously described protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Specifically, during the habituation phase (day 1), mice could freely explore an empty open field arena for 10 minutes (motor activity and anxiety (time in center) were measured during this phase). During the training phase (day 2), two identical objects were placed in the habituated arena, and mice could explore the objects for 5 minutes. For the testing phase (day 3), one object was replaced with a novel object, and mice could explore the objects for 5 minutes. Time spent exploring each object was quantified using the Smart Video Tracking Software (Panlab; Harvard Apparatus). Two different sets of objects are used. To control for any inherent object preference, half of the mice are exposed to object A as their novel object and half to object B. To control for any potential object-independent location preference, the location of the novel object relative to the trained object is also varied. The objects were chosen based on their ability to capture the animal’s interest, independent of genetic background or age. To determine percent time with novel object, we calculate (Time with novel object)/(Time with Trained Object + Time with Novel Object) * 100. In this preference index, 100% indicates full preference for the novel object, and 0% indicates full preference for the trained object. A mouse with a value of 50% would have spent equal time exploring both objects. Mice that did not explore both objects for 5 seconds during the training phase or testing phase were excluded from analysis.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Shea and Villeda furnishes the field with a valuable scRNAseq data set detailing microglial aging in the mouse hippocampus. They provide clear evidence that changes in microglial attributes begin in mid-life, well before time points when mice are traditionally considered to be &quot;aging.&quot; It also adds to a growing body of data in the field demonstrating that there is substantial heterogeneity in microglial responses to aging. Using in vitro experiments and transgenic manipulations in mice, the authors show that transforming growth factor beta (TGFb1)-based signaling can potently impact microglial state, consistent with previous findings in the field. They also demonstrate that manipulation of microglial TGFb1-based signaling can impact hippocampus-dependent behaviors.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study lie primarily in reaching too far with interpretations of the data. The authors argue that changes in microglial transcriptome during midlife represent a type of &quot;checkpoint,&quot; after which microglial aging can progress along distinct trajectories depending on the status of TGFb1 signaling. They also posit that a specific intermediate &quot;stress response&quot; state in midlife is mechanistically linked to a translational burst that drives the subsequent progression of microglia to an &quot;inflammatory state.&quot; Unequivocal data to support these causal links is lacking, however. similarly, key additional experiments would be needed to demonstrate that TGFb1 signaling and microglial progression through these identified intermediate states are causally linked to cognitive decline.</p>
<p>Guidance for readers along with study strengths and caveats:</p>
<p>The present manuscript provides valuable strengthening and expansion to a growing body of data showing prominent changes in the microglial state during aging. Microarray(1), bulkRNAseq(2-5), scRNAseq(6,7), snRNAseq(8,9), and spatial transcriptomic(10) approaches have been leveraged to map changes in microglial transcriptome during aging in rodents, non-human primates, and humans. A number of these studies include the hippocampus (1,8,9,11) and have highlighted variation across brain regions in microglial transcriptomic changes during aging (1,11). They have also revealed differences across sex (7) as well as increased cell-to-cell heterogeneity (6-10), consistent with the idea that individual microglia can follow distinct aging trajectories. Several of these studies revealed that changes in microglial attributes begin in middle age (1,7,11), supporting similar observations from studies that did not use omics (12-14). The present manuscript utilizes scRNAseq of hippocampal microglia at adulthood (6mo), middle age (12mo), late middle age (18mo) and aging (24mo) to show that aging-induced changes in microglia begin in middle age and that microglia exhibit ample phenotypic heterogeneity during the progression of aging.</p>
<p>To gain further insight into the dynamics of microglial aging in the hippocampus, the authors used a bioinformatics method known as &quot;pseudotime&quot; or &quot;trajectory inference&quot; to understand how cells may progress through different functional states, as defined by cellular transcriptome (15,16). These bioinformatics approaches can reveal key patterns in scRNAseq / snRNAseq datasets and, in the present study, the authors conclude that a &quot;stress response&quot; module characterized by expression of TGFb1 represents a key &quot;checkpoint&quot; in microglial aging in midlife, after which the cells can move along distinct transcriptional trajectories as aging progresses. This is an intriguing possibility. However, pseudotime analyses need to be validated via additional bioinformatics as well as follow-up experiments. Indeed, Heumos et al, in their Nature Genetics &quot;Expert Guidelines&quot; Review, emphasize that &quot;inferred trajectories might not necessarily have biological meaning.&quot; They recommend that &quot;when the expected topology is unknown, trajectories and downstream hypotheses should be confirmed by multiple trajectory inference methods using different underlying assumptions.&quot;(15) Numerous algorithms are available for trajectory inference (e.g. Monocle, PAGA, Sligshot, RaceID/StemID, among many others) and their performance and suitability depends on the individual dataset and nature of the trajectories that are to be inferred. It is recommended to use dynGuidelines(16) for the selection of optimal pseudotime analysis methods. In the present manuscript, the authors do not provide any justification for their use of Monocle 3 over other trajectory inference approaches, nor do they employ a secondary trajectory inference method to confirm observations made with Monocle 3. Finally, follow-up validation experiments that the authors carry out have their own limitations and caveats (see below). Hence, while the microglial aging trajectories identified by this study are intriguing, they remain hypothetical trajectories that need to be proven with additional follow-up experiments.</p>
<p>To follow up on the idea that TGFb1 signaling in microglia plays a key role in determining microglial aging trajectories, the authors use RNAscope to show that TGFb1 levels in microglia peak in middle age. They also treat primary LPS-activated microglia with TGFb1 and show that this restores expression of microglial homeostatic gene expression and dampens expression of stress response and, potentially, inflammatory genes. Finally, they utilize transgenic approaches to delete TGFb1 from microglia around 8-10mo of age and scRNAseq to show that homeostatic signatures are lost and inflammatory signatures are gained. Hence, findings in this study support the idea that TGFb1 can strongly regulate microglial phenotype. Loss of TGFb1 signaling to microglia in adulthood has already been shown to cause decreased microglial morphological complexity and upregulation of genes typically associated with microglial responses to CNS insults(17-19). TGFb1 signaling to microglia has also been implicated in microglial responses to disease and manipulations to increase this signaling can improve disease progression in some cases(19). In this light, the findings in the present study are largely confirmatory of previous findings in the literature. They also fall short of unequivocally demonstrating that TGFb1 signaling acts as a &quot;checkpoint&quot; for determining subsequent microglial aging trajectory. To show this clearly, one would need to perturb TGFb1 signaling around 12mo of age and carry out sequencing (bulkRNAseq or scRNAseq) of microglia at 18mo and 24mo. Such experiments could directly demonstrate whether the whole microglial population has been diverted to the TGFb1-low aging trajectory (that progresses through a translational burst state to an inflammation state as proposed). Future development of tools to tag TGFb1 high or low microglia could also enable fate tracing type experiments to directly show whether the TGFb1 state in middle age predicts cell state at later phases of aging.</p>
<p>The present study would also like to draw links between features of microglial aging in the hippocampus and a decline in hippocampal-dependent cognition during aging. To this end, they carry out behavioral testing in 8-10mo old mice that have undergone microglial-specific TGFb1 deletion and find deficits in novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning. While this provides compelling evidence that TGFb1 signaling in microglia can impact hippocampus-dependent cognition in midlife, it does not demonstrate that this signaling accelerates or modulates cognitive decline (see below). Age-associated cognitive decline refers to cognitive deficits that emerge as a result of the normative brain aging process(20-21). For a cognitive deficit to be considered age-associated cognitive decline, it must be shown that the cognitive operation under study was intact at some point earlier in the adult lifespan. This requires longitudinal study designs that determine whether a manipulation impacts the relationship between brain status and cognition as animals age (22-24). Alternatively, cross-sectional studies with adequate sample sizes can be used to sample the variability in cognitive outcomes at different points of the adult lifespan(22-24) and show that this is altered by a particular manipulation. For this specific study, one would ideally demonstrate that hippocampal-based learning/memory was intact at some point in the lifespan of mice with microglial TGFb1 KO but that this manipulation accelerated or exacerbated the emergence of deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning/memory during aging. In the absence of these types of data, the authors should tone down their claims that they have identified a cellular and molecular mechanism that contributes to cognitive decline.</p>
<p>A final point of clarification for the reader pertains to the mining of previously generated data sets within this study. The language in the results section, methods, and figure legends causes confusion about which experiments were actually carried out in this study versus previous studies. Some of the language makes it sound as though parabiosis experiments and experiments using mouse models of Alzheimer's Disease were carried out in this study. However, parabiosis and AD mouse model experiments were executed in previous studies (25,26), and in the present study, RNAseq datasets were accessed for targeted data mining. It is fantastic to see further mining of datasets that already exist in the field. However, descriptions in the results and methods sections need to make it crystal clear that this is what was done.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The goal of the paper was to trace the transitions hippocampal microglia undergo along aging. ScRNA-seq analysis allowed the authors to predict a trajectory and hypothesize about possible molecular checkpoints, which keep the pace of microglial aging. E.g. TGF1b was predicted as a molecule slowing down the microglial aging path and indeed, loss of TGF1 in microglia led to premature microglia aging, which was associated with premature loss of cognitive ability. The authors also used the parabiosis model to show how peripheral, blood-derived signals from the old organism can &quot;push&quot; microglia forward on the aging path.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength and uniqueness of this work is the in-depth single-cell dataset, which may be a useful resource for the community, as well as the data showing what happens to young microglia in heterochronic parabiosis setting and upon loss of TGFb in their environment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>That said, given what we recently learned about microglia isolation for RNA-seq analysis, there is a danger that some of the observations are a result of not age, but cell stress from sample preparation (enzymatic digestion 10min at 37C; e.g. PMID: 35260865). Changes in cell state distribution along aging were made based on scRNA-seq and were not corroborated by any other method, such as imaging of cluster-specific marker expression in microglia at different ages. This analysis would allow confirming the scRNA-seq data and would also give us an idea of where the subsets are present within the hippocampus, and whether there is any interesting distribution of cell states (e.g. some are present closer to stem cells?). Since TGFb is thought to be crucial to microglia biology, it would be valuable to include more analysis of the mice with microglia-specific Tgfb deletion e.g. what was the efficiency of recombination in microglia? Did their numbers change after induction of Tgfb deletion in Cx3cr1-creERT2::Tgfb-flox mice.</p>
<p>Overall:</p>
<p>In general, I think the authors did a good job following the initial observations and devised clever ways to test the emerging hypotheses. The resulting data are an important addition to what we know about microglial aging and can be fruitfully used by other researchers, e.g. those working on microglia in a disease context.</p>
