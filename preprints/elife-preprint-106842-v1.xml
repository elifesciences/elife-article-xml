<abstract>
<p>Biomolecular condensates provide compartments that organize biological processes in the cell. Spatial organization of condensates relies on transport across phase boundaries. We investigate the kinetics of molecule transport across interfaces in phase-separated mixtures. Using non-equilibrium thermodynamics we derive the interfacial kinetics, describing the movement of the interface, and of molecular transport across the interface. In the limit of a thin interface, we show that breaking local equilibrium at the interface introduces a local transport resistance. Subsequently, using a continuum approach, we explore two physical scenarios where such a resistance emerges: a mobility minimum and a potential barrier at the interface. These scenarios lead to the same effective transport model in the sharp interface limit, characterized by a single interface resistance parameter. We discuss experimental conditions for which interface resistance could be observed and how these scenarios could be distinguished.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In biological cells, membraneless condensates can be understood as droplets of coexisting liquid phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. These condensates form biochemical compartments in the cell. Such condensates can dynamically form and dissolve, and they need to exchange molecules with their surroundings to enable biochemical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. The transport kinetics across condensate interfaces can thus impact cellular function and dysfunction. To understand how biomolecular condensates affect the dynamics of key biological processes, it is important to quantify these kinetics in the coexisting phases and across phase boundaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>].</p>
<p>Experimental assays such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) can be used to study molecular transport inside the phases and across interfaces of biological condensates. This transport is characterized by kinetic parameters such as diffusion coefficients and thermodynamic properties such as partition coefficients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Phase boundaries have been investigated in different systems with different methods, from <italic>in vivo</italic> condensates in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], to aqueous two-phase systems in chemistry and engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. For example, in the cell nucleus, protein diffusion was quantified close to the heterochromatin-euchromatin border indicating a slower protein diffusion at the phase boundary compared to the surrounding phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Other <italic>in vivo</italic> work quantified single molecule trajectories moving across the phase boundary of viral replication compartments in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] and the confinement effects that biomolecular condensates have on their constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>In reconstituted protein condensates, Taylor et al. found a low diffusion coefficient inside condensates when fitting a transport model based only on two diffusion coefficients and the partition coefficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. They suggested that this apparent slow diffusion might be an artifact of the simple transport model, and thus incorporated an interfacial resistance parameter. Such an effect had been introduced in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] in the context of ripening kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, the magnitude of this effect remains unclear due to the challenge of accurately quantifying partition coefficients by fluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], which in turn makes it difficult to create reliable fits to theoretical models. Subsequent work on other <italic>in vitro</italic> protein condensates found good agreement of a theory without interface resistance with experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>In aqueous two phase systems, made, for example, of polyethylene glycol and dextran, phase boundaries can be observed using microfluidics setups. Applying an electric field across the phase boundary, one can observe the motion of several model proteins or DNA across the phase boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Under certain conditions, this resulted in a transient accumulation of molecules at the liquid-liquid interface, slowing interfacial transport. This slowdown was attributed to the interplay between the applied electric field and the Donnan potential across the interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Recent theoretical work has discussed possible physical origins of interface resistance. For example, interfacial charge-separation was suggested to influence interfacial transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. There is also numerical evidence for interface resistance from studying a coarse-grained model of stickers and spacers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Taken together, the extent to which additional effects at the phase boundaries have to be considered requires both theoretical and experimental clarification.</p>
<p>Here, we present a general theoretical framework, based on irreversible thermodynamics, to capture interfacial transport kinetics in multi-component phaseseparated systems and discuss its application to experiments. We start by developing our approach for a binary mixture in a sharp interface limit, taking into account dissipation within the interface. Dissipation arises from differences of chemical potentials across the interface, corresponding to a phase boundary that is not at phase equilibrium. This situation is associated with interface resistance, slowing the movement of phase boundaries and molecular transport across phase boundaries. Our framework naturally extends to multiple molecular species, and we show how interface resistance influences the exchange kinetics of labeled and unlabeled molecules across a phase boundary. We then generalise our approach to a continuum theory where the interface has a finite width. We demonstrate that a potential barrier or a reduction in diffusivity within the phase boundary can contribute to interface resistance. Finally, we propose experimental settings <italic>in vitro</italic> and comment on the necessary optical resolution to detect signatures of interfacial kinetics associated with resistance and distinguish the underlying physical mechanisms.</p>

<p>This section aims to derive the fluxes of condensate and solvent (subscript “s”) molecules at the phase boundary between a dense phase (subscript “in”) and a dilute phase (subscript “out”). To this end, we consider a sharp interface model where the interface can move.</p>
<p>We start from a binary mixture with free energy density

where <italic>ϕ</italic> denotes the volume fraction of the condensate molecule. We consider an incompressible system with a constant molecular volume of the solvent <italic>ν</italic>, and a constant <italic>n</italic> denoting the molecular volume fraction between the condensate molecule and solvent. Moreover, <italic>χ</italic> is an interaction parameter characterizing the interaction between both components. The solvent volume fraction is given by <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>= 1 − <italic>ϕ</italic>. The exchange chemical potential <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> thus reads
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
and the osmotic pressure <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is given by
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The chemical potential of the condensate molecule is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, while the solvent chemical potential reads <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> = <italic>ν</italic>(<italic>P</italic> − Π), where <italic>P</italic> denotes the pressure.</p>
<p>At phase equilibrium between the phases “in” and “out”, we have <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and for the Laplace pressure, we obtain ΔΠ = Π<sup>in</sup> − Π<sup>out</sup> = Δ<italic>P</italic>, where Δ<italic>P</italic> = <italic>γ/R</italic>, is the Laplace pressure and <italic>γ</italic> denotes the surface tension.</p>
<p>The dynamic equation for condensate molecules and the solvent are:
<disp-formula id="eqn4a">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqn4a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqn4b">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqn4b.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Incompressibility implies that fluxes of solvent and condensate molecules are equal and opposite in each phase: <bold><italic>j</italic></bold><sub><bold>s</bold></sub> = − <bold><italic>j</italic></bold>.</p>
<p>Since the volume fraction <italic>ϕ</italic> jumps discontinuously at the interface when the interface moves, the flux <bold><italic>j</italic></bold> changes discontinuously, too. In the reference frame moving with the interface, the magnitude of the normal flux <italic>j</italic> = <bold><italic>n</italic></bold> · <bold><italic>j</italic></bold> is continuous across the interface, where <bold><italic>n</italic></bold> is the outward normal vector on the interface.

Analogously to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5a">Eq. (5a)</xref>, we can write the flux of solvent in the frame of the interface, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Together with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5a">Eq.

Since concentrations at the interface, in general, change discontinuously, we propose the chemical potentials <italic>μ</italic><sup>in</sup> and <italic>μ</italic><sup>out</sup> could also differ at the interface (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In this case, since the interface is considered as sharp, differences between the two chemical potentials occur at the same position, suggesting a similarity to chemical potential differences between chemical states. Irreversible thermodynamics suggests a non-linear relation between chemical potentials and the fluxes <italic>j</italic> and <italic>j</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> at the interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]:

where we introduce the difference of chemical potential <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, the difference in osmotic pressure ΔΠ = Π<sup>in</sup> − Π<sup>out</sup> and the pressure difference Δ<italic>P</italic> = <italic>P</italic> <sup>in</sup> − <italic>P</italic> <sup>out</sup> at the interface. Moreover, <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> are kinetic coefficients characterizing the resistance of the interface to approach phase equilibrium with respect to condensate molecule and solvent, respectively.

<p>If we set <italic>λ</italic> = <italic>λ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> and vary their magnitude, we find that larger interface resistance results in slower droplet growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The interface velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>is dominated by interface resistance at small radii, however, as the droplet grows, its interface velocity approaches the limit in which diffusive flux dominates interface resistance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Dynamics of labeled and unlabeled molecules</title>
<p>Experimentally, the dynamics of droplets are often studied using fluorescence microscopy. A commonly used imaging technique is fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching (FRAP). In such experiments, molecules in a defined region are bleached, and the exchange kinetics with the surroundings are studied. Thus, FRAP enables visualization of molecular motion even in steadystate systems. We thus distinguish between labeled and unlabeled condensate molecules, or equivalently, unbleached and bleached molecules in a FRAP experiment (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). In our theory, the key assumption is that labeled and unlabeled molecules show the same physical behaviour (same molecular volume <italic>nν</italic> and interaction parameter <italic>χ</italic>). However, being able to distinguish both gives rise to a mixing entropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>

<caption><title>Influence of interface resistance on FRAP recovery.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold>: In a typical FRAP experiment, the droplet is close to equilibrium prior to the experiment. The fluorescent dye labeling the condensate material gets bleached, and is therefore not visible in fluorescence microscopy (unlabeled, white). Subsequently, the exchange of labeled and unlabeled material across the phase boundary can be observed. <bold>(B)</bold>: The ratio between the concentrations right inside and outside (see panel (A), <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>in</sub>, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>out</sub>) starts at zero (postbleach).

For the case of interface resistance, the concentration ratio approaches the equilibrium value continuously. <bold>(C)</bold> Time course of FRAP recovery with and without interface resistance.

This initial condition is the situation after fully bleaching the droplets, i.e., the droplet contains only condensate molecules of type 2 (without a label). The following kinetics of exchanging the unlabeled molecules of type 2 with labeled molecules of type 1 in time corresponds to Fluoresecence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) as observed experimentally (sketch in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Refs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]). This recovery depends on the interface resistance <italic>ρ</italic> that is set by thermodynamic parameters and the kinetic coefficient <italic>λ</italic> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn24">Eq. (24)</xref>).</p>
<p>The time course starts right after bleaching at time <italic>t</italic> = 0 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). In the case for no interface resistance (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0), the equilibration occurs infinitely fast and the partition ratio reaches the partition coefficient immediately (dashed line). For non-zero interface resistance, the partition ratio approaches the partition coefficient asymptotically. This can also be seen in the time course of volume fraction profiles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). As a result, gradients in the volume fraction of labeled molecules are weaker in the interface resistance case than the noresistance case at comparable recovery stages. Since interface resistance is a kinetic phenomenon, the equilibrium volume fractions are identical.</p>
<p>Interestingly, interface resistance can also be modeled by using a finite-width interface-compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], between the dense and dilute phases, which we present in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix A</xref>. This three-compartment model is of relevance, for example when interface resistance results from a wetted surface layer on condensate interfaces. In the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix A</xref> we show that the three-compartment model reduces to an effective interface resistance model in the limit of a narrow interface and when either of the following conditions is satisfied: (a) Small diffusion coefficient and finite partitioning into the interface. This corresponds to the mobility minimum scenario, which we discuss in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3a">Sect. III A</xref>. (b) Finite diffusion coefficient and small partitioning into the interface.

However, even during early times such measurements are impossible with current techniques for samples with a large fraction of labeled molecules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), due to the large point-spread function (<italic>&gt;</italic> 250 <italic>μm</italic>) compared to the interface width seen in experiments and simulations (<italic>&lt;</italic> 10 <italic>μm</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Assuming such a 25fold difference we see a completely smoothed-out interface (dashed lines in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), where the dashed lines become hardly distinguishable. However, recent progress in single-molecule imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] enables nanometer resolution imaging, and thus provides an exciting opportunity to study phase boundaries in detail.</p>
<p>As labels are not always available or desirable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] an alternative for measuring interface resistance could be provided by microfluidics as depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. Briefly, a channel that contains the dense phase is connected on one side to a fluid channel below the saturation concentration (<italic>ϕ</italic><sub>sub</sub> in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), which effectively keeps the boundary concentration constant. Due to diffusive material exchange, the dense phase will shrink, and the resulting speed of the phase boundary will depend on the interface resistance. Here, the most robust read-out can be obtained at long times, provided the experimental assay is sufficiently stable. We note that the dynamics are sensitive to the experimental set-up, in particular with respect to channel length and outside concentration <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>sub</sub>. Generally, a large concentration difference seems desirable between the outside reservoir and the capillary containing the dense phase.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework to study the kinetics of molecules across an interface between two coexisting liquid phases. Molecule transport can lead to movement of this interface and to material exchange between the two phases. We started by deriving the interfacial kinetics in the thin-interface limit. Crucially, we allow for a discontinuity in the chemical potential at the interface, which naturally leads to interface resistance, as proposed for droplet growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] and particle exchange across liquid-liquid interfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Our theory extends to multiple molecular species. We show that interface resistance leads to a slow-down in interfacial movement in a binary mixture, and, if part of the molecules are labeled, a decelerated molecule exchange between labeled and unlabeled molecules across the phase boundary. We then present continuous transport models that introduce interface resistance, either by slowing down diffusion at the interface, or by introducing a potential barrier at the interface.</p>
<p>Our theory comes at a time when transport across phase boundaries is receiving renewed interest, both in biology and engineering. For example, a number of works have described how client molecules that are not involved in phase separation travel across a stationary liquidliquid phase boundary in aqueous two-phase systems in an external electrical field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. A transient accumulation of material at the interface was observed. This accumulation is reminiscent of interface resistance, and has been attributed to the Donnan potential across the interface and its interaction with the electric field that was applied across the interface. This interplay was suggested to cause a local potential well, where molecules are trapped. This corresponds to the opposite of the potential barrier case discussed here. A main difference is that in the experiments, due to the electric field, no equilibrium distribution comparable to ours can be observed – particles eventually desorb from the boundary and travel across the entire system.</p>
<p>For biomolecular condensates, it was suggested that interface resistance is required to explain FRAP recovery curves of the protein LAF-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Taylor et al. found that the slow recovery of condensates could not be accounted for based on the measured diffusion and partition coefficients. By introducing an interface resistance parameter the discrepancy was resolved. However, adding this new parameter to the model led to a reduced fit quality (see Fig. 11 in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]), indicating that these fits do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that interface resistance governs the FRAP recovery of LAF-1. Using the available spatio-temporal resolution of the data could improve the parameter quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>We suggest a number of ways to measure interface resistance despite current optical limitations in resolving the phase boundary. Similar to the FRAP measurements performed in Ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], we suggest measuring the FRAP halftime. However, ideally this would be done for differently sized condensates and by also using the spatial information available, instead of integrating the intensity over the entire droplet. This has the advantage of directly measuring <italic>D</italic><sub>in</sub>, which avoids any confusion between the time scale associated with the interface and that associated with diffusion inside the droplet. Even without labeled molecules, interface resistance could be measured by examining droplet growth, for example using a microfluidic setup as proposed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>. In conclusion, our framework can guide further experiments to quantify interface resistance and decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>

<title>Interface compartment model</title>
<p>The interface compartment extends from position − <italic>a</italic> to <italic>a</italic> and we denote the space-dependent interface volume fraction profile as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline25.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and the constant diffusion coefficient in the interface compartment as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline26.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. We have a diffusion equation in each compartment
<disp-formula id="eqnA1">

</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqnA2">

</disp-formula>
<disp-formula id="eqnA3">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqnA3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which are coupled by non-trivial boundary conditions where the compartments meet (at −<italic>a</italic> and <italic>a</italic>)
<disp-formula id="eqnA4">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqnA4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where we have introduced the two partition coefficients, which describe how enriched the dense and the dilute phases are with respect to the interface at the boundary, respectively. For a narrow interface <italic>a ≪</italic> 1 we assume that the interface compartment rapidly reaches a steady state, characterized by a constant flux in space <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. This constant flux implies a linear volume fraction profile inside the interface compartment. Continuity then implies that, at the boundaries between the interface compartment and the two phases, we have <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline29.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, so that
<disp-formula id="eqnA5">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqnA5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The linearity of the volume fraction profile in the interface compartment allows us to write
<disp-formula id="eqnA6">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqnA6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Combining this expression with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA4">Eqs. (A4)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqnA5">(A5)</xref>, we have that
<disp-formula id="eqnA7">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqnA7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
which, identifying,
<disp-formula id="eqnA8">
<graphic xlink:href="629798v2_eqnA8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
corresponds to the interface resistance boundary condition obtained for the effective droplet model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn25">Eq. (25)</xref> if we define <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline30.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Since <italic>a</italic> is small we need to require the ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline31.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to be small as well to obtain a finite interface resistance <italic>ρ</italic>. This can be achieved by having a small diffusion coefficient <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="629798v2_inline32.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, which is what we discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3a">Section III A</xref> for the case of a mobility minimum at the interface. A finite interface resistance can also arise for large partition coefficients enriching the two phases with respect to the interface compartment (Γ<sup>in</sup> <italic>≫</italic> 1 and Γ<sup>out</sup> <italic>≫</italic> 1, with finite Γ). This latter case corresponds to a potential barrier in the interface, as discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3b">Section III B</xref>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors theoretically address the topic of interface resistance between a phase-separated condensate and the surrounding dilute phase. In a nutshell, &quot;interface resistance&quot; occurs if material in the dilute phase can only slowly pass through the interface region to enter the dense phase. There is some evidence from FRAP experiments that such a resistance may exist, and if it does, it could be biologically relevant insofar as the movement of material between dense and dilute phases can be rate-limiting for biological processes, including coarsening. The current study theoretically addresses interface resistance at two levels of description: first, the authors present a simple way of formulating interface resistance for a sharp interface model. Second, they derive a formula for interface resistance for a finite-width interface and present two scenarios where the interface resistance might be substantial.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The topic is of broad relevance to the important field of intracellular phase separation, and the work is overall credible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a few problems with the study as presented - mainly that the key formula for the latter section has already been derived and presented in Reference 6 (notably also in this journal), and that the physical basis for the proposed scenarios leading to a large interface resistance is not clearly supported.</p>
<p>(1) As noted, Equation 32 of the current study is entirely equivalent to Equation 8 of Reference 6, with a very similar derivation presented in Appendix 1 of that paper. In fact, Equation 8 in Reference 6 takes one more step by combining Equations 32 and 35 to provide a general expression for the interface resistance in an integral form. These prior results should be properly cited in the current work - the existing citations to Reference 6 do not make this overlap apparent.</p>
<p>(2) The authors of the current study go on to examine cases where this shared equation (here Equation 32) might imply a large interface resistance. The examples are mathematically correct, but physically unsupported. In order to produce a substantial interface resistance, the current authors have to suppose that in the interface region between the dense and dilute phases, either there is a local minimum of the diffusion coefficient or a local minimum of the density. I am not aware of any realistic model that would produce either of these minima. Indeed, the authors do not present sufficient examples or physical arguments that would support the existence of such minima.</p>
<p>In my view, these two issues limit the general interest of the latter portion of the current manuscript. While point 1 can be remedied by proper citation, point 2 is not so simple to address. The two ways the authors present to produce a substantial interface resistance seem to me to be mathematical exercises without a physical basis. The manuscript will improve if the authors can provide examples or compelling arguments for a minimum of either diffusion coefficient or density between the dense and dilute phases that would address point 2.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work provides a general theoretical framework for understanding molecular transport across liquid-liquid phase boundaries, focusing on interfacial resistance arising from deviations from local equilibrium. By bridging sharp and continuous interface descriptions, the authors demonstrate how distinct microscopic mechanisms can yield similar effective kinetics and propose practical experimental validation strategies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Conceptually rich and physically insightful interface resistance formulation in sharp and continuous limits.</p>
<p>(2) Strong integration of non-equilibrium thermodynamics with biologically motivated transport scenarios.</p>
<p>(3) Thorough numerical and analytical support, with thoughtful connection to current and emerging experimental techniques.</p>
<p>(4) Relevance to various systems, including biomolecular condensates and engineered aqueous two-phase systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The work remains theoretical, mainly, with limited direct comparison to quantitative experimental data.</p>
<p>(2) The biological implications are only briefly explored; further discussion of specific systems where interface resistance might play a functional role would enhance the impact.</p>
<p>(3) Some model assumptions (e.g., symmetric labeling or idealized diffusivity profiles) could be further contextualized regarding biological variability.</p>

<p>The manuscript investigated the kinetics of molecule transport across interfaces in phase-separated mixtures. Through the development of a theoretical approach for a binary mixture in a sharp interface limit, the authors found that interface resistance leads to a slowdown in interfacial movement. Subsequently, they extended this approach to multiple molecular species (incorporating both labeled and unlabeled molecules) and continuous transport models. Finally, they proposed experimental settings in vitro and commented on the necessary optical resolution to detect signatures of interfacial kinetics associated with resistance.</p>
<p>The investigation of transport kinetics across biomolecular condensate interfaces holds significant relevance for understanding cellular function and dysfunction mechanisms; thus, the topic is important and timely. However, the current manuscript presentation requires improvement. Firstly, the inclusion of numerous equations in the main text substantially compromises readability, and relocation of a part of the formulae and derivations to the Appendix would be more appropriate. Secondly, the manuscript would benefit from more comprehensive comparisons with existing theoretical studies on molecular transport kinetics. The text should also be written to be more approachable for a general readership. Modifications and sufficient responses to the specific points outlined below are recommended.</p>
<p>(1) The authors introduced a theoretical framework to study the kinetics of molecules across an interface between two coexisting liquid phases and found that interface resistance leads to a slowdown in interfacial movement in a binary mixture and a decelerated molecule exchange between labeled and unlabeled molecules across the phase boundary. However, these findings appear rather expected. The work would be strengthened by a more thorough discussion of the kinetics of molecule transport across interfaces (such as the physical origin of the interface resistance and its specific impact on transport kinetics).</p>
<p>(2) The formulae in the manuscript should be checked and corrected. Notably, Equation 10 contains &quot;\phi_2\ln\phi_2&quot; while Eq. 11b shows &quot;n^{-1}\ln\phi_2&quot;, suggesting a missing factor of &quot;n^{-1}&quot;. Similarly, Equation 18 obtained from Equation 11: the logarithmic term in Eq.11a is &quot;n^{-1}\ln phi_1-\ln(1-\phi)&quot; but the pre-exponential factor in Equation 18a is just &quot;\phi_1/(1-\phi*)&quot;, where is &quot;n^{-1}&quot;? Additionally, there is a unit inconsistency in Equation 36, where the unit of \rho (s/m) does not match that of the right-hand side expression (s/m^2).</p>
<p>(3) The authors stated that the numerical solutions are obtained using a custom finite difference scheme implemented in MATLAB in the Appendix. The description of numerical methods is insufficiently detailed and needs to be expanded, including specific equations or models used to obtain specific figures, the introduction of initial and boundary conditions, the choices of parameters and their reasons in terms of the biology.</p>
<p>(4) The authors claimed that their framework naturally extends to multiple molecular species, but only showed the situation of labeled and unlabeled molecules across a phase boundary. How about three or more molecular species? Does this framework still work? This should be added to strengthen the manuscript and confirm the framework's general applicability.</p>

<p>We agree and will make the overlap explicit, acknowledging priority and clarifying what is new here. The initial version of the preprint of Zhang et al. (2022) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484641v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484641v1</ext-link>) lacked the derivation (it referenced a Supplementary Note not yet available); it was added during the eLife submission. We worked from the preprint and missed this update, which we will now correct.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer on the physical plausibility of these scenarios there is both concrete experimental and theoretical evidence for the scenarios we discussed.</p>
<p>Experimental: Strom et al. (2017) (our reference 11) describes a substantially reduced protein diffusion coefficient at an in vivo phase boundary, while Hahn et al. (2011a) and Hahn et al. (2011b) (our references 27 and 28) describe transient accumulation of molecules at a phase boundary, which they attribute to the Donnan potential, but conceivably a lowered mobility could play a role.</p>
<p>Theoretical: Recent work (e.g., Majee et al. (2024)) shows that charged layers could form at phase boundaries, which could either repel or attract incoming molecules, depending on their charge, thus altering the local volume fraction, resulting in a trough or peak. Arguably, the model put forth by Zhang et al. (2024) could be mapped to a potential wall, where particles are reflected, unless in a certain state. We will add sentences to the corresponding results section, as well as the discussion to make this plausibility more apparent.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer, an experimental manuscript is in progress.</p>
<p>(2) The biological implications are only briefly explored; further discussion of specific systems where interface resistance might play a functional role would enhance the impact.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We will add several such scenarios to the discussion, including the possibility to use interface resistance as a way of ordering biochemical reactions in time, as well as their potential to exclude molecules from condensates for long time periods, which, while not effective in the long-time limit, could help on cellular timescales of minutes to hours to respond to transient events.</p>

<p>(3) Some model assumptions (e.g., symmetric labeling or idealized diffusivity profiles) could be further contextualized regarding biological variability.</p>

<p>The treatment of labelled and unlabelled molecules as physically identical is well supported by our experiments. Droplets under typical experimental conditions, i.e. when bleaching is not too strong, do not markedly change size or volume fraction of molecules, which would be expected if the physical properties like molecular volume or interaction strength were significantly changed. However, we do agree that in more extreme bleaching regimes the bleach step itself will change the droplet properties, but this can be avoided by tuning the FRAP laser power and dwell times accordingly.</p>
<p>Our diffusivity profiles are chosen in the simplest possible way to handle typical experimental constraints (large D outside, lower D inside, potentially lowered D at the boundary) and allow for a mean-field treatment. To the best of our knowledge, the precise make-up and concentration profiles of phase boundaries in biomolecular condensates are not currently known, due to limitations in optical resolution.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript investigated the kinetics of molecule transport across interfaces in phase-separated mixtures. Through the development of a theoretical approach for a binary mixture in a sharp interface limit, the authors found that interface resistance leads to a slowdown in interfacial movement. Subsequently, they extended this approach to multiple molecular species (incorporating both labeled and unlabeled molecules) and continuous transport models. Finally, they proposed experimental settings in vitro and commented on the necessary optical resolution to detect signatures of interfacial kinetics associated with resistance.</p>
<p>The investigation of transport kinetics across biomolecular condensate interfaces holds significant relevance for understanding cellular function and dysfunction mechanisms; thus, the topic is important and timely. However, the current manuscript presentation requires improvement. Firstly, the inclusion of numerous equations in the main text substantially compromises readability, and relocation of a part of the formulae and derivations to the Appendix would be more appropriate. Secondly, the manuscript would benefit from more comprehensive comparisons with existing theoretical studies on molecular transport kinetics. The text should also be written to be more approachable for a general readership. Modifications and sufficient responses to the specific points outlined below are recommended.</p>
<p>(1) The authors introduced a theoretical framework to study the kinetics of molecules across an interface between two coexisting liquid phases and found that interface resistance leads to a slowdown in interfacial movement in a binary mixture and a decelerated molecule exchange between labeled and unlabeled molecules across the phase boundary. However, these findings appear rather expected. The work would be strengthened by a more thorough discussion of the kinetics of molecule transport across interfaces (such as the physical origin of the interface resistance and its specific impact on transport kinetics).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and will discuss possible mechanisms and how they map to our meanfield model in more detail, both in the corresponding results section, and in the discussion, as also outlined in our response to Reviewer #1.</p>

<p>(2) The formulae in the manuscript should be checked and corrected. Notably, Equation 10 contains &quot;\phi_2\ln\phi_2&quot; while Eq. 11b shows &quot;n^{-1}\ln\phi_2&quot;, suggesting a missing factor of &quot;n^{-1}&quot;. Similarly, Equation 18 obtained from Equation 11: the logarithmic term in Eq.11a is &quot;n<sup>^</sup>{-1}\ln phi_1-\ln(1-\phi)&quot; but the pre-exponential factor in Equation 18a is just &quot;\phi_1/(1-\phi*)&quot;, where is &quot;n<sup>^</sup>{-1}&quot;? Additionally, there is a unit inconsistency in Equation 36, where the unit of \rho (s/m) does not match that of the right-hand side expression (s/m<sup>^</sup>2).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer. We identified that the error originates in the inline definition of the exchange chemical potential, already before equation 11. We inadvertently dropped a prefactor of n, which then shows up in the following equation as an exponent to (1-phi<sup>^</sup>*). Very importantly this means the main result eq. 25 still holds, and in the revised manuscript we will correct the ensuing typographical mistakes.</p>

<p>(3) The authors stated that the numerical solutions are obtained using a custom finite difference scheme implemented in MATLAB in the Appendix. The description of numerical methods is insufficiently detailed and needs to be expanded, including specific equations or models used to obtain specific figures, the introduction of initial and boundary conditions, the choices of parameters and their reasons in terms of the biology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will substantially expand the Appendix for the numerical solutions and add an explanatory file to the repository to make clear how the code can be run, as well as its dependencies.</p>

<p>(4) The authors claimed that their framework naturally extends to multiple molecular species, but only showed the situation of labeled and unlabeled molecules across a phase boundary. How about three or more molecular species? Does this framework still work? This should be added to strengthen the manuscript and confirm the framework's general applicability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have shown in Bo et al. (2021) that the labelling approach can be carried over to multi-component systems. Each species may, for example, encounter its own interface resistance. We will discuss this in more detail in the revised manuscript.</p>
