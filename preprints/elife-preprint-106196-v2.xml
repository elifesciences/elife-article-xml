<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In every cell, thousands of DNA lesions are induced by endogenous and environmental agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). To overcome their deleterious effects, cells have evolved an intricate network of DNA damage response pathways that detect, signal and repair DNA lesions. These pathways work in coordination with key physiological processes, such as cell cycle progression, chromatin remodeling, and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Cancer cells typically exhibit higher levels of genotoxic stress than non-transformed cells due to their altered metabolism and high proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). As a complement to radiotherapy and chemotherapy that overload cancer cells with DNA lesions, the aim of novel anti-cancer strategies is to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to genotoxic stress by targeting DNA damage signaling and DNA repair mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, ATR signaling activates cell cycle checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), promotes DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), regulates the firing of replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), and the cellular pool of deoxyribonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The ATR signaling pathway is also essential for the proliferation of cancer cells that display intrinsically higher levels of genotoxic stress. Therefore, several clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of ATR inhibitors in patients with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), particularly cancers in which the oncogene CDC25A is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). However, as kinase inhibitors oven exert a strong selective pressure for the acquisition of drug resistance through kinase mutations, alternative therapeutic options must be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike classical approaches that target the activity of a specific protein with small molecule inhibitors, recent cell biology advances suggest that targeting biomolecular condensates may provide conceptually novel approaches to drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Biomolecular condensates are subcellular compartments that selectively concentrate hundreds of proteins and nucleic acids, without a surrounding membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). These structures underlie the spatiotemporal organization of multiple biological processes. Moreover, the aberrant properties of condensates have been implicated in many diseases, including neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy, cancer and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Condensate formation is typically driven by multivalent scaffold proteins that function as central nodes in molecular networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Therefore, one potential approach to disturb the condensate properties and functions is to interfere with their essential protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions.</p>
<p>In humans, the main ATR activator in S phase is Topoisomerase IIβ binding protein 1 (TopBP1), a scaffold protein that includes nine BRCA1 carboxyl terminal (BRCT) protein-protein interaction motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and an intrinsically disordered ATR-activation domain located between BRCT6 and BRCT7-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Recent studies indicate that TopBP1 activates the ATR signaling pathway via the formation of biomolecular condensates, which appear as nuclear foci by immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The available evidence suggests that ATR activation is a multistep process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). TopBP1 is recruited to ATR-activating DNA structures by MRE11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and binds to RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), ATRIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) and the 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) to form a stable ATR-activating complex. Then, TopBP1 is phosphorylated by the basal kinase activity of ATR, triggering the assembly of TopBP1 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). We found that TopBP1 condensation functions as a molecular switch that amplifies ATR activity up to the level required for signal transduction by the checkpoint effector kinase Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we explored the feasibility of targeting TopBP1 condensates as a novel strategy to interfere with ATR signaling and sensitize colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. We present a high throughput optogenetic screening approach to identify small-molecule modulators of TopBP1 condensation. Using this approach, we identified AZD2858, a known glycogen synthase 3β (GSK-3β) inhibitor, as a potential modulator of TopBP1 condensation. We demonstrated in a CRC cell line that AZD2858 (at very low doses) inhibits the assembly of endogenous TopBP1 and suppresses the activation of the ATR/Chk1 pathway induced by the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan. Furthermore, the combination of AZD2858 with FOLFIRI (5-fluorouracil + SN-38) displayed a synergistic effect in CRC cell spheroid cultures, including in spheroids from CRC cells resistant to SN-38. Incubation with AZD2858 for 6-12 hours improved the induction of apoptosis by SN-38 and FOLFIRI by dampening the S checkpoint. Our observations suggest that the cytotoxic effects observed with the AZD2858 and SN-38 combination are mainly explained by disruption of TopBP1 assembly, rather than by the direct involvement of the GSK-3β pathway. These data support the feasibility of targeting condensates formed in response to DNA damage to improve chemotherapy-based cancer treatments.</p>

<p>Flp-In# 293 T-REx cells were obtained from Thermo Fisher and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)-GlutaMAX medium (Merck-Sigma-Aldrich, #D5796) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS). For the generation of stable cell lines that express TopBP1 fused to the photoreceptor cryptochrome 2 (Cry2) and mCherry (optoTopBP1), please refer to Frattini et al., 2024 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The HCT116 human CRC cell line was obtained from Horizon (#HD-PAR-082). The human SW620, SW480, HT29 and murine CT26 CRC cell lines from ATCC. (CT26.WT -CRL-2638, HCT116-CCL247,</p>
<p>HT29-HTB-38, SW620-CCL-227, SW480-CCL228) The control human colon cell line CCD 841 CoN was also obtained from ATCC (CCD 841 CoN-CRL-1790). The SN-38-resistant clones HCT116-SN6 (low-level resistance) and HCT116-SN50 (high-level resistance) were generated in the laboratory as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Briefly, parental HCT116 cells were grown in the presence of 10 nmol/L or 15 nmol/L SN-38, respectively. SW620 shLuc and SW620 shGSK3-β cells were kindly provided by Maguy Del Rio. The description of their generation can be found in Cherradi et al. 2023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). All CRC cell lines were grown in and cultured in RPMI medium (Merck-Sigma-Aldrich, #R8758) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. All cell lines were maintained at 37°C in saturated humidity with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. All cell lines were tested and authenticated by short-tandem repeat profiling (Eurofins Genomics). Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination.</p>

<title>Screening</title>
<p>OptoTopBP1-expressing Flp-In 293 T-Rex cells were seeded in a 384-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells/well in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 µg/ml doxycycline and allowed to attittiach overnight. Then, cells were incubated with the TargetMol library compounds at the concentration of 10 µM for 2 h. From the 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO, each compound was diluted to 2 mM (intermediated dilution) before addition to the wells by automated pipetting at a final concentration of 10µM. Aver incubation, cells were exposed to cycling pulses (4 s 8ON9, 10 s 8OFF9) of 488 nm blue light for 5 min. Cells were fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Euromedex, #15710-S) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS twice and permeabilized in PBS/0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Cells were rinsed in PBS twice and nuclei were counterstained with 1 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #62249). Imaging was performed with the Opera PHENIX system at the Montpellier Ressources Imagerie facility.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Whole cell extracts were obtained by lysing cells in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 8) on ice for 30 min. Aver sonication (40% amplitude, 3 cycles of 3 s sonication and 3 s resting), the protein amount was quantified using the Pierce# BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher #23225). Laemmli buffer was added, and protein extracts were boiled at 95°C for 5 min. 40 μg of protein samples were resolved on precast SDS-PAGE gels (4-15%, 7.5% and 10%, BioRad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Turbo transfer device. Membranes were saturated in 5% non-fat milk diluted in TBS (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4)-0.1 % Tween 20, and incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The used antibodies were against Chk1 phosphorylated at S345 (Cell Signaling Technology, #2348), Chk1 (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, #sc8408), Chk2 phosphorylated at T68 (Cell Signaling Technology, #2661S), Chk2 (Milipore, #05-649), TopBP1 (Euromedex, #A300-111A or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-271043), ATM phosphorylated at S1981 (Rockland, #200-301-400), α-tubulin (Sigma, #T5168), RPA phosphorylated at S33 (Abcam, #ab2118877), RPA (Abcam, #AB2175), GSK-3β phosphorylated at S9 (Cell Signaling Technology, #9336), GSK-3β (Cell Signaling Technology, #9832), PARP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-8007), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, #9661).

Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA/PBS at RT for 20 min. Non-specific epitopes were saturated with a blocking solution (5% BSA/PBS) at RT for 30 min. For immunostaining, anti-TopBP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-271043, diluted at 1/100), anti-53BP1 (Cell Signaling Technology, #4937S) or anti-PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-966, diluted at 1/300) primary antibodies and the anti-mouse coupled to fluorochrome (Invitrogen, #A-11011, diluted at 1/500) secondary antibody were diluted in blocking solution and incubated for 1 h or 45 min, respectively. Three 5-min washes between incubation steps were performed in PBS/0.1% Tween 20 at RT. Hoechst was used at 1 µg/mL for DNA staining and coverslips were mounted on slides with the Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, #P36930). Images were captured using a 63 X objective and a Zeiss AxioImager with ApoTome at the Montpellier Ressources Imagerie facility.</p>

<p>For the immunofluorescence quantification of foci (TopBP1 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and 53BP1 <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>), all conditions were first compared using one-way ANOVA and confirmed using non-parametric unpaired Mann-Whitney tests on GraphPad Prism version 10.2.1 (the non-normal distributions of foci limited the precision of the ANOVA analyses). SN-38 vs SN-38+AZD2858 (Mann-Whitney); TopBP1 : p-value&lt;0.0001 ; 53BP1 : p-value&lt;0.0001. In addition, we conducted in-depth statistical analyses on R to complete the results obtained with GraphPad. Specifically, for TopBP1 foci, an ANOVA analysis of a generalized linear model (modeling TopBP1 foci number with a Poisson distribution) was performed to confirm this. The ANOVA test shows that SN38 and AZD2858 treatments exhibit significantly negative interaction on TopBP1 foci number (SN38 treatment p-value&lt;2.2e-16; AZD2858 treatment p-value&lt;2.2e-16; SN38:AZD2858 interaction p-value&lt;2.2e-16). For PML foci (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>), all conditions were first compared using Kruskal-Wallis on GraphPad Prism and p-value&lt;0.0001 was obtained. Then, Dunn9s multiple comparison test was conducted to specifically compare the Arsenic condition with the following treatments: untreated cells, AZD2858, SN-38, and SN-38+AZD2858. In each comparison, the p-value was &lt;0.0001.</p>
<p>For DNA fiber analyses, groups were first compared using one-way ANOVA and confirmed using unpaired t-tests on GraphPad Prism version 10.2.1 (the non-normal distributions of CldU tracts length limited the precision of the ANOVA analyses, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, we conducted in-depth statistical analyses on R to complete the results obtained with GraphPad : ANOVA analysis of a generalized linear model (modeling replication tract length with a gamma distribution) shows that both drugs, as well as their interaction, have a significant effect on tract length (p-value for SN38 treatment: &lt; 2.2e-16; for AZD2858 treatment: 0.01129; for their interaction: 2.651e-06). We did not detect a significant effect of biological replicate identity (p-value=0.26274).</p>
<p>For cytometry analyses, linear regression analysis was performed on R (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

For S-phase analysis, both treatment duration (6h vs. 12h) and nature of treatment (untreated, AZD2858-treated, SN38-treated or (AZD2858+SN38)-treated) have a significant effect on the proportion of cells in S phase in the endpoint experiment (p=0.00308 for treatment duration, p=2.14e-06 for nature of treatment). Interaction between treatment nature and duration did not appear significant (p=0.05942): AZD2858-treated and untreated cells tend to have higher S phase cell counts than SN38-treated and (AZD2858+SN38)-treated cells, regardless of treatment duration; and increasing treatment duration (from 6 to 12h) decreases S phase cell count, regardless of treatment nature. For S-entry analysis, both treatment duration (6h vs. 12h) and nature of treatment (untreated, AZD2858-treated, SN38-treated or (AZD2858+SN38)-treated) have a significant effect on the proportion of cells in SE phase in the pulse-chase experiment (p=0.0173 for treatment duration, p=4.03e-06 for nature of treatment). Interaction between treatment nature and duration also has a significant effect (p=0.00865): AZD2858-treated and untreated cells tend to have higher SE cell counts than SN38-treated and (AZD2858+SN38)-treated cells, but that difference is larger aver a 6h treatment than a 12h treatment. For G2 phase analysis, treatment duration (6h vs. 12h) has a significant effect on the proportion of cells in G2 phase in the pulse-chase experiment (p=0.000363). The nature of the administered treatment significantly alters the effect of duration (interaction between treatment nature and treatment duration: p=0.000340), with SN38-treated and (AZD2858+SN38)-treated cells exhibiting similar proportion of G2 cells aver 6 and 12h of treatment, while untreated and AZD2858-treated cells undergo a drop in G2 cell count between 6 and 12h of treatment.

<title>Identifying modulators of TopBP1 condensation with an optogenetic approach</title>
<p>Resistance to conventional chemotherapies is the major cause of therapy failure in patients with cancer. In CRC, irinotecan resistance is oven caused by overexpression of efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). However, additional pathways may also contribute, particularly the DNA damage response pathways that are frequently activated in various cancer types to cope with increased DNA replication stress. TopBP1 has been implicated in oxaliplatin resistance in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) and is overexpressed in several cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). We first examined the number of TopBP1 condensates in the CRC cell lines HCT116 and HCT116-SN50 (50-fold more resistant to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, than the parental HCT116 cell line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) and observed a significantly higher number of TopBP1 foci in HCT116-SN50 cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). Moreover, our previous findings suggest that TopBP1 condensation is required to amplify ATR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Therefore, targeting TopBP1 assembly could be a promising strategy for cancer treatment. To this end, we developed an optogenetic system for screening molecules that modulate the formation of TopBP1 condensates. We used the stable Flp-In 293 T-Rex cell line in which expression of TopBP1 fused to the photoreceptor Cry2 and mCherry (optoTopBP1) is induced by doxycycline. Cry2 forms tetramers when exposed to 488 nm light and thereby nucleates the assembly of TopBP1 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). The advantage of this optogenetic approach is that TopBP1 condensates are formed on demand, within minutes, in the absence of DNA damaging agents that can induce confounding effects aver prolonged treatment. Aver a 2-hour incubation step of optoTopBP1-expressing Flp-In 293 T-Rex cells with 10 µM of each molecule from the TargetMol library of preclinical and clinical compounds, we exposed cells to an array of blue light-emitting diodes for 5 min of light-dark cycles (4 s light followed by 10 s dark) to induce optoTopBP1 condensation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Aver quantification of the number of TopBP1 foci per nucleus, we assigned a z-score to each candidate molecule based on this count. We considered molecules with a z-score lower than -2 as potential TopBP1 condensation inhibitors (red dots in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We identified &gt;300 molecules that could be potential TopBP1 condensation inhibitors among the 4730 compounds. Then, we selected 131 compounds (based on the best z-scores) and assessed their effect on the ATR pathway activation in HCT116 cells using two complementary approaches. First, we evaluated these compounds at two low concentrations (1 and 10 µM) using a quantitative immunofluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) in flat-bottittiomed 384-well plates to monitor phosphorylation at S315 of the kinase effector Chk1 following incubation with SN-38 alone or with each of the 131 pre-selected compounds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This allowed us to select the ten most effective drugs (MCB-613, OTSSP167, AZD2858, P005091, Tubercidin, Dactolisib, Physalin F, PFK158, PF562271, Torkinib) based on their ability to inhibit Chk1 phosphorylation. For the second approach, we incubated HCT116 cells with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and SN-38 (FOLFIRI thereaver) to mimic <italic>in vitro</italic> the first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with metastatic CRC (i.e., FOLFIRI: folic acid or leucovorin, 5-FU, and irinotecan) and each of the ten drugs and detected their interactions using a full-range dose matrix approach and SRB cytotoxicity assays. We quantified cell survival and the additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects. We observed the strongest synergistic interactions between FOLFIRI and AZD2858 (a known GSK-3β inhibitor). Consequently, we focused our study on AZD2858, which was efficient already at 1 µM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<title>AZD2858 hampers SN-38-induced endogenous TopBP1 condensate formation and ATR activation</title>
<p>We then evaluated AZD2858 capacity to modulate endogenous TopBP1 condensation in HCT116 cells. To this aim, we induced TopBP1 condensation by incubating cells with 300 nM SN-38 or/and 100 nM AZD2858 for 2 h. Co-incubation with AZD2858 resulted in a significant reduction in the number of endogenous TopBP1 condensates per nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Co-incubation with AZD2858 also led to a decrease in the number of 53BP1 foci (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>). 53BP1 forms biomolecular condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) and might interact with TopBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Conversely, co-incubation with AZD2858 did not modulate the number of PML nuclear bodies, which are membrane-less organelles unlike the Arsenic treatment, which is known to induce the formation of PML nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). We then evaluated the effect of incubation of HCT116 cells with AZD2858 or/and SN-38 for 2 hours on ATR signaling (TopBP1 target), as well as on ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated), another phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related protein kinase. Western blot analysis showed that SN-38-mediated ATR signaling induction was severely reduced by co-incubation with 100 nM AZD2858, as indicated by the decrease in Chk1 phosphorylated at S345, and RPA32 phosphorylated at S33 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We obtained a similar result for Chk1 phosphorylated at S345 using the Celigo cytometer in cells incubated with AZD2858 and FOLFIRI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Co-incubation of AZD2858 with SN-38 or FOLFIRI did not affect the ATM pathway, as indicated by the unchanged levels of ATM phosphorylated at S1981 and Chk2 phosphorylated at T68 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3A</xref><bold>)</bold>. The level of γH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, was not affected by co-incubation with AZD2858 and SN-38 (or FOLFIRI) compared with SN-38 (or FOLFIRI) alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>). We obtained similar results (i.e. decrease in Chk1 phosphorylated at S345 and unchanged γH2AX levels) aver co-incubation with FOLFIRI+AZD2858 for 20 hours (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Altogether, these findings suggest that AZD2858 significantly affects the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway by inhibiting the assembly of TopBP1 condensates induced by the DNA-damaging agent SN-38.</p>

<title>AZD2858 modulates ATR/Chk1 signaling by disrupting TopBP1 assembly</title>
<p>As AZD2858 is a known GSK-3β inhibitor, we asked whether its effects on the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway might be mediated by inhibiting the GSK-3β pathway. We incubated SW620 cells in which endogenous GSK-3β was depleted or not by shRNA with SN-38 or/and AZD2858 (0.1 and 1 µM) for 2 hours. SN-38-induced Chk1 phosphorylation at S345 was comparable in GSK3-β-depleted cells (shGSK3) and control cells (shLuc) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>). Moreover, the SN-38 and AZD2858 combination inhibited Chk1 phosphorylation in shGSK3 and shLuc cells, indicating that GSK-3β is not involved in Chk1 phosphorylation inhibition by AZD2858. The combination did not increase significantly the level of GSK-3β phosphorylated at S9, a marker of kinase inhibition, unlike what observed with insulin, a well-known regulator of GSK-3β activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). In addition, among the molecules tested from the TargetMol library, other more effective and specific GSK-3β inhibitors, compared with AZD2858, did not show any effect on light-induced optoTopBP1 condensation (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). These findings suggest that although AZD2858 is a GSK-3β inhibitor, its modulation of the ATR/Chk1 pathway is not due to this function. To identify the underlying mechanisms, we used a biotin proximity-labeling approach to assess TopBP1 interaction with cellular partners in the presence of AZD2858 or/and SN-38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). For this, we used our optoTopBP1 construct tagged at its N-terminus with TurboID, an optimized biotin ligase that allows protein biotinylation within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). We incubated Flp-In 293 T-Rex cells that stably express TurboID-tagged optoTopBP1 with AZD2858 or/and SN-38 for 2 hours and added biotin for the last 30 minutes. Isolation of biotinylated proteins using streptavidin-coated beads highlighted a drastic reduction in TopBP1 proximity with recombinant and endogenous TopBP1 and also with ATR upon incubation with AZD2858 alone or with SN-38 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These findings suggest that AZD2858 disrupts TopBP1 self-association and its interaction with its primary activator ATR. This may contribute to the observed decrease in SN-38-induced TopBP1 foci following AZD2858 administration. Next, we determined whether TopBP1 recruitment to chromatin was altered by AZD2858 using the well-established cell-free DNA replication system derived from <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts in which replication of demembranated sperm nuclei occurs synchronously, independently of transcription or protein synthesis. In the presence of the topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT, replication fork progression was challenged, leading to a reduction in polymerase (Pol) ε levels and an accumulation of DNA-bound TopBP1 and RPA to activate the checkpoint response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). When AZD2858 was added to the extract alone or with CPT, TopBP1 recruitment to chromatin was not inhibited. Our data demonstrate that combining CPT and AZD2858 earlier enhances the accumulation of replication-related factors (RPA, TopBP1, and Pol ε) on chromatin compared to CPT treatment alone, particularly visible at the 60-minute aver starting replication (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). This may be due to increased origin activation, as normally seen when the S-phase checkpoint is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that AZD2858 acts primarily on the ATR signaling pathway through TopBP1 self-association inhibition.</p>

<title>AZD2858 inhibits induction of the S-phase checkpoint by SN-38</title>
<p>Chk1 plays a pivotal role as a mediator of the S-phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). As SN-38-induced phosphorylation of Chk1 was decreased aver incubation with AZD2858, we investigated the impact of 2 hours treatments of SN-38 or/and AZD2858 on the cell cycle distribution using a BrdU/PI flow cytometry assay. BrdU incorporation was markedly reduced in SN-38-treated HCT116 cells, suggesting a slowdown of the S phase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>To determine whether this effect depends on replication fork progression or replication origin firing, we co-labeled replication tracks with two consecutive pulses of the thymidine analogs IdU and CldU (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). As expected, CldU tracks were shorter in HCT116 cells incubated with SN-38 alone, while addition of AZD2858 significantly reduced the negative impact of SN-38 on replication fork progression. We observe a heterogeneous population in the combination treatment, with some CldU tracts remaining short, similar to those in SN-38-treated cells, while others were longer, resembling those observed in untreated cells. This heterogeneity contributes to an overall increase in the mean length of CldU tracts in cells treated with the combination of AZD2858 and SN-38.</p>
<p>Moreover, the impact of the combination treatment becomes more pronounced over time. Indeed, there was a tendency for the SN-38-induced S-phase checkpoint to be weakened aver 6 and 12 hours of co-treatment with AZD2858 and SN-38. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C-D</xref>). In the representative biological replicate shown, the percentage of BrdU incorporating cells increased from 15% (SN-38 alone) to 41% (combination) at 6 hours and from 21% (SN-38 alone) to 34% (combination) at 12 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C-D</xref>). These results indicate that the combination of AZD2858 and SN-38 affects replication fork progression and disrupts the cell cycle homeostasis, likely by inhibiting the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway.</p>
<p>To further investigate the impact of AZD2858 on cell cycle progression, we performed a pulse-chase experiment in HCT116 cells. Cells were pulse-labeled with BrdU for 15 minutes, washed and then incubated with SN-38 and/or AZD2858 for 6 and 12 hours. In the combination treatment, at 12 hours, we observed an increase in the proportion of cells transitioning into S phase, which were initially in G1 (BrdU-negative) and progressed to a mid-S DNA content state (between 2N and 4N) (green squares) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref> and <bold>S5B</bold>). This observation aligns with previous findings indicating that the S-phase checkpoint is partially alleviated in the combination treatment compared to SN-38 alone. Of note, in untreated cells and those treated with AZD2858 alone, the S-phase gate represents a new round of DNA synthesis, as indicated by the progression from the new G1 phase at 6 hours to the initiation of a new S phase at 12 hours. However, in cells treated with SN-38 or the combination of SN-38 and AZD2858, the same S-phase population observed at 6 hours persists at 12 hours, reflecting a marked slowing of cell cycle progression.</p>
<p>Finally, the combined treatment led to a progressive accumulation of BrdU-positive cells with 4N DNA content, corresponding to cells that completed S phase (BrdU-positive) and progressed into G2 phase (4N DNA content) (red squares) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref> and <bold>S5B</bold>). This effect was more pronounced aver 12 hours of treatment, with the proportion of BrdU-positive cells in G2 phase increasing from 4% in SN-38-treated cells to 11% in the combination treatment, as shown in the representative experiment in <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>. While this trend was consistently observed across all experiments, the increase was modest and did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5F</xref>). This suggests that the combination of SN-38 and AZD2858 attittienuates the S-phase checkpoint, thereby activating a compensatory post-replicative cell cycle checkpoint that arrests the cell cycle before mitosis.</p>
<p>Abrogation of the replication checkpoint allows cells to enter and progress into the S phase with unrepaired DNA damage. We evaluated the level of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) using PFGE and monitored γH2AX and cleaved PARP1 expression by western blotting in cells exposed to SN-38 and AZD2838 at various time points. DSBs remained elevated aver the combined treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, γH2AX and cleaved PARP1 levels increased at later time points of incubation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Altogether, these findings indicate that the AZD2858 and SN-38 combination disrupts TopBP1 assembly, most likely by inhibiting ATR kinase activity amplification, a critical process for inducing the S-phase checkpoint and regulating DNA damage repair.</p>

<title>AZD2858 treatment synergizes with conventional chemotherapy drugs</title>
<p>In the absence of an effective S-phase checkpoint, DNA damage can lead to apoptosis and cell death. To assess this, we stained HCT116 cells with PI and quantified the sub-G1 population to measure cell death. Aver 48-hour incubation with sub-lethal doses of SN-38 and AZD2858, the sub-G1 cell population was increased by 40% compared with untreated cells, indicative of apoptotic cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and consistent with the early increase of cleaved PARP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We obtained the same results in cells incubated with AZD2858 and FOLFIRI. Specifically, in the representative experiment shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, the sub-G1 population increased from 19% aver incubation with SN-38 alone to 61% aver incubation with SN-38+AZD2858, and from 27% aver incubation with FOLFIRI alone to 71% aver incubation with FOLFIRI+AZD2858 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

<p>Next, we assessed whether the combination affected cell death or proliferation. First, we determined whether AZD2858, SN−38, and FOLFIRI alone induced cytotoxic (cell death) or cytostatic (inhibition of cell proliferation) effects by PI/Hoechst labeling of cells incubated with increasing concentrations of each drug. The three drugs displayed mainly cytostatic effects (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>), as indicated by the absence of cell death (lower panels) even at doses that decreased cell proliferation (upper panels). Next, we stained with PI/Hoechst and performed SRB assays in HCT116 cells, CT−26 cells (murine CRC cell line) and CCD 841 CoN (untransformed colorectal cells) incubated with increasing concentrations of AZD2858 and FOLFIRI (matrix analysis). We found that the combination was cytostatic at low drug doses and became cytotoxic at higher doses (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6C</xref>), especially in areas where we detected synergy (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6D</xref><bold>).</bold> However, no synergistic effect was observed on CCD 841 CoN cells with the AZD2858 and FOLFIRI combination (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref>).

<p>Lastly, we tested the FOLFIRI+AZD2858 combination (matrix analysis) in 3D cell cultures that are physiologically closer to tumor growth compared with 2D cultures and allow mimicking the complexity of solid tumors from a structural, biochemical and biophysical point of view. We prepared spheroids of parental HCT116 cells, SN-38-resistant HCT116 SN-6 and HCT116 SN-50 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B,E,G</xref>), and murine CT-26 cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6E</xref>). We again observed that the combination was synergistic in all tested cell lines, demonstrating remarkable efficacy with nearly complete elimination of spheroids.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>TopBP1 assembly is required for the activation of the ATR signaling pathway, a critical step in the DNA damage response and repair. We exploited our ability to control TopBP1 condensation and ATR activation using an optogenetic approach to develop a high-throughput screening procedure for identifying modulators of TopBP1 condensation. As proof of concept, we screened a TargetMol library of 4730 preclinical and clinical compounds. Through this approach, we found that AZD2858, a known GSK3-β inhibitor, is also a potential inhibitor of TopBP1 condensation. Using a complementary approach based on the irinotecan active metabolite SN-38 to induce DNA damage in CRC cells, we confirmed that AZD2858 disrupts endogenous TopBP1 condensates, thus affecting the ATR signaling pathway.</p>
<p>AZD2858 inhibits GSK-3β activity and activates the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). In addition, AZD2858 has cytotoxic effects in glioma cell lines through disruption of centrosome function and mitotic failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), and affects glioma proliferation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Our findings show that AZD2858, at nanomolar concentrations, alters TopBP1 condensation without influencing GSK-3β activity and does not require the presence of GSK-3β to prevent Chk1 activation by SN-38. These observations clearly rule out the involvement of the GSK-3β pathway in TopBP1 condensate formation inhibition by AZD2858.</p>
<p>TopBP1 is overexpressed in several cancer types, including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) and advanced-stage CRC as well as radiotherapy-resistant lung cancer cells and oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). This overexpression is associated with high-grade tumors and poor prognosis. Notably, inhibition of TopBP1 expression increases the radiosensitivity of lung cancer and brain metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) and also DNA damage in oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). To date, no study assessed or visualized TopBP1 condensate levels in tumors, or investigated whether their presence is linked to poor prognosis. Here, we found that TopBP1 condensates are increased in SN-38 resistant CRC cells. Many attittiempts have been made to target TopBP1 activity. Weei-Chin Lin9s team was the first to perform two large scale molecular docking screens targeting the BRCT7/8 domains of TopBP1. They identified calcein AM and 5D4 as compounds that block TopBP1 oligomerization and demonstrated their anti-cancer activity <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Interestingly, 5D4 also disrupts TopBP1 interaction with E2F1, mutant p53, CIP2A, and MIZ1, leading to E2F1-mediated apoptosis, suppression of mutant p53 and repression of MYC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>).</p>
<p>We demonstrated that AZD2858 disrupts the interaction between TopBP1 and its canonical partner ATR and also its self-interaction. Additionally, in cell-free <italic>X. laevis</italic> egg extracts, AZD2858, alone or in combination with the topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT, enhanced the DNA binding occupancy of both TopBP1 and RPA32. These findings, combined with the cell cycle and DNA fiber results, suggest that AZD2858 abrogates the intra-S phase and DNA elongation checkpoints induced by SN-38, leading to unscheduled DNA synthesis. In addition, incubation with SN-38+AZD2858 enhanced DNA damage and apoptosis, as indicated by (i) the increased γH2AX levels, (ii) the persistence of DSBs (PFGE assay), (iii) the expression of cleaved PARP1 and caspase-3 (apoptotic markers), and (iv) the accumulation of sub-G1 cells. Incubation with the AZD2858+SN-38 combination mimicked the effects observed with ATR inhibitors when combined with topoisomerase I inhibitors, such as CPT, topotecan and SN-38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). For instance, the ATR inhibitors VE-821 and VE-822, sensitize cancer cells to CPT derivatives by alleviating the intra-S-phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>), and induce apoptosis mediated by caspase-3 when combined with SN-38 because cells experience extensive DNA damage due to failure of the replication checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>). Importantly, the e昀케cacy of several ATR inhibitors is currently investigated in preclinical studies or in phase I/II clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy-induced replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). We also showed a synergistic effect of the AZD2858+FOLFIRI combination, including in SN-38-resistant HCT116 cell lines, due to the increased apoptosis and accumulation of DNA damage. Given the similarity of mechanism between AZD2858 and ATR inhibitors, when combined with chemotherapy (SN-38 or CPT), we hypothesize that AZD2858 could prevent the development of resistance because its mechanism of action is not to inhibit the ATR kinase but to prevent the interaction of TopBP1 with ATR. FOLFIRI is used as first-line chemotherapy regimen for patients with metastatic CRC and gastric/gastroesophageal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>
<p>In the last decade, a major advance has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms and functions of various cytoplasmic and nuclear membrane-less organelles within cells, revolutionizing thefield of cell biology. Recent studies highlighted the importance of compartmentalizing cellular components into mesoscale structures, known as biomolecular condensates, implicated in new physiological functions and in triggering the activation of specific signaling pathways. Many research projects have incorporated condensates into the understanding of cancer pathogenesis, leading to the development of new therapeutic strategies to target cancer-associated condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). We recently found that TopBP1 condensation acts as a molecular switch to amplify ATR activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), a critical pathway to tolerate the intrinsically high levels of lesions that block replication fork progression in cancer cells. Targeting TopBP1 assembly, rather than its degradation, offers an interesting strategy to selectively inhibit its role in the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway activation, while preserving its other essential functions in replication and transcription that do not rely on its assembly.</p>
<p>Overall, this study brought the first insights into the rational of targeting the condensation of TopBP1, a multifunctional protein that forms biomolecular condensates in response to DNA damage to inhibit the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway and to potentiate conventional therapies.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study reveals that the GSK-3 inhibitor AZD2858 inhibits the formation of TOPBP1 condensates and hence DNA damage responses in colorectal cancer cells. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>convincing</bold>, although uncovering how this drug blocks bio-condensate formation would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to cancer researchers searching for synergistic drug combination strategies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Laura Morano and colleagues have performed a screen to identify compounds that interfere with the formation of TopBP1 condensates. TopBP1 plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response, and specifically the activation of ATR. They found that the GSK-3b inhibitor AZD2858 reduced the formation of TopBP1 condensates and activation of ATR and its downstream target CHK1 in colorectal cancer cell lines treated with the clinically relevant irinotecan active metabolite SN-38. This inhibition of TopBP1 condensates by AZD2858 was independent from its effect on GSK-3b enzymatic activity. Mechanistically, they show that AZD2858 thus can interfere with intra-S-phase checkpoint signaling, resulting in enhanced cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of SN-38 (or SN-38+Fluoracil aka FOLFIRI) in vitro in colorectal carcinoma cell lines.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The requested plots are in figure S7 of the latest manuscript version, and look convincing. My last point is now adequately addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In 2021 (PMID: 33503405) and 2024 (PMID: 38578830) Constantinou and colleagues published two elegant papers in which they demonstrated that the Topbp1 checkpoint adaptor protein could assemble into mesoscale phase-separated condensates that were essential to amplify activation of the PIKK, ATR, and its downstream effector kinase, Chk1, during DNA damage signalling. A key tool that made these studies possible was the use of a chimeric Topbp1 protein bearing a cryptochrome domain, Cry2, which triggered condensation of the chimeric Topbp1 protein, and thus activation of ATR and Chk1, in response to irradiation with blue light without the myriad complications associated with actually exposing cells to DNA damage.</p>
<p>In this current report Morano and co-workers utilise the same optogenetic Topbp1 system to investigate a different question, namely whether Topbp1 phase-condensation can be inhibited pharmacologically to manipulate downstream ATR-Chk1 signalling. This is of interest, as the therapeutic potential of the ATR-Chk1 pathway is an area of active investigation, albeit generally using more conventional kinase inhibitor approaches.</p>
<p>The starting point is a high throughput screen of 4730 existing or candidate small molecule anti-cancer drugs for compounds capable of inhibiting the condensation of the Topbp1-Cry2-mCherry reporter molecule in vivo. A surprisingly large number of putative hits (&gt;300) were recorded, from which 131 of the most potent were selected for secondary screening using activation of Chk1 in response to DNA damage induced by SN-38, a topoisomerase inhibitor, as a surrogate marker for Topbp1 condensation. From this the 10 most potent compounds were tested for interactions with a clinically used combination of SN-38 and 5-FU (FOLFIRI) in terms of cytotoxicity in HCT116 cells. The compound that synergised most potently with FOLFIRI, the GSK3-beta inhibitor drug AZD2858, was selected for all subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>AZD2858 is shown to suppress the formation of Topbp1 (endogenous) condensates in cells exposed to SN-38, and to inhibit activation of Chk1 without interfering with activation of ATM or other endpoints of damage signalling such as formation of gamma-H2AX or activation of Chk2 (generally considered to be downstream of ATM). AZD2858 therefore seems to selectively inhibit the Topbp1-ATR-Chk1 pathway without interfering with parallel branches of the DNA damage signalling system, consistent with Topbp1 condensation being the primary target. Importantly, neither siRNA depletion of GSK3-beta, or other GSK3-beta inhibitors were able to recapitulate this effect, suggesting it was a specific non-canonical effect of AZD2858 and not a consequence of GSK3-beta inhibition per se.</p>
<p>To understand the basis for synergism between AZD2858 and SN-38 in terms of cell killing, the effect of AZD2858 on the replication checkpoint was assessed. This is a response, mediated via ATR-Chk1, that modulates replication origin firing and fork progression in S-phase cell under conditions of DNA damage or when replication is impeded. SN-38 treatment of HCT116 cells markedly suppresses DNA replication, however this was partially reversed by co-treatment with AZD2858, consistent with the failure to activate ATR-Chk1 conferring a defect in replication checkpoint function.</p>
<p>Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that AZD2858 can markedly enhance the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of SN-38 and FOLFIRI through a combination of increased apoptosis and growth arrest according to dosage and treatment conditions. Figure 6 extends this analysis to cells cultured as spheroids, sometimes considered to better represent tumor responses compared to single cell cultures.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>Liquid phase separation of protein complexes is increasingly recognised as a fundamental mechanism in signal transduction and other cellular processes. One recent and important example was that of Topbp1, whose condensation in response to DNA damage is required for efficient activation of the ATR-Chk1 pathway. The current study asks a related but distinct question; can protein condensation be targeted by drugs to manipulate signalling pathways which in the main rely on protein kinase cascades?</p>
<p>Here, the authors identify an inhibitor of GSK3-beta as a novel inhibitor of DNA damage-induced Topbp1 condensation and thus of ATR-Chk1 signalling.</p>
<p>This work will be of interest to researchers in the fields of DNA damage signalling, biophysics of protein condensation, and cancer chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>Having read the revised manuscript and rebuttal I am satisfied that the authors have resolved my various original concerns through a combination of clarification/ explanation and textual changes necessary to make the description of certain data precise. My impression is that they have also largely or completely satisfied the concerns of the other reviewers, with the possible exception of reviewer 1's point about the relative toxicity of AZD and FOLFIRI in colorectal cancer cell lines versus the untransformed CCD841 cell line. This is of course an important point with respect to the possible practical application of this combination for cancer therapy, however this seems somewhat subsidiary to the main novelty and significance of the findings, which are that protein liquid phase separation/ condensation can be manipulated pharmacologically to modify signal transduction processes and that existing drugs can be re-purposed to this end.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have extended their previous research to develop TOPBP1 as a potential drug target for colorectal cancer by inhibiting its condensation. Utilizing an optogenetic approach, they identified the small molecule AZD2858, which inhibits TOPBP1 condensation and works synergistically with first-line chemotherapy to suppress colorectal cancer cell growth. The authors investigated the mechanism and discovered that disrupting TOPBP1 assembly inhibits the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway, leading to increased DNA damage and apoptosis, even in drug-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>I have reviewed the revised manuscript and read the rebuttal. The authors have carefully addressed my concerns. There is however one point that needs further work:</p>
<p>This follows up on my major point #1 in my initial review. I had I asked the authors to demonstrate that FOLFIRI + AZD are less toxic to untransformed colorectal cells than colorectal cancer cell lines.  It is good to see that the authors took my advice and show effects of the drug treatments on the untransformed colorectal cell line CCD841. It seems to be less sensitive to AZD and FOLFIRI in the figure in the rebuttal. What surprises me is that I cannot find these new figures anywhere in the revised manuscript. Also, the data seem preliminary, because I do not see any standard errors in the graphs, and I cannot find a description of the time of drug incubation. I ask the authors to make sure that the CCD841 data are reproducible, and make sure they incorporate the data in the revised manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. In the initial revised version of the manuscript, we did not include results from the untransformed colorectal cell line CCD841, as those experiments had only been performed once and were considered preliminary. However, we fully agree with the reviewer on the importance of including these data.</p>
<p>To address this, we have repeated the experiments in CCD841 cells to ensure reproducibility. We now report the results from three independent experiments testing the combination of AZD2858 and FOLFIRI on healthy epithelial colon cells. These results are shown in Supplementary Figure S7, where blue matrices represent cell viability and black matrices reflect the level of synergy between AZD2858 and FOLFIRI.</p>
<p>Our results confirm that, individually, each drug has little to no effect on healthy cells, and no consistent synergistic interaction was observed, except in Experiment 1, which could not be reproduced. Importantly, the drug concentrations used were identical to those applied in the cancer cell experiments, allowing for direct comparison between normal and malignant cell responses.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>Morano et al. have revised their manuscript in response to the points raised by reviewer #3 as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Fig. 2E: Correcting the previously erroneous labelling of this Fig. makes it match the textual description.</p>
<p>(2) Figs 3A and B: The revised textual description of the flow cytometry BrdU incorporation is now precise.</p>
<p>(3) Fig. 3E: Removing the suspect WB images is a pragmatic decision that does not significantly affect the overall conclusions of the paper.</p>
<p>(4) Fig. 3D: Despite its puzzling appearance this data is now described accurately in the text as &quot;DSBs remained elevated after the combined treatment&quot; rather than &quot;increased after the combined treatment. A more convincing increase in the presumed damaged DNA band is evident in Fig. 4D when AZD2858 is combined with a much lower concentration of SN38 (1.5nM) which could mean that the concentration used in Fig. 3D (300nM) induced maximal damage that could not be further enhanced.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments and constructive feedback, which have helped us improve the clarity and rigor of the manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed most of the concerns that I raised in the first round of revision and I have no further questions. I appreciate the authors's efforts in carrying out an preliminary in vivo work, although as the authors pointed out the compound seems to be not effective in vivo. Future work is desired to address this to clarify the significance of the work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging our efforts in addressing the previous concerns. We also appreciate the recognition of our preliminary in vivo work. While these results suggest limited in vivo efficacy of the compound at this stage, we agree that additional studies will be necessary to fully evaluate its therapeutic relevance. We consider this an important next step and are committed to pursuing it in future work.</p>
