<title>Abstract</title><p>Dissection of neural circuitry underlying behaviors is a central theme in neurobiology. Chemical transmission is the predominant model for signaling between neurons. Here we have created lines target all chemical transmission corresponding genes in Drosophila after modifying GFP RNA interference, Flp-out and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies. After thorough validation, all three strategies are demonstrated to be highly effective with the best using chromatin-peptide fused Cas9 variants and scaffold optimized sgRNAs. As a proof of principle, we conduct a comprehensive intersection analysis of chemoconnectome (CCT) genes expression profiles in the clock neurons using chemoconnectomics driver lines, leading to the finding of 45 CCT genes presented in clock neurons. Mutating these genes specifically in clock neurons revealed that loss of the neuropeptide CNMa in two posterior dorsal clock neurons (DN1p) or its receptor (CNMaR) caused advanced morning activity, opposite to the mutants of neuropeptide PDF or its receptor (PDFR). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional chemoconnectomics libraries and indicate an antagonistic relationship between CNMa-CNMaR and PDF-PDFR signaling in regulating morning anticipation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much research efforts have been made in uncovering the wiring and signaling pathways of neural circuits underlying specific behaviors. Multiple circuit dissection strategies have been developed, including genetic screening, genetic labelling, circuit tracing, live imaging, genetic sensors and central nervous system reconstruction via electron microscopy (EM) imaging. Recently, we have developed chemoconnectomics (CCTomics), focusing on building a comprehensive set of knockout and knockin tool lines of chemoconnectome (CCT) genes, to dissect neural circuitry based on chemical transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deng et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Each strategy has advantages and disadvantages, for example: genetic screening is less biased but inefficient; circuit tracing with viruses provides information of connection, but is often prone to leaky expression and inaccurate labelling; and EM reconstruction is anatomically elaborate but does not allow for manipulation of corresponding neurons. CCTomics overcomes some limitations of previous strategies by allowing for behavioral screening of CCT genes and accurate labelling or manipulation of corresponding neurons. However, it is still limited in that knockout of some CCT genes can be lethal during development and that CCT genes may function differently in different neurons, which require a cell type-specific manipulation. Thus, we decided to invent a conditional CCTomics (cCCTomics) in which gene deletion was conditional.</p>
<p>There are three major strategies for somatic gene mutagenesis at the DNA/RNA level: RNA interference, DNA site-specific recombination enzymes, and CRISPR/Cas system. RNA interference targets RNAs conveniently and efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Martin and Caplen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Oberdoerffer et al., 2005</xref>). Libraries of transgenic RNAi flies covering almost the entire fly genome have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Perkins et al., 2015</xref>). DNA site specific recombination enzymes such as Flp, B3 and Cre mediate specific and efficient gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gaj et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>). These strategies require flies with reverse repetitive sequences knocked into the corresponding genes, which is time-consuming with relatively complex recombination for genetic assays. CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9, which targets DNA with a sgRNA/Cas protein complex, have been broadly applied in gene manipulation over the last decade. The widespread use of CRIPSR/Cas9 in Drosophila somatic gene manipulation began in 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). Later, tRNA-flanking sgRNAs was designed and applied, which enabled multiple sgRNAs to mature in a single transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Xie et al., 2015</xref>), accelerating the application of this strategy in conditional gene manipulation in flies with impressive efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delventhal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Port et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schlichting et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schlichting et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, libraries of UAS-sgRNA targeting kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Port et al., 2020</xref>) and GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schlichting et al., 2022</xref>) have been established, but no sgRNA libraries covering all the CCT genes exists yet. The efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 has not been validated systematically in the Drosophila nervous system.</p>
<p>The circadian rhythm can be used for proof of principle testing of cCCTomics. Organisms evolve periodic behaviors and physiological traits in response to cyclical environmental changes. The rhythmic locomotor behavior of Drosophila, for instance, shows enhanced activity before the light is turned on and off in a light-dark (LD) cycle, referred to as morning and evening anticipations, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Collins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Helfrich-Förster, 2001</xref>). Under dark-dark (DD) conditions, the activities peaks regularly about every 24 hours (h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>). Approximately 150 clock neurons, circadian output neurons and extra-clock electrical oscillators (xCEOs) coordinate Drosophila circadian behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). The regulation of morning and evening anticipations, the most prominent features in the LD condition, is primarily mediated by four pairs of sLNvs expressing pigment dispersing factor (PDF), six pairs of LNds and the 5<sup>th</sup> s-LNv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rieger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). At the molecular level, Pdf and Pdf receptor (PDFR) are well-known, with their mutants showing an advanced evening activity peak and no morning anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hyun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Renn et al., 1999</xref>). Other neuropeptides and their receptors, including AstC/AstC-R2 and neuropeptide F (NPF) and its receptor (NPFR), have also been reported to modulate evening activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Díaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hermann et al., 2012</xref>), while CCHa1/CCHa1-R and Dh31 regulate morning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fujiwara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Goda et al., 2019</xref>). To date, no advanced morning activity phenotype has been reported in flies.</p>
<p>To develop a more efficient approach for somatic gene manipulation, we have now generated two systems for conditional manipulation of CCT genes. One is GFPi/Flp-out-based conditional knockout system of CCT genes (cCCTomics) and another is CRISPR/Cas9-based (C-cCCTomics). Both systems have achieved high efficiency of gene mutagenesis in the Drosophila nervous system. C-cCCTomics, utilizing chromatin-peptide fused Cas9 and scaffold optimized sgRNA, makes efficient conditional gene knockout as simple as RNAi. Further application of C-cCCTomics in clock neurons revealed novel roles of CCT genes in circadian behavior: CNMa-CNMaR modulates morning anticipation as an antagonistic signal of PDF-PDFR.</p>

<title>Complete Disruption of Target Genes by GFPi and Flp-out Based cCCTomics</title>
<p>For the purpose of conditional chemoconnectomics (cCCTomics), we initially leveraged the benefits of our previously generated CCTomics attP lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deng et al., 2019</xref>), which enabled us to fuse enhanced GFP coding sequence at the 3’ end of each gene’s coding region and flank most or entire gene span with FRT sequence through site-specific recombination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). We designed this system so that it could be used to target genes tagged with GFP by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Neumüller et al., 2012</xref>) and at the same time to enable flippase(Flp) mediated DNA fragment excision between two FRT sequences when FRT sequences are in the same orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Vetter et al., 1983</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig1A</xref>).</p>

A T2A-EGFP sequence was induced at the 3’ end of CCT genes and their most or all coding regions (depending on attP-KO lines) were flanked by 34 bp FRT sequence. Both Flp-out (top) and GFP RNAi (down) could mediate CCT gene manipulation. (B-J) Expression of Trh (B-D), CCHa2 (E-G), and Dh31 (H-J) are efficiently disrupted by pan-neuronal expression of GFP-RNAi (B-D), pan-neuronal expression of Flp-out (E-G), and heatshock-Flp (H-J) respectively.

<p>To validate the efficiency of cCCTomics, we performed pan-neuronal expression of either shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> or flipase in cCCT flies. Immunofluorescent imaging showed that constitutive expression of shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1I</xref>) or flipase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1J</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1U</xref>) almost completely eliminated GFP signals of target genes, indicating high efficiency. Knockout at the adult stage using either hsFLP driven Flp-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Golic and Lindquist, 1989</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1J</xref>) or neurally (elav-Switch) driven shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Nicholson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2I</xref>) also showed high efficiency of suppression. Notably, control group of CCT<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup>; elav-Switch/UAS-shRNAGFP flies fed with solvent (ethanol) showed obvious decreased GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2H</xref>) comparing with UAS-shRNA<sup>GFP</sup>/CCT<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> flies fed with RU486 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2G</xref>), indicating leaky expression of elav-Switch.</p>
<p>We then applied cCCTomics in pan-neuronal knockout of nAChRβ2 which is required for Drosophila sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). Ablation of nAChRβ2 in the nervous system dramatically decreased both day and night sleep of flies, which was the same as shown in the previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1K</xref>, 1L). Therefore, cCCTomics is an effective toolkit for manipulation of CCT genes and suitable for functional investigations of genes. Expression of in-frame fused eGFP-labelled CCT genes highly co-localized with signals revealed by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3I</xref>), allowing direct examination of gene expression without amplification, which is different from the GAL4/UAS binary system.</p>
<p>We then checked the viability of cCCT lines and found that cCCT lines including Capa<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup>, ChAT<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> and Eh<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> were viable whereas their CCT mutants were lethal. Gad1<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup>, GluRIID<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> and CapaR<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> were still lethal as their CCT mutants were (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). This indicates that some of the cCCT knockin flies may functionally affect corresponding genes, which are not suitable for conditional gene manipulation. Combination of cCCT transgenic flies with UAS-flp, UAS-shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> or specific drivers is complicated and unfriendly for screen work, despite the almost 100% efficiency of gene suppression. Because of the limitations of this method, we further created a CRISPR/Cas9 based conditional knockout system of chemoconnectomics (C-cCCTomics).</p>

<title>CRISPR/Cas9-Based Conditional Knockout System for CCTomics</title>
<p>To simplify effective manipulation of CCT genes, we designed a vector based on pACU2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Han et al., 2011</xref>) with tRNA flanking sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Xie et al., 2015</xref>) targeting CCT genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). We also adopted an optimized sgRNA scaffold “E+F” (E, stem extension; F, A-U flip) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), which facilitates Cas9-sgRNA complex formation and gene knockout efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Poe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), to all sgRNAs to improve gene knockout efficiency. To balance efficiency and off-target effect, we selected three sgRNAs for each CCT gene with highest predicted efficiency and no predicted off-target effect based on previously reported models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Doench et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Graf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Heigwer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Stemmer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Table S3</xref> and details at Methods).</p>

Sanger sequencing showed that indels were present exactly at the Cas9 cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4H</xref>). To determine the efficiency of C-cCCTomics, we employed pan-neuronal expression of Cas9.HC with sgRNA<sup>Dh31</sup> or sgRNA<sup>pdf</sup>. Targeting by Cas9.HC/sgRNA<sup>Dh31</sup> eliminated most but not all of the GFP signal in Dh31<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>), whereas all anti-PDF signals were eliminated by Cas9.HC/sgRNA<sup>pdf</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). Furthermore, we used the C-cCCT strategy to conditionally knockout genes for pdfr, nAChRβ2 and nAChRα2, which were previously reported as essential for circadian rhythm or sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Renn et al., 1999</xref>). Pan-neuronal knockout of Pdfr phenocopied arrhythmicity of its null mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>) while there was no significant sleep decrease in these conditional knockout (cKO) flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2K</xref>-<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>) when we applied C-cCCTomics to manipulate nAChRβ2 or nAChRa2. Taken together, C-cCCTomics (with Cas9.HC) achieved a relatively high gene knockout efficiency, but it was not effective enough for all genes.</p>

<p>To determine whether the modified Cas9 variants were more efficient, we first pan-neuronally expressed each Cas9 variant and sgRNA<sup>ple</sup>, and assessed their efficiency by immunofluorescence imaging. By counting anti-TH positive neurons in the brain (anterior view) after targeting by Cas9/sgRNA<sup>ple</sup>, we found that unmodified Cas9.HC/sgRNA<sup>ple</sup> only achieved 69.58±3.04% (n=5) knockout efficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>, 3K, 3L), while Cas9.M6/sgRNA<sup>ple</sup> and Cas9.M9/sgRNA<sup>ple</sup> significantly improved efficiency to 87.53±3.06% (n=7) and 97.19±2.15% (n=8), respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3L</xref>). Fourteen additional CCT genes were subjected to pan-neuronal knockout, and the mRNA levels of the target genes were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR with at least one primer overlapping the sgRNA targeting site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig S5</xref>). Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 demonstrated significantly higher gene disruption efficiency compared to the unmodified Cas9.HC, achieving average efficiencies of 87.51%±2.24% and 89.59%±2.39% for Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9, respectively, in contrast to 70.72%±3.82% for Cas9.HC. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig S5</xref>). To rule out the possibility of the observed variations in gene disruption efficiency being attributed to differential Cas9 expression levels, we quantified the Cas9 expression levels and noted that both Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 exhibited lower mRNA levels than Cas9.HC under the experiment condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3N</xref>). Subsequently, genomic DNA of Drosophila head was extracted, and libraries encompassing target sites were constructed for high-throughput sequencing to verify disparities in genetic editing efficiency among these three Cas9 variants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3O</xref>). In almost all nineteen sites tested, the mutation ratio consistently showed a trend towards Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 having a higher gene disruption efficiency than Cas9.HC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6</xref>). The single-site mutation rates varied from 5.81% to 43.47% for Cas9.HC, 22.40% to 53.54% for Cas9.M6, and 19.90% to 63.57% for Cas9.M9 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6</xref>). It should be noted that genomic DNA extracted from fly heads contained glial cells, which did not express Cas9/sgRNA, leading to a larger denominator and consequently reducing the observed mutation rates. Unmodified Cas9 displayed mutation rates comparable to those previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schlichting et al., 2022</xref>. The findings indicated that both Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 displayed elevated efficiency compared to Cas9.HC, with Cas9.M9 exhibiting the highest mutagenesis proficiency. These results suggest that the implementation of modified C-cCCTomics using Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 achieved an elevated level of efficiency. While unmodified C-cCCTomics was not efficient enough to knockout nAChRβ2 and nAChRα2 to phenocopy their mutants, we employed Cas9.M9 in conditional knockout of these genes to verify its efficiency. Pan-neuronal knocking out of nAChRβ2 or nAChRa2 by Cas9.M9/sgRNA showed significant sleep decrease which was similar to their mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3Q</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3R</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results support that we have created a high efficiency toolkit for CCT gene manipulation in the nervous system, as well as more efficient Cas9 variants, Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9, which can also be applied to genes other than those in the CCT.</p>

<title>Conditional Knockout of CCT Genes in Circadian Neurons</title>
<p>To investigate the function of CCT genes in circadian neurons with our conditional knockout system, we knocked out all 67 (45 genes identified above and additional 22 genes reported previously) CCT genes in Clk856-labeled clock neurons by C-cCCTomics.</p>
<p>In the pilot screen, we monitored fly activity by video recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dai et al., 2019</xref>) and analyzed rhythmic behavior under LD and DD conditions. We analyzed morning anticipation index (MAI) and evening anticipation index (EAI) under the LD condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Harrisingh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Im and Taghert, 2010</xref>)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), power, period and arrhythmic rate (AR) under the DD condition. Fly activities tended to rise rapidly after ZT22.5 at dawn and ZT10 at dusk. Thus, we added two more parameters to describe the anticipatory activity patterns of LD condition. Morning anticipation pattern index (MAPI) was defined as the difference between <italic>Pi</italic><sub>a</sub>[arctan(ZT20.5∼ZT22.5 activity increasing slope)] and <italic>Pi</italic><sub>p</sub>[arctan(ZT22.5 ∼ZT24 activity increasing slope)], M(<italic>Pi</italic><sub>a</sub>-<italic>Pi</italic><sub>p</sub>). Evening anticipation pattern index (EAPI) was defined similar to MAPI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, see Methods). <italic>Pi</italic><sub>a</sub> and <italic>Pi</italic><sub>p</sub> were positive, while MAPI and EAPI were negative, for wild type (wt) flies as their activities gradually increases at dawn or dusk at increasing rates. Knocking out Pdf or Pdfr in clock neurons phenocopied their mutants with lower MAI, advanced evening activity, low power, high arrhythmic rate and shorter period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hyun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Renn et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls6">Table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">S9D</xref>).

All the above results verified the effectiveness of C-cCCTomics. Unexpectedly, additional experimental replications with full controls using Cas9.M9 revealed that leaky expression of Cas9.M9 and sgRNA might have caused disruption of Dh31, Dh44, Pdf and Pdfr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">S9D</xref>) (see DISCUSSION), which was not suitable for neuronal specific mutagenesis of some genes.

<p>Analysis of the newly defined parameters MAPI and EAPI showed that control flies (Clk856-GLA4&gt;UAS-Cas9.M9) had negative EAPI but slightly positive MAPI.

<p>Because we had found that knocking out CNMa in Clk856-GAL4 labeled neurons produced advanced morning activity, and that CNMa intersected with Clk856-Gal4 labeled neurons in 4 pairs of DN1ps and one pair of DN3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8</xref>-16), we focused on these neurons and performed more intersections. Taking advantage of a series of clock neuron subset-labeled drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sekiguchi et al., 2020</xref>), we intersected CNMa-p65AD with 4 DN1 labelling drivers: GMR51H05-GAL4, GMR91F02-GAL4, Pdfr-KI-GAL4 and GMR79A11-GAL4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>). We found two arborization patterns: Type I with two neurons whose branches projecting to the anterior region, as in CNMa∩GMR51H05, CNMa∩Pdfr, and CNMa∩GMR79A11 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>, 5G, 6H), and type II with four neurons branching on the posterior side with few projections to the anterior region, as in CNMa∩GMR91F02 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>CNMa knockout in Type I or Type II neurons (GMR51H05-GAL4, GMR91F02-GAL4, and GMR79A11-GAL4) all reproduced the MAPI-increased phenotype of clk856 specific CNMa knockout (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>). However, Type II neurons-specific CNMa knockout (CNMa ∩ GMR91F02) showed no advanced morning activity peak (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6K</xref>), while Type I neurons-specific CNMa knockout did (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6J</xref>), indicating that these two type I CNMa neurons are the main functional subset regulating the morning anticipation activity of fruit fly.</p>
<p>Pdf or Pdfr mutants have weak or no morning anticipation, which is in reversely related to the phenotype of CNMa knockout flies. We also identified two Pdfr and CNMa double-positive DN1ps, which have a type I projection pattern (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). Reintroduction of Pdfr in Pdfr knockout background revealed that GMR51H05 and GMR79A11Gal4 drivers, which covered the main functional CNMa-positive subset, could partially rescue the morning anticipation and power phenotype of Pdfr knockout flies to a considerably larger extent than the GMR91F02 driver (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6L</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6M</xref>). Moreover, knocking out Pdfr in type I CNMa neurons decreased morning anticipation of flies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6N</xref>). Because the main subset of functional CNMa is also PDFR-positive, it is possible that CNMa secretion is regulated by PDF/PDFR signal.</p>

<title>Role of Neuronal CNMaR in Morning Anticipation</title>
<p>There is only one CNMa receptor reported in the fly genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Jung et al., 2014</xref>). We generated a CNMaR<sup>KO-p65AD</sup> line by CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>) and this knockout showed advanced morning activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>, 7D) and increased MAPI (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>, 7E) in both sexes. CNMaR<sup>KI-Gal4</sup>/UAS-mCD8::GFP and CNMaR<sup>KI-Gal4</sup>/UAS-stinger::Red showed expression of CNMaR across the whole brain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Fig S11B</xref>), especially in DN1p, DN3, the PI and the SOG. The dendrite arborization and synaptic projections of CNMaR neurons also covered broad regions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>, 7H), at the PI, the SOG, the posterior ventrolateral protocerebrum (PVLP) and the central complex (CC). Further conditional knockout of CNMaR in neurons by C-cCCTomics phenocopied CNMaR<sup>KO-p65AD</sup> phenotype (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7I</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7L</xref>). These results indicate that CNMaR is similar to CNMa in regulating morning anticipation.</p>

<title>Conditional CCTomics Strategies and Toolkit</title>
<p>We have generated conditional gene manipulation systems based on Flp-out/GFPi or CRISPR/Cas9. cCCT based gene deletion after heat-shock or mifepristone (RU486) eliminated most GFP signals, and pan-neuronal constitutive expression of shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> or flippase disrupted seven out of eight tested genes completely while targeting of SIFa<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> achieved 96±3% efficiency. Although the recombination of genetic elements is relatively cumbersome when using cCCTomics, it is worthwhile to apply this method to specific genes given its high level of efficiency. While two UAS-sgRNA libraries have been established, one primarily targeting kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Port et al., 2020</xref>) and the other targeting GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schlichting et al., 2022</xref>), both libraries only cover a portion of CCT genes, and are thus insufficient for manipulating all CCT genes. The development of C-cCCTomics, however, makes CCT gene manipulation as simple as RNA interference. Furthermore, the use of modified Cas9.M6 or Cas9.M9 highly enhances the efficiency of gene disruption in the nervous system, allowing for efficient manipulation of all CCT genes in a cell-specific manner.</p>
<p>The toxicity of CRISPR/Cas9 depends on the Cas9 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Port et al., 2014</xref>). When expressed pan-neuronally in nSyb-GAL4 (R57C10-GAL4, attP40), Cas9.M9 slightly reduced viability, while the expression of other Cas9 variants had no significant effect on viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Fig S12</xref>). Although Cas9.M9 showed leaky-expression-efficiency, this was not a problem with Cas9.M6, which successfully disrupted Dh31, Dh44, Pdf, and Pdfr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9</xref>). A more restricted expression of Cas9.M9 with lower toxicity is necessary for better somatic gene manipulation in the future.</p>

<title>CCT of Clock Neurons</title>
<p>Intersecting Clk856-Gal4 or Clk856-p6AD with CCTomics, we identified 45 CCT genes in Clk856 labelled clock neurons. Clock neurons appear highly heterogeneous both in our intersection dissection and in a previous transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abruzzi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). Comparing these two CCT gene expression profiles in clock neurons, 45 out of 128 gene-subsets are identical. The accuracy of our genetic intersection is limited by two possibilities: 1) KI-LexA may not fully represent the expression pattern of the corresponding gene, and 2) the efficiency of STOP cassette removal in the Flp-out strategy is limited. Moreover, the leakage of LexAop-GFP may result in unreliable labelling in split-lexA strategy.</p>
<p>We have also observed that the expression profile of Pdfr in clock neurons is inconsistent across studies, with different clock subsets being identified(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hyun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Im and Taghert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mertens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shafer et al., 2008</xref>) . The variability in labelling clock neurons with Pdfr transgenic GAL4s, KI-myc tag, antibodies, and transcriptomic anatomy reflects the limitations of each approach. The expression of Pdfr in LNds and DN1s is considered reliable as they are labeled by all strategies. Our intersection dissection is most closely aligned to Pdfr antibody-labelled neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hyun et al., 2005</xref>). Both genetic drivers and transcriptomic analysis contribute to our knowledge of the expression profile of neurons. The physiological significance of each gene in a particular neuron should be further investigated by genetic manipulation.</p>

<title>Regulation of Rhythmic Behavior by CCT genes</title>
<p>Multiple attractive genes have been identified in our functional screen of CCT genes in clock neurons: for example, knocking out of VGlut weakens both morning anticipation and rhythmic strength (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls7">Table S7</xref>). In further screening of brain regions, we have narrowed down the morning anticipation regulation role of VGlut in R18H11-GAL4 labeled neurons (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls8">Table S8</xref>). VGlut in these neurons has also been reported to regulate sleep in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). Its downstream neurons may be the PI neurons or LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the deficiency of the neuropeptide CNMa results in advanced morning activity. We have validated that two Pdfr and CNMa double-positive DN1p neurons mainly regulate this process through intersectional manipulation of CNMa. Knockout and reintroduction of Pdfr in these neurons have verified that Pdfr partially functions in DN1p CNMa neurons, and PDF increases cAMP level in Pdfr positive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Shafer et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting the regulation of CNMa signaling by PDF signaling. Furthermore, given that the morning anticipation vanishing phenotype of Pdf or Pdfr mutant is opposite to that of CNMa knockout flies, we consider the two signals to be antagonistic. However, knocking out CNMaR in Clk856 labelled clock neurons showed no significant phenotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls7">Table S7</xref>), whereas the mutant and pan-neuronal knockout flies had similar phenotypes to CNMa knockout flies, suggesting its role in the circadian output neurons. Previous studies have indicated that CNMa integrate thermosensory inputs to promote wakefulness, and CNMaR is thought to function in Dh44 positive PI neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jin et al., 2021</xref>), a subset of circadian output neurons. To gain a deeper understanding of the downstream effects of DN1p CNMa postive neurons, further analysis focusing on specific brain regions is necessary.</p>
<p>We have also reproduced phenotypes of Pdf, Pdfr, and Dh31 mutant flies with C-cCCTomics as previous studies. Surprisingly, only five genes are functional among all sixty-seven CCT genes in this prior screen. This may be caused by limitations of the simple behavioral paradigm, single gene manipulation, and single GAL4 driver. For example, switching of light condition from L: D = 12h: 12h to L: D = 6h:18h, AstC/AstC-R2 would suppress flies’ evening activity intensity to adapt to the environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Díaz et al., 2019</xref>), and only double knockout of AChRs and mGluRs in PI neurons can possibly result in alteration in behavioral rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barber et al., 2021</xref>). Further diversified functional analysis of CCT genes in clock neurons is required for clock circuit dissection.</p>

<p>MAI, MAPI, EAI, EAPI, power and period were calculated by python or R scripts. ZT0 was set as the time point when light was on and ZT12 was set as the time point for light-off. Activity bins started at ZT0 and each was calculated as a sum of the total activity within 30min. Flies were regarded as death and removed if their activity value within last 2 bins was 0. A representative 24hr activity pattern was the average between corresponding activity bins from 2 consecutive days. To minimize effects from singular values, each flies‣ activity was normalized using the following formula:

</disp-formula>
bi means the activity value for a certain bin. min(b0,…,b48) means the minimal bin value within 24hr and max(b0,…,b48) means the maximal bin value within 24hr. Nor_bi means the final normalized bin value for a certain bin from a given fly. Normalized activity was used for following analysis.</p>
<p>Morning activity arise (M_arise) was defined as the radian between the activity curve (ZT21-ZT22) and the time coordinate.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper of Mao et al. expands the genetic toolset that was previously developed by the Rao lab (Denfg et al 2019) to introduce the conditional KO or downregulation of neurotransmission components in Drosophila. The authors then use these tools to investigate neurotransmission in the clock neurons of the Drosophila brain. They first test some known components and then analyze the contribution of the CNMa neuropeptide and its receptor to the circadian behavior. The results indicate that CNMA acts from a subset of DN1ps (dorsal clock neurons) to set the phase of the morning peak of locomotor activity in light:dark cycles, with an advanced morning activity in the absence of the neuropeptide. Interestingly, the receptor for the PDF neuropeptide appears to be acting in some of the CNMa neurons to control morning activity.</p>
<p>Strengths/weaknesses:</p>
<p>This is clearly a very useful new set of tools to restrict the manipulation of these components to specific neuronal populations, and overall (see specific points below), the paper is convincing to show that the tools indeed allow to efficiently and specifically eliminate neuropeptides/receptors from subsets of neurons. The analysis of the CNMa function in the clock network reveals a new and interesting function for CNMa. but this part needs to be improved. Some of the behavioral data (PDF/PDFR) do not fit with published work with the mutants. This should be clarified by providing more data comparing the described genotypes with the classical mutants. Some conclusions also need to be toned down.</p>

<p>In this study, Mao and co-workers deliver a substantial suite of genetic tools in support of the senior author's recent proposal to create a &quot;chemoconnectomic&quot; tool kit for the expression mapping and conditional disruption of specific neurotransmitter systems with fly neurons of interest. Specifically, they describe the creation of two toolsets for recombination-based and CRISPR/Cas9-based conditional knockouts of genes supporting neurotransmitter and neuromodulator function and Flp-Out and Split-LexA toolkit for the examination of gene expression within defined subsets of neurons. The authors report the creation of conditional genetic tools for the disruption/mapping of approximately 200 chemoconnectomic gene products, an examination of the general effectiveness of these tools in the fly brain, and apply them to the circadian clock network in an attempt to reveal new information regarding the transmitter/modulator systems involved in daily behavioral timing. The authors provide clear evidence of the effectiveness of the new methods along with a transparent assessment of the variability of the tools. In addition, they present evidence that the neuro peptide CNMa influences the morning peak of daily activity in the fly by regulating the timing of activity increases in anticipation of dawn.</p>
<p>A major strength of the study is the transparent assessment of the effectiveness and variability of the conditional genetic approaches developed by the authors. The authors have largely achieved their aims and the study therefore represents a major delivery on the promise of chemoconnectomics made by the senior author in 2019 (Neuron, Vol. 101, p. 876). Though there are some concerns about the variability of knockout effectiveness, off-target effects of the knockout strategies, and (especially) the accuracy of the gene expression approach, the tools created for this study will almost certainly be useful for the field and support a great deal of future work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mao and colleagues generated powerful reagents to genetically analyse chemical communication (CCT) in the brain, and in the process uncovered a function for the CNMa neuropeptide expressed in a subset of DN1p neurons that contributes to the temporal organization of locomotor activity, i.e., the timing of morning anticipation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of the manuscript relies on the generation/characterization of new tools for conditional targeting a well-defined set of CCT genes along with the design and testing of improved versions of Cas9 for efficient knockout. Such invaluable resources will be of interest to the whole community. The authors employed these tools and intersectional genetics to provide an alternative profiling of clock neurons, which is complementary to the ones already published. Furthermore, they uncovered a role for CNMamide, expressed in two DN1ps, in the timing of morning anticipation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>They targeted an extensive set of candidate genes putatively involved in communication (transporters, receptor subunits, neuropeptides, neurotransmitter synthesis, etc); they provide a list of efficient gRNAs to target even a longer list of candidate genes, however, it is not clear if all of those made it into transgenic lines that effectively mediate targeting all chemical transmission genes (as suggested by the authors).</p>

<p>We are grateful for the constructive comments of the reviewers. Here is a provisional response to major questions.</p>
<p>To Question 1, we appreciate that you point out that the phenotypes of pan-neuronal knockout of PDFR by unmodified Cas9 (Fig 2H-2I, in previous manuscript) whose morning anticipation still exist at some level (Fig a) though the decreases of morning anticipation index (Fig b) and advanced evening activity were not as pronounced as observed in han5304 (Fig 3C Hyun et al., 2005), our response is that the difference between pan-neuronal knockout of PDFR by unmodified Cas9 might be caused by the limited efficiency of unmodified Cas9 in our conditional system. We will adjust the relevant conclusions in the revised version, and these findings underscore the necessity to enhance the efficiency of the original Cas9</p>

<label>Author response image 1.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-91927-sa4-fig1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>To Question 2, that some expression profiles of clock neurons are not consistent with previous reports, such as Dh31 and ChAT in s-LNvs, our response is that the differences can be attributed to the variation in expression patterns between 3’ terminal KI-LexA (used in this gene expression dissection) and KO-GAL4, KI-GAL4, or transgenic GAL4. We have indeed observed differences when identical sites were inserted in frame with Gal4 or LexA.</p>
<p>To Question 3, that our description of advanced morning anticipation versus no morning anticipation with the term &quot;opposite&quot; is not accurate enough, our response is that we will modify that. Mutants of CNMa or CNMaR exhibit advanced morning activity, suggesting an inhibitory role of CNMa/CNMaR. Mutants of Pdf/Pdfr, on the other hand, showed no morning anticipation, indicating a promoting role in morning anticipation.</p>
<p>To Question 4, whether we have generated transgenic UAS-sgRNA flies for all CCT genes or only a subset, our response is that we have indeed generated UAS-sgRNA flies for all CCT genes.</p>
