<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Discovering new strategies to combat the multi-drug resistance bacteria constitutes a major medical challenge of our time. Previously, artesunate (AS) has been reported to exert antibacterial enhancement activity in combination with β-lactam antibiotics, via inhibition of the efflux pump AcrB. However, combination of AS and colistin (COL) revealed weak synergistic effect against a limited number of strains, and few studies have further explored its possible mechanism of synergistic action. In this paper, we found that AS and EDTA could strikingly enhance the antibacterial effects of COL against <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>-</sup> and <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>, when used in triple combination. The excellent bacteriostatic effect was primarily related to the increased cell membrane damage, accumulation of toxic compounds and inhibition of MCR-1. The potential binding sites of AS to MCR-1 (THR283, SER284, and TYR287) were critical for its inhibition of MCR-1 activity. Additionally, we also demonstrated that the CheA of chemosensory system and virulence-related protein SpvD were critical for the bacteriostatic synergistic effects of the triple combination. Selectively targeting CheA, SpvD or MCR using the natural compound AS could be further investigated as an attractive strategy for treatment of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection. Collectively, our work opens new avenues towards the potentiation of COL and revealed an alternative drug combination strategy to overcome COL resistant bacterial infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Salmonella</italic> is globally recognized as a major zoonotic foodborne pathogen, that responsible for food poisoning, gastroenteritis and even life threatening in animals and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Galán-Relaño <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gangathraprabhu, 2020</xref>). Antibiotics are commonly used to shorten duration of illness and reduce infectivity. However, with the increasing use of antibiotics, the infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, especially the carbapenemase-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, have become the major source of public-health concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Foletto <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). The shortage of new antibiotics for these MDR bacteria strains has led to the re-use of polymyxins as the “last resort” antimicrobial drug with the inevitable risk of emerging resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Falagas &amp; Kasiakou, 2005</xref>). Colistin (polymyxin E, COL), a fatty acyl oligopeptide antibiotic, is an active agent against Gram-negative (G<sup>-</sup>) pathogens, and has been widely used to combat <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections. Generally, COL kills bacteria through a detergent-like effect, that the polycationic ring of COL electrostatically interacted with the cell envelope components, causing the competitive displacement of divalent cations calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and magnesium (Mg<sup>2+</sup>), destabilizing the membrane, thus killing the bacterium via the “self-promoted uptake” pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kaye <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Beyond that, other models for the antibacterial activity have been reported, including vesicle-vesicle contact, hydroxyl radical death, inhibition of respiratory enzymes and anti-endotoxin COL activity pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">El-Sayed Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Until now, numerous chromosomally- or plasmid-mediated mechanisms underlying polymyxins resistance in G<sup>-</sup> bacteria have been identified, including intrinsic, mutation (eg. PmrAB, PhoPQ or AcrAB-TolC mutants), adaptation mechanisms or horizontally acquired resistance via the phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) transferase genes <italic>mcr-1</italic> to <italic>9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carroll <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lima <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Poirel <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To tackle the increasing emergence of MDR pathogens, many alternative therapies, less costly and time-consuming than drug discovery, have been new areas of current research interest, involving the combination therapy of existing agents, the drug discovery from natural products, and the evaluation of drug resistance reversers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rosenthal, 2003</xref>). A variety of antibiotic adjuvants that may or may not have direct antibacterial effects have been widely investigated to increase the effectiveness of current antibiotics or delay the emergence of drug resistance, such as β -lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme inhibitors, membrane permeabilisers, and efflux pump inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Laws <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Several promising inhibitors, for example zidebactam and pyrazolopyrimidine compounds have been described as the β-lactam and aminoglycoside enhancers against G<sup>-</sup> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Moya <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Stogios <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Alternatively, numerous synthetic antimicrobial peptides and plant-derived natural products have been shown to possess membrane permeabilising or efflux pump inhibitory activity, with the combination of azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aron &amp; Opperman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lin <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Su &amp; Wang, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Artesunate (AS) is a semi-synthetic derivative of anti-malarial compound artemisinin that extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Artemisia annua. Beyond remarkable antimalarial action, AS and other artemisinin derivatives, eg. dihydroartemisinin (DHA), have been proven to restored the antibacterial effect of COL against <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), while themselves didn’t exhibited intrinsic antimicrobial activity against clinical <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates as well as ATCC 25922 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhou <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). In addition, AS has also been proved to enhance the effectiveness of various β-lactam and fluoroquinolones antibiotics against MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> via inhibiting the efflux pump AcrAB-TolC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pan <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, the synergistic effect between AS and COL were only observed in a limited number of strains, with a modest reversal effect. Therefore, few studies have been undertaken to evaluate its underlying mechanism. Under this circumstance, it is meaningful to explore new drug combinations between AS and COL against MDR bacteria. Encouragingly, in this study, we confirmed the prominent synergistic effects of AS and EDTA to restore the antimicrobial activity of COL and its possible molecular mechanism.</p>

<title>Artesunate and EDTA could enhance the effects of colistin against <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains</title>
<p>The antimicrobial activities of AS, EDTA or COL alone were initially investigated to the COL-sensitive strains of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (JS, S34), COL-resistant clinical strains of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (S16, S20, S13, and S30), <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (E16), and intrinsically COL-resistant species (<italic>Morganella morganii</italic> strain M15, <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> strain P01). Results showed that AS or EDTA alone had no direct antibacterial activity against these strains, with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 1250 or &gt; 125 mg/L (Table supplement 1). Excepting for the two intrinsically COL-resistant strains M15 and P01, there were only slight decrease of COL MICs for other strains (fold changes ranging from 0 to 133), when the sub-inhibitory concentrations (1/4, 1/8, 1/16 MIC) of AS or EDTA were combined with COL (namely AC or EC) (Table supplement 1). Whease, we found marked decrease of COL MICs (up to 60000 fold), after three drug combinations (namely AEC) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These results indicated that when used simultaneously with COL, AS and EDTA exerted antibacterial enhancement activity for <italic>Salmonella</italic> and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, but not the intrinsically COL-resistant species. Thus, AS and EDTA could be considered as adjuvants to reverse COL resistance in <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>

<p>To verify the antibacterial enhancement activity of AS and EDTA, the growth curves of <italic>Salmonella</italic> JS, S16 (<italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>-</sup>), and S30 (<italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup>) for the combined treatments were generated within 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Generally, the higher concentration of COL (2 mg/L), either alone or in combinations, was found more effective against these strains than that of the lower concentration (0.1 mg/L). Compared with the control groups, when these bacteria were grown in the presence of COL alone (0.1 mg/L) or different drug combinations, the antimicrobial activity were not significant after incubation for 24 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a, b, c</xref>). By contrast, higher concentration of COL (2mg/L), alone or in combinations, showed better antibacterial activity, and a gradual increase in antibacterial activity was observed: AEC &gt; AC &gt; EC &gt; C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d, e, f</xref>). It’s worth noting that the effect of different combinations against <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup> strain S30 was weaker than that of <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>-</sup> S16 and standard sensitive strain JS.</p>

<title>Artesunate and EDTA enhanced the membrane-damaging effect of colistin on <italic>Salmonella</italic></title>
<p>In order to gain insight into the membrane-damaging bactericidal mechanism of COL alone or combinations, the damages to the bacterial outer and inner membrane (OM and IM) were severally monitored by measuring the fluorescent intensity of <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains S16 and S30 mixed with NPN and PI. Overall, the fluorescence signals of NPN and PI increased progressively with increases in the concentration of COL. After the treatment of AEC, S16 and S30 both showed strongest fluorescence signals of NPN, compared to those of other groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a, b</xref>). Nevertheless, AS treatment group also exerted a significant increase of fluorescent signal, although it is not as strong as that of AEC treated group. Meanwhile, there were rapid and significant increase in fluorescence of PI, when AEC or EC were added to bacterial cultures, and the two regimens played dominant roles in low or high concentrations of COL, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c, d</xref>). Therefore, these results indicated that the bacterial cell surfaces were severely damaged after the AEC treatment, via the rapid perturbations of OM and IM. Subsequently, the morphological changes of <italic>Salmonella</italic> strain S16 treated with different regimens were further investigated using Scanning electron microscope (SME) analysis to confirm the above membrane-damaging effect. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, SEM micro-graphs of control and solvent treated groups revealed that cells were short and rod-shaped, with rounded ends and intact cell membranes. As expected, after exposure to COL alone and different regimens, noticeable damage to the OM were observed, especially in AC and AEC treated group. Exposure to AC and AEC leading to cell damages characterized by folds, crevices, and depressions, which further suggested that AS and EDTA combined with COL resulted in remarkable bacterial membrane injury for antibacterial activity. Collectively, these data confirmed the membrane-damaging effects of AS, EDTA and COL combination against <italic>Salmonella</italic>.</p>

<title>AEC combination could collapse the Δψ component of Proton Motive Force (PMF) in <italic>Salmonella</italic></title>
<p>In bacteria, the PMF, alternatively known as electrochemical proton gradient, is result from the extrusion of protons by the electron transport chain, and made up of the sum of two parameters: an electric potential (Δψ) and an osmotic component (ΔpH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Farha <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). It has been reported to drives vital cellular processes in bacteria, including ATP synthesis, antibiotic transport, and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Le <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Therefore, PMF dissipation was considered as a promising strategy for combating microbial pathogens. In this work, we explored whether the antibacterial synergism activities of different combinations were accompanied by dissipation of PMF in cells. We uncovered that when compared to that of other groups, AEC treatment caused a rapid collapse of Δψ component, as shown by the increase in fluorescence values of DISC<sub>3</sub>(5) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e, f</xref>). But none of these combinations observed significant dissipation of ΔPH, when compared to that of control group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g, h</xref>). The above results indicated that AEC treatment was able to dissipate selectively the Δψ component of PMF.</p>

<title>Other reactive oxygen species (ROS), not H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, contributed to the AS and EDTA-mediated efficacy enhancement of COL</title>
<p>ROS including superoxide (O<sup>2-</sup>), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and hydroxyl radical ( · OH), are commonly generated during the electron transfer process, which has been considered to associated with the lethal action of diverse antimicrobials. Subsequently, we investigated whether the addition of AS and EDTA could facilitate the intracellular ROS generation and stimulate the ROS-mediated killing. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i, j</xref>, compared to control group, total ROS increases in S16 and S30 strains were observed in AC and AEC groups either after 0.1 or 2 mg/L COL was added, but for COL alone and EC groups, the increase were only occured after the addition of a relatively high COL concentration (2 mg/L). In addition, the ROS accumulation level was further increased in AEC group, when extending the incubation time period to 6 h (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> did not contribute to the increase of total ROS, as there was no significant difference in intracellular level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> among all the groups <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2k, l</xref>. Collectively, these observations supported a role for ROS in AS and EDTA-mediated efficacy enhancement of COL.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>Membrane-damaging played a crucial role in the synergistic antimicrobial effects of AS+EDTA+COL combination</title>
<p>COL is an increasingly important antibiotic against serious infections caused by G<sup>-</sup> bacteria. It damages both the OM and IM layers of the cell surface by targeting LPS, displacing cations that form bridges between LPS molecules, and thereby leading to disruption of the cell envelope and bacterial lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sabnis <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Our data showed that the AEC combination could permit ingress of NPN fluorophore into the OM, as well as the membrane impermeant dye PI into the IM, which fluoresces upon contact with DNA in the bacterial cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-d</xref>). Thus, it indicated AEC combination has punched holes in both the OM and IM of whole bacterial cells. The considerably deformed of cell membranes observed by SEM further supported the above results that the membrane integrity, and permeability were damaged after AEC incubation. Considering that EDTA is used as a complexing agent, we tried to explore if it could assist COL to destroy the bacterial membrane and reduce their survival by chelating cations that stabilize LPS and the outer membrane. Nevertheless, we found minimal changes in MICs of different combinations to S16 and S30 strains, after different cations (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup>) were supplemented (Table supplement 2). In contrast, LPS treatment resulted in dose-dependent changes in MICs of different combinations to S16 and S30 strains (Table supplement 3), which indicated that LPS on cell membrane was a crucial target for AEC to injure cell membrane and exert prominent antibacterial effects.</p>
<p>Whilst it is commonly believed that COL acts against G<sup>-</sup> bacteria by cell membrane lysis, we hypothesised that alterations in bacterial membrane lipid composition may also be a possible Achilles’ heel to increase efficacy of COL after the AEC incubation in this paper. The metabolomic results of AEC vs. C group in this study showed a significant decrease of prostaglandins (PGs) in arachdonic acid metabolism pathway (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Arachidonic acid is a highly abundant long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid in vertebrates, which have been proposed to have antibacterial roles. Exogenous Arachidonic acid has been reported to readily incorporated into the synthesis pathways of membrane phospholipids, and exert detrimental effects on membrane integrity by perturbing membrane ordering, altering membrane composition and increasing fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Eijkelkamp <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">MacDermott-Opeskin <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). PGs are lipid compounds derived from arachidonic acid, which has been demonstrate to enhance biofilm development and fungal load in the murine vaginae of <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ells <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that the down-regulated lipid compounds PGs may lead to perturbtion of membrane phospholipids in cell membranes and reduce microbial viability.</p>
<p>Accumulation of toxic compounds may also be held responsible for the membrane damage. We noted that there were significant accumulation of styrene in both S16 and S30 strains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Styrene is naturally present as a minor metabolite, that can be synthesized at low levels by several microorganisms, like <italic>Pencillium camemberti</italic> and members of the <italic>Styracaceae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yeh <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). However, styrene itself is toxic to most cell types, and its hydrophobic molecules could readily partition into bacterial membrane, resulting in membrane disruption and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lian <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Additionally, we found that the taurocholic acid and protocatechuic acid were up-regulated respectively in S16 and S30 strains (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Taurocholic acid is usually a major component of the selective culture medium, for example MacConkey agar, for G<sup>-</sup> bacteria, which has also been confirmed as a secondary metabolite of marine isolates and the soil bacterium <italic>Streptococcus faecium</italic>. Sannasiddappa <italic>et al</italic> have proved that taurocholic acid were able to inhibit growth of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> through increasing membrane permeability and disruption of the PMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sannasiddappa <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Protocatechuic acid has been demonstrated to exert antimicrobial effects by disrupting the cell membranes, preventing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bernal-Mercado <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stojković <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Consequently, these toxic compounds were anticipated to accelerate the destruction of cell membrane and thus enhance the antibacterial activity.</p>

<title>The CheA of chemosensory system and virulence-related protein SpvD were critical for the bacteriostatic synergistic effect of AEC combination</title>
<p>Flagellar motility is intimately connected to chemotaxis, biofilm formation, colonisation and virulence of many bacterial pathogens. It is generally regulated by a chemotactic signaling system, which enables their movement toward favorable conditions and invade their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bolton, 2015</xref>). The chemotaxis proteins CheA, CheW, CheY, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) have already been identified as core components and present in all chemotaxis systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Minamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). The <italic>Salmonella</italic> flagellum is composed of about 30 different proteins, such as FliD (the filament cap), FlgK and FlgL (the hook-filament junction) <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Minamino <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Tellingly, we have found an extensive down-regulation of chemotaxis and flagellar assembly related genes in S16 and S30 strains after AEC incubation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a-d</xref>). Meanwhile, the swimming motility of the strains were decreased after AEC incubation (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 5</xref>). The overexpression of <italic>cheA</italic> in S16 strain, but not <italic>cheY</italic>, <italic>STMDT2-34621</italic>, <italic>aer</italic>, <italic>fliD</italic>, <italic>fliT</italic>, could lead to noticeable increases of MICs by 4 to 32 fold, after EC or AEC incubation (Table supplement 4). These results suggested that the down regulation of the central component of chemosensory system CheA may affect both chemotactic motility and general structure of flagellum, thus attenuating <italic>Salmonella</italic> survival after AEC treatment.</p>
<p>In addition to the above findings, we also noted that there were relatively large number of SDEGs, most of them were down-regulated, enriched in the ABC transports pathway in S16 and S30 strains after AEC incubation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e, f</xref>). ABC transporters are a class of transmembrane transporters, which mediate uptake of micronutrients, including saccharides, amino acids, metal ions <italic>et al</italic> and have also been shown to protect bacteria from hazardous compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Nguyen &amp; Götz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). The <italic>opuBB</italic> and <italic>opuBA</italic> encode components of the ABC-type proline/glycine betaine transport system, and their up-regulation were proved to promote accumulation of proline that acted as an osmoprotectant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Similarly, the OsmU osmoprotectant systems, consisting of OsmV, OsmW, OsmY, and OsmX, were identified to enable bacterial survival at high-osmolarity through the accumulation of glycine betaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Frossard <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). The <italic>gltI</italic> gene encodes glutamate/aspartate transport protein, and its deletion in <italic>E. coli</italic> were shown to result in attenuated survival under antibiotics, acid, and hyperosmotic stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Niu <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the dipeptide permease operon (<italic>dpp</italic>), especially <italic>dppA</italic>, has been reported as an essential enzyme for survival of <italic>Mycobacteria tuberculosis</italic> under nutrient starvation conditions, and was associated with reduced bacterial burden in chronically infected mice in knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fernando <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, the overexpression of <italic>opuBB</italic>, <italic>gltI</italic>, <italic>dppB</italic> and <italic>dppC</italic> genes caused no detectable change in MICs for S16 strain after AEC incubation (Table supplement 4). Thus, these observations suggest that overexpression of these SDEGs in ABC transporters were not sufficient enough for causing changes in COL susceptibility, and additional factors may be required for the excellent bactericidal activity of AEC.</p>
<p>Besides that, we also noticed that the expression levels of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection related genes <italic>sseJ</italic>, <italic>spvD</italic> and ribosomal protein genes <italic>rpmJ</italic>, <italic>rpmE</italic> were all strikingly changed in S16 strain (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4a</xref>). SseL and SpvD are effectors of <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI1 and SPI2), which are required for full virulence during animal infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Coombes <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Grabe <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). The <italic>rpmJ</italic> gene codified a part of 50S ribosomal subunit, and its up-regulation has been related to size increase and slow growth of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Peredo-Lovillo <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). The overexpression of <italic>spvD</italic> gene in S16 strain could attenuate the antibacterial activity of AC and AEC regimen with 4 fold increase in MICs (Table supplement 4), which indicated that the virulence-related protein SpvD contributed to the increase of COL susceptibility after AEC incubation.</p>

<title>Artesunate can be considered as a potential MCR-1 inhibitor that enhances the efficacy of colistin</title>
<p>During our research process, several phenomenon have caught our attention, that the synergistic effect of AEC combination was irrelevant to whether the <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic> gene exists or not, and the <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>-</sup> strain S16 exhibited more robust changes than that of <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup> strain S30 in different KEGG pathways. These results indicated that AS and EDTA were possible to exert synergistic effects by blocking the broad-spectrum resistance mechanisms (eg. efflux pumps, membrane damage), and coupling with the drug-specific resistance mechanisms (eg. MCR-1, β-lactamase). Previously, AS was capable of significantly enhancing the antibacterial activity of β-lactam antibiotics against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, via inhibition of the efflux pumps such as AcrB, NorA, NorB, and NorC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jiang <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Molecular docking experiments showed that AS could dock into AcrB very well forming five hydrogen bonds with Ser46, Gln89 and Gln176 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Whereas, in this paper, the inhibitory actions of different drug combinations on efflux pump were only observed in <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>-</sup> strain S16, regardless of whether AS was added (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4c</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesised that AS may exert synergistic effects with COL against <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic><sup>+</sup> S30 strain by targeting MCR-1 rather than efflux pump.</p>
<p>MCR-1 comprises two distinct domains, an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a soluble C-terminal α / β / α sandwich domain where the active site located. The active site contains a concentration of metal-binding residues to accommodate between one and four zinc ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wei <italic>et al</italic>, 2018</xref>). Several crystal structures of the soluble domain have been well studied, and six residues GLU246, THR285, HIS395, ASP465, HIS466, and HIS478 were found conserved among pEtN transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ma <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Especially the THR285 residue, which was highly conserved and providing a distinct electronegative potential to attract and bind the substrate pEtN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Son <italic>et al</italic>, 2019</xref>). Mutations of these residues and stripping the metals by EDTA could re-establish polymyxin B antibacterial action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hinchliffe <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hu <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stojanoski <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). In this paper, we firstly analyzed the relative expression of <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic> in S30 strain after the incubation of different drug combinations, and found a striking down-regulation of <italic>mcr</italic>-<italic>1</italic> gene whether after AC, EC incubation or AEC incubation, when compered to that of A and E treatment (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4b</xref>). Additionally, we performed the molecular docking between AS and MCR-1 to predict if there were possible interactions, and found that AS could bind to the residues arrounding the reported key residues within MCR-1 of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, forming seven hydrogen bonds with THR283, SER284, TYR287, PRO481, and ASN482 residues (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplement 4e</xref>). The interaction between AS and MCR-1 was further proved by competitive inhibitory assays, that the binding of AS with MCR-1 was blocked after the addition of polypeptide P<sub>u</sub> (containing unmutated THR283, SER284, and TYR287 sites) and lead to significant increases of MICs by 8 fold after AC or AEC treatment (Table supplement 5). Nevertheless, we also noticed that the blocking effect could not be removed by peptide P<sub>m</sub> (containing mutated THR283, SER284, and TYR287 sites) when EDTA exists. We supposed that EDTA may chelate zinc ions that required for MCR-1 activity. Thus, we suggested that AS could be developed as the a MCR-1 inhibitor, and coupled with the chelating agent EDTA may favor to additionally magnify its inhibitory effect.</p>

<title>A mixed blessing: the excellent antibacterial activity and potential toxicity of AEC combination</title>
<p>In the preceding years, several studies have reported on the synergistic effects of COL with different candidates, such as antimicrobial agents, natural compounds and synthetically prepared molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cui <italic>et al</italic>, 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yi <italic>et al</italic>, 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, the potential toxicity of these combination therapy will be the prime concern affecting their clinical application, and a similar concern has also been raised for the AEC combination in this study. Although <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have determined that with increasing dose of AS and EDTA, the antibacterial synergistic activity was gradually enhanced, and meanwhie, may also resulting in more toxic side effects. Thus, In our study, the 1/8 MICs of AS and EDTA were selected to ensure excellent antibacterial activity whereas minimize the potential toxicity. The toxic side effects of AEC combination may be most probably caused by COL, which is well known to present several adverse toxic effects, and the dose-dependent nephrotoxicity is the most reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lu <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Visentin <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). Conversely, EDTA and AS may be low toxicity. When used in combination with COL or AB569, EDTA has been proved to synergistically overcome the COL-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumonieae</italic> and MDR <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> with the concentration of 12000 mg/L and 73 mg/L, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bari <italic>et al</italic>, 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bogue <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). These concentrations were reported non-toxic to primary adult human skin (dermal) fibroblasts and other normal body cells, which may also apply to the lower concentrations of EDTA (15.6 mg/L) used in AEC combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Shein <italic>et al</italic>, 2021</xref>). Additionally, AS has been found to exert multiple pharmacological actions including anti-malaria, anti-tumor, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects, which has displayed a relatively safe toxicity profile with the LD<sub>50</sub> values being 4223 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheong <italic>et al</italic>, 2020</xref>). However, the potential toxic effects of AEC combination is still unknown and requires further investigations.</p>
<p>In summary, our results established that the combination of COL with AS and EDTA was a promising candidate for combating infections caused by MCR-negative and -positive COL-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic>. The membrane-damaging effect, accumulation of toxic compounds, inhibition of MCR-1 were supposed to play synergistic roles in reversing COL resistance of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>).

<p>The MICs of COL, AS, and EDTA against all strains were determined by the 2-fold serial broth microdilution method according to CLSI guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wayne, 2021</xref>) The double and triple combination strategies were carried out as follow: AS (1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 MIC of AS)+ COL, EDTA (1/4, 1/8, or 1/16 MIC of EDTA) + COL, AS (1/4 MIC of AS)+ EDTA (1/4, 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 MIC of EDTA) + COL, AS (1/8 MIC of AS)+ EDTA (1/4, 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 MIC of EDTA) + COL. These medication strategies, including COL alone, AS + COL, EDTA + COL, AS + EDTA + COL, were abbreviated as C, AC, EC, and AEC, respectively. When determining the MICs of COL after drug combinations, AS or/and EDTA were pre-added into MHB broth with different final concentrations, namely 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 MIC of AS (312.5, 156.25, 78.13, 39.06 mg/L) or EDTA (for example 31.25, 15.63, 7.81, 3.91 mg/L for JS, S16 and S30 strains), then COL was added and diluted to make a 2-fold dilution series. The lowest concentrations with no visible growth of bacteria were defined as MIC values of COL after drug combinations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study addresses the growing threat of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, focusing on the efficacy of colistin (COL), a last-resort antibiotic, and its enhanced activity when combined with artesunate (AS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) against colistin-resistant Salmonella strains. The researchers aim to explore whether these combinations can restore the effectiveness of colistin and understand the underlying mechanisms. The study used a combination of microbiological and molecular techniques to evaluate the antibacterial activity and mechanisms of action of COL, AS, and EDTA. Key methods included: (i) Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing: Determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of COL, AS, and EDTA, both alone and in combination, against various Salmonella strains; (ii) Time-Kill Assays: Measuring bacterial growth inhibition over time with different drug combinations; (iii) Fluorescent Probe-Permeability Assays: Assessing cell membrane integrity using fluorescent dyes; (iv) Proton Motive Force Assay: Evaluating the impact on the electrochemical proton gradient (PMF); (v) Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Measurement: Quantifying intracellular ROS levels; (vi) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM): Observing morphological changes in bacterial cells; and (vii) Omics Analysis: Transcriptome and metabolome profiling to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and significant differential metabolites (SDMs). The combination of COL, AS, and EDTA (AEC) showed significant antibacterial activity against colistin-resistant Salmonella strains, reducing the MICs and enhancing bacterial killing compared to individual treatments. The AEC treatment caused extensive damage to both the outer and inner bacterial membranes, as evidenced by increased fluorescence of membrane-impermeant dyes and SEM images showing deformed cell membranes. AEC treatment selectively collapsed the Δψ component of PMF, indicating disruption of vital cellular processes. The combination therapy increased intracellular ROS levels, contributing to bacterial killing. Transcriptome data revealed changes in genes related to two-component systems, flagellar assembly, and ABC transporters. Metabolome analysis highlighted disruptions in pathways such as arachidonic acid metabolism. The findings suggest that AS and EDTA can potentiate the antibacterial effects of colistin by disrupting bacterial membranes, collapsing PMF, and increasing ROS levels. This combination therapy could serve as a promising approach to combat colistin-resistant Salmonella infections.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The study employs a wide range of techniques to thoroughly investigate the antibacterial mechanisms and efficacy of the drug combinations.</p>
<p>
- The results are consistent across multiple assays and supported by both in vitro and in vivo data.</p>
<p>
- Combining AS and EDTA with COL represents a novel strategy to tackle antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The methodology used for interpreting and reporting time-kill assay results.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>Overall, the authors have adequately addressed the suggestions provided.</p>

<p>The study by Zhai et al describes repurposing of artesunate, to be used in combination with EDTA to resensitize Salmonella spp. to colistin. The observed effect applied both to strains with and without mobile colistin resistance determinants (MCR). It is known since earlier that EDTA in combination with colistin has an inhibitory effect on MCR-enzymes, but at the same time both colistin and EDTA can contribute to nephrotoxicity, something which is also true for artesunate. Thus, the triple combination of three nephrotoxic agents has significant challenges in vivo, which is not particularly discussed in this paper.</p>
<p>The study is sound from a methodological point of view and has many interesting angles to address mechanistically how the three compounds can synergize.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>After having read the revised version, I have the following comments:</p>
<p>(1) The antimicrobials tested in Figure 9 are not really very relevant. I would want to see carbapenems and novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors rather than many old drugs with a debatable role in the treatment of Gram-negative infections. At least the authors should be able to test carbapenem resistance</p>
<p>
(2) The genomics analysis of the strains should be fairly quick - both in terms of characterizing the mobile resistome and the sequence types. There are publicly available databases for this purpose</p>
<p>The rest of my comments have been addressed in the revised version. There are still some remaining valid points from other reviewers that could be debatable whether they should be address. The authors refer to plans of studying these aspects in subsequent studies, but it could be discussed whether some of the data could be expected already in this study.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife Assessment:</bold></p>
<p>This study provides valuable insights, addressing the growing threat of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens by focusing on the enhanced efficacy of colistin when combined with artesunate and EDTA against colistin-resistant <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains. The evidence is solid, supported by comprehensive microbiological assays, molecular analyses, and in vivo experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of this synergic combination. However, the discussion on the clinical application challenges of this triple combination is incomplete, and it would benefit from addressing the high risk associated with using three potential nephrotoxic agents in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The development of novel pharmaceutical dosage forms, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety analysis of the triple combination will be further conducted in our next study to provide a theoretical basis for the next clinical drug use. The discussion of potential toxicity of AS, colistin, EDTA and the triple combination have been added in line 318 to 337.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The study focuses on a limited number of <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains, and broader testing on various MDR pathogens would strengthen the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The number of COL-resistant clinical strains that actually used was larger than that mentioned in our original article, when evaluating the antimicrobial activities of AS, EDTA, COL alone or drug combinations. But, considering that there were superfluous results of <italic>mcr-1</italic> positive <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains, we omitted these results (Table supplement 7 and 8 in revised supplement materials) to avoid redundant data presentation in the original article. Additionally, much more gram-negative and -positive MDR bacteria, such as <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> will be selected for the next study including the development of novel pharmaceutical dosage forms, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety analysis <italic>et al</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) While the study elucidates several mechanisms, further molecular details could provide deeper insights into the interactions between these drugs and bacterial targets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our next study, further molecular details will be focused on the regulatory targets of CheA and SpvD-related pathways, as well as the precise inhibition targets of MCR protein by the triple combination, through the generation of deletion or point mutations, and analysis of intermolecular interactions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The time-kill experiment was conducted over 12 hours instead of the recommended 24 hours. To demonstrate a synergistic effect among the drugs, a reduction of at least 2 log10 in colony count should be shown in a 24-hour experiment. Additionally, clarifying the criteria for selecting drug concentrations is important to improve the interpretation of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The time-kill experiment of 24 hours have been re-executed and could be used to replace the Figure 1 in the original paper. The New Figure 1 has been uploaded and the change do not affect our interpretation of the result.</p>
<p>Although <italic>in</italic> <italic>vitro</italic> studies have determined that with increasing dose of AS and EDTA, the antibacterial synergistic activity was gradually enhanced, and meanwhie, may also resulting in more toxic side effects. Thus, in our study, the 1/8 MICs of AS and EDTA were selected to ensure excellent antibacterial activity whereas minimize the potential toxicity. The instructions on the selection of drug concentration have been added in line 323 to 326.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The study by Zhai et al describes repurposing of artesunate, to be used in combination with EDTA to resensitize Salmonella spp. to colistin. The observed effect applied both to strains with and without mobile colistin resistance determinants (MCR). It was already known that EDTA in combination with colistin has an inhibitory effect on MCR-enzymes, but at the same time, both colistin and EDTA can contribute to nephrotoxicity, something which is also true for artesunate. Thus, the triple combination of three nephrotoxic agents has significant challenges in vivo, which is not particularly discussed in this paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The discussion of potential toxicity of triple combination has been added in line 318 to 337.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The selection of strains is not very clear. Nothing is known about the sequence types of the strains or how representative they are for strains circulating in general. Thus, it is difficult to generalize from this limited number of isolates, although the studies done in these isolates are comprehensive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The tested strains in this study were all COL-resistant clinical isolates, and the genome sequencing and comparative analysis of these strains have not been analyzed. The antibacterial activities of different antimicrobial drugs against the S16 and S30 strains have been measured and listed in the Table supplement 9 within revised supplement materials. Considering that the number of COL-resistant clinical strains that actually used was larger than that mentioned in our original article (see the NO.1 response to the Public Reviewer #1), we think that the results obtained in this study could be representative to some extent.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Nothing is known about the susceptibility of the strains to other novel antimicrobial agents. Colistin has a limited role in the treatment of gram-negative infections, and although it can be used sometimes in combination, it is not clear why it would be combined with two other nephrotoxic agents and how this could have relevance in a clinical setting.</p>

<p>(4) It is not clear whether their transcriptomics analysis should at least be carried out in duplicate for reasons of being able to assess reproducibility. It is also not clear why the samples were incubated for 6 hours - no discussion is presented on the selection of a time point for this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As it can be seen from the time kill curves that the survival number of bacteria started to decrease after 4 h incubation of drug combinations. If the incubation time is too short (for example less than 4 h), the differentially expressed genes can not be fully revealed, while too long incubation time (such as 8 h and 12 h) may lead to a significant CFU reduction of bacteria, and result in inaccurate sequencing results. Therefore, we selected the incubation time 6 h, at which point drugs exhibited  significant antibacterial effects and there were also enough survival bacteria in the sample for transcriptome analysis. Each sample had three replications to preserve the accuracy of results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Discussion is lacking on the reproducibility and selection of details for the methodology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results obtained in this paper have been repeated several times, which indicated that the detailed operation steps described in the materials and methods section were reproducibility. To avoid redundancy, we did not include too much details in the discussion section.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Introduction:</p>
<p>The introduction should provide more context about the pathogen Salmonella, its significance in both human and veterinary medicine, and the impact of colistin resistance in these pathogens. Salmonella is a leading cause of foodborne illnesses worldwide, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. It can cause a range of diseases, from gastroenteritis to more severe systemic infections like typhoid fever and invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis. In veterinary medicine, Salmonella infections can lead to significant economic losses in livestock industries due to illness and death among animals, as well as through the contamination of animal products.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The description has been added in the introduction section in line 47 to 53.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Results and Discussion:</p>
<p>(1) While the combination of EDTA, artesunate, and colistin shows promising in vitro results against Salmonella, the clinical application of this combination warrants careful consideration due to potential toxicity issues associated with these compounds. Colistin is known for nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, limiting its use to severe cases where the benefits outweigh the risks. EDTA, as a chelating agent, can disrupt essential metal ions in the body, posing risks of metabolic imbalances. Although it has clinical applications, primarily in cases of heavy metal poisoning, its use as an adjuvant in antibiotics may present risks. Although generally well-tolerated for malaria, interactions of artesunate with other drugs and long-term safety in combined therapies require thorough investigation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The discussion of potential toxicity of triple combination has been added in line 318 to 337.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Table 1: The manuscript mentions that some strains used in the study are mcr-positive and mcr-negative. It is important to indicate in Table 1, in addition to the identification of Salmonella species, which strains are mcr-positive or mcr-negative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The relevant information has been added in Table 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Figure 2: What is the authors' hypothesis regarding the growth curves labeled &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; where strains JS and S16 resume growth 12 hours after treatment with AS? In the legend of Figure 2, describe what was used as the &quot;positive control group.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The growth curves labeled “a” and “e” were in Figure 1. After incubated with AC for 8 h, the survival CFUs of JS and S16 strains showed a slightly reduction, but there were still living cells. Since the bactericidal activity of AC is not strong enough to exert sustained bactericidal activity, these remaining living cells will resume growth after treatment with AC for 12 h. The “positive control group” in the legend of Figure 2 has been indicated in line 724.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) What is the authors' hypothesis for the differences observed in the transcriptome and metabolome?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The changes in gene transcription level may cause corresponding changes in protein level, but these proteins are not all involved in the bacterial metabolic process. For example, MCR protein  is encoded by the COL resistance related gene <italic>mcr</italic>, which mediates the modification of lipid A, but are not involved in the cellular metabolic process. Therefore, the transcriptome change of <italic>mcr</italic> gene may affect the protein production of MCR, nor the bacterial metabolic processes, so there are differences observed in the transcriptome and metabolome.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In some parts of the text, the authors state that artesunate and EDTA potentiate the action of colistin, which is a bacteriostatic drug. However, in other parts, the authors describe the effect of the AEC combination as bacteriostatic (Abstract: line 32; Results: line 179). How do the authors explain this inconsistency?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The artesunate and EDTA could be regarded as “adjuvants” for the bacteriostatic drug colistin. Adjuvants itself act no or weak antibacterial effect on bacteria. For antimicrobial drugs, the “adjuvants” are compounds that generally used in combination with antibacterial drugs to re-sensitizing bacteria that have developed drug resistance. Thus, in this paper the AEC combination could be regared as bacteriostatic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) According to Brennan &amp; Kirby (2019; doi: 10.1016/j.cll.2019.04.002), to evaluate the synergism between different drug combinations, bacterial growth curves need to be assessed over 24 hours. If the colony count is {greater than or equal to} 2 log10 lower than that of the most active antimicrobial alone, the combination is considered synergistic. Based on the growth curve results shown in Figure 1, the experiment was conducted for 12 hours, and in some cases, only a small reduction in growth was observed, even at the maximum concentration of colistin. Moreover, in some cases, the curve resumes rising between 8 and 12 hours. What is the authors' hypothesis in this case? It is important to conduct the assay over 24 hours to confirm the synergism between these drugs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The time-kill experiment of 24 hours have been re-executed and could be used to replace the Figure 1 in the original paper. Additionally, the phenomenon that “the curve resumes rising between 8 and 12 hours” has been explained in the response to comment of “Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors), Results and Discussion, (3) Figure 2”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) To prove that CheA and SpvD play a critical role in the effect of the AEC combination, deletion of these genes should be performed, and the mutant strains should be tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The deletion of <italic>cheA</italic> and <italic>spvD</italic> will be carried out in our next study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) To demonstrate that the flagellum is no longer assembled, a transmission electron microscopy image using antibodies against flagellin should be performed, along with motility tests.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The motility assays have been performed and displayed as Figure supplement 5 in the revised supplement materials.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Figure 7: In the X-axis legend, specify what &quot;model&quot; refers to.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The “model” refers to the PBS control group that mice were treated with PBS after the intraperitoneal injection of 100 µL bacterial solution (1.31 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFU).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Figure 8 Legend: In the legend of Figure 8 (line 717), are the authors referring to E. coli or Salmonella?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It referred to <italic>Salmonella</italic>, which has already been illustrated in the headline of Figure 8 in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Materials and Methods:</p>
<p>(1) Bacterial Strains and Agents: It would be beneficial to include in the table the species of the strains used in the study, as well as the concentrations of colistin, artesunate, and EDTA utilized (lines 321 - 332).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have ever tried to add the above information to Table 1, but the addition of this information would make the table too large and beyond the margins, which is not conducive to the layout design of the table, so we chose to display these information in the materials and methods section instead of the table.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Antibacterial Activity In Vitro: Ensure clarity and well-defined ranges for the concentrations of colistin, EDTA, and artesunate used separately and in combinations (lines 335 - 344).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The drug concentrations have been listed in line 369 to 371.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Time-Kill Assays: Clarify the criteria for selecting concentrations, whether based on MICs or peak and trough concentrations relevant to human and animal treatments with colistin (lines 345 - 351).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although <italic>in</italic> <italic>vitro</italic> studies have determined that with increasing dose of AS and EDTA, the antibacterial synergistic activity was gradually enhanced, and meanwhie, may also resulting in more toxic side effects. Thus, in our study, the 1/8 MICs of AS and EDTA were selected to ensure excellent antibacterial activity whereas minimize the potential toxicity. The instructions on the selection of drug concentration have been added in line 323 to 326.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) General Corrections: Throughout the manuscript, correct typographical errors and consistently include the concentration values in mg/L alongside the MIC fractions. Specify the strains used for all experiments to ensure clarity. In the manuscript, the term &quot;medication regimens&quot; is used to describe the experimental setups involving different combinations of drugs tested in vitro. To improve accuracy and clarity, it is recommended to use the term &quot;drug combination&quot; instead. This term is more appropriate for in vitro experiments and will help avoid confusion with clinical treatment protocols.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The typographical errors have been checked and corrected throughout the manuscript, and the “medication regimens” have been replaced by “drug combinations”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Please see above for recommendations on what can be done to improve the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While other omics analyses have been conducted herein, the authors do not comment on the genomic analysis of their own strains. It would have been a natural step to sequence all the strains used in the experiments.</p>
<p>Due to limited program funding, the genome sequencing and comparative analysis of these strains have not been analyzed. The antibacterial activities of different antimicrobial drugs against the S16 and S30 strains have been measured and listed in the Table supplement 9 within revised supplement materials.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) There are some spelling errors - e.g. &quot;bacteria strains&quot; instead of &quot;bacterial strains&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The grammar and spelling errors have been corrected throughout the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) I would avoid words like &quot;unfortunately&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The word “unfortunately” has been changed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Some MIC-values in Table 1 seem incorrect - e.g. 24 mg/L. This is not a 2-log value - the value should be 32 mg/L if the dilution series has been carried out correctly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are so sorry for the mistake. The data has been corrected, and we also checked other data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Below are some suggestions.</p>
<p>(1) Sentences L47 &amp; L48 &quot;Infections with antibiotic-resistant pathogens, especially carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, represent an impending catastrophe of a return to the pre-antibiotic era&quot; - this is slightly exaggerated! I also wonder if we need to use Enterobacterales instead of Enterobacteriaceae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The sentences in L47 &amp; L48 have been changed. We googled the “carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae” and found it is a high-frequency word in numerous reports.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) L48. The drying up of the antibiotic discovery pipeline is NOT necessarily the reason to use colistin as a drug of last resort!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The sentence has been revised.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The manuscript requires extensive English editing but has merit based on the strong compilation of data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have optimized and revised the writing of the whole article.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) I suggest the authors have some data on the cytotoxicity of AS alone, colistin alone, and both of them against eucaryotic cells (Caco-) and if possible determine IS (index selectivity). This additional experiment will strengthen the quality of the manuscript. The authors must also explain how to put such tri-therapy into practice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The development of novel pharmaceutical dosage forms, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety analysis of the triple combination will be further conducted in our next study to provide a theoretical basis for the next clinical drug use. The discussion of potential toxicity of AS, colistin, EDTA and the triple combination have been added in line 318 to 337.</p>
