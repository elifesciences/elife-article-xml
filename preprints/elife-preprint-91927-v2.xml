<title>Abstract</title><p>Dissection of neural circuitry underlying behaviors is a central theme in neurobiology. We have previously proposed the concept of chemoconnectome (CCT) to cover the entire chemical transmission between neurons and target cells in an organize and created tools for studying it (CCTomics) by targeting all genes related to the CCT in Drosophila. Here we have created lines targeting the CCT in conditional manners after modifying GFP RNA interference, Flp-out and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies. All three strategies are validated to be highly effective with the best using chromatin-peptide fused Cas9 variants and scaffold optimized sgRNAs. As a proof of principle, we conduct a comprehensive intersection analysis of CCT genes expression profiles in the clock neurons, uncovering 43 CCT genes present in clock neurons. Specific elimination of each from clock neurons revealed that loss of the neuropeptide CNMa in two posterior dorsal clock neurons (DN1ps) or its receptor (CNMaR) caused advanced morning activity, indicating a suppressive role of CNMa-CNMaR on morning anticipation, opposite to the promoting role of PDF-PDFR on morning anticipation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of conditional CCTomics and its tools created by us here and establish an antagonistic relationship between CNMa-CNMaR and PDF-PDFR signaling in regulating morning anticipation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much research efforts have been made to uncover the wiring and signaling pathways of neural circuits underlying specific behaviors. Circuit dissection strategies include genetic screening, genetic labelling, circuit tracing, live imaging, genetic sensors and central nervous system (CNS) reconstruction via electron microscopy (EM). Recently, we have developed chemoconnectomics (CCTomics), focusing on building a comprehensive set of knockout and knockin tool lines of chemoconnectome (CCT) genes, to dissect neural circuitry based on chemical transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deng et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Each strategy has advantages and disadvantages. For example, genetic screening is less biased but inefficient; circuit tracing with viruses provides information of connection, but is often prone to leaky expression and inaccurate labelling; and EM reconstruction is anatomically accurate but does not allow for manipulation of corresponding neurons. CCTomics overcomes limitations of previous strategies by allowing for behavioral screening of CCT genes and accurate labelling or manipulation of corresponding neurons. However, it is still limited in that knockout of some CCT genes can be lethal during development and that CCT genes may function differently in different neurons, which require a cell type-specific manipulation. Thus, we decided to invent a conditional CCTomics (cCCTomics) in which gene deletion was conditional.</p>
<p>There are three major strategies for somatic gene mutagenesis at the DNA/RNA level: RNA interference, DNA site-specific recombination enzymes, and CRISPR/Cas system. RNA interference targets RNAs conveniently and efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Martin and Caplen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Oberdoerffer et al., 2005</xref>). Libraries of transgenic RNAi flies covering almost the entire fly genome have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Perkins et al., 2015</xref>). DNA site specific recombination enzymes such as Flp, B3 and Cre mediate specific and efficient gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gaj et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Grindley et al., 2006</xref>). These strategies require flies with reverse repetitive sequences knocked into the corresponding genes, which is time-consuming with relatively complex recombination for genetic assays. CRISPR/Cas systems, particularly CRISPR/Cas9, which targets DNA with a sgRNA/Cas protein complex, have been broadly applied in gene manipulation over the last decade. The widespread use of CRIPSR/Cas9 in Drosophila somatic gene manipulation began in 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). Later, tRNA-flanking sgRNAs was designed and applied, which enabled multiple sgRNAs to mature in a single transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Xie et al., 2015</xref>), accelerating the application of this strategy in conditional gene manipulation in flies with impressive efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Delventhal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Port et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Schlichting et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Schlichting et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, libraries of UAS-sgRNA targeting kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Port et al., 2020</xref>) and GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Schlichting et al., 2022</xref>) have been established, but no sgRNA libraries covering all the CCT genes exists yet. The efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 has not been validated systematically in the Drosophila nervous system.</p>
<p>The circadian rhythm can be used for proof of principle testing of cCCTomics. Organisms evolve periodic behaviors and physiological traits in response to cyclical environmental changes. The rhythmic locomotor behavior of Drosophila, for instance, shows enhanced activity before the light is turned on and off in a light-dark (LD) cycle, referred to as morning and evening anticipations, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Collins et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Helfrich-Förster, 2001</xref>). Under 12 hours (h) dark-12 h dark (DD) conditions, the activities peaks regularly about every 24 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>). Approximately 150 clock neurons, circadian output neurons and extra-clock electrical oscillators (xCEOs) coordinate Drosophila circadian behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dubowy and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tang et al., 2022</xref>). The regulation of morning and evening anticipations, the most prominent features in the LD condition, is primarily mediated by four pairs of sLNvs expressing pigment dispersing factor (PDF), six pairs of LNds and the 5<sup>th</sup> s-LNv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rieger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>). At the molecular level, Pdf and Pdf receptor (PDFR) are well-known, with their mutants showing an advanced evening activity peak and no morning anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hyun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lear et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Renn et al., 1999</xref>). Other neuropeptides and their receptors, including AstC/AstC-R2 and neuropeptide F (NPF) and its receptor (NPFR), have also been reported to modulate evening activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Díaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hermann et al., 2012</xref>), while CCHa1/CCHa1-R and Dh31 regulate morning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fujiwara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Goda et al., 2019</xref>). To date, no advanced morning activity phenotype has been reported in flies.</p>
<p>To develop a more efficient approach for somatic gene manipulation, we have now generated two systems for conditional manipulation of CCT genes. One is GFPi/Flp-out-based conditional knockout system of CCT genes (cCCTomics) and another is CRISPR/Cas9-based (C-cCCTomics). Both systems have achieved high efficiency of gene mutagenesis in the Drosophila nervous system. C-cCCTomics, utilizing chromatin-peptide fused Cas9 and scaffold optimized sgRNA, makes efficient conditional gene knockout as simple as RNAi. Further application of C-cCCTomics in clock neurons revealed novel roles of CCT genes in circadian behavior: CNMa-CNMaR modulates morning anticipation as an antagonistic signal of PDF-PDFR.</p>

<title>Near Complete Disruption of Target Genes by GFPi and Flp-out Based cCCTomics</title>
<p>For the purpose of conditional chemoconnectomics (cCCTomics), we initially leveraged the benefits of our previously generated CCTomics attP lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deng et al., 2019</xref>), which enabled us to fuse enhanced GFP coding sequence at the 3’ end of each gene’s coding region and flank most or entire gene span with FRT sequence through site-specific recombination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>). We designed this system so that it could be used to target genes tagged with GFP by RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Neumüller et al., 2012</xref>) and at the same time to enable flippase(Flp) mediated DNA fragment excision between two FRT sequences when FRT sequences are in the same orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Vetter et al., 1983</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>cCCTomics Mediates Efficient Conditional Disruption of CCT Genes</title>
<p>(A) Schematic of cCCT gene span and principle of cCCTomics. A T2A-EGFP sequence was introduced at the 3’ end of CCT genes and their most or all coding regions (depending on attP-KO lines) were flanked by 34 bp FRT sequence. Both Flp-out (top) and GFP RNAi (down) could mediate CCT gene manipulation. (B-J) Expression of Trh (B-D), CCHa2 (E-G), and Dh31 (H-J) are efficiently disrupted by pan-neuronal expression of GFP-RNAi (B-D), pan-neuronal expression of Flp-out (E-G), and heatshock-Flp (H-J) respectively. Representative fluorescence images of R57C10-Gal4/+;Trh<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup>/+ (B), UAS-shRNA<sup>GFP</sup>/Trh<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> (C), R57C10-Gal4/+; UAS-shRNA<sup>GFP</sup>/Trh<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> (D), R57C10-Gal4/+;CCHa2<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup>/+; (E), UAS-Flp/CCHa2<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> (F), R57C10-Gal4/+; UAS-Flp/CCHa2<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> (G), Dh31<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> with heatshock (H), hs-Flp/Dh31<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> without heatshock (I), and hs-Flp/Dh31<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> with heatshock are shown.

</fig>
<p>To validate the efficiency of cCCTomics, we performed pan-neuronal expression of either shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> or flipase in cCCT flies. Immunofluorescent imaging showed that constitutive expression of shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A-S1I</xref>) or flipase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1J-S1U</xref>) almost completely eliminated GFP signals of target genes, indicating high efficiency. Knocking out at the adult stage using either hsFLP driven Flp-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Golic and Lindquist, 1989</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H-1J</xref>) or neural (elav-Switch) driven shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Nicholson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A-S2I</xref>), also resulted in the elimination of most, though not all, GFP signals. Notably, control group of CCT<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup>; elav-Switch/UAS-shRNAGFP flies fed with solvent (ethanol) showed obvious decreased GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2B, S2E</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2H</xref>) comparing with UAS-shRNA<sup>GFP</sup>/CCT<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> flies fed with RU486 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A, S2D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2G</xref>), indicating leaky expression of elav-Switch.</p>
<p>We then applied cCCTomics in pan-neuronal knockout of nAChRβ2 which is required for Drosophila sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). Ablation of nAChRβ2 in the nervous system dramatically decreased sleep of flies, mirroring the nAChRβ2 knockout phenotype (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>, 1L). Therefore, cCCTomics is an effective toolkit for manipulation of CCT genes and suitable for functional investigations of genes. Expression of in-frame fused eGFP-labelled CCT genes highly co-localized with signals revealed by immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3A-S3I</xref>), allowing direct examination of gene expression without amplification, which is different from the GAL4/UAS binary system.</p>
<p>We then checked the viability of cCCT lines and found that cCCT lines including Capa<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup>, ChAT<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> and Eh<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> were viable whereas their CCT mutants were lethal. Gad1<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup>, GluRIID<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> and CapaR<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> were still lethal as their CCT mutants were (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). This indicates that some of the cCCT knockin flies may functionally affect corresponding genes, which are not suitable for conditional gene manipulation. Combination of cCCT transgenic flies with UAS-flp, UAS-shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> or specific drivers is complicated and unfriendly for screen work, despite the almost 100% efficiency of gene suppression when driven by a pan-neuronal driver. Because of the limitations of this method, we further created a CRISPR/Cas9 based conditional knockout system of chemoconnectomics (C-cCCTomics).</p>

<title>CRISPR/Cas9-Based Conditional Knockout System for CCTomics</title>
<p>To simplify effective manipulation of CCT genes, we designed a vector based on pACU2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Han et al., 2011</xref>) with tRNA flanking sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Port and Bullock, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Xie et al., 2015</xref>) targeting CCT genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We also adopted an optimized sgRNA scaffold “E+F” (E, stem extension; F, A-U flip) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), which facilitates Cas9-sgRNA complex formation and gene knockout efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Poe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), to all sgRNAs to improve gene knockout efficiency.

<p>We generated UAS-sgRNA<sup>3x</sup> transgenic lines for all 209 defined CCT genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abruzzi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Deng et al., 2019</xref>) and UAS-Cas9.HC (Cas9.HC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mali et al., 2013</xref>). We first verified that C-cCCTomics mediated precise target DNA breaking by ubiquitous expression of Cas9.P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Port et al., 2014</xref>) and sgRNA by targeting Pdf or Dh31. Sanger sequencing showed that indels were present exactly at the Cas9 cleavage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A-S4H</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the efficiency of C-cCCTomics, we employed pan-neuronal expression of Cas9.HC with sgRNA<sup>Dh31</sup> or sgRNA<sup>pdf</sup>. Targeting by Cas9.HC/sgRNA<sup>Dh31</sup> eliminated most but not all of the GFP signal in Dh31<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B-2D</xref>), whereas all anti-PDF signals were eliminated by Cas9.HC/sgRNA<sup>pdf</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E-2G</xref>). Furthermore, we used the C-cCCT strategy to conditionally knockout genes for pdfr, nAChRβ2 and nAChRα2, which were previously reported as essential for circadian rhythm or sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Renn et al., 1999</xref>). Pan-neuronal knockout of Pdfr resulted in a tendency towards advanced evening activity and weaker morning anticipation compared to control flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H-2I</xref>), which is similar to Pdfr-attpKO flies. These phenotypes were not as pronounced as those reported previously, when han<sup>5304</sup> mutants exhibited a more obvious advanced evening peak and no morning anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hyun et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, there was no significant sleep decrease in these conditional knockout (cKO) flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-2K</xref>) when we applied C-cCCTomics to manipulate nAChRβ2 or nAChRa2. Taken together, C-cCCTomics (with Cas9.HC) achieved a relatively high gene knockout efficiency, but it was not effective enough for all genes.</p>

<title>Evaluation of Cas9 with Different Chromatin-Modulating Peptides</title>
<p>Since the establishment of the CRISPR/Cas9 system a decade ago, many groups have attempted to improve its efficiency in gene manipulation. Most attempts have been focused on the two main components of this system, the Cas9 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ling et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>) and the single guide RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Doench et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Filippova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Graf et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Labuhn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Mu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Nahar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Scott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). At the beginning of C-cCCTomics design, we adopted an optimized sgRNA scaffold and selected sgRNAs with predicted high efficiency. We tried to further improve the efficacy by modifying Cas9 protein. We fused a chromatin-modulating peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2019</xref>), HMGN1 (High mobility group nucleosome binding domain 1), at the N-terminus of Cas9 and HMGB1 (High mobility group protein B1) at its C-terminus with GGSGP linker, termed Cas9.M9 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, Methods). We also obtained a modified Cas9.M6 with HMGN1 at the N-terminus and an undefined peptide (UDP) at the C-terminus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We replaced the STARD linker between Cas9 and NLS in Cas9.HC with GGSGP the linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), termed Cas9.M0 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).

<p>To determine whether the modified Cas9 variants were more efficient, we first pan-neuronally expressed each Cas9 variant and sgRNA<sup>ple</sup>, and assessed their efficiency by immunofluorescence imaging. By counting anti-TH positive neurons in the brain (anterior view) after targeting by Cas9/sgRNA<sup>ple</sup>, we found that unmodified Cas9.HC/sgRNA<sup>ple</sup> only achieved 69.58±3.04% (n=5) knockout efficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, 3K, 3L</xref>), while Cas9.M6/sgRNA<sup>ple</sup> and Cas9.M9/sgRNA<sup>ple</sup> significantly improved efficiency to 87.53±3.06% (n=7) and 97.19±2.15% (n=8), respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I-3L</xref>). Fourteen additional CCT genes were subjected to pan-neuronal knockout, and the mRNA levels of the target genes were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR with at least one primer overlapping the sgRNA targeting site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 demonstrated significantly higher gene disruption efficiency compared to the unmodified Cas9.HC, achieving average efficiencies of 87.51%±2.24% and 89.59%±2.39% for Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9, respectively, in contrast to 70.72%±3.82% for Cas9.HC. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). To rule out the possibility of the observed variations in gene disruption efficiency being attributed to differential Cas9 expression levels, we quantified the Cas9 expression levels and noted that both Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 exhibited lower mRNA levels than Cas9.HC under the experiment condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N</xref>). Subsequently, genomic DNA of Drosophila head was extracted, and libraries encompassing target sites were constructed for high-throughput sequencing to verify disparities in genetic editing efficiency among these three Cas9 variants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3O</xref>). In almost all nineteen sites tested, the mutation ratio consistently showed a trend towards Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 having a higher gene disruption efficiency than Cas9.HC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6</xref>). The single-site mutation rates varied from 5.81% to 43.47% for Cas9.HC, 22.40% to 53.54% for Cas9.M6, and 19.90% to 63.57% for Cas9.M9 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3P</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6</xref>). It should be noted that genomic DNA extracted from fly heads contained glial cells, which did not express Cas9/sgRNA, leading to a larger denominator and consequently reducing the observed mutation rates. Unmodified Cas9 displayed mutation rates comparable to those previously reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Schlichting et al., 2022</xref>. The findings indicated that both Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 displayed elevated efficiency compared to Cas9.HC, with Cas9.M9 exhibiting the highest mutagenesis proficiency. These results suggest that the implementation of modified C-cCCTomics using Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9 achieved an elevated level of efficiency. While unmodified C-cCCTomics was not efficient enough to knockout nAChRβ2 and nAChRα2 to phenocopy their mutants, we employed Cas9.M9 in conditional knockout of these genes to verify its efficiency. Pan-neuronal knocking out of nAChRβ2 or nAChRa2 by Cas9.M9/sgRNA showed significant sleep decrease which was similar to their mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3Q-3R</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results support that we have created a high efficiency toolkit for CCT gene manipulation in the nervous system, as well as more efficient Cas9 variants, Cas9.M6 and Cas9.M9, which can also be applied to genes other than those in the CCT.</p>

<p>To assess the accuracy of expression profiles using CCT drivers, we compared our dissection results with previous reports. Initially, we confirmed the expression of CCHa1 in two DN1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fujiwara et al., 2018</xref>), sNFP in four s-LNvs and two LNds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Johard et al., 2009</xref>), and Trissin in two LNds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ma et al., 2021</xref>), aligning with previous findings. Additionally, we identified the expression of nAChRα1, nAChRα2, nAChRβ2, GABA-B-R2, CCHa1-R, and Dh31-R in all or subsets of LNvs, consistent with suggestions from studies using ligands or agonists in LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Duhart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fujiwara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lelito and Shafer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Shafer et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding previously reported Nplp1 in two DN1as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Shafer et al., 2006</xref>), we found approximately five DN1s positive for Nplp-KI-LexA, indicating a broader expression than previously reported. A similar pattern emerged in our analysis of Dh31-KI-LexA, where four DN1s, four s-LNvs, and two LNds were identified, contrasting with the two DN1s found in immunocytochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Goda et al., 2016</xref>). Colocalization analysis of Dh31-KI-LexA and anti-PDF revealed labeling of all PDF-positive s-LNvs but not l-LNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig. S9A</xref>), suggesting that the differences may arise from the broader labeling of 3’ end knock-in LexA drivers or the amplitude effect of the binary expression system. The low protein levels might go undetected in immunocytochemical analysis. This aligns with transcriptome analysis findings showing Nplp1 positive in DN1as, a cluster of CNMa-positive DN1ps, and a cluster of DN3s(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ma et al., 2021</xref>), which is more consistent with our dissection.</p>
<p>Despite the well-known expression of PDF in LNvs and PDFR in s-LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Shafer et al., 2008</xref>), we did not observe stable positive signals for both in Flp-out intersection experiments, although both Pdf-KI-LexA and Pdfr-KI-LexA label LNvs as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig. S9B-S9C</xref>). We also noted fewer positive neurons in certain clock neuron subsets compared to previous reports, such as NPF in three LNds and some LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Erion et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hermann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Johard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lee et al., 2006</xref>) and ChAT in four LNds and the 5th s-LNv (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Duhart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Johard et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table S4</xref>). We attribute this limitation to the inefficiency of LexAop-FRT-myr::GFP driven by LexA, acknowledging that our intersection results may miss some positive signals.</p>

<p>Analysis of the newly defined parameters MAPI and EAPI showed that control flies (Clk856-GLA4&gt;UAS-Cas9.M9) had negative EAPI but slightly positive MAPI.

Using the Trans-tango strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Talay et al., 2017</xref>), we also found that downstream of CNMa neurons were about fifteen pairs of neurons in the SOG, five pairs of LNd neurons, one pair of DN3 neurons and six intercerebralis (PI) neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, arrowhead).</p>

<p>Because we had found that knocking out CNMa in Clk856-GAL4 labeled neurons produced advanced morning activity, and that CNMa intersected with Clk856-Gal4 labeled neurons in 4 pairs of DN1ps and one pair of DN3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig. S8-16</xref>), we focused on these neurons and performed more intersections. Taking advantage of a series of clock neuron subset-labeled drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sekiguchi et al., 2020</xref>), we intersected CNMa-p65AD with 4 DN1 labelling drivers: GMR51H05-GAL4, GMR91F02-GAL4, Pdfr-KI-GAL4 and GMR79A11-GAL4 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-6H</xref>). We found two arborization patterns: Type I with two neurons whose branches projecting to the anterior region, as observed in CNMa∩GMR51H05, CNMa∩Pdfr, and CNMa∩GMR79A11 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E, 6G, 6H</xref>), and type II with four neurons branching on the posterior side with few projections to the anterior region, as observed in CNMa∩GMR91F02 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). These two types of DN1ps’ subsets have been previously reported and profound discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lamaze et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Reinhard et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>CNMa knockout in Type I or Type II neurons (GMR51H05-GAL4, GMR91F02-GAL4, and GMR79A11-GAL4) all reproduced the MAPI-increased phenotype of clk856 specific CNMa knockout (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). However, Type II neurons-specific CNMa knockout (CNMa ∩ GMR91F02) showed weaker advanced morning activity without advanced morning peak (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6N</xref>), while Type I neurons-specific CNMa knockout did (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>), indicating a possibility that these two type I CNMa neurons are the main functional subset regulating the morning anticipation activity of fruit fly.</p>
<p>Pdf or Pdfr mutants exhibit weak or no morning anticipation, which is related to the phenotype of CNMa knockout flies. We also identified two Pdfr and CNMa double-positive DN1ps, which have a type I projection pattern (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). Reintroduction of Pdfr in Pdfr knockout background revealed that GMR51H05 and GMR79A11 Gal4 drivers, which covered the main functional CNMa-positive subset, could partially rescue the morning anticipation and power phenotype of Pdfr knockout flies to a considerably larger extent than the GMR91F02 driver (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6Q-6S</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Fig. S13A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls7">Table S7</xref>). Moreover, knocking out Pdfr by GMR51H05, GMR79A11 and CNMa GAL4, which cover type I CNMa neurons, decreased morning anticipation of flies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6T</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Fig. S13B</xref>). However, the decrease in morning anticipation observed in the Pdfr knockout by CNMa-GAL4 was not as pronounced as with the other two drivers. Because the presumptive main subset of functional CNMa is also PDFR-positive, there is a possibility that CNMa secretion is regulated by PDF/PDFR signal.</p>

<title>Role of Neuronal CNMaR in Morning Anticipation</title>
<p>There is only one CNMa receptor reported in the fly genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Jung et al., 2014</xref>).

Further conditional knockout of CNMaR in neurons by C-cCCTomics phenocopied CNMaR<sup>KO-p65AD</sup> phenotype (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7I-7L</xref>).

<title>Conditional CCTomics Strategies and Toolkit</title>
<p>We have generated conditional gene manipulation systems based on Flp-out/GFPi or CRISPR/Cas9. cCCT based gene deletion after heat-shock or mifepristone (RU486) eliminated most GFP signals, and pan-neuronal constitutive expression of shRNA<sup>GFP</sup> or flippase disrupted seven out of eight tested genes completely while targeting of SIFa<sup>EGFP.FRT</sup> achieved 96±3% efficiency. Although the recombination of genetic elements is relatively cumbersome when using cCCTomics, it is worthwhile to apply this method to specific genes given its high level of efficiency. While two UAS-sgRNA libraries have been established, one primarily targeting kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Port et al., 2020</xref>) and the other targeting GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Schlichting et al., 2022</xref>), both libraries only cover a portion of CCT genes, and are thus insufficient for manipulating all CCT genes. The development of C-cCCTomics, however, makes CCT gene manipulation as simple as RNA interference. Furthermore, the use of modified Cas9.M6 or Cas9.M9 highly enhances the efficiency of gene disruption in the nervous system, allowing for efficient manipulation of all CCT genes in a cell-specific manner.</p>
<p>The toxicity of CRISPR/Cas9 depends on the Cas9 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Port et al., 2014</xref>). When expressed pan-neuronally in nSyb-GAL4 (R57C10-GAL4, attP40), Cas9.M9 slightly reduced viability while the expression of other Cas9 variants had no significant effect on viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs14">Fig. S14</xref>). Although Cas9.M9 showed leaky-expression-efficiency, this was not a problem with Cas9.M6, which successfully disrupted Dh31, Dh44, Pdf, and Pdfr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig. S9</xref>). A more restricted expression of Cas9.M9 with lower toxicity is necessary for better somatic gene manipulation in the future.</p>

<title>CCT of Clock Neurons</title>
<p>Intersecting Clk856-Gal4 or Clk856-p6AD with CCTomics, we identified 45 CCT genes in Clk856 labelled clock neurons. Clock neurons appear highly heterogeneous both in our intersection dissection and in a previous transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abruzzi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). Comparing these two CCT gene expression profiles in clock neurons, 41 out of 127 gene-subsets are identical. The accuracy of our genetic intersection is limited by two possibilities: 1) KI-LexA may not fully represent the expression pattern of the corresponding gene, and 2) the efficiency of STOP cassette removal in the Flp-out strategy is limited or the efficiency of LexA&gt;LexAop::myrGFP. Moreover, the leakage of LexAop-GFP may result in unreliable labelling in split-lexA strategy. Both genetic drivers and transcriptomic analysis contribute to our knowledge of the expression profile of neurons. The physiological significance of each gene in particular neurons should be further investigated by genetic manipulation.</p>

<title>Regulation of Rhythmic Behavior by CCT genes</title>
<p>Multiple attractive genes have been identified in our functional screen of CCT genes in clock neurons: for example, knocking out of VGlut weakens morning anticipation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls8">Table S8</xref>). In further screening of brain regions, we have narrowed down the morning anticipation regulation role of VGlut in R18H11-GAL4 labeled neurons (Table S9). VGlut in these neurons has also been reported to regulate sleep in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). Its downstream neurons may be the PI neurons or LNvs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Guo et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, the deficiency of the neuropeptide CNMa results in advanced morning activity. We have validated that two Pdfr and CNMa double-positive DN1p neurons may play a major role in regulating this process through intersectional manipulation of CNMa. Knockout and reintroduction of Pdfr in these neurons have verified that Pdfr partially functions in DN1p CNMa neurons, and PDF increases cAMP level in Pdfr positive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Shafer et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting a possibility of the regulation of CNMa signaling by PDF signaling. Furthermore, given that the morning anticipation vanishing phenotype of Pdf or Pdfr mutant indicates a promoting role of PDF-PDFR signal, while the enhanced morning anticipation phenotype of CNMa mutant suggests an inhibiting role of CNMa signal, we consider the two signals to be antagonistic. However, knocking out CNMaR in Clk856 labelled clock neurons showed no significant phenotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls6">Table S6</xref>), whereas the mutant and pan-neuronal knockout flies had similar phenotypes to CNMa knockout flies, suggesting its role in the circadian output neurons. Previous studies have indicated that CNMa integrate thermosensory inputs to promote wakefulness, and CNMaR is thought to function in Dh44 positive PI neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jin et al., 2021</xref>), a subset of circadian output neurons. To gain a deeper understanding of the downstream effects of DN1p CNMa positive neurons, further analysis focusing on specific brain regions is necessary.</p>
<p>We have also reproduced phenotypes of Pdf, Pdfr, and Dh31 mutant flies with C-cCCTomics as previous studies. Surprisingly, only five genes are functional among all sixty-seven CCT genes in this prior screen. This may be caused by limitations of the simple behavioral paradigm, single gene manipulation, and single GAL4 driver. For example, switching of light condition from L: D = 12h: 12h to L: D = 6h:18h, AstC/AstC-R2 would suppress flies’ evening activity intensity to adapt to the environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Díaz et al., 2019</xref>), and only double knockout of AChRs and mGluRs in PI neurons can possibly result in alteration in behavioral rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barber et al., 2021</xref>). Further diversified functional analysis of CCT genes in clock neurons is required for clock circuit dissection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper of Mao et al. expands the genetic toolset that was previously developed by the Rao lab (Denfg et al 2019) to introduce the conditional KO or downregulation of neurotransmission components in Drosophila. The authors then use these tools to investigate neurotransmission in the the clock neurons of the Drosophila brain. They first test some known components and then analyze the contribution of the CNMa neuropeptide and its receptor to the circadian behavior. The results indicate that CNMA acts from a subset of DN1ps (dorsal clock neurons) to set the phase of the morning peak of locomotor activity in light:dark cycles, with an advanced morning activity in the absence of the neuropeptide. Interestingly, the receptor for the PDF neuropeptide appears to be acting in some of the CNMa neurons to control morning activity.</p>
<p>Strengths/weaknesses:</p>
<p>This is clearly a very useful new set of tools to restrict the manipulation of these components to specific neuronal populations, and overall (see specific points below), the paper is convincing to show that the tools indeed allow to efficiently and specifically eliminate neuropeptides/receptors from subsets of neurons. The analysis of the CNMa function in the clock network reveals a new and interesting function for CNMa in the control of morning anticipation in LD conditions. This function appears to depend on CNMA_expressing DN1ps.</p>
<p>Comment on revised version:</p>
<p>I believe that the authors properly addressed the main points that were raised in my comment on version 1.</p>

<p>Original Review:</p>
<p>In this study Mao and co-workers deliver a substantial suite of genetic tools in support of the senior author's recent proposal to create a &quot;chemoconnectomic&quot; tool kit for the expression mapping and conditional disruption of specific neurotransmitter systems with fly neurons of interest. Specifically, they describe the creation of two toolsets for recombination-based and CRISPR/Cas9-based conditional knockouts of genes supporting neurotransmitter and neuromodulator function and Flp-Out and Split-LexA toolkit for the examination of gene expression within defined subsets of neurons. The authors report the creation of conditional genetic tools for the disruption/mapping of approximately 200 chemoconnectomic gene products, an examination of the general effectiveness of these tools in the fly brain and apply them to the circadian clock network in an attempt to reveal new information regarding the transmitter/modulator systems involved in daily behavioral timing. The authors provide clear evidence of the effectiveness of the new methods along with a transparent assessment of the variability of the tools. In addition, they present evidence that the neuro peptide CNMa influences the morning peak of daily activity in the fly by regulating the timing of activity increases in anticipation of dawn.</p>
<p>A major strength of the study is the transparent assessment of the effectiveness and variability of the conditional genetic approaches developed by the authors. The authors have largely achieved their aims and the study therefore represents a major delivery on the promise of chemoconnectomics made by the senior author in 2019 (Neuron, Vol. 101, p. 876). Though there are some concerns about the variability of knockout effectiveness, off target effects of the knockout strategies, and (especially) the accuracy of the gene expression approach, the tools created for this study will almost certainly be useful for the field and support a great deal of future work.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have responded to each of my concerns. Most importantly, they have made the discrepancies within the study and between the study and previously published work clearer to the reader. they have also corrected statements that are not consistent with the current state of the field. The issue regarding opposing effects of PDF signaling and CNMa, which was also raised by Reviewer One still stands, notwithstanding the edits made to the text.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mao and colleagues generated powerful reagents to genetically analyse chemical communication (CCT) in the brain, and in the process uncovered a function for the CNMa neuropeptide expressed in a subset of DN1p neurons that contributes to the temporal organization of locomotor activity, i.e., the timing of morning anticipation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of the manuscript relies in the generation/characterization of new tools for conditional targeting a well-defined set of CCT genes along with the design and testing of improved versions of Cas9 for efficient knock out. Such invaluable resources will be of interest to the whole community. The authors employed these tools and intersectional genetics to provide an alternative profiling of clock neurons, which is complementary to the ones already published. Furthermore, they uncovered a role for CNMamide, expressed in two DN1ps, in the timing of morning anticipation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All prior concerns have been addressed.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the reviewers for their constructive comments. The following is our point-to-point responses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Point 1- Abstract: advanced morning peak « opposite » to pdf/pdfr mutants. To my knowledge, the alteration of PDF/PDFR suppresses the morning peak. I am not sure that an advance of the peak is « opposite » to its inhibition?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Mutants with disruptions in CNMa or CNMaR display advanced morning activity, indicating an enhanced state. Mutants with disruptions in Pdf or Pdfr exhibit no morning anticipation, suggesting a promoting role of these genes in morning anticipation. Therefore, our revised version is: “Specific elimination of each from clock neurons revealed that loss of the neuropeptide CNMa in two posterior dorsal clock neurons (DN1ps) or its receptor (CNMaR) caused advanced morning activity, indicating a suppressive role of CNMa-CNMaR on morning anticipation, opposite to the promoting role of PDF-PDFR on morning anticipation.” (Line 43-51)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 2- Fig 1K-L: the authors should show the sleep phenotype of the homozygous nAChRbeta2 mutant (if not lethal) for a direct comparison with the FRT/FLP genotype and thus evaluate the efficiency of the system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have incorporated sleep profiles of nAChRbeta2 mutant and W1118 into Fig 1K-L. nAChRbeta2 mutants (red) exhibited a sleep amount comparable to that of pan-neural nAChRbeta2 knockout flies (dark red), as shown below.</p>

<p>Point 5- Fig 2H-J: the LD behavioral phenotype of pdfr pan-neuronal cripsr does not seem to correspond to what is described in the literature for the pdfr mutant (han), see hyun et al 2005 (no morning anticipation and advanced evening peak). I understand that the activity index is lower than controls but fig2H shows a large anticipatory activity that seems really unusual, and no advanced evening peak is observed. I think that the authors should show the CRISPR flies and pdfr mutants together, to better compare the phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out that the phenotypes of pan-neuronal knockout of PDFR by unmodified Cas9 (Fig. 2H-2I of the previous version) whose morning anticipation still exist (Fig, 2H of the previous manuscript), although the significant decrease of morning anticipation index (Fig 2I of the previous manuscript) and advanced evening activity are not as pronounced as observed in han5304 (Fig. 3C in Hyun et al., 2005).</p>
<p>First, we have separated the activity plots of Fig. 2H of previous manuscript, as shown below. The activity from ZT18 to ZT24 shows a tendency of decreasing from ZT18 to ZT21 and a tendency of increasing from ZT21 to ZT24. The lowest activity before dawn during ZT18 to ZT24 shows at about ZT21, and the activity at ZT18 is comparable to the activity at ZT24. This is significantly different compared to the two control groups, whose activity tends to increase activity from ZT18 to ZT24 with an activity peak at ZT24.</p>
<p>The activity from ZT6 to ZT12 increased much faster in Pdfr knockout flies and get to an activity plateau at about ZT11 compared to two control groups with a slower activity increasing from ZT6 to ZT12 with no activity plateau but an activity peak at ZT12.</p>

</fig>
<p>Second, we have incorporated the phenotype of Pdfr mutants we previously generated (Pdfr-attpKO Deng et al., 2019) with Pdfr pan-neuronal knockout by Cas9.HC. This mutant lacks all seven transmembrane regions of Pdfr (a). The phenotypes are very similar between Pdfr-attpKO flies and Pdfr pan-neuronal knockout flies. In this experimental repeat, we found that a much more obvious advanced evening activity peak is observed both in pan-neuronal knockout flies and Pdfr-attpKO flies.</p>
<p>To further analyze the phenotypes of Pdfr pan-neuronal knockout flies by Cas9.HC, we referred to the literature. The activity pattern at ZT18 to ZT24 (activity tends to decrease from ZT18 to ZT21 and tends to increase from ZT21 to ZT24, with the lowest activity before dawn occurring at about ZT21, and activity at ZT18 comparable to activity at ZT24) is also reported in Pdfr knockout flies such as Fig3C and 3H in Hyun et al., 2005, Fig 2B in Lear et al., 2009, Fig 3B in Zhang et al., 2010, Fig .5A in Guo et al., 2014, and Fig 5B in Goda et al., 2019. Additionally, the less pronounced advanced evening activity peak compared to han5304 (Fig. 3C in Hyun et al., 2005) is also reported in Fig. 2B in Lear et al., 2009, Fig. 3B in Zhang et al., 2010, and Fig. 5B in Goda et al., 2019. We consider that this difference is more likely to be caused by environmental conditions or recording strategies (DAM system vs. video tracing).</p>
<p>Therefore, we revised the text to: “Pan-neuronal knockout of Pdfr resulted in a tendency towards advanced evening activity and weaker morning anticipation compared to control flies (Fig. 2H-2I), which is similar to Pdfr-attpKO flies. These phenotypes were not as pronounced as those reported previously, when han5304 mutants exhibited a more obvious advanced evening peak and no morning anticipation (Hyun et al., 2005)”.</p>

<p>We have incorporated period data into Fig. 2I. Indeed, conditional knock out of Pdfr by Cas9.HC driven by R57C10-GAL4 shortens the period length, as shown below (previous data), also in Fig. 2I of the revised version.</p>
<p>In the revised Fig. 2I, we tested 45 Pdfr-attpKO flies during DD condition (3 out of 48 flies died during video tracing in DD condition), and only one fly was rhythmic. In contrast, 9 out of 48 Pdfr pan-neuronal knockout flies were rhythmic.</p>

<p>Point 7- P15 and fig6. The authors indicate that type II CNMa neurons do not show advanced morning activity as type I do, but Figs 6 I and K seem to show some advance although less important than type I.

<p>We have re-organized Fig. 6 and revised the summary of these results as: “However, Type II neurons-specific CNMa knockout (CNMa ∩ GMR91F02) showed weaker advanced morning activity without advanced morning peak (Fig. 6N), while Type I neurons-specific CNMa knockout did (Fig. 6J), indicating a possibility that these two type I CNMa neurons constitute the main functional subset regulating the morning anticipation activity of fruit fly”.

In the new version of the manuscript, we have included the activity plots for the LD phase in supplementary Fig S13, as well as shown below (A, B), and the period and arrhythmicity data for the DD phase in Fig. 6S and Table S7. We have also refined the related description as follows: “Moreover, knocking out Pdfr by GMR51H05, GMR79A11 and CNMa GAL4, which cover type I CNMa neurons, decreased morning anticipation of flies (Fig. 6T, Fig. S13B). However, the decrease in morning anticipation observed in the Pdfr knockout by CNMa-GAL4 was not as pronounced as with the other two drivers. Because the presumptive main subset of functional CNMa is also PDFR-positive, there is a possibility that CNMa secretion is regulated by PDF/PDFR signal”. (Line 413-419)</p>

<p>Point 9- Fig 7: does CNMaR affect DD behavior? This should be tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We analyzed the CNMaR-/- activity in the dark-dark condition over a span of six days. Results revealed a higher power in CNMaR mutants compared to control flies (Power: 93.5±41.9 (CNMaR-/-, n=48) vs 47.3±31.6 (w1118, n=47); Period: 23.7±0.3 h (CNMaR-/-, n=46) vs 23.7±0.3 h (w1118, n=47); arrhythmic rate 2/48 (CNMaR-/-) vs 0/47 (w1118)). Considering that mutating CNMa had no obvious effect on DD behavior, even if CNMaR affects DD behavior, it cannot be attributed to CNMa signal, we did not further repeat and analyze DD behavior of CNMaR mutant. We believe this raises another question beyond the scope of our current discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Point 1-One major concern is the apparent discrepancies in clock network gene expression using the Flp-Out and split-LexA approaches compared to what is known about the expression of several transmitter and peptide-related genes. For example, it is well established that the 5th-sLNv expresses CHAT (along with a single LNd), yet there appears to be no choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) signal in the 5th-sLNv as assayed by the Split-LexA approach (Fig. 4). This approach also suggests that DH31 is expressed in the s-LNvs, which, as one of the most intensely studied clock neuron are known to express PDF and sNPF, but not DH31. The results also suggest that the sLNvs express ChAT, which they do not. Remarkably PDF is not included in the expression analysis, this peptide is well known to be expressed in only two subgroups of clock neurons, and would therefore be an excellent test case for the expression analysis in Fig. 4. PDF should therefore be added to analysis shown in Fig. 4. Another discrepancy is PdfR, which split LexA suggests is expressed in the Large LNvs but not the small LNvs, the opposite of what has been shown using both reporter expression and physiology. The authors do acknowledge that discrepancies exist between their data and previous work on expression within the clock network (lines 237 and 238). However, the extent of these discrepancies is not made clear and calls into question the accuracy of Flp-Out and Split LexA approaches.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The concerns mentioned above are:</p>
<p>(1) sLNvs express PDF and sNPF but not Dh31;</p>
<p>(2) ChAT presents in 5th-sLNv and one LNd but not in other sLNvs;</p>
<p>(3) PDFR presents in sLNvs but not l-LNvs.</p>
<p>(4) PDF is not included in the analysis.</p>
<p>To verify the accuracy of these intersection analyses, all related to PDF positive neurons (except 5th-sLNv and LNds), we stained PDF and examined the co-localization between PDF-positive LNvs and the respective drivers ChAT-KI-LexA, Pdfr-KI -LexA, Dh31-KI -LexA, and Pdf-KI -LexA.</p>
<p>First, Dh31-KI-LexA labeled four s-LNvs, as shown below (also in Fig. S9A). Therefore, the results of the intersection analysis of Dh31-KI-LexA with Clk856-GAL4 are correct. The difference in the results compared to previous literature is attributed to Dh31-KI-LexA labels different neurons than the previous driver or antibody.</p>
<p>Second, no s-LNv was labeled by ChAT-KI -LexA as shown below. We rechecked our intersection data and found that we analyzed 10 brains of ChAT-KI-LexA∩Clk856-GAL4 while only two brains showed sLNvs positively. To enhance the accuracy of intersection analysis results, we marked all positive signal records when positive subsets were found in less than 1/3 of the total analyzed brains (Table S4).</p>
<p>Third, one l-LNv and at least two s-LNvs were labeled by Pdfr-KI-LexA, as shown below (also in Fig. S9B). Fourth, Pdf-KI-LexA labels all PDF-positive neurons, but the intersection analysis by Pdf-KI-LexA and Clk856-GAL4 only showed scattered signals, as shown below (D, also in Fig. S9C). For these cases, we found some positive signals expected but not observed in our dissection. The possible reason could be the inefficiency of LexAop-FRT-myr::GFP driven by LexA. Therefore, our intersection results must miss some positive signals.</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, we revised the text to (Line 286-317):</p>
<p>To assess the accuracy of expression profiles using CCT drivers, we compared our dissection results with previous reports. Initially, we confirmed the expression of CCHa1 in two DN1s (Fujiwara et al., 2018), sNFP in four s-LNvs and two LNds(Johard et al., 2009), and Trissin in two LNds (Ma et al., 2021), aligning with previous findings. Additionally, we identified the expression of nAChRα1, nAChRα2, nAChRβ2, GABA-B-R2, CCHa1-R, and Dh31-R in all or subsets of LNvs, consistent with suggestions from studies using ligands or agonists in LNvs (Duhart et al., 2020; Fujiwara et al., 2018; Lelito and Shafer, 2012; Shafer et al., 2008) (Table S4).</p>
<p>Regarding previously reported Nplp1 in two DN1as (Shafer et al., 2006), we found approximately five DN1s positive for Nplp-KI-LexA, indicating a broader expression than previously reported. A similar pattern emerged in our analysis of Dh31-KI-LexA, where four DN1s, four s-LNvs, and two LNds were identified, contrasting with the two DN1s found in immunocytochemical analysis (Goda et al., 2016). Colocalization analysis of Dh31-KI-LexA and anti-PDF revealed labeling of all PDF-positive s-LNvs but not l-LNvs (Fig S9A), suggesting that the differences may arise from the broader labeling of 3' end knock-in LexA drivers or the amplitude effect of the binary expression system. The low protein levels might go undetected in immunocytochemical analysis. This aligns with transcriptome analysis findings showing Nplp1 positive in DN1as, a cluster of CNMa-positive DN1ps, and a cluster of DN3s (Ma et al., 2021), which is more consistent with our dissection.</p>
<p>Despite the well-known expression of PDF in LNvs and PDFR in s-LNvs (Renn et al., 1999; Shafer et al., 2008), we did not observe stable positive signals for both in Flp-out intersection experiments, although both Pdf-KI-LexA and Pdfr-KI-LexA label LNvs as expected (Fig S9B-S9C). We also noted fewer positive neurons in certain clock neuron subsets compared to previous reports, such as NPF in three LNds and some LNvs (Erion et al., 2016; He et al., 2013; Hermann et al., 2012; Johard et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2006) and ChAT in four LNds and the 5th s-LNv (Johard et al., 2009; Duhart et al., 2020) (Table S4). We attribute this limitation to the inefficiency of LexAop-FRT-myr::GFP driven by LexA, acknowledging that our intersection results may miss some positive signals.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 2-Related to this, the authors rather inaccurately suggest that the field's understanding of PdfR expression within the clock neuron network is &quot;inconsistent&quot; and &quot;variable&quot; (lines 368-377). This is not accurate. It is true that the first attempts to map PdfR expression with antisera and GAL4s were inaccurate. However, subsequent work by several groups has produced strong convergent evidence that with the exception of the l-LNvs after several days post-eclosion, PdfR is expressed in the Cryptochrome expressing a subset of the clock neuron network. This section of the study should be revised.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. As we have already addressed and revised the related part in the RESULTS section (Line 308-317), we have now removed this part from the DISCUSSION section of the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 3-One minor issue that would avoid unnecessary confusion by readers familiar with the circadian literature is the say that activity profiles are plotted in the study. The authors have centered their averaged activity profiles on the 12h of darkness. This is the opposite of the practice of the field, and it leads to some initial confusion in the examination of the morning and evening peak data. The authors may wish to avoid this by centering their activity plots on the 12h light phase, which would put the morning peak on the left and the evening peak on the right. This is the way the field is accustomed to examining locomotor activity profiles.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The centering of averaged activity profiles on the 12 h of darkness is done to highlight the phenotype of advanced morning activity. To prevent any confusion among readers, we have included a sentence in the figure legend explaining the difference in our activity profiles compared to previous literatures: &quot;Activity profiles were centered of the 12 h darkness in all figures with evening activity on the left and morning activity on the right, which is different from general circadian literatures. (Fig. 2H legend)&quot; (Line 957-959))</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 4-The authors conclude that the loss of PDF and CNMa have opposite effects on the morning peak of locomotor activity (line 392). But they also acknowledge, briefly, that things are not that simple: loss of CNMa causes a phase advance, but loss of PDF causes a loss or reduction in the anticipatory peak. It is still significant to find a peptide transmitter with the clock neuron network that regulates morning activity, but the authors should revise their conclusion regarding the opposing actions of PDF and CNMa, which is not well supported by the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the relevant parts.</p>
<p>ABSTRACT: “Specific elimination of each from clock neurons revealed that loss of the neuropeptide CNMa in two posterior dorsal clock neurons (DN1ps) or its receptor (CNMaR) caused advanced morning activity, indicating a suppressive role of CNMa-CNMaR on morning anticipation, opposite to the promoting role of PDF-PDFR on morning anticipation.” (Line 43-48)</p>
<p>DISCUSSION: “Furthermore, given that the morning anticipation vanishing phenotype of Pdf or Pdfr mutant indicates a promoting role of PDF-PDFR signal, while the enhanced morning anticipation phenotype of CNMa mutant suggests an inhibiting role of CNMa signal, we consider the two signals to be antagonistic.” (Line 492-495)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

Therefore, in all results related to GFP signal (Fig. 1B-1J, Fig. S1, Fig. S2, Fig. 2B-2D), we relied on qualitative judgment rather than quantitative judgment, unless the GFP signal was easily quantifiable (such as in cases with limited cells or no GFP signal in the experimental group).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the description of the calculation in the methods section (Line 612). After calculating the ratio of the last three hours of activity to the total six hours of activity, the results were further subtracted by 0.5. Therefore, the index should be ≤0.5. When the index is equal to 0, it indicates no morning anticipation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 9-Fig 2K/L. The authors mention that not all genes are effectively knocked out with their strategy. Could this be accounted for the specific KD strategy, its duration, or the promotor strength? It is surprising no explanation is provided in the text (page 9 line 179).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our pursuit of establishing a broadly effective method for gene editing, Fig. 2H-2L and Fig. 2D revealed that previous attempts have fallen short of achieving this objective. The observed inefficiency may be attributed to the intensity of the promoter, resulting in inadequate expression. Alternatively, the insufficient duration of the operation may also contribute to the lack of success. However, in the context of sleep and rhythm research applications, the age of the fruit fly tests is typically fixed, limiting the potential to enhance efficiency by extending the manipulation time. Moreover, increasing the expression level may pose challenges related to cytotoxicity, as reported in previous studies (Port et al., 2014). We refrain from offering specific explanations, as we lack a definitive plan and cannot provide additional robust evidence to support the above speculations. Consequently, in our ongoing efforts, we aim to enhance the efficiency of the tool system while operating within the current constraints.</p>

<p>First, we designed and generated transgenic UAS-sgRNA fly lines for all these sgRNAs. We randomly selected 14 receptor genes, known for their difficulty in editing based on our experience, to assess the efficiency of our strategy, as depicted in Fig. 3M-3P, Fig. S5, and Fig. S6.

While we selected sgRNAs with no predicted off-target effects through various prediction models (outlined in the Methods under C-cCCTomics sgRNA design), we did not conduct whole-genome sequencing. Consequently, we can only assert that the off-target possibility is relatively low. To address potential misleading effects arising from off-target concerns, it is essential to validate these results through mutants, RNAi, or alternative UAS-sgRNAs targeting the same gene.</p>

<p>Point 16-Table S4. Some of the data presented derives from observations made in 1-2 brains for a specific cluster; isn´t it too little to base a decision on whether a certain gene is (or not) expressed? It is surprising since the same CCT line was observed/analysed in more brains for other clusters. Can the authors explain the rationale?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The N# number represents the GFP positive number, and we have revised the legend of Table S4. The largest N# number denotes the total number of brains analyzed for a specific CCT line. It's possible that, due to variations in our dissection or mounting process, some clusters were only observed in 1-2 brains out of the total brains analyzed. To enhance the accuracy of intersection analysis results, we marked all positive signal records when positive subsets were found in less than 1/3 of the total analyzed brains (Table S4).</p>

<p>Point 17-The paragraph describing this data in the results section needs revising (lines 233-243).</p>

<p>We have now revised this. (Line 286-317)</p>

<p>Point 18-While it is customary for authors to attempt to improve the description of the activity patterns by introducing new parameters (i.e. MAPI and EAPI, lines 253-258) it would be interesting to understand the difference between the proposed method and the one already in use (which compares the same parameter, i.e., the slope (defined as ¨the slope of the best-fitting linear regression line over a period of 6 h prior to the transition¨, i.e., Lamaze et al. 2020 and many others). Is there a need to introduce yet another one?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This approach is necessary. The slope defined by Lamaze et al. utilizes data from only 2 time points, which may not accurately capture the pattern within a period before light on or off. Linear regression is not well-suited for a single fly due to the high variability in activity at each time point, making it challenging to fit the model at the individual level. The parameters we have introduced (MAPI and EAPI) in this paper are concise and can be applied at the individual level, effectively reflecting the morning or evening anticipation characteristics of each fly.</p>
<p>As an alternative, the activity plot of a certain fly line could be represented by an average of all flies' activity in one experiment. This would make linear regression easier to fit. However, several independent experiments are required for statistical robustness, necessitating the inclusion of hundreds of flies for each strain in a single analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 19-In general, the legends of supplementary figures are a bit too brief. S7 and S8: it is not clear which of the two intersectional strategies were used (it would benefit whoever is interested in replicating the experiments). Legend to Fig S8 should read ¨similar to Fig S7¨.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now revised the legend and included “The exact strategy used for each gene is annotated in Table S5” in the legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point 20-The legend in Table S6 should clearly state the genotypes examined. What does the marking in bold refer to?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now revised annotation of Table S6. Marking in bold refer to results out of one SD compared to control group.</p>

<p>Point 22-Line 391 (and also in the results section). The authors attempt to describe the CNMa phenotype as the opposite of pdf/pdfr mutant phenotypes. However, no morning anticipation/advanced morning anticipation are not necessarily opposite phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised related description.</p>
<p>ABSTRACT: “Specific elimination of each from clock neurons revealed that loss of the neuropeptide CNMa in two posterior dorsal clock neurons (DN1ps) or its receptor (CNMaR) caused advanced morning activity, indicating a suppressive role of CNMa-CNMaR on morning anticipation, opposite to the promoting role of PDF-PDFR on morning anticipation.” (Line 43-48)</p>
<p>DISCUSSION: “Furthermore, given that the morning anticipation vanishing phenotype of Pdf or Pdfr mutant indicates a promoting role of PDF-PDFR signal, while the enhanced morning anticipation phenotype of CNMa mutant suggests an inhibiting role of CNMa signal, we consider the two signals to be antagonistic.” (Line 492-495)</p>
