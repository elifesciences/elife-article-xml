<title>Abstract</title><p>Trained immunity involves the reprogramming of innate immune cells after an initial exposure, resulting in heightened inflammatory responses to subsequent stimuli and enhanced bactericidal capacity during infection. However, this proinflammatory state could also exacerbate chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is characterized by persistent inflammation and microbial imbalance. It remains unclear how trained immunity influences IBD pathogenesis and whether it can be harnessed therapeutically. In our study, pretreatment with Î²-glucan reprogrammed bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors and peripheral monocytes, inducing a profound shift in monocyte plasticity and significantly reducing the severity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)âinduced colitis. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow or peripheral monocytes from Î²-glucanâtrained mice into naive mice conferred robust protection against colitis, demonstrating that this protective effect is transferable. Trained mice also displayed improved clearance of intestinal bacterial infections. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an expansion of reparative Cx3cr1âº macrophages derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, correlating with accelerated colonic epithelial regeneration. Collectively, these findings reveal how Î²-glucanâinduced trained immunity modulates monocyte differentiation to ameliorate experimental colitis, highlighting the potential of harnessing trained immunity as a therapeutic strategy to recalibrate innate immune responses and restore gut homeostasis in IBD, shedding light for future clinical applications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohnâs disease (CD), is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder associated with significant morbidity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The intestinal mucosa is continuously exposed to a diverse microbial ecosystem, including fungi, bacteria, and viruses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). In IBD, the delicate balance between the immune system and the microbiota is disrupted, leading to uncontrolled inflammation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). This dysregulation is further exacerbated by genetic factors, such as loss-of-function mutations in NOD2, which impair antimicrobial peptide production, increase susceptibility to intestinal infections, and decrease IL-10 production by monocytes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Trained immunity, a phenomenon where innate immune cells exhibit enhanced responses to secondary challenges, has emerged as a promising therapeutic avenue for various infectious diseases and cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). However, its role in chronic inflammatory conditions like IBD remains largely unexplored. While trained immunity can enhance pathogen clearance, it also involves the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1Î², and IL-6(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), therefore the role of trained immunity in IBD remained elusive.</p>
<p>This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of trained immunity in a mouse model of colitis. We hypothesized that inducing trained immunity could enhance microbial control, thereby preserving intestinal integrity and ultimately mitigating disease severity. To test this, we employed Î²-glucan (BG), a prototypic trained immunity inducer, and assessed its impact on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Our findings demonstrate that BG pretreatment significantly alleviates colitis in mice. Mechanistically, BG induced central immunity in the hematopoietic compartment, leading to the generation of âtrainedâ monocytes in the periphery. Both bone marrow transplantation from trained donors and adoptive transfer of trained monocytes conferred protection against DSS-induced colitis. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq revealed that BG-induced trained immunity promotes the expansion of reparative Cx3cr1 intestinal macrophages derived from Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes, thereby facilitating epithelial regeneration. In summary, our data suggest that harnessing trained immunity represents a promising therapeutic approach for IBD treatment.</p>

<title>Î²-glucan (BG) pretreatment ameliorates DSS-induced colitis</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of trained immunity on colitis, mice were pretreated with BG, a potent inducer of trained immunity. Successful induction of BG-induced trained immunity (BGTI) was confirmed by the enhanced resistance to <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection in BG-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1B</xref>), consistent with previous findings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). Importantly, BG-pretreatment did not induce spontaneous intestinal inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1D</xref>). Following BGTI induction, mice were subjected to DSS-induced colitis. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). BG pretreatment significantly ameliorated disease severity, as indicated by the reduced body weight loss (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1E</xref>), colon shortening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1G</xref>), and diminished mucosal inflammation observed via endoscopic imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Histological analysis demonstrated lower histopathologic scores (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Additionally, BG-pretreated mice exhibited enhanced intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, as evidenced by the increased expression of tight junction proteins Zo-1 and Occludin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref>), and decreased circulating FITC-dextran levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I</xref>).</p>

<p>Acknowledging that the long-lasting effects of BGTI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), we further examined its long-term protective effects against DSS-induced colitis. Despite peripheral myeloid cells and monocytes returning to homeostasis four weeks post-BG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2B</xref>), mice remained protected against DSS-induced colitis as demonstrated by body weight change and colon shortening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1J</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1K</xref>), and improved histological outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2D</xref>). This BG-induced protection persisted for up to seven weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">S2F</xref>). These findings indicate that BG pretreatment effectively ameliorates DSS-induced colitis in mice, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of trained immunity in IBD management.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>BG ameliorates colitis via enhanced myeloid cell activation independent of adaptive immunity</title>
<p>Given that BGTI has been reported to function independently of adaptive immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), we evaluated the effects of BG pretreatment in <italic>Rag1</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3A-S3D</xref>). Notably, BG pre-treatment remained effective in <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, as evidenced by reduced body weight loss, colon shortening, and improved histological outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3E-S3H</xref>). These findings confirm that BGTI-mediated protection is independent of adaptive immune responses, consistent with previous findings demonstrating that adaptive immunity is dispensable for trained immunity.</p>
<p>To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BG-mediated protection, we performed RNA sequencing on colonic samples collected at multiple time points following DSS administration. WGCNA identified the MEturquoise module emerged as the core functional module, containing 5,015 genes whose expression exhibited significant co-regulation following BG intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4A</xref>). And differential gene expression of genes within this module was most significant on day 7 post-DSS treatment when comparing the BG-treated mice to PBS controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4B</xref>). GO analysis revealed significant enrichment in pathways related to chemotaxis and leukocyte migration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated significant activation of cellular processes involved in phagocytic function (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>) Additionally, the enrichment observed in WGCNA was further corroborated by whole-genome analysis of day 7 colitis samples, which also identified significant enrichment of pathways associated with chemotaxis, leukocyte migration and phagocytic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4D</xref>). Multiple analytical approaches concurrently indicated that BG pretreatment not only enhances the recruitment of immune cells but also promotes their functional activation, particularly with respect to phagocytic capabilities.</p>

<p>To further investigate how BG pretreatment reprograms of intestinal myeloid cells, we performed single-cell RNA-seq to characterize intestinal leukocytes populations on day 7 post-DSS treatment. Unbiased clustering analysis identified multiple clusters of intestinal immune cells subsets, including monocytes/macrophages (<italic>Ly6c2</italic>, <italic>Ccr2</italic> and <italic>Adgre1</italic>), dendritic (DC) (<italic>Cst3</italic> and <italic>H2-Aa</italic>), neutrophils (<italic>S100a8/a9</italic> and <italic>Ly6g</italic>), B (<italic>Cd79a Cd79b</italic> and <italic>Cd19</italic>), Pre B (<italic>Myl4</italic> and <italic>Mme</italic>), CD4 T (<italic>Cd3d</italic> and <italic>Cd4</italic>), CD8 T (<italic>Cd3d</italic> and <italic>Cd8a</italic>), natural killer (<italic>Nkg7</italic>), ILC2 (<italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Il4</italic>) and ILC3 (<italic>Rorc</italic> and <italic>Il22</italic>) cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4E</xref>). Importantly, the ratio of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils was elevated in the BG group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA-sequencing data further demonstrated enhanced expression of innate pathogen recognition receptors (<italic>Syk</italic>, <italic>Nod1</italic>, <italic>Nod2</italic>, <italic>Tlr2</italic> and <italic>Tlr4</italic>), efferocytosis (<italic>Cd300lf</italic>, <italic>Axl</italic>, <italic>Mertk</italic>, <italic>Itgal</italic> and <italic>Itgb7</italic>), cytokines (<italic>Il1b</italic>, <italic>Il1rn</italic>, <italic>Vegfa</italic> and <italic>Tgfb1</italic>), chemokines (<italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl6</italic>, <italic>Ccl9</italic>, <italic>Cxcl9</italic>) and chemokine receptors (<italic>Ccr1</italic>, <italic>Ccr2</italic>, <italic>Cxcr4</italic>) in intestinal monocytes/macrophages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). AUC and KEGG analysis demonstrated significant enrichment pathways related to activation of innate immune response and phagocytosis in monocytes/macrophages from BG-treated mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>). These findings, corroborated by WGCNA analysis, strongly suggest that BG pretreatment enhanced the recruitment and activation of myeloid cells, particularly monocytes/macrophages, in the inflamed colon, thereby improving disease outcomes.</p>

<title>BG trained bone marrow monocytes protected against colitis via the Ccl2-Ccr2 axis</title>
<p>Drawing upon single-cell transcriptome analysis that reveals the proportional expansion and functional reprogramming features of colonic monocyte/macrophage populations, in conjunction with the observation of significantly upregulated peripheral monocytes following BG pretreatment as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2B</xref>.

<p>In view of the fact that BG induces myelopoiesis through the modulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitors cell compartments in the bone marrow via central trained immunity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). we assessed whether transplantation of bone marrow cells from BG-pretreated donors could confer resistance to DSS-induced colitis in naÃ¯ve recipients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). At 6 weeks post-transplantation, circulating myeloid cells were predominately derived from donor mice as indicated by the CD45.1 marker on circulating mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig S5C</xref>). Following DSS treatment, mice receiving bone marrow cells from BG-pretreated donors exhibited significantly reduced body weight loss (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). However, no significant difference in colon length was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig S5D</xref>).

<p>The BG-treated group exhibited a significant increase in the proportions of Mono1, Mono2, Macro1, and CD209aâºDCs, whereas higher proportions of Mono3 and Macro3 were observed in the PBS group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Given the strong enrichment of Mono1 and the reduction of Mono3 following BG treatment, we sought to further define the transcriptomic characteristics that differentiate Mono1 from Mono3. GO enrichment analysis revealed that Mono1 was significantly enriched in pathways regulating the activation of innate immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6B</xref>). KEGG pathways analysis further identified enrichment in NOD-like receptor (NLR) signaling, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, and phagocytosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). AUC analysis further confirmed the TLR and NLR signaling pathways were significantly upregulated in Mono1 and Mono2 subsets of the BG-pretreated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">S6D</xref>). Additionally, antimicrobial humoral response pathway was also upregulated in these two subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6E</xref>). Cooperative activation of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signaling axis and antimicrobial humoral response significantly promotes the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). BG pretreatment significantly upregulated genes encoding pattern recognition receptors (<italic>Nod1</italic>, <italic>Nod2</italic>, <italic>Tlr2</italic>, <italic>Tlr4</italic>) and antimicrobial effector molecules (<italic>S100a8</italic>, <italic>S100a9</italic>, <italic>Lcn2</italic> and <italic>Defb1</italic>) in the colon on day 7 of colitis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Furthermore, antimicrobial genes <italic>S100a8</italic> and <italic>Defa1</italic> were highly expressed in the BG group as validated by qPCR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6F</xref>). These genes upregulation suggest a potential link between trained immunity and enhanced microbial control. Consistently, gene signatures associated with bacterial defense responses were prominently enriched in the BG-treated group (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that GBPs as intracellular effectors induced by IFNÎ³ and LPS to promote antibacterial defense(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). We found that BG training significantly enriched the IFN-Î³ response pathway in Mono1 and Mono2 subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6G</xref>). Meanwhile, Guanylate-binding proteins (GBP)-related genes, including <italic>Gbp2</italic>, <italic>Gbp3</italic>, <italic>Gbp5</italic>, and <italic>Gbp7,</italic> were also specifically upregulated in Mono1 and Mono2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>).

<p>Taken together, these results reinforced our bulk RNA-seq findings, indicating that BG pretreatment induces a specific monocyte subcluster with enhanced innate activation and phagocytic capacity, facilitating more efficient control of the breaching microbiome associated with DSS-induced leaky gut.</p>

<title>BG-mediated reprogramming of myeloid differentiation trajectories balances inflammation and enhances mucosal repair in colitis</title>
<p>While BG-induced trained immunity is characterized by enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and increased bactericidal capacity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines release may exacerbate colitis progression. To balance heightened cytokine production without inducing overwhelming immunopathology, we hypothesized that BG pretreatment might involve feedback loops that modulate the inflammation while preserving enhanced phagocytic capacity.</p>
<p>To investigate this, we analyzed previously obtained bulk colonic RNA-seq data, focusing on genes associated with anti-inflammatory and regulatory functions. On day 7 of colitis, BG pretreatment significantly upregulated genes encoding immunomodulatory factors (<italic>Il4</italic>, <italic>Il10</italic>, <italic>Il11</italic> and <italic>Il33</italic>), signaling inhibitors (<italic>Socs1</italic>, <italic>Socs3</italic>), and differentiation regulators (<italic>Csf1</italic>, <italic>Csf1r</italic>, <italic>Stat3</italic> and <italic>Stat6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7A</xref>) The upregulation of <italic>Socs1</italic> and <italic>Socs3</italic> was further corroborated by scRNA-seq data, which showed increased expression of these genes in the Mono1 and Mono2 subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7B</xref>). As members of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family, SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibit excessive JAK-STAT signaling activation via negative feedback regulation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Moreover, coordinated activation of the monocyte/macrophage differentiation regulatory network (<italic>Csf1r</italic>, <italic>Nr4a2</italic>, <italic>Irf8</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>) suggests that BG may induce the differentiation of regulatory-phenotype macrophage subsets by reprogramming myeloid developmental trajectories, thereby modulating inflammatory responses.</p>
<p>To further investigate whether BG pretreatment reprograms monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, we analyzed the day7 RNA-seq data revealed significant enrichment of myeloid leukocyte differentiation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig S7C</xref>). Additionally, Single-cell trajectory analysis further revealed that Macro1 and Macro2 differentiated from Mono2 and Mono3, respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). BG training significantly accelerated the differentiation kinetics of Mono3 into Macro1, which may underlie the reduced frequency of the Mono3 subset in the BG group. Coupled with the gene expression signatures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6A</xref>, Macro1 shares similarities with Macro2 in marker gene expression, and the differentiated Macro1 subset could further differentiate into the tissue-resident macrophage Macro2 subset (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, we observed that the expression levels of <italic>Ccr2</italic> and <italic>Ly6c2</italic> decreased from Mono1 to Macro2, while <italic>H2-Ab1</italic> and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> progressively increased, particularly in macrophages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Since Cx3cr1 upregulation is a hallmark of circulating monocytes migrating to the intestinal lamina propria and undergoing macrophage differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), we used <italic>CX3CR1-GFP</italic> reporter mice to monitor the monocyte-to-macrophage transition in the DSS colitis model. In circulating leukocyte subsets, the total percentage of CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells was higher in BG-pretreated mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8A-C</xref>). A similar trend was observed in neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">S8E</xref>). While the initial monocyte percentage was higher in the BG group, no significant difference was observed the two groups on day 7 post-DSS treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">S8F</xref>), suggesting that circulating monocytes in BG-pretreated mice had extravasated into the intestinal tissue. Meanwhile, the percentage of colonic CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells and neutrophils was increased in the BG-pretreated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>We further defined monocyte/macrophage populations from P1 to P6 based on the expression of CD11b, CX3CR1-GFP, Ly6C, and MHCII. P1 to P3 were gated from CD11b<sup>+</sup>&amp;CX3CR1-GFP<sup>-</sup>&amp;Ly6G<sup>-</sup> cells. While P1 (Ly6C<sup>+</sup>&amp;MHCII<sup>-</sup>) and P3 (Ly6C<sup>-</sup>&amp;MHCII<sup>+</sup>) were comparable between group, P2 (Ly6C<sup>+</sup>&amp;MHCII<sup>+</sup>) was increased in BG-pretreated mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). P4 to P6 are gating from CD11b<sup>+</sup>&amp;CX3CR1-GFP<sup>+</sup> cells and further separate by the expression of Ly6C and MHCII. P4 (Ly6C<sup>+</sup>&amp;MHCII<sup>-</sup>) as infiltrating monocytes gaining CX3CR1 expression. P5 (Ly6C<sup>+</sup>&amp;MHCII<sup>+</sup>) is regarded as intermediate transitory immature macrophage and P6 (Ly6C<sup>-</sup>&amp;MHCII<sup>+</sup>) is considered as mature macrophage as it completely loss expression of Ly6C and highly express MHCII. BG pretreatment led to an increase in P5 level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). The increase of P2 and P5 in BG group in line with the decrease of monocytes at day 7 in circulation post DSS treatment, suggesting that BG trained monocytes have higher capacity to infiltrate into the damaged colon and undergo macrophage differentiation.</p>
<p>Previous WGCNA analysis suggested that BG pre-treatment upregulated the focal adhesion pathway, which may enhance tissue repair mechanisms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed increased expression of genes involved in wound healing and tissue repair, such as <italic>Mmp</italic>-related genes, <italic>Spon1</italic>, <italic>Notch1</italic>, <italic>Notch2</italic>, <italic>Tgfb</italic>, <italic>Fgf1</italic>, <italic>Fgf2</italic>, <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Col1a2</italic>, <italic>and Fn1</italic> in the BG-treated group on day 7, followed by a rapid decline by day 12. In contrast, the PBS group exhibited a much milder induction of these genes, with several genes remaining at comparable levels between day 7 and day 12 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). This led us to hypothesize that the upregulated monocytes and macrophages in the BG-treated group might exhibit enhanced expression of tissue repair-associated genes. As expected, the expression of <italic>Spon1</italic> and <italic>Mmp14</italic>, which promote the mucosal repair was increased in Mono2, Macro1, and Macro2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5I</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Trained immunity, a non-antigen-specific form of innate immunological memory, enables rapid host defense mobilization upon pathogen challenge(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In inflammatory bowel disease, gut microbial dysbiosis manifests as reduced Î±-diversity, diminished commensal taxa (e.g., <italic>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</italic>), and pathobiont expansion (e.g., <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>adherent-invasive Escherichia coli</italic>), which may compromise intestinal barrier integrity and precipitate microbial translocation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Additionally, the long-term use of immunosuppressants and biologics in IBD patients elevates infection susceptibility, rendering the microbial-controlling properties of trained immunity a viable therapeutic strategy for IBD(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). However, Excessive or sustained immune activation could trigger chronic inflammatory cascades and provoke autoimmune tissue damage through aberrant immune recognition, such as rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular diseases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). However, the functional correlation between trained immunity and colitis remains unclear, and how to apply trained immunity to colitis treatment represents an urgently unresolved scientific question.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrated that BG-induced trained immunity confers cross-pathogen protective effects using a lethal <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection model, while failing to induce intestinal inflammation under conditions of an intact mucosal barrier. Further investigations revealed that BG effectively attenuated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis upon secondary challenge. BG pretreatment conferred long-term protection against DSS-induced colitis, with benefits lasting for at least two months after the peripheral myeloid cell populations returned to baseline levels. Bone marrow transplantation experiments confirmed that BG-induced trained immunity persists within hematopoietic progenitors, leading to durable reprogramming of peripheral monocytes. This long-term effect is likely supported by epigenetic modifications in hematopoietic cells, as reported in previous studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). These findings highlight the potential of BG-induced trained immunity in establishing long-lasting immune memory, which could be leveraged to achieve sustained therapeutic effects in IBD.</p>
<p>The conventional understanding of IBD pathogenesis has long posited that abnormal immune activation is central to disease development and progression. This paradigm has predominantly focused on the role of adaptive immunity, particularly the dysregulation of Th17 and Treg functions over the past decades(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). However, our results suggest that BG-induced protection is independent of adaptive immune responses. Even in <italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which lack adaptive immunity, BG pretreatment significantly improved DSS-induced colitis outcomes. This underscores the dominant role of innate immunity.</p>
<p>In DSS-induced colitis, epithelial barrier disruption facilitates microbiota translocation across the mucosal epithelium, triggering inflammatory responses mediated by innate cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). We identified monocytes as key mediators of BG-induced protection against DSS-induced colitis, as demonstrated by experiments using <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse models and monocyte transfer studies. BG pretreatment enriched Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which exhibited enhanced antimicrobial capabilities, as revealed by scRNA-seq. Ly6C<sup>hi</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes displayed higher levels of antimicrobial receptors like NOD2, TLR4 and GBP-related gene. Guanylate-binding protein (GBP) enhances <italic>Salmonella</italic> clearance by promoting inflammasome activation and intracellular bacterial elimination, particularly through disrupting <italic>Salmonella-</italic>containing vacuoles and inducting pyroptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Our finding revealed that BG pretreatment increased resistance to <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> infection. As inflammation and infection is partially controlled, monocytes can differentiate into macrophage subsets with anti-inflammatory and tissue repair functions, secreting cytokines such as IL-10, TGF-Î² and VEGF to promote inflammation resolution and tissue repair(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have underscored the essential role of circulating Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> monocytes in replenishing intestinal macrophages(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). During colitis and infection, these monocytes are rapidly recruited to injured colonic tissues, where they differentiate into Cx3cr1<sup>+</sup> macrophages. We also observed that these monocytes exhibited enhanced migratory capabilities, enabling them to infiltrate inflamed tissues and differentiate into CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages. These macrophages contribute to mucosal repair by clearing pathogens such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> and promoting epithelial regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). Single-cell trajectory analysis further showed that BG training promoted the differentiation of Macro1 into Macro2, which is consistent with the dynamic process of monocyte-to-mature macrophage conversion observed in <italic>CX3CR1-GFP</italic> reporter mice. Maintaining a balance between inflammatory monocytes, differentiated macrophages, and tissue-resident macrophages is critical for resolving inflammation, promoting tissue repair(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). These findings suggest that BG not only augments monocyte antimicrobial functions but also facilitates their differentiation into macrophages, enhancing their ability to recognize, phagocytose, and eliminate bacteria while promoting tissue repair. This dual function likely strengthens the intestinal barrier, mitigates inflammation, and supports gut homeostasis.</p>
<p>In the clinical exploration of IBD treatment, novel therapies based on cellular regeneration (intestinal organoid transplantation) and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) are emerging as critical avenues to overcome the limitations of conventional pharmacotherapies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Given the efficacy of BG-induced trained immunity in alleviating DSS-induced colitis, this approach holds significant promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for IBD treatment. We transferred BG-preconditioned monocytes significantly alleviated clinical symptoms, including weight loss and colon shortening, demonstrating the potential of cell-based therapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Fig S10A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, BG confers long-term colitis amelioration through trained immunity by reprogramming bone marrow-derived monocytes. Mechanistically, BG enhances monocyte chemotaxis and antimicrobial functionality activation, enabling efficient microbial containment. Crucially, this trained state establishes self-regulating circuits, engaging in negative feedback regulation of excessive immune responses, while accelerated CX3CR1âº macrophage differentiation facilitates mucosal repair. These findings establish a foundation for leveraging trained immunity as a therapeutic strategy for IBD, highlighting the potential of BG in modulating intestinal immunity and restoring gut homeostasis.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and real-time PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from colon tissue previously washed from luminal content. Samples were homogenized in TRIZOL. Homogenized tissues were then added with chloroform in order to separate RNA from genomic DNA and proteins. RNA isolation and purification required isopropanol (RNA precipitation) and 70% ethanol (RNA wash). Total RNA was resuspended in Nuclease-free water. Subsequently, 1 Âµg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using the HifairÂ® ll lst Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix for qPCR (gDNA digester plus) following manufacturerâs instructions. cDNA analysed through quantitative Real-Time PCR.</p>

<title>Isolation of cells from lamina propria</title>
<p>To isolate lamina propria mononuclear cells (lamina propria MCs), extraintestinal fat tissue was carefully removed and colons were then flushed of their luminal content with physiologic solution, opened longitudinally and cut into 1 cm pieces. Epithelial cells and mucus were removed by incubation with 10 mL of D-Hankâs balanced salt solution (containing EDTA and DTT, free of Ca2<sup>+</sup> and Mg2<sup>+</sup>) for 20 minutes at 37Â°C at 200 rpm in a constant temperature shaker. Colon pieces were then digested in Hankâs (with Ca2<sup>+</sup> and Mg2<sup>+</sup>) containing 0.5 mg/ml Collagenase IV and 15 Âµg/ml DNase I, for 40 min at 37Â°C shaking at 200 rpm. The remaining cells were centrifuged and resuspended in FACS buffer (1% FBS, 2 mM EDTA in PBS).</p>

<title>Bone Marrow Transplantation</title>
<p>Wild type CD45.2 mice were subjected to 8 Gy irradiation (RAD SOURCE, RS2000). CD45.1 wild type and BG trained mice were sacrificed, and the femurs were used to harvest bone marrow cells. 1Ã10<sup>7</sup> bone marrow cells from CD45.1 wild type and BG trained donor mice were transferred to irradiated CD45.2 recipients via tail-vein injection. 2.5% DSS was given at 6 weeks-post bone marrow transplantation. Mice were monitored every day until day 12.</p>

<title>RNA-seq data processing and analysis</title>
<p>Raw data of fastq format were quality checked through fastqc software. Reference genome and gene model annotation files were downloaded from genome (mm10) website directly. Index of the reference genome was built using Hisat2 v2.1.0 and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using Hisat2 v2.1.0. Expression levels across the sample were expressed in FPKM (Fragment per kilobase per million). Weighted correlation network analysis was perform using an R package from horvath.genetics.ucla.edu/html/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/. Differential gene expression was used DESeq2 by a twofold cutoff and pvalue &lt; 0.05. All differentially expressed genes were plotted with the âpheatmapâ and âggplot2â R packages. For KEGG enrichment analysis, p-value &lt; 0.05 was used as a threshold to determine significant enrichment for gene sets with the âclusterProfilerâ R package.</p>

<title>scRNA-seq data processing and analysis</title>
<p>Raw sequencing data was processed and aligned mm10 mouse reference genome with CellRanger (10ÃGenomics) v 7.2.0. Resulting filtrated matrices (count matrices) of molecular counts were used as input for further processing with Seurat package V5.0.1running under R studio. First, quality control was performed to create Seurat object with min features &gt; 200 and removal of cells having &lt; 200 or &gt; 8000 expressed genes or &gt; 5% mitochondrial counts. The total number of recovered cells was mentioned before. Variable features using FindVariableFeatures (using RNA and vst as an assay and selection method as parameters) and normalization using normalization.method = âLogNormalizeâ, scale.factor = 10000 were performed . This integrated data is scaled using ScaleData function using all genes and âRNAâ as assay method.</p>
<p>Doublet cells were filtered by DoubletFinder v3. Principal Component Analysis was performed on variable features using RunPCA and first 30 PCs were chosen. The nearest neighbors using the FindNeighbors(dims=1:12) and FindClusters(resolution=0.8) function. For visualization, the non-linear dimensional reduction such as UMAP analysis was using RunUMAP function from Seurat.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents an interesting investigation into the role of trained immunity in inflammatory bowel disease, demonstrating that Î²-glucan-induced reprogramming of innate immune cells can ameliorate experimental colitis. The findings are novel and clinically relevant, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies in IBD. The combination of functional assays, adoptive transfer experiments, and single-cell RNA sequencing provides comprehensive mechanistic insights. However, some aspects of the study could benefit from further clarification to strengthen the conclusions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study elegantly connects trained immunity with IBD, demonstrating how Î²-glucan-induced innate immune reprogramming can mitigate chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>(2) Adoptive transfer experiments robustly confirm the protective role of monocytes/macrophages in colitis resolution.</p>
<p>(3) Single-cell RNA sequencing provides mechanistic depth, revealing the expansion of reparative Cx3cr1âº macrophages and their contribution to epithelial repair.</p>
<p>(4) The work highlights the therapeutic potential of trained immunity in restoring gut homeostasis, offering new directions for IBD treatment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While Î²-glucan may exert its training effect on hematopoietic stem cells, performing ATAC-seq on HSCs or monocytes to profile chromatin accessibility at antibacterial defense and mucosal repair-related genes would further validate the trained immunity mechanism. Alternatively, the authors could acknowledge this as a study limitation and future research direction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study investigates whether Î²-glucan (BG) can reprogram the innate immune system to protect against intestinal inflammation. The authors show that mice pretreated with BG prior to DSS-induced colitis experience reduced colitis severity, including less weight loss, colon damage, improved gut repair, and lowered inflammation. These effects were independent of adaptive immunity and were linked to changes in monocyte function.</p>
<p>The authors show that the BG-trained monocytes not only help control inflammation but confer non-specific protection against experimental infections (Salmonella), suggesting the involvement of trained immunity (TI) mechanisms. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, they map the transcriptional changes in these cells and show enhanced differentiation of monocytes into reparative CX3CR1âº macrophages. Importantly, these protective effects were transferable to other mice via adoptive cell transfer and bone marrow transplantation, suggesting that the innate immune system had been reprogrammed at the level of stem/progenitor cells.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides evidence that TI, often associated with heightened inflammatory programs, can also promote tissue repair and resolution of inflammation. Moreover, this BG-induced functional reprogramming can be further harnessed to treat chronic inflammatory disorders like IBD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors use advanced experimental approaches to explore the potential therapeutic use of myeloid reprogramming by Î²-glucan in IBD.</p>
<p>(2) The authors follow a data-to-function approach, integrating bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing with in vivo functional validation to support their conclusions.</p>
<p>(3) The study adds to the growing evidence that TI is not a singular pro-inflammatory program, but can adopt distinct functional states, including anti-inflammatory and reparative phenotypes, depending on the context.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The epigenetic and metabolic basis of TI is not explored, which weakens the mechanistic claim of TI. This is especially relevant given that a novel reparative, anti-inflammatory TI program is proposed.</p>
<p>(2) The absence of a BG-only group limits interpretation of the results. Since the authors report tissue-level effects such as enhanced mucosal repair and transcriptional shifts in intestinal macrophages (colonic RNA-Seq), it is important to rule out whether BG alone could influence the gut independently of DSS-induced inflammation.</p>
<p>
Without a BG-only control, it is hard to distinguish a true trained response from a potential modulation caused directly by BG.</p>
<p>(3) Although monocyte transfer experiments show protection in colitis, the fate of the transferred cells is not described (e.g., homing or differentiation into Cx3cr1âº macrophage subsets). This weakens the link between specific monocyte subsets and the observed phenotype.</p>
<p>(3) While scRNA-seq reveals distinct monocyte/macrophage subclusters (Mono1-3..), their specific functional roles remain speculative. The authors assign reparative or antimicrobial functions based on transcriptional signatures, but do not perform causal experiments (depletion or in vitro assays). The biological roles of these cells remain correlative.</p>
<p>(4) While Rag1â»/â» mice were used to rule out adaptive immunity, the potential role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), particularly ILC2s and ILC3s, which are known to promote mucosal repair (PMID: 27484190), was not explored. Given the reparative phenotype observed, the contribution of ILCs remains a confounding factor.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present work, Yinyin Lv et al offer evidence for the therapeutic potential of trained immunity in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Prior research has demonstrated that innate cells pre-treated (trained) with Î²-glucan show an enhanced pro-inflammatory response upon a second challenge.</p>
<p>While an increased immune response can be beneficial and protect against bacterial infections, there is also the risk that it will worsen symptoms in various inflammatory disorders. In the present study, the authors show that mice preconditioned with Î²-glucan have enhanced resistance to Staphylococcus aureus infection, indicating heightened immune responses.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that Î²-glucan training of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors and peripheral monocytes mitigates the pro-inflammatory effects of colitis, with protection extending to naÃ¯ve recipients of the trained cells.</p>
<p>Using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model of colitis, Î²-glucan pre-treatment significantly dampens disease severity. Importantly, the use of Rag1^-/- mice, which lack adaptive immune cells, confirms that the protective effects of Î²-glucan are mediated by innate immune mechanisms. Further, experiments using Ccr2^-/- mice underline the necessity of monocyte recruitment in mediating this protection, highlighting CCR2 as a key factor in the mobilization of Î²-glucan-trained monocytes to inflamed tissues. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that Î²-glucan training upregulates genes associated with pattern recognition, antimicrobial defense, immunomodulation, and interferon signaling pathways, suggesting broad functional reprogramming of the innate immune compartment. In addition, Î²-glucan training induces a distinct monocyte subpopulation with enhanced activation and phagocytic capacity. These monocytes exhibit an increased ability to infiltrate inflamed colonic tissue and differentiate into macrophages, marked by increased expression of Cx3cr1. Moreover, among these trained monocyte and macrophage subsets, other gene expression signatures are associated with tissue and mucosal repair, suggesting a role in promoting resolution and regeneration following inflammatory insult.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study presents an interesting investigation into the role of trained immunity in inflammatory bowel disease, demonstrating that Î²-glucan-induced reprogramming of innate immune cells can ameliorate experimental colitis. The findings are novel and clinically relevant, with potential implications for therapeutic strategies in IBD. The combination of functional assays, adoptive transfer experiments, and single-cell RNA sequencing provides comprehensive mechanistic insights. However, some aspects of the study could benefit from further clarification to strengthen the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewerâs positive assessment of our study and constructive suggestions to improve the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study elegantly connects trained immunity with IBD, demonstrating how Î²-glucan-induced innate immune reprogramming can mitigate chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>(2) Adoptive transfer experiments robustly confirm the protective role of monocytes/macrophages in colitis resolution.</p>
<p>(3) Single-cell RNA sequencing provides mechanistic depth, revealing the expansion of reparative Cx3cr1âº macrophages and their contribution to epithelial repair.</p>
<p>(4) The work highlights the therapeutic potential of trained immunity in restoring gut homeostasis, offering new directions for IBD treatment.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While Î²-glucan may exert its training effect on hematopoietic stem cells, performing ATAC-seq on HSCs or monocytes to profile chromatin accessibility at antibacterial defense and mucosal repair-related genes would further validate the trained immunity mechanism. Alternatively, the authors could acknowledge this as a study limitation and future research direction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that further epigenetic profilingâsuch as ATAC-seq analysis on HSCs or monocytesâwould provide additional mechanistic depth to our current findings. We will acknowledge this as a limitation of the present study and highlight it as an important direction for future research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment (1): Itâs better to include a schematic summarizing the proposed mechanism for reader clarity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that a visual summary will enhance the clarity and accessibility of our findings. We will add a new schematic diagram (Figure 6) illustrating the proposed mechanism of Î²-glucanâinduced myeloid reprogramming and its protective effects in the experimental colitis model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Comment (2): Discuss potential off-target effects of Î²-glucan-induced trained immunity (e.g., risk of exacerbated inflammation in other contexts).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this important comment regarding the potential off-target effects of Î²-glucan pretreatment. As trained immunity is known to amplify inflammatory responses upon heterologous stimulation and has been implicated in chronic inflammationâprone conditions such as atherosclerosis, this is an important consideration. Previous in vivo studies have shown that Î²-glucan pretreatment can enhance antibacterial or antitumor responses without inducing basal inflammation after one week of administration (PMID: 22901542, PMID: 30380404, PMID: 36604547, PMID: 33125892). Nevertheless, it remains possible that Î²-glucanâinduced trained immunity could have unintended effects in certain contexts, which warrants further investigation and caution. We will expand the Discussion section to include a dedicated paragraph addressing these potential off-target effects.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study investigates whether Î²-glucan (BG) can reprogram the innate immune system to protect against intestinal inflammation. The authors show that mice pretreated with BG prior to DSS-induced colitis experience reduced colitis severity, including less weight loss, colon damage, improved gut repair, and lowered inflammation. These effects were independent of adaptive immunity and were linked to changes in monocyte function.</p>
<p>The authors show that the BG-trained monocytes not only help control inflammation but confer non-specific protection against experimental infections (Salmonella), suggesting the involvement of trained immunity (TI) mechanisms. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, they map the transcriptional changes in these cells and show enhanced differentiation of monocytes into reparative CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages. Importantly, these protective effects were transferable to other mice via adoptive cell transfer and bone marrow transplantation, suggesting that the innate immune system had been reprogrammed at the level of stem/progenitor cells.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides evidence that TI, often associated with heightened inflammatory programs, can also promote tissue repair and resolution of inflammation. Moreover, this BG-induced functional reprogramming can be further harnessed to treat chronic inflammatory disorders like IBD.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors use advanced experimental approaches to explore the potential therapeutic use of myeloid reprogramming by Î²-glucan in IBD.</p>
<p>(2) The authors follow a data-to-function approach, integrating bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing with in vivo functional validation to support their conclusions.</p>
<p>(3) The study adds to the growing evidence that TI is not a singular pro-inflammatory program, but can adopt distinct functional states, including anti-inflammatory and reparative phenotypes, depending on the context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewerâs positive assessment of our study and recognition of its translational implications. We particularly appreciate the acknowledgment that our work expands the therapeutic potential of Î²-glucanâmediated trained immunity in ameliorating colitis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The epigenetic and metabolic basis of TI is not explored, which weakens the mechanistic claim of TI. This is especially relevant given that a novel reparative, anti-inflammatory TI program is proposed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs valuable comment highlighting the importance of the epigenetic and metabolic basis of TI in providing mechanistic insight. While previous studies, including work from our group (S.-C. Cheng), have extensively characterized the epigenetic and metabolic signatures of monocytes from BG-trained miceâprimarily in the context of inflammatory genesâwe acknowledge that these aspects are not directly addressed in our current manuscript.</p>
<p>To strengthen the mechanistic component, we plan to: 1. Reanalyze relevant public datasets, focusing on pathways related to reparative and antibacterial function. 2. Perform monocyte ATAC-seq in our current model to validate the epigenetic changes in these pathways.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The absence of a BG-only group limits interpretation of the results. Since the authors report tissue-level effects such as enhanced mucosal repair and transcriptional shifts in intestinal macrophages (colonic RNA-Seq), it is important to rule out whether BG alone could influence the gut independently of DSS-induced inflammation.</p>
<p>Without a BG-only control, it is hard to distinguish a true trained response from a potential modulation caused directly by BG.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. Although we did not perform qPCR for mucosal repair genes in Figure S1C and Figure S1D, our colon RNA-seq analysis in Figure 5G included a BG-only control group (Colitis_d0). The results from this group indicate that BG preconditioning alone does not alter baseline expression of colon mucosal repair genes, supporting the conclusion that the observed effects occur in the context of DSS-induced inflammation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Although monocyte transfer experiments show protection in colitis, the fate of the transferred cells is not described (e.g., homing or differentiation into Cx3cr1âº macrophage subsets). This weakens the link between specific monocyte subsets and the observed phenotype.</p>
<p>(4) While scRNA-seq reveals distinct monocyte/macrophage subclusters (Mono1-3.), their specific functional roles remain speculative. The authors assign reparative or antimicrobial functions based on transcriptional signatures, but do not perform causal experiments (depletion or in vitro assays). The biological roles of these cells remain correlative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the functional role of CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages is not comprehensively validated and is currently inferred from scRNA-seq clustering. While our flow cytometry data show increased CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the BG-TI group, and our CCR2 KO and monocyte adoptive transfer experiments indicate these macrophages are monocyte-derived, we lack direct depletion experiments due to the unavailability of effective depletion antibodies for this subset.</p>
<p>We acknowledge this as a limitation and will clarify in the Discussion that our conclusions regarding CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> macrophage function are based on transcriptional profiling and association with protective phenotypes, rather than direct causal evidence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) While <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were used to rule out adaptive immunity, the potential role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), particularly ILC2s and ILC3s, which are known to promote mucosal repair (PMID: 27484190IF: 7.6 Q1 IF: 7.6 Q1 IF: 7.6 Q1 IF: 7.6 Q1 IF: 7.6 Q1 IF: 7.6 Q1 ), was not explored. Given the reparative phenotype observed, the contribution of ILCs remains a confounding factor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs valuable comment regarding the potential role of ILCs in the observed mucosal repair. Indeed, in examining the BG-trained immunity effect, the contribution of ILCs was not evaluated. We will explicitly acknowledge in the Discussion that <italic>Rag1â»/â»</italic> mice retain ILCs (including ILC3s) and that BG-induced activation of these cells remains possible.</p>
<p>The literature (PMID: 21502992; PMID: 32187516) supports a role for ILC3-mediated IL-22 production in tissue repair, which could overlap with our observed effects. However, our monocyte adoptive transfer experiments show that monocytes alone can alleviate DSS-induced colitis, suggesting a dominant role for monocytes in this context. Nonetheless, we will make it clear that ILC contributions cannot be excluded.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present work, Yinyin Lv et al offer evidence for the therapeutic potential of trained immunity in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Prior research has demonstrated that innate cells pre-treated (trained) with Î²-glucan show an enhanced pro-inflammatory response upon a second challenge.</p>
<p>While an increased immune response can be beneficial and protect against bacterial infections, there is also the risk that it will worsen symptoms in various inflammatory disorders. In the present study, the authors show that mice preconditioned with Î²-glucan have enhanced resistance to Staphylococcus aureus infection, indicating heightened immune responses.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that Î²-glucan training of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors and peripheral monocytes mitigates the pro-inflammatory effects of colitis, with protection extending to naÃ¯ve recipients of the trained cells.</p>
<p>Using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced model of colitis, Î²-glucan pre-treatment significantly dampens disease severity. Importantly, the use of Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which lack adaptive immune cells, confirms that the protective effects of Î²-glucan are mediated by innate immune mechanisms. Further, experiments using Ccr2<sup>-/-</sup> mice underline the necessity of monocyte recruitment in mediating this protection, highlighting CCR2 as a key factor in the mobilization of Î²-glucan-trained monocytes to inflamed tissues. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that Î²-glucan training upregulates genes associated with pattern recognition, antimicrobial defense, immunomodulation, and interferon signaling pathways, suggesting broad functional reprogramming of the innate immune compartment. In addition, Î²-glucan training induces a distinct monocyte subpopulation with enhanced activation and phagocytic capacity. These monocytes exhibit an increased ability to infiltrate inflamed colonic tissue and differentiate into macrophages, marked by increased expression of Cx3cr1. Moreover, among these trained monocyte and macrophage subsets, other gene expression signatures are associated with tissue and mucosal repair, suggesting a role in promoting resolution and regeneration following inflammatory insult.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Overall, the authors present a mechanistically insightful investigation that advances our understanding of trained immunity in IBD.</p>
<p>(2) By employing a range of well-characterized murine models, the authors investigate specific mechanisms involved in the effects of Î²-glucan training.</p>
<p>(3) Furthermore, the study provides functional evidence that the protection conferred by the trained cells persists within the hematopoietic progenitors and can be transferred to naÃ¯ve recipients. The integration of transcriptomic profiling allows the identification of changes in key genes and molecular pathways underlying the trained immune phenotype.</p>
<p>(4) This is an important study that demonstrates that Î²-glucan-trained innate cells confer protection against colitis and promote mucosal repair, and these findings underscore the potential of harnessing innate immune memory as a therapeutic approach for chronic inflammatory diseases.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reminder about best practices for RNA-seq analysis. We apologize for the inaccurate description in the Materials and Methods section. For all differential expression analyses, we have in fact used raw count data as input for DESeq2. FPKM values were only used for visualization purposes, such as in heatmaps and clustering analyses. We will correct this description in the revised manuscript to accurately reflect our analysis workflow.</p>
