<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Hematopoietic dysfunction has been associated with a reduction in the number of active precursors. However, precursor quantification at homeostasis and under diseased conditions is constrained by the scarcity of available methods. To address this issue, we optimized a method for quantifying a wide range of hematopoietic precursors. Assuming the random induction of a stable label in precursors following a binomial distribution, the estimation depends on the inverse correlation between precursor numbers and the variance of precursor labeling among independent samples. Experimentally validated to cover the full dynamic range of hematopoietic precursors in mice (1 to 10<sup>5</sup>), we utilized this approach to demonstrate that thousands of precursors, which emerge after modest expansion during fetal-to-adult transition, contribute to native and perturbed hematopoiesis. We further estimated the number of precursors in a mouse model of Fanconi Anemia, showcasing how repopulation deficits can be segregated into autologous (cell proliferation) and non-autologous causes (lack of precursor). Our results support an accessible and reliable approach for precursor quantification, emphasizing the contemporary perspective that native hematopoiesis is highly polyclonal.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The continuous self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are fundamental to blood production. Even though rare cases exist where a single HSPC clone supports hematopoiesis, the HSPC population contributing to homeostatic hematopoiesis is usually highly polyclonal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. For example, the number of HSPCs actively participating in white blood cell production was estimated to range from 20,000 to 200,000 in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Conversely, a decline in the number of active hematopoietic precursors has been linked to hematopoietic dysfunctions. For example, in humans older than 70 years of age, hematopoietic dysfunction coincides with an abrupt reduction in the HSPCs population actively contributing to blood production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>].</p>
<p>These observations underscore the association between a low number of active hematopoietic precursors and hematological dysfunction. Yet, few methods are suitable for quantifying active hematopoietic precursors in a native environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. In mice, methods utilizing <italic>in situ</italic> barcodes often suffer from barcode homoplasy, preventing total precursor number estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In humans, estimations based on somatic mutations and computational modeling carry high uncertainty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. The absence of precise precursor quantification methods in their natural environment hampered the study of precursor numbers across different conditions and their potential usage as predictive functional markers.</p>
<p>In mice, the quantification of developmental hematopoietic precursors has been achieved using mice with a Confetti cassette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. This cassette can randomly recombine and express one of four fluorescence proteins (FPs, being RFP, CFP, YFP, or GFP) upon Cre induction, resulting in variability in Confetti expression pattern in mice inversely correlating with precursor numbers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. While suitable for developmental hematopoiesis, this method has limited linear range (50-2500), impeding its potential application to adult hematopoiesis or clonal hematopoiesis. To measure hematopoietic precursors in various conditions, expansion of the detection range is desired.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the random induction of Confetti colors in HSPCs bears similarity with X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). In XCI, one of the X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in precursor cells, a process that adheres to a binomial distribution. Formula derivation from binomial distribution implied that higher XCI variance among individuals correlates with a smaller number of precursors at the time of inactivation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). As XCI is faithfully maintained in the progeny, this correlation has been used to estimate precursor numbers from mature blood cells in human and mouse, leading to the discovery of the first mutation (Tet2) that contributes to clonal hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Nonetheless, XCI occurs exclusively in females, limiting its applicability in males. Additionally, XCI takes place during early development when few precursors are present, resulting in low sensitivity in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Building on insights from Confetti mice and XCI studies, we investigated whether random induction of Confetti FPs in precursor cells can be similarly modeled by a binomial distribution, thus the variance of FPs inversely correlates with precursor numbers. Based on this relationship, we asked if we could broaden the measurable range of precursor number, which would allow us to measure the numbers outside the existing correlation range.</p>
<p>Examining the premises of binomial distribution and setting some assumptions, we established that the random induction of FPs among a group of mice or cells could be modeled by a binomial distribution. Experimental validation established a broader linear range, covering the full spectrum of precursor numbers (1∼10<sup>5</sup>) and overcoming the prior range limit. We leveraged this correlation to probe the number of hematopoietic precursors at homeostasis, post-myeloablation, during developmental expansion, and in a mouse model of inherited bone marrow failure.</p>

<title>Binomial distribution underlies the inverse linear correlation between FP% variance and the precursor numbers</title>
<p>To broaden the limited correlation range, we aimed to elucidate the mathematical relationship between variance and precursor numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Inspired by XCI, we asked how the stochastic induction of Confetti FPs in precursors may satisfy the premises of binomial distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. We found that when we assume the number of precursors remain the same for the condition tested, then induction of FPs meet the required premises : (1) the number of precursors, denoted as <italic>n</italic>, remains constant within a group of mice or cells; (2) each observation (e.g. each precursor) is independent; (3) each observation yields one of two outcomes (e.g., it signifies the presence or absence of RFP in a precursor); (4) the probability of success, represented as <italic>p</italic> (e.g., the likelihood of a precursor expressing RFP upon Confetti induction), remains consistent across all observations.</p>
<p>Should the induction of a FP adhere to a binomial distribution, precursor numbers can be estimated using the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="587737v1_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> signifies the estimated number of precursors, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> represents the estimated probability of a precursor being one given FP (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> denotes the estimated coefficient of variance (CV) of one given FP (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). CV is the standard deviation divided by the mean, utilized by the empirical correlation formula.</p>
<p>The equation proposed a direct linear relationship between the precursor number and the CVs of individual FP, supporting the empirical correlation formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Indeed, by analyzing a published dataset providing precursor numbers and the corresponding distribution of FPs, we found that the correlation between <italic>n</italic> and individual CVs of FP exhibits superior fit (&gt;0.93), higher than the empirical correlation equation based on all three CVs (0.75) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Moreover, according to <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 1</xref>, the y-intercept of correlation between precursor number and CV was influenced by FP<sub>mean</sub>%, while the slope was the same (-2) regardless of FP<sub>mean</sub>%. Given the unequal value of RFP<sub>mean</sub>%, CFP<sub>mean</sub>%, and YFP<sub>mean</sub>% in the published dataset, their correlation equations showed significantly distinct y-intercepts (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>). In contrast, the slopes of these correlation equations were similar (p=0.49, with all 95% confidence intervals encompassing -2, the theoretical value).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the FP induction in precursor cells can be modeled by a binomial distribution with the assumption that precursor numbers are constant among a group of mice. This sets the mathematical basis for the inverse linear correlation between variance of FP% and the number of precursors.</p>
<p>A broad range of precursor numbers correlates with variance of FP%</p>
<p>While the correlation formula derived from binomial distribution does not impose any range limitation, experimental errors may confound the measurement of variance. We next aimed to experimentally confirm this correlation. To streamline the calculation, we used standard deviation instead of CV to compute variance. The correlation between standard deviation and precursor numbers is expressed through the following equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="587737v1_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> denotes the estimated standard deviation of a given FP% (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>).</p>
<p>Given this equation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> exhibits a linear and inverse correlation with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Indeed, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> exhibited linear and inverse correlation with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in the published data (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>To simplify the validation, we used a two-color cell model HL-60 bearing one of the two FPs (BFP and GFP, GFP represents non-BFP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Although the Confetti cassette recombination can generate one of four colors, our estimation is based on a given FP (e.g. a precursor expresses RFP or not), making this simplification justifiable.</p>
<p>We first proved that neither BFP nor GFP HL-60 cells had a competitive growth advantage over the other, ensuring that HL-60 progenies mirrored the seeding population (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). We next sorted one to 10<sup>5</sup> cells into individual wells and allowed them to proliferate for at least three generations before assessing BFP% at the end of the culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We seeded up to 10<sup>5</sup> cells as 1.4x10<sup>5</sup> non-HSC LSK and 5.2x10<sup>3</sup> active HSCs were previously estimated in an adult female mouse, which corresponded to the highest possible precursor numbers in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. We considered the survival rate of cells in wells receiving a single HL-60 cell (53% to 60%), to ensure the accuracy of the number of cells seeded.</p>
<p>Consistent with the proposed correlation, as seeded number increased, BFP% standard deviation decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The variance of BFP% displayed an inverse correlation with the seeding numbers (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.996) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). After normalizing for cell survival rates, the calculated numbers closely aligned with the expected numbers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We had anticipated that measurement of small variance in high precursor numbers may be confounded by experimental errors. Yet, at 10<sup>5</sup> seeded cells, the estimated number of precursors did not plateau, suggesting minimal impact from experimental error even at 10<sup>5</sup> cells.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Experimental practices for accurate precursor number measurement</title>
<p>It is crucial to ensure the accuracy of variance measured because variance of FP% is solely used for estimation. Based on the data from the two-color HL-60 model, we concluded that there were at least three experimental practices required for accurate cell estimates: (1) exclusion of outliers; (2) sufficient flow cytometry recorded events; (3) sufficient sample size per group. Both outliers and insufficient recorded events inaccurately inflate sample variance, leading to underestimation of precursor numbers (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref> and F). We found that the minimum recorded events increase in tandem with the seeded number, in contrary to the reported 500-event threshold (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>].</p>
<p>While having a small sample size per biological replicate is possible, the variability of estimations among replicates would be high (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1G</xref>). Practically, achieving a large sample size (&gt;20) is cumbersome in mice. To determine a feasible sample size for relatively accurate estimates, we resampled datapoints to calculate the amount of variability reduction as sample size increased (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1H</xref>). Our analyses revealed that five samples per group were sufficient to dramatically reduce error, where additional increase in sample size led to marginal error reduction. We therefore used at least five mice per biological replicates for our precursor estimations.</p>

<title>Inducible HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>-targeted Confetti labeling in the active blood precursors at the adult stage</title>
<p>To label hematopoietic precursors and quantify their number <italic>in vivo</italic>, we considered the Cre mouse line to be crossed with Confetti. Historically, hematopoietic precursors were thought to be hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) capable of long-term repopulation. However, recent studies indicate that multipotent progenitors (MPPs) also contribute alongside HSCs in maintaining blood production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Hence, both HSCs and MPPs should be labeled.</p>
<p>Among limited Cre mouse lines capable of labeling HSCs and MPPs simultaneously at the adult stage (such as Rosa26<sup>CreERT2</sup>, Mx1-Cre, and HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>), we chose HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> because of its preference for labeling HSPCs (immunophenotypically defined as Lin<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup> (LSK)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. To validate the specificity of HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>, we generated mice possessing a single Confetti allele and homozygous HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> alleles. We then examined Confetti expression one day after two-day tamoxifen administration. We observed Confetti expression in the LSK population, consistent with prior reports of HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A</xref>-C). Confetti expression was additionally detected in T cells, NK cells, CD41<sup>+</sup> cells, non-inflammatory monocytes (SSC-A<sup>low</sup>Ly6C<sup>-</sup>Ly6G<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>), common myeloid progenitors (CMP, Lin<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>-</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>CD16/32<sup>-/low</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>), and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP, Lin<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>-</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>CD16/32<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>-G). Considering the relatively shorter lifespan of these cells compared to HSC/MPP, the labeling in these cells should minimally impact precursor calculations, especially with a chase period post-labeling. While the Confetti induction in the relatively long-lived T cells precludes estimation based on mature T cells, we concluded that HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> remained a practical choice for labeling active hematopoietic precursors.</p>

<p>The stability of Confetti labeling after induction is required for binomial distribution. Therefore, the absence of background Cre activity after Confetti induction is critical. We determined the background Cre activity in HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti animals by two approaches: (1) detecting Confetti expression in non-induced animals; (2) identifying cells co-expressing two Confetti FPs months after tamoxifen induction due to cassette “flipping” from background Cre activity. We observed no Confetti-expressing cells without tamoxifen treatment in mice up to 50 weeks old and minimal co-expression of two Confetti FPs in induced HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti animals (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>-B). Conversely, Vav-Cre/Confetti animals constitutively express Cre, resulting in ∼15% cells co-expressing two Confetti colors in peripheral blood (PB) T cells (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>-D). Both pieces of evidence support minimal Cre background activity in HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> and its feasibility to be used as a Cre driver for precursor number calculation.</p>

<title>Variance of FP% inversely correlates with precursor numbers <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To ascertain the inverse correlation between variance of FP% and the number of hematopoietic precursors <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first investigated the variance of FP% in mice hosting various numbers of hematopoietic precursors. We generated these mice by non-competitively transplanting 0.25x10<sup>6</sup> or 4x10<sup>6</sup> induced CD45.2<sup>+</sup> HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti mouse bone marrow (BM) cells into CD45.1<sup>+</sup> recipient mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Given the constant frequency of precursors in the donor BM (1/10<sup>5</sup>) and the varying doses of donor BM cell received, these mice received approximately 2.5 (“low precursor number”) or 40 (“high precursor number”) precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. While similar experiments transplanting defined numbers of precursors have been reported, the estimation for precursor numbers lower than 50 has not been explored.</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of hematopoietic precursors in the BM, the precursor number seeded in recipients followed Poisson distribution instead of being constant, violating premise (1) of binomial distribution. Nonetheless, our simulations showed that the seeding number variation among recipient mice was relatively small, therefore the variance resulting from precursor number differences still dominated and inversely correlated with precursor numbers. A minor problem was that the estimated numbers were not at one-to-one ratio to expected numbers at low precursor number range (&lt;10, see Methods) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>).</p>
<p>As cells were not 100% labeled with Confetti, for clarity, we use “FP<sub>PB</sub>%” or “FP<sub>BM</sub>%” to represent the frequency of a given FP in the PB or BM, and use “FP<sub>Conf</sub>%” to represent the frequency of a given FP in the Confetti<sup>+</sup> population. For total precursor number calculations, we normalized the number calculated from the Confetti-labeled population to Confetti labeling efficiency.</p>
<p>As expected, we observed higher RFP<sub>Conf</sub>% variance across all PB cell types in mice belonging to the “low precursor number” groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). Since variance of any FP following a binomial distribution inversely correlates with precursor numbers, we also observed higher CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% and YFP<sub>Conf</sub>% variance in the “low precursor number” groups (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>-E). Following the same principle, we observed higher RFP<sub>PB</sub>%, CFP<sub>PB</sub>%, YFP<sub>PB</sub>% and Confetti% variance in “low precursor number” mice (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref>).</p>
<p>Applying <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 2</xref>, we found that the precursor numbers of B cells and myeloid cells were noticeably higher in the first two months than at four months post-transplantation, suggesting transient progenitor contribution at early time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). At four months post-transplantation, the estimated precursor numbers aligned with the expected values (in myeloid cells, 94 for “high precursor number” groups, three for “low precursor number” groups, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Again, for any FP following binomial distribution, variance of FP% inversely correlates with precursor numbers and thus can be leveraged to calculate precursor numbers (Methods). Since different FPs measured the same population of precursors, we expected the estimations from different FPs to be similar. Indeed, precursor numbers derived from RFP<sub>Conf</sub>% highly correlated with those estimated from YFP<sub>Conf</sub>% or CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.885 for CFP% in Confetti<sup>+</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.769 for YFP% in Confetti<sup>+</sup>), as well as those from RFP<sub>PB</sub>%, YFP<sub>PB</sub>% and CFP<sub>PB</sub>% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4G</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with PB data, higher variance of RFP<sub>Conf</sub>% was also observed in the BM HSPCs of “low precursor number” mice (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>). The precursor numbers estimated from various HSPC subpopulations aligned well with each other and were consistent within the same group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). However, in “high precursor number” groups, estimates from BM HSPCs were lower than those derived from PB myeloid cells (27 for BM HSPC, 94 for PB myeloid cells, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). This discrepancy may reflect uneven seeding of precursors to the BM throughout the body after transplantation, and the fact that we only sampled a part of the BM (femur, tibia, and pelvis). In summary, we validated the inverse correlation between variance of FP% and precursor numbers <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, the quantification of precursor numbers was feasible even for precursor numbers outside the empirical correlation range.</p>

<title>Cell frequency measurements fail to reflect the differences in precursor numbers</title>
<p>Given that transplantation was performed non-competitively and the recipients were lethally irradiated, we expected to see minimal differences in donor chimerism between two groups, despite drastic differences in donor precursor numbers. Indeed, although we observed substantially lower donor chimerism in mice belonging to “low precursor number” groups during the first two months post-transplantation, the chimerism differences were very small by four months post-transplantation (5.5±2.8%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). The initial differences in donor precursor numbers did not affect PB cell frequencies except for the first month post-transplantation, when higher PB myeloid frequencies was observed in the “low precursor number” groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). This suggests myelopoiesis is preferred when very few precursors are available after irradiation-mediated injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>In BM, nucleated cell counts, donor chimerism and HSPC frequencies were mostly similar regardless of donor precursor numbers, suggesting that even extremely low numbers of hematopoietic precursors can still repopulate effectively a non-competitive environment (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>-D). Therefore, in cases where hematopoietic precursors expand or attrite without competition, stem cell frequencies are less informative to study precursor activity. Measuring precursor numbers is more meaningful as low number of active precursors may be hindered by compensatory proliferation.</p>

<title>Thousands of hematopoietic precursors contribute to native hematopoiesis</title>
<p>While the empirical formula, which measures 50-2500 precursors, supports quantification of precursors labeled at fetal stages, it may not be applicable to measure native hematopoiesis as the total precursor number may exceed 2500. Having validated the feasibility for measuring precursor numbers <italic>in vivo</italic> by Confetti animals, we next sought to investigate the number of active precursors contributing to native hematopoiesis. In HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti animals, we opted to label a smaller portion of HSPCs with two-day treatment despite the potential to label up to 60% HSPCs with Confetti (CFP+YFP+RFP) by 14-day tamoxifen treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref>). This precautionary measure aimed to mitigate potential toxicity arising from prolonged tamoxifen treatment.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, we observed a successive decline of CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% and CFP<sub>PB</sub>% in some animals, which distorted the distribution of CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref> and C). A similar decline was not observed in RFP<sub>Conf</sub>% or YFP<sub>Conf</sub>%, nor the RFP<sub>RPF+YFP</sub>% (calculated by RFP<sub>PB</sub>%/(RFP<sub>PB</sub>%+YFP<sub>PB</sub>%)) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6D</xref> and E). Declining CFP<sub>Conf</sub>% was also not observed in animals where Confetti was induced during fetal development, suggesting a potential immune response to CFP in adult-induced animals (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6F</xref>). Since only ∼2% of myeloid cells were labeled with CFP, we reasoned that the decline of CFP in some animals was unlikely to affect the calculation of total precursor numbers based on other FPs. Therefore, we solely relied on the variance of RFP<sub>RPF+YFP</sub>% for adult precursor calculations. In transplantation studies, precursor numbers calculated with variance of RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>% linearly correlated with those calculated with variance of RFP<sub>Conf</sub>% (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4G</xref>).</p>
<p>To ensure accuracy, we focused on PB myeloid cells, as (1) Confetti labeling of T cells resulted from direct induction by HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>, but not differentiation from HSPCs (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2D</xref>); (2) Confetti labeling (RFP and YFP) of B cells did not plateau at seven months post-induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>); (3) myeloid cells are of shorter lifespan. In myeloid cells, we focused on precursor numbers after four months post-induction, when their labeling reached a plateau (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We also examined average RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Its stability suggested an equal contribution of RFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>+</sup> cells to the PB, a prerequisite for estimating precursor numbers from FP% distributions in the progenies (PB myeloid cells). The average RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>% in BM HSPC subpopulations mirrored those observed in PB, supporting non-biased differentiation of RFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>+</sup> precursor cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Fitting data to <xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation 2</xref>, we estimated an average of 2667 precursors contributing to native myelopoiesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, average of numbers at five to seven months post-induction after myeloid cell labeling plateaued). This number closely aligns with the clone number estimated by transposon-based barcodes and statistic method in granulocytes (831/30% = 2770) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>
<p>The average myeloid precursor number at the time of BM analysis (1958) matched the average precursor number calculated from BM myeloid progenitors (MP, Lin<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>-</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>) and HSPCs (1773 and 1917), but it was five-fold higher than that of LT-HSC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Although LT-HSCs were conventionally believed to sustain steady-state hematopoiesis, recent studies suggest that ST-HSC and MPPs persist long-term and are the primary contributors to adult hematopoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The observed discrepancy between the number of precursors contributing to LT-HSC and those contributing to MPPs indicates that at least some MPPs were not replaced by progenitors directly differentiated from LT-HSC at seven months post-induction, affirming the long life of MPPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, the fact that PB myeloid and BM MP precursor numbers were closer to those of MPPs than LT-HSC confirm active and long-term (at least seven months) contributions from MPPs to steady-state myelopoiesis.</p>
<p>Of note, the quantity of precursor does not necessarily correlate with the frequency of cell type in the BM. For example, the cell frequency of MPP2 (Lineage<sup>-</sup>cKit<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>Flk2<sup>-</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup>CD150<sup>+</sup>) in BM was very low, but MPP2 comprised a modest number of precursors, making its frequency-to-precursor-number ratio the lowest among the HSPC subtypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref> and S6G). The frequency-to-precursor-number ratio reflects how well precursors of a particular type proliferate to expand their absolute cell count. The low frequency-to-precursor-number ratio of MPP2 suggests that it expands more poorly than other HSPC subtypes.</p>
<p>In summary, we detected thousands of hematopoietic precursors contributing to adult hematopoiesis. At the time of BM analysis, the number of PB myeloid precursors was comparable to those observed in BM MP and HSPCs.</p>

<title>Precursor numbers determined by FP% variance confirmed reduced clonality of progenitors after myeloablation</title>
<p>Myeloablation through 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment depletes most actively cycling cells, forcing quiescent stem cells to proliferate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Previous studies have indicated a significant reduction in the number of clones detected within the c-Kit<sup>+</sup> population (consisting of MP and HSPC) of the BM following a single dose of 5-FU treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. However, questions arise regarding whether this observed reduction is an artifact stemming from potential under-sampling of the highly expanded c-Kit<sup>+</sup> population after 5-FU treatment by single-cell sequencing.

<p>To compare the precursor changes post-5-FU treatment, we used the animals described in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> as untreated (UT) benchmark, which were collected at the same age. At ten days post 5-FU injection, the efficacy of 5-FU treatment was validated by lower PB myeloid cell frequency post-treatment and higher frequencies of BM progenitors compared to UT animals (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7A</xref> and B). The high progenitor frequencies in the BM corresponded to the depletion of cycling cells in the BM and the enhanced proliferation of HSPCs following 5-FU treatment.</p>
<p>Compared to UT animals, the precursor numbers of MP (including CMP, GMP, MEP) and HSPC significantly decreased, confirming a reduction in clonality in the c-Kit<sup>+</sup> population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. By contrast, the precursor numbers of LT-HSC did not show a decreasing trend. While transplantation studies supported unchanged clonality of primitive stem cells after a single dose of 5-FU, similar investigation in a native environment has not been assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Our findings support the notion that native LT-HSC clonality remains unaltered following one-dose 5-FU treatment. Together, myeloablation treatment reinforces how the dynamics of precursor numbers can be tracked through assessing Confetti pattern variations.</p>

<title>Active lifelong precursors expand poorly in development ontogeny</title>
<p>HSCs are thought to undergo substantial expansion in the fetal liver during fetal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. However, a recent study employing the empirical formula challenged this notion by quantifying endogenous lifelong hematopoietic precursors labeled at various developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. It revealed limited expansion of hematopoietic precursors during the fetal liver stage (from E10 to E15,1.8-to 2.7-fold) as well as a gradual and moderate increase from the fetal liver to the post-natal stage (2.4-to 10-fold) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Although intriguing, most post-natal measurements in this study fell outside the empirical linear range, leaving the genuine degree of post-natal precursor expansion unknown. As our formula quantitatively assesses a wide range of precursor numbers, we set out to directly compare the numbers of precursor labeled at various development stages (E11.5 and E14.5, by one dose of tamoxifen; adult-stage, benchmark shown in in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, all analyzed at the same age) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>For accuracy, we first examined the dynamics of Confetti labeling. In E14.5-induced animals, the Confetti labeling of T cells almost doubled from one month to four months of age (4.7% at one month, 9.3% at four months), suggesting Confetti<sup>+</sup>-labeled precursors contributed more to post-natal T cell than non-labeled precursors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Therefore, for T cells in E14.5-induced animals, we focused on precursor numbers generated after three months of age. The Confetti labeling for E11.5-induced animals remained stable for all timepoints examined (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7C</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to adult-induction, the distribution of average FP% was stable for fetal-induction, supporting equal proliferation of RFP<sup>+</sup> and YFP<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7D</xref>). Unlike adult-induction, fetal-labeled precursor numbers can be calculated with various combination of FP%, since the expression of CFP introduced at the fetal stages was stable (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6F</xref>). Nonetheless, for consistency, all precursor numbers were calculated with variance of RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>%, the one employed in adult-induction animals.</p>
<p>The resulting precursor numbers estimated for E11.5 and E14.5-labeled cohorts were similar in all PB cell types except at two and three months of age, echoing the previous study reporting limited lifelong precursor expansion in the fetal liver (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Precursor numbers calculated from BM subpopulations were also comparable between the two timepoints (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Although E9.5-labeled clones were reported to seed non-uniformly across bones, the precursor numbers calculated from PB myeloid cells did not significantly differ from those calculated from BM MP and HSPC in E14.5-labeled animals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>].</p>
<p>For comparison between fetal- and adult-induced animals, we focused on PB myeloid cells, as adult-induced animals had non-saturated labeling in B cells and non-HSPC-rooted Confetti labeling in T cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed a relatively small increase of precursor numbers in adult-induced animals in PB and BM compared to those labeled at the fetal stage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E and F</xref>). The increase between E11.5/E14.5- and adult-labeled precursors were less than ten-fold, a level similar to a previous report (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Together, we detected minimal to no expansion of lifelong precursors in the fetal liver stage and minor expansion of expansion of lifelong precursors from fetal liver to adult stage.</p>
<p><italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice have normal quantity of hematopoietic precursors at steady-state</p>
<p>Our approach provided an opportunity to investigate the number of active HSPC precursor in the native environment of genetic mouse models. To showcase precursor quantification in genetic mouse models, we focused on Fanconi Anemia (FA), the most common inherited bone marrow failure syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Current FA mouse models exhibit mostly normal adult hematopoiesis at steady state but demonstrate reduced repopulation ability upon BM transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. It remains unclear if their steady-state blood production is sustained by a reduced number of precursors, predisposing them to repopulation defects after transplantation.</p>
<p>To quantify precursor number in a mouse model of FA, we generated <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice with a single Confetti allele and homozygous HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup> alleles (Fancc<sup>+/+</sup>Confetti<sup>fl/+</sup>HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T/T</sup>, hereafter <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/+</sup>; Fancc<sup>+/-</sup>Confetti<sup>fl/+</sup>HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T/T</sup>, hereafter <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/-</sup>; Fancc<sup>-/-</sup> Confetti<sup>fl/+</sup>HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T/T</sup>, hereafter <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Consistent with previous literature, we observed similar PB cell frequencies and blood counts between <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8A</xref>-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. BM nucleated cell counts, as well as HSPC and MP frequency, were mostly identical, except for ST-HSC frequencies, which were significantly reduced in <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8D</xref>-E).</p>
<p>To label hematopoietic precursors in FA animals, Confetti expression was induced at two months of age, and FP% was monitored over seven months (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The absence of <italic>Fancc</italic> did not affect Confetti labeling efficiency, Confetti labeling dynamics or average FP% (RFP<sub>RFP+YFP</sub>%), suggesting precursor numbers in <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> can be similarly calculated (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure S8F</xref>).

<title>The number of precursors remained unchanged in mice transplanted with young donor cells</title>
<p>While <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have similar number of precursors with their wildtype counterparts at homeostasis, it is unknown whether their reduced repopulation ability post-transplantation stems from diminished precursor numbers, reduced cell expansion, or a combination of both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed competitive transplantation using BM cells from three-month-old Confetti-induced <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/-</sup> or <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice along with CD45.1<sup>+</sup> competitor cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9A</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, recipient mice of <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cells showed significantly lower donor chimerism in the PB and BM compared to those of <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>+/-</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9B</xref>). Despite lower donor chimerism, PB and BM precursor numbers were unaffected in <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> recipient mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9C</xref>-E). This suggests that reduced <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> cell proliferation instead of fewer active precursors was likely to be the cause for the reduced repopulation capacity post-transplantation.</p>
<p>Ageing <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have reduced number of lymphoid hematopoietic precursors upon transplantation</p>
<p>Ageing <italic>Fancc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have been reported to develop hematologic neoplasms, resulting in decreased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. To determine if aging <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells also maintain similar precursor numbers post-transplantation, we competitively transplanted BM cells from nine-month-old Confetti-induced <italic>Fancc<sup>+/+</sup></italic>or <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with CD45.1<sup>+</sup> competitor cells, a stage when aging <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice started to show decreased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9F</xref>).</p>
<p>The diminished repopulation ability of <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells was reaffirmed by lower PB and BM chimerism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9I</xref>). While no differences in precursor numbers were noted during the initial post-transplantation period, a slight yet consistent reduction in lymphoid precursors was observed in <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic>recipient mice at three to five months post-transplantation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9G</xref> and H). Changes in precursor numbers in the BM of KO recipients were less clear as we observed high variance in several HSPC subtypes (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure S9J</xref>). Nonetheless, precursor numbers of MEP, LSK and ST-HSC showed a consistent reduction. In conclusion, aging <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed a modest but consistent loss of active PB lymphoid precursors post-transplantation, implying decreased lymphoid precursors additionally contribute to reduced repopulation capacity as <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice age.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The polyclonal nature of endogenous hematopoiesis imposes methodological problems on a robust dynamic measurement. Inspired by the XCI studies, we successfully employed the correlation formula informed by binominal distribution to quantify precursor number in native hematopoiesis. Using HSC-Scl-CreER<sup>T</sup>/Confetti animals, we estimate thousands of precursors contributing to adult native hematopoiesis, a number comparable to the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. This number resulted from a moderate increase during fetal-to-adult transition and responded dynamically to myeloablation by 5-FU. Applying to a mouse model of inherited bone marrow failure (Fancc<sup>-/-</sup> mice), we detected normal precursor numbers at steady state and decreased lymphoid precursors upon transplantation of aging donors. In sum, the study underscores the flexibility of the approach and the value in analyzing precursor contributions <italic>in situ</italic>.</p>
<p>Although the linear relationship between variance of FP% and precursor numbers has been described, its measurable range was limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Estimates outside this linear range may erroneously fall within it, making it challenging to distinguish accurate measurements within the range from inaccurate ones beyond it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Based on binomial distribution, we expanded the measurable range to encompass the possible dynamic range of hematopoietic precursors in mice, minimizing the likelihood of inaccuracies. Futhermore, the linear correlation based on binomial distribution can accommodate any labeling system that follows the underlying premises, alleviating the need for the intricate Confetti cassette.</p>
<p>Having established a quantitative measurement, we were initially surprised to confirm the moderate number differences between fetal and adult-precursors seen in other report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. The maximum increase observed (seven-fold observed in CMP) was substantially lower than the increase of competitive repopulation units (CRU) from E12 to E16 determined by limited dilution assays (∼38-fold) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), as well as the escalation from immunophenotype-defined HSPC counts (28-to 47-fold, from 3-5x10<sup>3</sup> at E14.5 to 1.4x10<sup>5</sup> at two months old) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. It is possible that we overestimated E11.5 precursors, as the numbers of lifelong E11.5 precursors were substantially higher (on average 753 PB myeloid precursor, 512 HSPC precursors) than the one to two repopulation units estimated with transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Nonetheless, our results were comparable to the ∼870 hematopoietic cluster cells observed at E11.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. On the other hand, we may have underestimated precursor numbers in adult-labeled animals, as most adult HSCs are quiescent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. However, HSC precursor numbers did not increase after induced proliferation by one dose 5-FU treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In sum, our results suggest that the moderate precursor numbers difference between fetal- and adult-stage are likely genuine, emphasizing the analysis of hematopoiesis in a native environment. Future studies using different methods to investigate precursor activity locally is required to validate this result.</p>
<p>Novel methods tracing clones <italic>in situ</italic> offer new opportunities to study native hematopoiesis, yet most are challenging to apply to genetic mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Since only two mouse lines are required (sometimes Cre is already used for conditional deletion of alleles), our approach is more convenient to study hematopoiesis in mouse models of genetic disorders. Applying precursor measurements to <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we observed a minor decrease in precursor numbers after transplantation of aging donors. Although donor chimerism differences had been linked to difference in precursor numbers, reduced proliferation capacity may also contribute to reduced competitive repopulation capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In this case, precursor number analysis is necessary to differentiate these possibilities.</p>
<p>Currently, concerns regarding clonal restriction in the context of FA gene therapy arises, as the engraftment of gene-corrected stem cells has yielded marginal clinical benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. For the first time, we demonstrated that FA cell maintaining a normal precursor quantity post-transplantation, thereby disproving clonal attrition, including putative homing deficits post-transplantation as a cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. However, it is imperative to acknowledge that the majority of murine models of FA, including the <italic>Fancc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> model utilized herein, do not manifest spontaneous bone marrow failure, raising uncertainty regarding the extent to which FA mouse models recapitulate the pathophysiology observed in FA patients. Future investigations in other FA mice and studies leveraging FA patient-derived materials will be pivotal in corroborating and validating the findings presented here.</p>
<p>While we implemented careful data processing procedure, one pitfall of our analyses was that we inferred precursor numbers from their progenies, assuming uniform and linear expansion from precursor to progenies. A recent study has showed non-uniform precursor clone sizes, although the level of non-uniformity is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. In cases where the non-uniformity is high, according to mathematical modeling, we measured the major contributors to hematopoiesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Another potential caveat is that the relative contribution of Confetti-labeled precursors to blood production compared to non-labeled precursors remains unknown. Future studies using different Cre drivers will help validate the precursor numbers for steady-state hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>In summary, we established a wide applicable range of the correlation between variance of FP% and the precursor based on binomial distribution. We discovered thousands of precursors contributing to steady-state adult hematopoiesis and validated that fetal-to-adult precursor expansion were limited. This analysis highlights active precursor number as an important metric in both normal and genetic mouse models.</p>

<title>Derivation of the correlation between variance of confetti fp% and precursor numbers based on binomial distribution</title>
<p>When a random variable adheres to binomial distribution, studies have established that the following equation holds true:

where <italic>n</italic> signifies the number of precursors, <italic>p</italic> represents the probability of an individual being one of the FPs (e.g., RFP), and σ<sup>2</sup> denotes the variance of specific FP% (e.g. σ<sub>RFP</sub>%2)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. In experiments, <italic>p</italic> will be estimated with the average FP% in the Confetti<sup>+</sup> cells (e.g. RFP<sub>mean</sub>%), and σ<sup>2</sup> will be estimated with the variance of FP% among a group of individual or mice (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="587737v1_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). Consequently, the estimation of precursors number n is calculated using the following equation:

<graphic xlink:href="587737v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

<caption><title>Establishing the correlation between variance of FP and precursor numbers.</title>
<p>(A) The correlation between precursor numbers and CVs of individual FP or all CVs (original correlation formula), replotted from Ganuza et al., 2017.</p>
<p>(B) FPmean% in a previously published dataset, replotted from Ganuza et al., 2017.</p>
<p>(C) The correlation between precursor numbers and standard deviation (σ) of individual FP, replotted from Ganuza et al., 2017.</p>
<p>(D) The BFP% in HL-60 mix during two weeks of growth.</p>
<p>(E) The effect of outliers on precursor number estimation. Left, BFP% in samples with/without outliers. Quartiles by Tukey method was shown. The outlier is highlighted by circle. Middle, standard deviation of BFP% with/without outliers. Right, estimated precursor numbers with/without outliers.</p>
<p>(F) The changes of standard deviation when recorded events varied. “&amp;” denotes the potential overestimated standard deviation due to low flow recorded events.</p>
<p>(G) The variance of estimated precursor numbers when varying sample sizes were used.</p>
<p>(H) The relative error of estimation as sample sizes increased. Each dot represents data from one seeded number. Error bars represent mean ± SD.</p>

<p>Previous studies have used a randomly induced label to estimate the number of hematopoietic precursors that contribute to hematopoiesis. In particular, the McKinney-Freeman lab established a measurable range of precursors of 50-2500 cells using random induction of one of the 4 fluorescent proteins (FPs) of a Confetti reporter in the fetal liver to show that hundreds of precursors establish lifelong hematopoiesis. In the presented work, Liu and colleagues aim to extend the measurable range of precursor numbers previously established and enable measurement in a variety of contexts beyond embryonic development. To this end, the authors investigated whether the random induction of a given Confetti FP follows the principles of binomial distribution such that the variance inversely correlates with the precursor number. They tested their hypothesis using a simplified 2-color in vitro system, paying particular attention to minimizing sources of experimental error (elimination of outliers, sample size, events recorded, etc.) that may obscure the measurement of variance. As a result, the data generated are robust and show that the measurable range of precursors can be extended up to 105 cells. They use tamoxifen-inducible Scl-CreER, which is active in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to induce Confetti labeling, and investigated whether they could extend their model to cell numbers below 50 with in vivo transplantation of high versus low numbers of Confetti total bone marrow (BM) cells. The premise of binomial distribution requires that the number of precursors remains constant within a group of mice. The rare frequency of HSPCs in the BM means that the experimentally generated &quot;low&quot; number recipient animals showed some small variability of seeding number, which does not follow the requirement for binomial distribution. While variance due to differences in precursor numbers still dominates, it is unclear how accurate estimated numbers are when precursor numbers are low (&lt;10).</p>
<p>The authors then apply their model to estimate the number of hematopoietic precursors that contribute to hematopoiesis in a variety of contexts including adult steady state, fetal liver, following myeloablation, and a genetic model of Fanconi anemia. Their modeling shows:</p>
<p>-thousands of precursors (~2400-2600) contribute to adult myelopoiesis, which is in line with results from a previous study (Sun et al, 2014).</p>
<p>
-myeloablation (single dose 5-FU), while reducing precursor numbers of myeloid progenitors and HSPCs, was not associated with a reduction in precursor numbers of LT-HSCs.</p>
<p>
-no major expansion of precursor number in the fetal liver derived from labeling at E11.5 versus E14.5, consistent with recent findings from Ganuza et al, 2022.</p>
<p>
-normal precursor numbers in Fancc-/- mice at steady state and from competitive transplantation of young Fancc-/- BM cells, suggesting that reduced Fancc-/- cell proliferation may underlie the reduced chimerism upon transplantation.</p>
<p>
-reduced number of lymphoid precursors following transplantation of BM cells from 9-month-old Fancc-/- animals (beyond this age animals have decreased survival).</p>
<p>Although this system does not permit the tracing of individual clones, the modeling presented allows measurements of clonal activity covering nearly the entire HSPC population (as recently estimated by Cosgrove et al, 2021) and can be applied to a wide range of in vivo contexts with relative ease. The conclusions are generally sound and based on high-quality data. Nevertheless, some results could benefit from further explanation or discussion:</p>
<p>-The estimated number of LT-HSCs that contribute to myelopoiesis is not specifically provided, but from the text, it would be calculated to be 1958/5 = ~391. Data from Busch et al, 2015 suggest that the number of differentiation-active HSCs is 5.2x103, which is considered the maximum limit. There is nevertheless a more than 10-fold difference between these two estimates, and it is unclear how this discrepancy arises.</p>
<p>
-Similarly, in Figure 3E, the estimated number of precursors is highest in MPP4, a population typically associated with lymphoid potential and transient myeloid potential, whereas the numbers of MPP3, traditionally associated with myeloid potential, tend to be higher but are not significantly different than those found in HSCs.</p>
<p>
-The requirement for estimating precursor numbers at stable levels of Confetti labeling is not well explained. As a result, it is unclear how accurate the estimates of B cell precursors upon transplantation of Fancc-/- cells are. In previous experiments on normal Confetti mice (Figure 3B), the authors do not estimate precursors of lymphopoiesis because Confetti labeling of B cells is not saturated, and this appears to be the case in Fanc-/- animals as well (Fig. 5B).</p>
<p>
-Do 9-month-old Fanc-/- animals have reduced lymphoid precursors as well?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Liu et al. uses Confetti labeling of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in situ to infer the clonal dynamics of adult hematopoiesis. The authors apply a new mathematical framework to analyze the data, allowing them to increase the range of applicability of this tool up to tens of thousands of precursors. With this tool, they (1) provide evidence for the large polyclonality of adult hematopoiesis, (2) offer insights on the expansion dynamics in the fetal liver stage, (3) assess the clonal dynamics in a Fanconi anemia model (Fancc), which has engraftment defects during transplantation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, with beautiful and clear figures, and both methods and mathematical models are clear and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Since 2017, Mikel Ganuza and Shannon McKinney-Freeman have been using these Confetti approaches that rely on calculating the variance across independent biological replicates as a way to infer clonal dynamics. This is a powerful tool and it is a pleasure to see it being implemented in more labs around the world. One of the cool novelties of the current manuscript is using a mathematical model (based on a binomial distribution) to avoid directly regressing the Confetti labeling variance with the number of clones (which only has linearity for a small range of clone numbers). As a result, this current manuscript of Liu et al. methodologically extends the usability of the Confetti approach, allowing them more precise and robust quantification.</p>
<p>They then use this model to revisit some questions from various Ganuza et al. papers, validating most of their conclusions. The application to the clonal dynamics of hematopoiesis in a model of Fanconi anemia (Fancc mice) is very much another novel aspect, and shows the surprising result that clonal dynamics are remarkably similar to the wild-type (in spite of the defect that these Fancc HSCs have during engraftment).</p>
<p>
Overall, the manuscript succeeds at what it proposes to do, stretching out the possibilities of this Confetti model, which I believe will be useful for the entire community of stem cell biologists, and possibly make these assays available to other stem cell regenerating systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My main concern with this work is the choice of CreER driver line, which then relates to some of the conclusions made. Scl-CreER succeeds at being as homogenous as possible in labeling HSC/MPPs... however it is clear that it also labels a subcompartment of HSC clones that become dominant with time... This is seen as the percentage of Confetti-recombined cells never ceases to increase during the 9-month chase of labeled cells, suggesting that non-labeled cells are being replaced by labeled cells. The reason why this is important is that then one cannot really make conclusions about the clonal dynamics of the unlabeled cells (e.g. for estimating the total number of clones, etc.).</p>
<p>I am not sure about the claims that the data shows little precursor expansion from E11 to E14. First, these experiments are done with fewer than 5 replicates, and thus they have much higher error, which is particularly concerning for distinguishing differences of such a small number of clones. Second, the authors do see a ~0.5-1 log difference between E11 and E14 (when looking at months 2-3). When looking at months 5+, there is already a clear decline in the total number of clones in both adult-labeled and embryonic-labeled, so these time points are not as good for estimating the embryonic expansion. In any case, the number of precursors at E11 (which in the end defines the degree of expansion) is always overestimated (and thus, the expansion underestimated) due to the effects of lingering tamoxifen after injection (which continues to cause Confetti allele recombination as stem cell divide). Thus, I think these results are still compatible with expansion in the fetal liver (the degree of which still remains uncertain to me).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Liu et al. focus on a mathematical method to quantify active hematopoietic precursors in mice using Confetti reporter mice combined with Cre-lox technology. The paper explores the hematopoietic dynamics in various scenarios, including homeostasis, myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil, Fanconi anemia (FA), and post-transplant environments. The key findings and strengths of the paper include (1) precursor quantification: The study develops a method based on the binomial distribution of fluorescent protein expression to estimate precursor numbers. This method is validated across a wide dynamic range, proving more reliable than previous approaches that suffered from limited range and high variance outside this range; (2) dynamic response analysis: The paper examines how hematopoietic precursors respond to myeloablation and transplantation; (3) application in disease models: The method is applied to the FA mouse model, revealing that these mice maintain normal precursor numbers under steady-state conditions and post-transplantation, which challenges some assumptions about FA pathology. Despite the normal precursor count, a diminished repopulation capability suggests other factors at play, possibly related to cell proliferation or other cellular dysfunctions. In addition, the FA mouse model showed a reduction in active lymphoid precursors post-transplantation, contributing to decreased repopulation capacity as the mice aged. The authors are aware of the limitation of the assumption of uniform expansion. The paper assumes a uniform expansion from active precursor to progenies for quantifying precursor numbers. This assumption may not hold in all biological scenarios, especially in disease states where hematopoietic dynamics can be significantly altered. If non-uniformity is high, this could affect the accuracy of the quantification. Overall, the study underscores the importance of precise quantification of hematopoietic precursors in understanding both normal and pathological states in hematopoiesis, presenting a robust tool that could significantly enhance research in hematopoietic disorders and therapy development. The following concerns should be addressed.</p>
<p>Major Points:</p>
<p>• The authors have shown a wide range of seeded cells (1 to 1e5) (Figure 1D) that follow the linear binomial rule. As the standard deviation converges eventually with more seeded cells, the authors need to address this limitation by seeding the number of cells at which the assumption fails.</p>
<p>
• Line 276: This suggests myelopoiesis is preferred when very few precursors are available after irradiation-mediated injury. Did the authors see more myeloid progenitors at 1 month post-transplantation with low precursor number? The authors need to show this data in a supplement.</p>
<p>Minor Points:</p>
<p>• Please cite a reference for line 40: a rare case where a single HSPC clone supports hematopoiesis.</p>
<p>
• Line 262-263: &quot;This discrepancy may reflect uneven seeding of precursors to the BM throughout the body after transplantation and the fact that we only sampled a part of the BM (femur, tibia, and pelvis).&quot; Consider citing this paper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.09.019">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.09.019</ext-link>) that explores the HSPCs migration across different bones.</p>
<p>
• Lines 299 and 304. Misspellings of RFP.</p>
<p>
• The title is misleading as the paper's main focus is the precursor number estimator using the binomial nature of fluorescent tagging. Using a single-copy cassette of Confetti mice cannot be used to measure clonality.</p>
