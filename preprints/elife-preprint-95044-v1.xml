<title>Abstract</title><p>Microgliosis is an important component of diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation in obesity. A few hours after the introduction of a high-fat diet, the mediobasal hypothalamus resident microglia undergo morphological and functional changes toward an inflammatory phenotype. If the consumption of large amounts of dietary fats persists for long periods, bone marrow- derived myeloid cells are recruited and integrated into a new landscape of hypothalamic microglia. However, it is currently unknown what are the transcriptional signatures and specific functions exerted by either resident or recruited subsets of hypothalamic microglia. Here, the elucidation of the transcriptional signatures revealed that resident microglia undergo only minor changes in response to dietary fats; however, under the consumption of a high-fat diet, there are major transcriptional differences between resident and recruited microglia with a major impact on chemotaxis. In addition, in recruited microglia, there are major transcriptional differences between females and males with an important impact on transcripts involved in neurodegeneration and thermogenesis. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 emerged as one of the components of chemotaxis with the greatest difference between recruited and resident microglia, and thus, was elected for further intervention. The hypothalamic immunoneutralization of CXCL10, one of the ligands for CXCR3, resulted in increased body mass gain and reduced energy expenditure, particularly in females. Furthermore, the chemical inhibition of CXCR3 resulted in a much greater change in phenotype with increased body mass gain, reduced energy expenditure, increased blood leptin, glucose intolerance, and reduced insulin. Thus, this study has elucidated the transcriptional differences between resident and recruited hypothalamic microglia in diet-induced obesity, identifying chemokines as a relevant subset of genes undergoing regulation. In addition, we showed that a subset of recruited microglia expressing CXCR3 has a protective, rather than a detrimental role in the metabolic outcomes promoted by the consumption of a high-fat diet, thus, establishing a new concept in obesity-associated hypothalamic inflammation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity affects over 600 million people worldwide and projections are pessimistic indicating that over a billion people will be diagnosed with obesity by the year 2030 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://worldobesity.org">worldobesity.org</ext-link>). Obesity develops as a consequence of a chronic state of anabolism in which caloric intake overcomes energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Both, experimental and human studies have indicated that, at least in part, the chronic anabolic state leading to obesity develops as a consequence of a defective hypothalamic regulation of whole-body energy balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Experimental studies have shown that the consumption of large amounts of saturated fats triggers an inflammatory response in the hypothalamus affecting the function of key neurons involved in the regulation of food intake, energy expenditure, and systemic metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. In addition, human studies using magnetic resonance imaging have identified hypothalamic gliosis in adults and children with obesity, providing clinical evidence for the existence of an obesity-associated hypothalamic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Microglia are key cellular components of this inflammatory response undergoing structural and functional changes that develop early after the introduction of a high-fat diet (HFD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Distinct strategies used to inhibit hypothalamic microglia resulted in impaired diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation, increased leptin sensitivity, reduced spontaneous caloric intake, and improved systemic glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms involved in the regulation of microglial response to dietary factors may provide an advance in the definition of the pathophysiology of obesity, and potentially identify new targets for interventions aimed at treating obesity and its metabolic comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Resident microglia are derived from the yolk sac primitive hematopoietic cells and populate the neuroepithelium at embryonic day 9.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Under baseline conditions, in the absence of infections, trauma, or other types of potentially harmful stimuli, resident microglia remain rather quiescent; however, under stimulus, they undergo rapid morphological and functional changes aimed at confronting the threat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. In the hypothalamus, differently from most parts of the brain, resident microglia are responsive to fluctuations in the blood levels of nutrients and hormones involved in metabolic control, such as leptin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Thus, a simple meal can promote considerable changes in hypothalamic resident microglia indicating the involvement of these cells in the complex network of cells that regulate whole body metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Under the consumption of a nutritionally balanced diet, meal-induced changes in hypothalamic resident microglia are cyclic and completely reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. However, under consumption of an HFD, microglia present profound changes in morphology and function; moreover, upon prolonged consumption of this type of diet, there is recruitment of bone marrow-derived myeloid cells that will compose a new landscape of hypothalamic microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Despite the considerable advance in the understanding of how hypothalamic microglia are involved in diet-induced obesity (DIO), the transcriptional landscapes of resident and recruited microglia are currently unknown; and, the specific functions of either subset of microglia remain elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we first elucidated the transcriptional differences between resident and recruited hypothalamic microglia in DIO, identifying chemokines as a relevant subset of genes undergoing regulation. Next, we identified a subset of recruited microglia expressing CXCR3, which exerts a protective role against DIO.</p>

<title>Elucidating the transcriptional signatures of hypothalamic resident and recruited microglia in diet-induced obesity</title>
<p>Double reporter mice were obtained by the crossing of CX3CR1<sup>GFP</sup> and CCR2<sup>RFP</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). At the age of 8 weeks, female and male mice were randomly selected for either chow or HFD feeding for 28 days, and then specimens were harvested for analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). In flow cytometry, cells expressing CCR2 could not be detected in the hypothalamus of mice fed on chow (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), whereas in the white adipose tissue, virtually all cells expressing CX3CR1 were also expressing CCR2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Conversely, in both female and male mice fed on HFD, CCR2 cells accounted for approximately 10% of hypothalamic microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Histological analysis confirmed the results obtained by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>); furthermore, it was shown that CD169, which is classically regarded as a marker of bone marrow-derived cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], is expressed both in resident as well as in recruited microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>), confirming data published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Next, to prepare the samples for RNA sequencing, we sorted hypothalamic microglia expressing either CX3CR1 or CCR2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The quality of sorting was confirmed by determining positivity for CX3CR1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>) and CCR2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>), and also by determining the positivity for several markers of resident microglia (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d-2m</xref>) and several markers of bone marrow-derived cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2n-2x</xref>). The elucidation of the transcriptional landscapes of CX3CR1 and CCR2 revealed that either diet or sex exerted only minor differences in the expression of transcripts in CX3CR1 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-3b</xref>); nevertheless, sex exerted major differences in CCR2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-3b</xref>). The direct comparisons between CX3CR1 and CCR2 obtained from mice fed on the HFD revealed the vast differences in the transcriptional landscapes of either female (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>) or male (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) mice. Furthermore, the direct comparisons between female and male mice revealed a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism in the transcriptional landscapes of recruited CCR2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). In CX3CR1 cells, the consumption of the HFD impacted on IL17, lipids, toll-like receptor signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling and chemokines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>); whereas in CCR2 cells, the consumption of the HFD impacted on lipids, toll-like receptor signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling, chemokines, neurotrophins signaling, reactive oxygen species, thermogenesis, and pathways related to neurodegeneration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Next, we asked what functions related to chemotaxis were predominantly regulated in CCR2 cells of mice fed on the HFD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b-4c</xref>). As cell chemotaxis emerged as an important function in both females (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) and males (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), we looked with greater detail into the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Virtually all the transcripts evaluated showed diametrically opposite expression between CX3CR1 and CCR2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>).</p>

<title>Cxcr3 is highly expressed in recruited microglia</title>
<p>As we were particularly interested in identifying factors involved in the recruitment of CCR2 to the hypothalamus, we evaluated cytokine receptors with high expression in CCR2 and low expression in CX3CR1. As depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, Ccr3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>), Ccr7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>), Ccr8 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>), Cxcr2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>), Cxcr3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>), Cxcr4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), Cxcr5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>), Cxcr6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>) and Cxcr7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i</xref>) were all expressed in CCR2 cells and virtually absent from CX3CR1 cells. Cxcr3 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>) and Cxcr6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>) presented the highest expressions, and therefore, we performed a search for previous studies looking at either of these chemokine receptors in the context of DIO hypothalamic inflammation. Using the terms, hypothalamus, hypothalamic, obesity, inflammation, Cxcr3, and Cxcr6, we could find no prior publications. As Cxcr3 is involved in interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], and IFN-γ is expressed in the context of DIO hypothalamic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], we looked into the IFN-γ-related pathways regulated in recruited microglia (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). First, we asked if the canonical ligands for CXCR3, C<italic>XCL9</italic>, CCL10, and CXCL11, were expressed in either CX3CR1 or CCR2 cells. C<italic>XCL11</italic> was not detected in either cell type (not shown). CXCL9 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>) was expressed in CX3CR1 cells, only, whereas CXCL10 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) was expressed in both CX3CR1 and CCR2 cells. In addition, in both female and male mice, Ifng was expressed in CCR2, but not in CX3CR1 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Furthermore, IFN-γ pathways were shown to be modulated in both female (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>) and male (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>) CCR2 cells. Thus, we elected CXCR3 as a target for further intervention.</p>

<title>The immunoneutralization of hypothalamic CXCL10 leads to increased body mass gain in female mice</title>
<p>As an attempt to interfere with CXCR3 actions in CCR2 cells, we targeted one of its ligands, CXCL10. As depicted in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, mice were submitted to two intracerebroventricular (icv) injections of an anti-CXCL10 antibody aimed at immunoneutralizing the target protein in the hypothalamus. As a result of the immunoneutralization of CXCL10, there were smaller numbers of CCR2-positive cells in the hypothalamus of both female and male mice fed on an HFD (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). However, there were no major changes in the numbers of CXCR3-expressing cells in the hypothalamus of either female (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>) or male (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>) mice fed on an HFD. This was accompanied by no changes in the transcript levels of Cxcr3 and several other chemokine-related transcripts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c-7d</xref>), except for a trend to decrease Cxcl11 and an increase of Cxcr4 in females (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>); and a decrease of Cxcl10 and a trend to increase Cx3cl1 in males (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>). Nevertheless, the immunoneutralization of hypothalamic CXCL10 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>) resulted in increased body mass gain (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a-8b</xref>), a trend to reduce blood triglycerides (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8f</xref>), reduced blood cholesterol (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8g</xref>), reduced expression of Agrp transcript in the hypothalamus (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8k</xref>), a trend to reduce blood insulin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8n</xref>), trends to reduce Il1b and Il6 transcripts in the hypothalamus (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8o</xref>), and a trend to reduce respiratory quotient (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8s</xref>) during the dark cycle in female mice. Conversely, in male mice (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>), the inhibition of hypothalamic CXCL10 had only a minor effect, leading to a trend to reduce hypothalamic Npy (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9k</xref>), a trend to reduce hypothalamic Il1b, and a trend to increase hypothalamic Il6 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9o</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we elucidated the transcriptional landscapes of resident and recruited microglia in the hypothalamus of mice. We showed that resident microglia undergo minor transcriptional changes when mice are fed an HFD; however, there are vast differences when confronting resident versus recruited microglia transcriptomes. Moreover, there is a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism in the transcriptomes of recruited microglia in mice fed an HFD. Upon exploration of the differences between resident and recruited microglia, we identified the chemokine receptor Cxcr3 as an interesting candidate for intervention as it was highly expressed in recruited cells. The inhibition of CXCR3 resulted in increased body mass gain, worsening of glucose intolerance, and increased expression of hypothalamic Npy. Thus, the study is the first to identify a subset of recruited microglia that has a protective role against the deleterious outcomes of DIO, therefore establishing a new concept in obesity-associated hypothalamic inflammation.</p>
<p>Early studies in this field have shown that dietary fats, particularly long-chain saturated fatty acids, trigger an inflammatory response in the MBH that emerges a few hours after the introduction of an HFD and progresses to chronicity if the consumption of the HFD persists for long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Microglia play an important role in this inflammatory response, and studies have shown that during a prolonged consumption of an HFD, there is recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to compose a new hypothalamic microglia landscape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, it was previously unknown what are the transcriptional signatures of hypothalamic resident and recruited microglia in DIO.</p>
<p>To elucidate the transcriptional landscapes of resident and recruited microglia, we initially prepared a double reporter mouse for CX3CR1 and CCR2. CX3CR1 encodes for fractalkine receptor and is highly expressed in resident microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. The creation of CX3CR1 reporter mice was regarded as an important step toward the characterization of resident microglia, and several studies in the field employ this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Conversely, CCR2 is expressed only in bone marrow-derived cells and is regarded as a good marker for studying recruited microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. The quality of our model was proven good as makers of resident microglia were present in CX3CR1 cells, only, whereas markers of recruited microglia were present in CCCR2 cells, only. Moreover, as previously described, we could find no CCR2 cells in the hypothalamus of mice fed chow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>].</p>
<p>The first important, and previously unknown finding emerged from the comparison of the transcriptomes of resident microglia in mice fed chow versus mice fed an HFD. In females, there were only 34 transcripts undergoing significant changes between the two dietary conditions, whereas in males, the number was greater, 412, but still quite small considering the whole transcriptome of resident microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. In a study evaluating the single-cell transcriptomics of hypothalamic cells, the consumption of an HFD resulted in minor changes in the so-called macrophage-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]; however, the detailed transcriptional landscape of these cells was not explored in depth, so it is uncertain if it contained both resident and recruited microglia. In an experimental model of Alzheimeŕs disease, which evaluated male and female mice, there were hippocampal resident microglial transcriptional changes of the same magnitude as the one we found in the hypothalamus, affecting approximately 300 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. In an experimental model of cerebral hemorrhage evaluating only males, the impact on microglia transcriptome was also small, affecting only 10% of the evaluated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. In addition, in a study evaluating transcriptional changes of resident microglia during aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], there were also important differences between female and male mice; and, the magnitude of the transcriptional changes occurring during aging was about the same as we see in the dietary intervention. Thus, it seems that in different brain regions and under distinct interventions, the magnitude of resident microglia transcriptional changes is quite small; however, the number of studies evaluating this question is not expressive; thus, further studies are needed to provide a definitive view regarding the actual magnitude of plasticity of resident microglia. Despite the small number of transcripts undergoing changes in our model, the greatest impact occurred in the expression of genes related to IL-17 signaling, lipid metabolism, TLR signaling, TNF signaling, and chemokine signaling, which strongly supports the role of dietary lipids in the induction of an inflammatory response by the resident microglia, supporting previous studies in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Interestingly, IL17 signaling emerged as a major pathway modulated by DIO. In a recent study, we have shown that IL17 can act upon POMC neurons promoting a reduction in calorie intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. The current finding of a transcriptional modulation of IL17-related genes in resident microglia opens a new perspective in the understanding of how inflammatory signals modulate the function of the hypothalamus in obesity, which should be explored in the future.</p>
<p>Next, we confronted the transcriptomes of resident and recruited microglia, and in this case, there were huge differences, reaching over 7,000 transcripts. Per se, this finding reveals a striking difference between resident and recruited microglia in the hypothalamus of mice fed an HFD. Nevertheless, despite this is new information regarding the hypothalamus, similar findings were reported in other brain regions submitted to distinct interventions, such as in an experimental model of glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], in flavivirus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], and in COVID-19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. The evaluation of the main pathways differently expressed in the two cell subsets revealed major differences in lipids, toll-like receptor signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling, chemokines, neurotrophins signaling, reactive oxygen species, thermogenesis, and pathways related to neurodegeneration. The impact of the consumption of an HFD on the regulation of lipid-related pathways, toll-like receptor, and tumor necrosis factor signaling has been widely explored in several previous studies, and interventions in these systems are known to mitigate the harmful effects of the diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, little has been done about the characterization of the mechanisms of chemotaxis that drive the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to the hypothalamus. Therefore, we looked with greater detail into the main chemokines and chemokine receptors differentially expressed in the two subsets of cells. We elected Cxcr3 because it was highly expressed in Ccr2 cells and presented low expression in Cx3cr1 cells. CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor that is involved in the recruitment of distinct types of bone marrow-derived monocytic cells, such as plasmacytoid monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], synovial tissue monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. In the brain, CXCR3-expressing cells have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and other age-dependent cognitive dysfunctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], and stoke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. However, no previous study has evaluated CXCR3 in the hypothalamus in the context of obesity.</p>
<p>First, we asked if the known ligands for CXCR3, and Infg, which is induced in response to the activation of CXCR3, were present in either subset of cells. We found Cxcl11 in neither cell subset; Cxcl9 was expressed in Cx3cl1 cells, only; Cxcl10 was expressed in both subsets of cells, with greater expression in Ccr2 cells; and Infg was expressed in Ccr2 cells only. Moreover, there was a considerable engagement of INF-γ-related pathways in Ccr2 cells of both female and, male mice fed an HFD. Thus, we considered CXCR3 as a promising target for intervention.</p>
<p>Next, we intervened in one of the ligands for CXCR3, CXCL10. For that, we performed icv injections of an immunoneutralizing antibody, which resulted in smaller numbers of CCR2 cells in the hypothalamus. However, the intervention promoted minimal changes in the hypothalamic expression of transcripts encoding several components of the chemotaxis machinery. Nevertheless, in females, the inhibition of CXCL10 resulted in increased body mass gain, reduction of hypothalamic Agrp, trends to reduce hypothalamic Il1b and Il6, and a trend to reduce blood insulin. In males, the phenotype was much milder, leading to minimal changes in hypothalamic Npy, Il1b, and Il6. Little is known about the involvement of CXCL10 in hypothalamic physiology and pathology. In a model of caloric restriction, there was an increase in the hypothalamic expression of Cxcl10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], and this was regarded as a component of the mechanism of neuroprotection induced by caloric restriction. In addition, in a model of hypothalamic inflammation elicited by exogenous LPS, Cxcl10 emerged as one of the transcripts undergoing the greatest increase in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>].</p>
<p>As CXCR3 can be engaged by distinct chemokines, we decided to use a broader intervention, pharmacologically inhibiting CXCR3. AMG487 is a chemical inhibitor of CXCR3 with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 8.0 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Upon treatment with AMG487, there was a reduction of the migration of Ccr2 cells to the hypothalamus, which was accompanied by minimal changes in the expressions of chemokines and chemokine receptors. Under inhibition of CXCR3, both female and male mice presented increased body mass gain, which was accompanied by increased blood leptin, increased fasting glucose, increased hypothalamic Npy, and a reduction in markers of hypothalamic inflammation. There were no changes in caloric intake, however, there were reductions in energy expenditure during some periods during the 24 hours of recording.</p>
<p>These findings reveal that at least one subset of recruited microglia, have a protective rather than a harmful role in DIO-associated hypothalamic inflammation. This is a completely new concept in the field because all previous studies evaluating hypothalamic microglia in DIO reported that, once active in response to dietary fats, either resident or recruited microglia exerted inflammatory actions that impacted negatively energy balance and glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. This concept has been recently explored in depth in a study that used elegant models to either activate or inactivate microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and the results confirm that, whenever manipulating microglia using approaches that are not specific for a given subset of cells, the net result is worsening of the metabolic phenotype when microglia is activated and improvement of the metabolic phenotype when microglia is inactivated. Thus, we believe that the subset of recruited microglia herein identified plays a regulatory role in hypothalamic inflammation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study elucidated the transcriptional landscapes of resident and recruited hypothalamic microglia in DIO. In resident microglia, the consumption of an HFD resulted in small changes in transcript expression, whereas the confrontation of the transcriptional landscapes of resident versus recruited microglia revealed broad differences that encompass lipids, toll-like receptor signaling, tumor necrosis factor signaling, chemokines, neurotrophins signaling, reactive oxygen species, thermogenesis, and pathways related to neurodegeneration. In addition, the study revealed a considerable sexual dimorphism in the transcriptional landscape of both resident and recruited microglia. The study also identified a subset of recruited microglia, expressing the chemokine receptor Cxcr3 that has a protective role against the harmful metabolic effects of the HFD; thus, providing a new concept in DIO-associated hypothalamic inflammation.</p>

Heterozygous CX3CR1<sup>GFP/+</sup>CCR2<sup>RFP/+</sup> mice were generated by mating CX3CR1<sup>GFP</sup> homozygous mice (JAX#005582) with CCR2<sup>RFP</sup> homozygous mice (JAX#017586). Genotypes of these mice were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mice were fed on a standard chow diet (Nuvilab; 3.76 kcal/g; 12.6% energy from protein, 77.7% energy from carbohydrate, and 9.58% energy from fat) or high-fat diet (HFD) (5.28 kcal/g; 12.88% energy from protein, 27.1% energy from carbohydrate, and 60% energy from fat) according to the experimental protocols. Food and water were available ad libitum throughout the experimental periods, except for the protocols that required fasting. The room temperature was controlled (22-24 °C), and a light-dark cycle was maintained on a 12-hour on-off cycle.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>For the separation of CX3CR1<sup>GFP+</sup> and CCR2<sup>RFP+</sup> cells from the white adipose tissue of CX3CR1<sup>GFP/+</sup>CCR2<sup>RFP/+</sup> mice we collected the retroperitoneal fat depot of one animal fed on a HFD for 4 weeks. It was minced and digested with type VIII collagenase (0.5 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 20 min at 37°C with shaking. After digestion, the suspension was filtered using a 100 μm cell filter. For isolation of the same cells from the hypothalamus, samples of five CX3CR1<sup>GFP/+</sup>CCR2<sup>RFP/+</sup> mice fed on an HFD for 4 weeks were pooled together and gently pressed through a cell strainer (100 μm). The cell solution was subjected to a Percoll gradient (70/40%) for monocyte purification. Samples were acquired on a BDFacs Symphony instrument (BD Biosciences, USA) and then analyzed using FlowJo software.</p>

<title>Cell sorting</title>
<p>For cell sorting of CX3CR1<sup>GFP+</sup> and CCR2<sup>RFP+</sup> cells from the hypothalamus, we employed CX3CR1<sup>GFP</sup> mice fed on chow diet and CX3CR1<sup>GFP/+</sup>CCR2<sup>RFP/+</sup> mice fed on HFD for 4 weeks. Harvested hypothalami of 20-30 male or 20-30 female mice were pooled together for each sample and gently pressed through a cell strainer (100 μm). The cell solution was subjected to a Percoll gradient (70/40%) for monocyte purification. The sorting was conducted on a BDFacs Melody instrument (BD Biosciences, USA).</p>

<title>RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and analysis</title>
<p>Cell-sorted CX3CR1 GFP+ and CCR2 RFP+ cell samples from the hypothalamus were lysed for RNA extraction using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Invitrogen). RNA integrity was analyzed on a Bioanalyzer RNA Pico 6000 chip at the Core Facility for Scientific Research – University of São Paulo (CEFAP-USP). Low input RNA-Seq library preparation (Takara SMART-Seq v4) and sequencing by Illumina NovaSeq S2 PE150 Sequencing Lane (40M read pairs/sample avg) were performed by Maryland Genomics (Institute for Genome Sciences - IGS, University of Maryland School of Medicine – Baltimore, USA). Illumina sequencing adapters and low-quality reads were removed with Trimmomatic. Trimmed reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (GRCm39) by STAR. Aligned reads were mapped to features using HTSeq, and differential expression analyses were performed using the DESeq2 package. Genes having less than 3 CPM were excluded prior to statistical analysis, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected using as cutoffs the adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05. Heatmaps were performed using Pheatmap and a list of DEGs was passed to EnrichR and cluster Profiler for enrichment analyses.</p>

<title>CXCL10 immunoneutralization</title>
<p>For central neutralization of CXCL10, 8-wk CCR2<sup>RFP</sup> male and female mice underwent a stereotaxic surgery for ICV injections of anti-CXCL10 Monoclonal Antibody (2 ul, Cat# MA5-23774, Thermo Fischer). The control groups were ICV injected with Mouse IgG2a Isotype Control (2 ul, Cat#02-6200, Thermo Fischer). Two distinct ICV injections were performed on Day 0 and Day 14, respectively, of the experimental protocol. For that, mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) and submitted to stereotaxic surgery (Ultra Precise–model 963, Kopf). ICV coordinates were [antero-posterior/lateral/depth to bregma]: −0.46/−1.0/−2.3 mm. Immediately after the first surgery, at Day 0, mice began to be fed on HFD for 4 weeks. From Day 0 to Day 28 food intake and body weight were evaluated weekly.</p>

<title>CXCR3 antagonism</title>
<p>For systemic blockage of CXCR3, 8-wk CCR2<sup>RFP</sup> male and female mice underwent a treatment with AMG487 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), an active and selective CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) antagonist. The in vivo formulation of AMG487 was prepared in 20% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). A 50% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solution was prepared and AMG487 was added to this solution, it was incubated in a sonicating water bath for 2 hours with occasional vortexing. Next, distilled water was added to give the appropriate final concentration of AMG487 in 20% of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin. This solution at 20% served as the vehicle. Mice were treated with AMG487 or vehicle (VEH group) intraperitoneally at 5 mg/kg every 48h throughout four weeks. During this period, mice were fed on HFD, and food intake and body weight were evaluated weekly.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>On the day 28th of CXCR3 blockage and CXCL10 neutralization experimental protocols, male and female mice were perfused with 0,9% saline followed by 4% formaldehyde by cardiac canulation. Brains were extracted and incubated in 4% formaldehyde overnight at 4 °C for extended fixation. The brains were then incubated in 30% sucrose at 4 °C for 48h. A series of 20 μm-thick frozen sections (4 series equally) were prepared using a cryostat and stored in an anti-freezing solution. For the free-floating immunostaining, slices were washed with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (3 times, 5 min each) and blocked with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% donkey serum in 0.1 M PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Slices were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Anti-Cxcr3 (1:200, Cat# NB100-56404, Novus Biologicals) or Anti-Sialoadhesin/CD169 (1:200, ab18619, Abcam) in a blocking solution. After washing with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (3 times, 5 min each), sections were incubated with fluorophore-labeled secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 405, 1:500, Cat# A48258, Invitrogen or goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 405, 1:500, Cat# A31553, Invitrogen) in a blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. After washing again with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (3 times, 5 min each), brain slices were mounted onto slides with ProLong Diamond antifade mountant (Cat# P36930, Thermo Fischer). Sections were visualized with a Zeiss LSM780, confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany) at the National Institute of Photonics Applied to Cell Biology (INFABIC) at the University of Campinas.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present work from Velloso and collaborators investigated the transcription profiles of resident and recruited hypothalamic microglia. They found sex-dependent differences between males and females and identified the protective role of chemokine receptor CXCR3 against diet-induced obesity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Novelty</p>
<p>
(2) Relevance, since this work provides evidence about a subset of recruited microglia that has a protective effect against DIO. This provides a new concept in hypothalamic inflammation and obesity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of mechanistic insight into the sex-dependent effects.</p>
<p>
(2) Analysis of indirect calorimetry data requires more depth.</p>
<p>
(3) A deeper analysis of hypothalamic inflammation and ER stress pathways would strengthen the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Mendes et al provides novel key insights into the role of chemotaxis and immune cell recruitment into the hypothalamus in the development of diet-induced obesity. Specifically, the authors reveal that although transcriptional changes in hypothalamic resident microglia following exposure to high-fat feeding are minor, there are compelling transcriptomic differences between resident microglia and microglia recruited to the hypothalamus, and these are sexually dimorphic. Using independent loss-of-function studies, the authors also demonstrate an important role of CXCR3 and hypothalamic CXCL10 in the hypothalamic recruitment of CCR2+ positive cells on metabolism following exposure to high-fat diet-feeding in mice. This manuscript puts forth conceptually novel evidence that inhibition of chemotaxis-mediated immune cell recruitment accelerates body weight gain in high-fat diet-feeding, suggesting that a subset of microglia that express CXCR3 may confer protective, anti-obesogenic effects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The work is exciting and relevant given the prevalence of obesity and the consequences of inflammation in the brain on perturbations of energy metabolism and ensuant metabolic diseases. Hypothalamic inflammation is associated with disrupted energy balance, and activated microglia within the hypothalamus resulting from excessive caloric intake and saturated fatty acids are often thought to be mediators of impairment of hypothalamic regulation of metabolism. The present work reports a novel notion in which immune cells recruited into the hypothalamus that express chemokine receptor CXCR3 may have a protective role against diet-induced obesity. In vivo studies reported herein demonstrate that inhibition of CXCR3 exacerbates high-fat diet-induced body weight gain, increases circulating triglycerides and fasting glucose levels, worsens glucose tolerance, and increases the expression of orexigenic neuropeptides, at least in female mice.</p>
<p>This work provides a highly interesting and needed overview of preclinical and clinical brain inflammation, which is relevant to readers with an interest in metabolism and immunometabolism in the context of obesity.</p>
<p>Using flow cytometry, cell sorting, and transcriptomics including RNA-sequencing, the manuscript provides novel insights into transcriptional landscapes of resident and recruited microglia in the hypothalamus. Importantly, sex differences are investigated.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript is perceived to be highly interesting, relevant, and timely. The discussion is thoughtful, well-articulated, and a pleasure to read and felt to be of interest to a broad audience.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There were no major weaknesses perceived. Some comments for potential textual additions to the results/discussion are listed in recommendations to authors.</p>
