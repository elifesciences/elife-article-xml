<title>Abstract</title><p>The legume-rhizobium symbiosis represents a unique and beneficial interaction between legumes and nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, called rhizobia. The initiation and development of this symbiosis is complex and begins with recognition of key molecular signals, produced by the plant and its symbiont, which determine symbiotic compatibility. Current data suggest that the invading symbiont initially triggers plant immune responses that are subsequently suppressed. Hence, there is growing evidence that features of plant immunity may be relevant to symbiotic establishment. RIN4 is a key immune regulator in plants, regulating basal immunity and it is also targeted by pathogen effector proteins that either confer susceptibility or resistance, depending on the presence of the appropriate resistance protein. Surprisingly, we found that RIN4 was rapidly phosphorylated upon rhizobial inoculation of soybean root hairs. RNAi silencing and mutant studies indicate that RIN4 expression is essential for effective nodulation of soybean. RIN4 phosphorylation occurs within a fifteen amino acid motif, which is highly conserved within the Fabales (legumes) and Rosales orders, that comprise species capable of nitrogen-fixing endosymbiosis with rhizobia. RIN4 proteins mutated in this conserved phosphorylation site failed to support efficient soybean nodulation. Phosphorylation of this site is mediated by the symbiotic receptor-like kinase, SymRK, a well-studied member of the symbiotic signaling pathway. The data implicate RIN4 phosphorylation as a key mediator of rhizobial compatibility, interconnecting symbiotic and immune signaling pathways.</p>

<title>Significance</title>
<p>The nitrogen fixing legume-rhizobium symbiosis is a cornerstone of sustainable agriculture, with ongoing efforts to transfer this unique ability to non-leguminous crop plants. Plants are surrounded by a myriad of microbes in the soil, and, therefore, require constant surveillance in order to distinguish between a pathogen or symbiont. Plants monitor for specific molecular signals that indicate pathogen or symbiont presence. We show that RIN4, a key immune regulator, plays an essential role in promoting the development of the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing relationship between soybean and its compatible symbiont <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</italic>. Therefore, RIN4 is likely a key player in mediating the appropriate response upon infection by friend or foe.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>At the very beginning of the symbiotic signaling pathway, there are three receptor-like kinases (RLKs) that are indispensable for the initiation of two developmental processes: bacterial infection and nodule organogenesis. Bacterial infection occurs primarily via an infection thread (IT) developed within the infected root hair. IT delivers rhizobia into the underlaying newly divided cortical cells forming the nodule primordium, which occurs in parallel with bacterial infection. Underneath the infection site, the nodule primordium develops into a new organ, the nodule, where the rhizobia are accommodated and convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. As a result, a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis will develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In legumes with determinate nodules, such as soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) and <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>, two Lysin (LysM)-domain containing RLKs, Nodulation Factor Receptor 1 and 5 (NFR1 and NFR5) perceive the rhizobial lipo-chitooligosaccharide nodulation factor (NF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Rhizobia produce NF in response to flavonoids secreted by the host legume. Lotus or soybean mutants lacking NFR1 and/or NFR5 do not respond to rhizobial inoculation and do not form nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). A third RLK, containing extracellular leucine-rich repeats, is located downstream of the NF receptors, called Symbiosis Receptor Kinase (SymRK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Root hairs of Lotus <italic>symrk</italic> mutant plants (cac41.5 insertion mutant) do not curl and bacterial infection cannot occur despite displaying root hair deformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). <italic>symrk-10</italic>, a Lotus mutant carrying a point mutation in the activation loop of the kinase domain, abolishing kinase activity, displays a similar phenotype as the insertion mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), underpinning the importance of phosphorylation in the symbiotic signaling cascade.</p>
<p>Studies using Lotus showed that SymRK interacts strongly with NFR5 and weakly with NFR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). It was shown that autophosphorylation of NFR1 is essential for downstream signaling. NFR5 lacks kinase activity and is trans-phosphorylated by NFR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), and by a third LysM-containing RLK, NFRe (epidermal), enhancing the robustness of NF-signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Transducers of RLK-induced signaling are receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs), a NFR5-interacting cytoplasmic kinase 4 (NiCK4) was shown to be an important link between NF perception by NFR5 and nodule organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Briefly, downstream components of the pathway are a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinase, CCaMK which phosphorylates CYCLOPS, a DNA-binding transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The CCaMK/CYCLOPS complex controls bacterial infection as well as nodule organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), forming a regulatory unit with other transcriptional regulators and activates NODULE INCEPTION (NIN), a nodulation-specific transcription factor. NIN is involved in root hair and epidermal as well as cortical cell responses, the latter leading to nodule development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the importance of phosphorylation in the symbiotic signaling cascade, it is not surprising that phosphoproteomic studies have been reported for a variety of legumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). The primary entry point for rhizobium in the case of <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, and <italic>G. max</italic> is the root hair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). However, only a small fraction of the root hairs on a given root are infected and even fewer infections lead to nodule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Hence, phosphoproteomic studies using entire roots, such as conducted with <italic>L. japonicus</italic> and <italic>M. truncatula,</italic> likely suffer from signal dilution due to the highly localized nature of rhizobial infection. Therefore, we previously performed phosphoproteomic studies of isolated soybean root hair cells (separated from the root), in order to reduce signal dilution due to non-responding root tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Indeed, this study identified a variety of proteins that were rapidly (one-hour post-inoculation) phosphorylated upon treatment with the compatible symbiont, <italic>Bradyrhizobium japonicum.</italic> To our surprise, among these proteins was the plant immune regulator RPM1-INteracting protein 4 (RIN4; 16).</p>
<p>RIN4 was discovered in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> as an interactor of RPM1, a disease resistance protein conferring resistance against the bacterial leaf pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). RIN4 is conserved among land plants and is involved in the regulation of Pattern Triggered Immunity (PTI). Given RIN4’s regulatory function in PTI, it is not surprising that the protein is targeted by several effector proteins released by pathogens to interfere and modulate plant immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). RIN4 undergoes post-translational modifications (PTM) or proteolytic cleavage as a consequence of being targeted by <italic>P. syringae</italic> effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). RIN4 modifications trigger a second layer of immune responses triggered by resistance (R) proteins, intracellular immune receptors (nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptor or NLRs) which monitor perturbations within the host cell leading to NLR-triggered immunity (NTI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). RIN4 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). IDPs lack stable secondary and tertiary protein structure and can transition from disorder to order upon interactions with other protein(s) or upon PTMs like phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Lee and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) demonstrated that phosphorylated RIN4 is more flexible than native RIN4 contributing to its conformational flexibility and function.</p>
<p><italic>P. syringae</italic> effector proteins AvrB and AvrRpm1 induce RIN4 phosphorylation, suppressing PTI responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Phosphorylation of AtRIN4 at serine 141 is triggered upon bacterial flagellin treatment (i.e., flagellin epitope, flg22). Phosphorylation of this site is the target of AvrB and consequently induces phosphorylation of the evolutionary conserved threonine 166. Increased T166 phosphorylation suppresses S141 induced PTI responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). It was shown that AvrRpm1 ADP-ribosylates Arabidopsis as well as soybean RIN4, and this ADP-ribosylation is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation of the T166 phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). AvrB-induced T166 phosphorylation is mediated by an RLCK, RIPK. However, in an Arabidopsis <italic>ripk</italic> mutant background, RIN4 phosphorylation in response to AvrB is decreased and not abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Furthermore, Xu and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) showed that several other RLCKs were able to phosphorylate RIN4. Hence, the relative phosphorylation of S141 and T166 determines the plant response to pathogen effector proteins and subsequent disease progression.</p>
<p>Although RIN4 plays an essential role in pathogen virulence and host immunity, the details of RIN4 molecular function are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). It should be noted that virtually all the studies on RIN4 have used leaves, the natural infection route for <italic>P. syringae</italic>.</p>
<p>The <italic>A. thaliana</italic> genome encodes a single <italic>RIN4</italic> gene. In contrast, the soybean genome encodes four <italic>RIN4</italic> (<italic>GmRIN4a-d</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In soybean, RPG1-B (resistance to <italic>Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea</italic>) R protein conveys resistance to <italic>P. syringae</italic> expressing AvrB. Both GmRIN4a and GmRIN4b were shown to associate with AvrB, but only GmRIN4b interacts with RPG1-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). These data and the above mentioned AvrRpm1-mediated ADP-ribosylation of both At and GmRIN4 suggest that, at least in leaves, the GmRIN4 proteins play a role in plant immunity similar to that defined by detailed studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>.</p>
<p>In the work described here, we demonstrate that soybean RIN4 (GmRIN4, hereafter RIN4) protein(s) are essential for efficient nodulation of soybean. This function of RIN4 is mediated by specific phosphorylation of serine 143, which is located within a 15 amino acid (aa) motif. These 15 aa are absent in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and seem to be highly conserved within the Fabales and Rosales plant orders, therefore suggesting a symbiosis-related function. Phosphorylation of S143 is mediated by GmSymRKβ. We found that <italic>RIN4a</italic> and <italic>RIN4b</italic> are highly expressed in root hair cells and that their expression level does not change upon rhizobial treatment. A soybean mutant line, in which <italic>RIN4b</italic> was mutated using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene editing, led to a significant reduction in nodulation concomitant with the reduction in the expression of downstream components of the symbiosis signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>

<title>Soybean RIN4 proteins harbor a highly conserved and a novel-RIN4-motif</title>
<p>A key, unifying feature of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is the formation of nodules where the bacteria are accommodated inside living plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The symbiosis is restricted to one phylogenetic clade containing four orders: Fabales (legumes), Fagales, Cucurbitales and Rosales (FaFaCuRo). Within this clade, there are 10 families out of the 28 that contain species which form nitrogen-fixing root nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Legumes and the non-legume <italic>Parasponia andersonii</italic> (Rosales) form symbiosis with rhizobia. Actinobacteria, <italic>Frankia</italic>, interact with species from Rosales, Fagales and Cucurbitales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), which also leads to intracellular symbiotic nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>We built a phylogenetic tree (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) of 149 RIN4 sequences derived from 66 species of the FaFaCuRo clade and species outside of the clade (Materials and Methods and SI Appendix, <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). The tree contains sequences from both nodulating and non-nodulating species of Fabales, Rosales, Fagales and Cucurbitales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), as well as from species outside of the clade. This analysis identified a specific clade of RIN4 proteins (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). Two subclades were apparent: one of them comprised of sequences from Fabales (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, blue highlighted), the other contains sequences from Rosales (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>, green highlighted). Within the sequences forming these two apparent subclades, we discovered a 15 amino acid motif, defined by a “GRDSP” core sequence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, red box), suggesting a nodulation related function. We named it a novel-RIN4-motif (NRM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, red box). In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, the alignment shows RIN4 protein sequences from model legume species such as <italic>G. max</italic>, <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, <italic>L. japonicus</italic> and <italic>M. truncatula</italic> aligned with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RIN4, and nodulating non-legume <italic>P. andersonii</italic> and its non-nodulating relative <italic>Trema orientale</italic> from Rosales. The sequence is absent in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RIN4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, red box) as well as in other non-FaFaCuRo species we used when building the phylogenetic tree. This motif is highly conserved among RIN4 proteins from nodulating and non-nodulating species of Fabales as well as Rosales. Interestingly, the motif is not conserved in RIN4 sequences derived from Fagales and Cucurbitales (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="table">Fig S2</xref>). However, the motif is retained in non-nodulating Fabales (such as <italic>C. canadensis</italic>, <italic>N. schottii</italic>; SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>) and Rosales species as well. NRM harbors the soybean RIN4 phosphorylation site, serine 143 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) identified in our previous study of soybean root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). S143 is localized within the “GRDSP” core motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, red arrow), and is highly conserved across Fabales and Rosales.</p>

Tree was rooted using <italic>A. thaliana</italic> RIN4 (At3g25070). (B) Novel-RIN4-motif within RIN4 protein sequences (red box). One of the identified phosphorylation sites, S143 is located within this motif (red arrow) within a “GRDSP” core sequence that is highly conserved among legume species and species of Rosales. Here, we show the sequence alignment of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RIN4 with soybean (Gma), <italic>L. japonicus</italic> (Lj), <italic>M. truncatula</italic> (Mtr), <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> (Pvul) and nodulating non-legume <italic>P. andersonii</italic> (Pan) and its non-nodulating relative <italic>T. orientale</italic> (Tor) RIN4 proteins. Grey underline indicates Nitrate-induced domain (NOI). Red underline indicates motif for proteolytic cleavage targeted by pathogenic effector proteins, while blue line shows cleavage site. The characteristic feature of the NOI-domain is that it harbors the PXFGXW motif which is target site for effector protein. Tryptophan (W) is a crucial residue within the motif. RIN4c and RIN4d is missing W (blue arrow), and SMART analysis also predicted only one Pfam: AvrPt2 cleavage site.</p></caption>

AvrRpt2 bacterial effector targeted cleavage sites are located within these motifs (35, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, red underline). Our <italic>in-silico</italic> analysis found that all four soybean RIN4 proteins contain 2 NOI domains, whereas the AvrRpt2 cleavage site is absent in RIN4c and RIN4d N-terminal NOI domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, blue arrow). This observation is based on sequence alignment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and prediction using the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART).</p>
<p>Root hairs are the primary entry point for rhizobial infection in most legumes. We wanted to narrow the number of study subjects and, therefore, looked at the gene expression level of <italic>RIN4</italic> genes in soybean root hairs and roots using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. <italic>RIN4a</italic> and <italic>RIN4b</italic> showed much higher expression in root hairs than <italic>RIN4c</italic>, <italic>RIN4d</italic> and a <italic>RIN4-like</italic> gene (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). <italic>RIN4</italic> transcripts levels were not induced upon rhizobial inoculation (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>), suggesting that the protein is regulated post-translationally, as was previously observed in other studies. In stripped roots (roots with root hairs removed), all <italic>RIN4</italic> genes displayed lower expression in comparison to root hairs, and none were up-regulated upon rhizobial treatment (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>). These results are consistent with <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> RNA-seq data revealing that <italic>AtRIN4</italic> is one of the most abundant transcripts in root hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Given that plant roots are constantly surrounded with microbes in the rhizosphere, it is not surprising that such a key immune regulator as RIN4 is being expressed and maintained at a high level. Our gene expression data were confirmed by Western-blot analysis using total protein extracted from root hairs and stripped roots (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>). RIN4 was detected using custom specific anti-RIN4 antibody generated against a mixture of RIN4a and RIN4b recombinantly expressed proteins. Anti-RIN4 antibody was tested using His-epitope tagged RIN4a, RIN4b, RIN4c and RIN4d recombinantly expressed and purified proteins. The RIN4 antibody recognizes only RIN4a and RIN4b, and not RIN4c and RIN4d (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>).</p>
<p>RIN4a and RIN4b share 93% identity on an amino acid level, whilst RIN4a/b share 64% identity with RIN4c and 62% identity with RIN4d on an amino acid level. RIN4c and RIN4d displayed lower expression in root hairs and roots compared to RIN4a and RIN4b (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Furthermore, it was previously shown that only <italic>RIN4b</italic> complements <italic>AtRIN4</italic> in an <italic>Arabidopsis rin4</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Therefore, we focused our attention on RIN4a and RIN4b in this study.</p>

<p>Relatively few soybean mutants are available and, therefore, we searched for <italic>rin4</italic> mutants in the model legume <italic>L. japonicus,</italic> which forms determinate nodules, as does soybean. In <italic>L. japonicus,</italic> we could identify only one <italic>RIN4</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). From the <italic>L. japonicus</italic> LORE1 mutant population database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://lotus.au.dk/">https://lotus.au.dk/</ext-link>; 37, 38), we ordered two lines with exogenic LORE1 insertions in the <italic>RIN4</italic> gene locus (Plant ID 30000711, 30019656). Genotyping of the two exogenic lines did not reveal homozygous individuals (SI Appendix, <xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>), suggesting that <italic>RIN4</italic> homozygous mutation might be lethal in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, as is the case in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to assess the role of <italic>RIN4</italic> genes during the legume-rhizobium symbiosis, we targeted <italic>RIN4a</italic> and <italic>RIN4b</italic> by RNAi-mediated gene silencing. <italic>RIN4a</italic> and <italic>RIN4b</italic>-RNAi constructs were introduced into soybean roots via Agrobacterium-mediated hairy root transformation.

(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Based on the qRT-PCR data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), the transcript levels of both genes were significantly reduced, but not abolished, suggesting that both genes contribute to the formation of the symbiosis. Transcripts of the two genes are 92% identical, explaining the reduction in both transcripts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Because of the high-level identity of the two genes, it was very challenging to silence each gene separately.</p>

<p>To further confirm that soybean <italic>RIN4a</italic> and <italic>RIN4b</italic> play a role in formation of the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, we targeted both genes using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology to generate stable knock-out mutants. A CRISPR/Cas9 edited soybean knock-out line was obtained only in <italic>RIN4b</italic> in the Bert cultivar background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). This line contains a two base pair deletion within the second exon of the gene that results in a pre-mature stop codon leading to reduced RIN4 protein abundance and significantly reduced <italic>RIN4b</italic> mRNA levels (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).

<title>A novel phosphorylation site, S143, contributes to symbiotic function</title>
<p>In our previous phosphoproteomic study, we found that RIN4 protein(s) phosphorylation occurred one-hour post-inoculation (hpi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). One of the identified phosphorylation sites is S143 (SI Appendix <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). Intriguingly, S143 is harbored within the highly conserved “GRDSP” core motif located in the NRM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, red arrow). The NRM is 100% identical between RIN4a and RIN4b (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Given that the phosphorylation site is located within the NRM, we decided to further investigate the function of the S143 phosphorylation site. A pS143-specific peptide antibody was generated to detect phosphorylation (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>). We treated three-day old soybean seedlings with mock (H<sub>2</sub>O) and wild-type <italic>B. japonicum</italic>, to confirm the phosphorylation previously observed. Root hairs (RH) were harvested 1 hpi separately from root tissue. AtRIN4 displays a basal phosphorylation level in mock-treated plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>); therefore, it is not surprising that our pS143 specific antibody shows RIN4 phosphorylation in mock-treated RH (SI Appendix <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>). ImageJ quantification of phosphorylation showed a 2-fold upregulation in response to <italic>B. japonicum</italic> when compared to mock-treated RH (SI Appendix <xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the function of the newly identified S143 phosphorylation site in relation to the symbiosis, we introduced point mutation(s) by site-directed mutagenesis and generated RIN4a<sup>S143A</sup> and RIN4b<sup>S143A</sup> mutated proteins that cannot be phosphorylated at S143. Aspartic acid (D) was introduced to mimic the phosphorylation status and phospho-mimic mutant versions (RIN4a<sup>S143D</sup> and RIN4b<sup>S143D</sup>) were created. RIN4a and RIN4b were N-terminally tagged with HA-epitope to detect the presence of the introduced mutant and native versions of the protein in soybean transgenic roots. Interestingly, ectopic expression of RIN4a<sup>S143A</sup> and RIN4b<sup>S143A</sup> mutant proteins led to significantly reduced nodule numbers on transgenic roots in comparison to roots expressing wild-type RIN4b and empty vector control, whereas expression of RIN4a<sup>S143D</sup> and RIN4b<sup>S143D</sup> did not affect nodule numbers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). These results suggest that phosphorylation at the S143 site in RIN4a and RIN4b is required for efficient symbiosis formation. In order to verify protein expression in transgenic roots, Western-blot analysis was performed on total protein extracts from transgenic roots. All constructs displayed two protein bands (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated versions) at the expected size (around 30 kDa) showing that the introduced versions of RIN4a and RIN4b were expressed (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>), contributing to the observed phenotype.</p>

<p>Complementation of the <italic>rin4b</italic>-CRISPR/Cas9 mutant was carried out by introducing either RIN4b, RIN4b<sup>S143A</sup>, RIN4b<sup>S143D</sup> or empty vector (control) via Agrobacterium-mediated hairy root transformation into soybean transgenic roots induced on <italic>rin4b</italic> mutant plants. This experiment confirmed that RIN4bS143 is critical for RIN4b symbiotic function, as the phosphor-negative mutant version (RIN4b<sup>S143A</sup>) of the protein, similar to the empty vector, was unable to rescue the nodulation phenotype observed on the mutant plants (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A</xref> and <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">B</xref>).

<title>RIN4a and RIN4b closely associate with symbiotic receptor-like kinases NFR1α and SymRKß <italic>in planta</italic></title>
<p>There are two active kinases required for early signal transduction during legume symbiosis development, NFR1 and SYMRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). In soybean, both NFR1 and SymRK are present in two copies (NFR1α/β and SymRKα/β; 5, 7). Ectopic, over-expression of NFR1α led to increased nodule numbers on transgenic roots, whereas this phenotype was not observed when NFR1β was over-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). RNAi-mediated gene silencing was performed on both soybean <italic>SymRK</italic> genes. Silencing of <italic>SymRKβ</italic> showed a stronger phenotype suggesting that this protein has the major function in nodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Since NFR1α and SymRKβ seem to be the major players in soybean, we decided to investigate the interaction of RIN4a and RIN4b only with NFR1α and SymRKβ and not their homologs (NFR1β and SymRKα). Previously it was shown that SymRK in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> undergoes proteolytic cleavage, when the Malectin-like domain (MLD) within the protein’s extracellular region is cleaved off creating SymRKΔMLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). We expressed both full-length (FL) SymRKß and SymRKßΔMLD in tobacco leaves, which revealed that ΔMLD was more easily detected. Therefore, for future experiments we used the SymRKßΔMLD construct, instead of SymRKß-FL. In the <italic>in planta</italic> Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation assay (BiFC), RIN4a and RIN4b showed interaction with each other as previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and were used as a positive control for the assay (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8A</xref>). Co-expression of RIN4a and b with SymRKßΔMLD and NFR1α resulted in YFP fluorescence detected by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>) suggesting that RIN4a and b proteins closely associate with both RLKs. While no interaction could be observed between RIN4a/b and the P2K1 receptor, which was used as negative control in the BiFC assay (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref> D and G). The reconstituted YFP signal localizes to the plasma membrane (PM) in accordance with earlier observations where the investigated proteins were localized to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). PM was visualized by application of a membrane staining dye, FM4-64 (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>). The interaction between RIN4a/b and NFR1α and SymRKßΔMLD was confirmed in a Split-Luciferase Complementation assay (SI appendix, <xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>), when the proteins were fused to the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of the Luciferase enzyme, which upon reconstitution results in bioluminescence.</p>

<title>SymRKβ phosphorylates the nodulation-related S143 phospho-site <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in planta</italic></title>
<p>The kinase activity of soybean NFR1α was demonstrated by Choudhury and Pandey (2015, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Here, we show that soybean SymRKβ possesses an active kinase domain (SymRKß-KD, SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>). The isolated soybean SymRKβ-KD showed strong autophosphorylation activity, as well as the ability to trans-phosphorylate MBP, a universal substrate (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>). Furthermore, to confirm that phosphorylation was triggered by SymRKβ-KD, we introduced a point mutation in the same position as previously described by Yoshida and Parniske (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>) for the <italic>L. japonicus</italic> SymRK kinase domain. Specifically, D734N (which corresponds to D738 in LjSymRK) was introduced, in the activation loop, and led to inactivation of the SymRKβ kinase activity (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>).</p>
<p>Both NFR1α and SymRKβ kinase domains phosphorylated RIN4a and RIN4b <italic>in vitro</italic> when radioactive [γ-32P] ATP was used to visualize the phosphorylation (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref> A).</p>
<p>In order to ascertain which of these two kinases phosphorylates the nodulation-related RIN4S143, we performed mass spectrometry-based Absolute Quantification (AQUA), a method that uses stable-isotope labeled peptides as internal standards to quantify proteins or post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). The abundance of the heavy-labeled peptides and their corresponding endogenous peptides (peptides derived from native RIN4a and b) can be quantified using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MS-SRM). In our phosphoproteomic study of soybean root hairs, we also observed phosphorylation of RIN4T173 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) which corresponds to the earlier published AtRIN4S141 triggered by bacterial flagellum epitope, flg22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Heavy-labeled AQUA peptides were generated against native peptides carrying S143 and T173 (to serve as a control), as well as phosphorylated versions of the peptides (SI Appendix, <xref rid="tblS3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> kinase assay was performed in the absence and presence of ATP (the donor of phosphate group), and MS-SRM was carried out to quantify phosphorylation levels of RIN4a<sup>S143</sup>, RIN4b<sup>S143</sup>, RIN4a<sup>T173</sup> and RIN4b<sup>T173</sup>. The nodulation-related S143 site was phosphorylated only by SymRKβ in the presence of ATP in RIN4a, as well as in RIN4b (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref> B), whereas phosphorylation of RIN4a<sup>T173</sup> and RIN4b<sup>T173</sup> was not detected (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref> B). No phosphorylation of RIN4a<sup>S143</sup>, RIN4b<sup>S143</sup>, RIN4a<sup>T173</sup> and RIN4b<sup>T173</sup> was observed when the proteins were co-incubated with NFR1α-KD (SI Appendix, <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref> B). Calibration curves for both S143 and T173 peptides were established (SI Appendix <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12</xref> A, C, E and G), as well as correlation coefficients were determined (SI Appendix <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12</xref> B, D, F and H). Peptides in both proteins were detected at a similar level when equal amounts were injected into the mass spectrometer (SI Appendix <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12</xref>).</p>
<p>To further assess RIN4a and RIN4b phosphorylation by SymRKβ in an <italic>in planta</italic> environment, the proteins were co-expressed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. Given that AtRIN4 lacks not only the S143 phosphorylation site but also the motif that carries this phosphorylation site, it provided clear evidence about the phosphorylation status of the protein induced by SymRKβ. RIN4a and RIN4b phosphorylation by wild-type SymRKβΔMLD is demonstrated on <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. SymRKβΔMLD kinase inactive version does not phosphorylate either RIN4a or Rin4b. Furthermore, it is also shown that phosphor-minus versions RIN4aS143A and RIN4bS143A do not display a phosphorylated band (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), supporting the specificity of the α-pS143 phosphor-specific peptide antibody.</p>

Both root epidermal and cortical signaling leads to activation of <italic>NIN</italic>. NIN contributes to bacterial infection in root hairs, to epidermal responses and cortical cell division leading to nodule organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).

While it was shown that both <italic>GmERN1a</italic> and <italic>GmERN1b</italic> responded to rhizobial inoculation, in our hands only <italic>ERN1a</italic> could be amplified.

<p>Expression of transcription factors (TF) involved in the symbiotic signaling pathway was investigated in <italic>rin4b</italic> mutant background by qRT-PCR. Induction of the closest homolog of nodulation-specific transcription factor <italic>NIN1a</italic> can be observed in wild type (wt) and it does not change in <italic>rin4b</italic> in response to <italic>B. japonicum</italic> (Bj) 12 hpi. While two other homologs (<italic>NIN2a</italic> and <italic>NIN2b</italic>) respond to Bj in <italic>rin4b,</italic> their induction is significantly lower in comparison to Bert wt. Two soybean <italic>NF-YA</italic> TFs were tested as they are activated by NIN, therefore their lower expression in response to Bj in <italic>rin4b</italic> was expected. <italic>ERN1</italic> is another TF downstream of NIN. Its induction in <italic>rin4b</italic> in response to Bj is significantly lower than the response in Bert wt. Student’s t-test * p&lt;0.05.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p><italic>NIN2a</italic> and <italic>NIN2b</italic> showed induction in <italic>rin4b</italic> upon rhizobial treatment, but at a significantly lower level in comparison to wild-type roots (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Since NIN is responsible for induction of NF-YA and ERN1 transcription factors, their reduced expression in <italic>rin4b</italic> plants was not unexpected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Given that <italic>ERN1</italic> expression is affected in <italic>rin4b</italic> mutant plants, the data suggest that RIN4b is located upstream of the CCaMK-CYCLOPS complex. Soybean <italic>NF-YA1</italic> homolog responded significantly to rhizobial treatment in <italic>rin4b</italic> plants, whereas <italic>NF-YA3</italic> induction did not show significant induction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the expression of all investigated transcription factors was impaired in the <italic>rin4b</italic> mutant background in comparison to Bert wild-type plants at 12 hpi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), the data suggest that the absence of <italic>RIN4b</italic> negatively affects the symbiotic signaling pathway. While the expression of these marker genes was reduced in the <italic>rin4b</italic> mutant plants, some induction upon inoculation was still apparent. We attribute these findings to the functional redundancy between <italic>RIN4a</italic> and <italic>RIN4b</italic>.</p>
<p>As an invading organism, rhizobia also elicit plant immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>), although transient in the case of compatible interactions. These responses need to be amplified or suppressed depending on whether the host senses the bacteria as friend or foe. RIN4 is an immune regulator that is a key intersection between PTI, effector-mediated defense suppression and NTI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The work presented here also supports a role for RIN4 as a key determinate in symbiotic signaling.</p>
<p>In Arabidopsis, absence of RIN4 enhances PTI responses. Over-expression of AtRIN4 leads to PTI inhibition as no callose deposition was observed when plants were treated with flg22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). The function of AtRIN4 is controlled by the specific phosphorylation status of the protein. In the case of soybean nodulation, silencing of <italic>rin4</italic> expression, mutagenesis (i.e., <italic>rin4b</italic>-CRISPR/Cas9 mutant) or disruption of S143 phosphorylation resulted in a significant reduction in nodulation. Absence of AtRIN4 leads to increased PTI responses and, therefore, it might be that GmRIN4b absence also causes enhanced PTI which might have contributed to significantly less nodules. However, this may be too simplistic an idea given the impact of <italic>rin4</italic> mutagenesis on nodule-related gene expression, as well as the lack of knowledge of other likely partners (e.g., interacting R proteins) that might also be playing a role. Compared to leaves there is also a paucity of data as to how plant roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), especially with regard to soybean, respond to pathogen infection and elicitation, as well as any functional role for RIN4. Clearly, there remains much to be discovered as to how RIN4, as well as other components of both the pathogen response and symbiotic response pathways, converge to ultimately distinguish friend from foe.</p>
<p>In soybean, an effector-mediated hijacking of the symbiotic signaling revealed nodule formation in the absence of the NFR1 receptor. NF-deficient <italic>Bradyrhizobium elkanii</italic> was able to elicit nodule formation on <italic>nfr1</italic> mutant plants, whereas NF-deficient T3SS (Type III secretion system is required for effector proteins delivery) double mutant was not able to induce nodule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), suggesting that effector protein(s) are required for successful nodulation in soybean. Taking into consideration that rhizobial effector(s) were able to mediate nodule formation and AtRIN4 up-regulated phosphorylation is a target for an effector protein, our proposed model of RIN4 function in the symbiosis is the following: GmRIN4<sup>S143</sup> is phosphorylated by SymRK, a receptor whose structure is similar to known pattern recognition receptors (PRR) (though no ligand was shown for SymRK so far). Putative effector proteins injected by compatible rhizobium recognize phosphorylated S143, ensuring downstream symbiotic signaling perhaps via effector-mediated interaction of RIN4 to modulate basal immune response. Another likely scenario would be phosphorylation mediated interaction of RIN4a and RIN4b proteins with other downstream proteins which would require further investigation into protein complex formation upon rhizobial infection.</p>
<p>Taken together, our results indicate that successful development of the root nodule symbiosis requires cross-talk between NF-triggered symbiotic signaling and plant immune signaling mediated by RIN4. While no redundancy was shown between RIN4a and RIN4b in plant-pathogenic interactions, our data suggest functional redundancy between the two isoforms in the symbiosis, pointing toward a likely scenario when immune responses in aerial part differ from immune responses in the root.</p>

<title>Seedling growth, treatment and total root, root hair and stripped root collection</title>
<p>In order to obtain root hairs and stripped roots, and total roots for protein and RNA extraction, <italic>Glycine max</italic> cv. Williams 82, and <italic>rin4b</italic>-CRISPR-Cas9 in Bert background M4 and M5 seeds, and Bert wild-type seeds were used. Seeds were surface sterilized with 20% household bleach, left in 20% bleach for 10 min, then washed three times with sterile diH<sub>2</sub>O. Afterwards, the seeds were incubated for 10 min in 0.05% HCl and subsequently washed four times with sterile diH<sub>2</sub>O before sowing onto 1% water-agar plates (20 cm in diameter glass Petri dish, MG Scientific, WI, USA). Williams 82 seeds (used for root hair experiments) were germinated in a growth chamber (Conviron Growth Chamber PGR15) with 90% humidity at 28°C in the dark and three days old seedling were used for treatment. <italic>rin4b</italic> and Bert wild-type seeds were germinated at room temperature (21-23°C) in the dark. Seedlings were spray-inoculated with an OD<sub>600</sub> ∼ 0.2 of <italic>B. japonicum</italic> USDA110 wild type, and sterile water sprayed as mock. Root hairs were harvested 1 hpi by flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, followed by stirring for 15 min, which shears the root hairs from the roots. Roots hairs were then isolated by filtration and both root hairs and stripped roots (i.e., roots with root hairs removed) stored separately at −80°C until further processing. As for <italic>rin4b</italic> and Bert wild-type plants, roots were inoculated 4 days post-sowing with mock and <italic>B. japonicum</italic> USDA 110 with an OD<sub>600</sub> ∼ 0.2, and entire roots harvested 1 hpi and 12 hpi, and stored at −80°C until further processing.</p>

<title>Protein purification from soybean root hairs, roots and transgenic roots</title>
<p>Soybean roots were ground in liquid nitrogen using mortar and pestle. Ground tissue was transferred to an Eppendorf tube and 750 μl of extraction buffer (0.9 M Sucrose, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM EDTA, 0.4% ß-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% Triton-X 100, Plant protease inhibitor, P9599 and phosphatase inhibitor, P0044 from Sigma) was added. Samples were vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min. Equal volume of Tris buffered phenol was added, samples were vortexed and incubated for at least 1 h at 4°C rotating. Samples were centrifuged for 6 min at 13000 rcf at 4°C. Upper phase was transferred to a new tube and one ml ice-cold precipitation buffer (0.1 M Ammonium acetate dissolved in high quality methanol) was added and proteins were precipitated over-night at −20°C. Next day, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 rcf at 4°C. Pellet was resuspended in 1 ml ice-cold precipitation buffer, vortexed and centrifuged (10 min, 3500 rcf, 4°C). This step was repeated. Afterwards, the pellet was washed with 80% ice-cold acetone, vortexed and centrifuged (10 min, 3500 rcf, 4°C), this step was repeated twice. The pellet was resuspended in 70% EtOH, vortexed, centrifuged and air dried. Proteins were resuspended in 8 M Urea (solubilized in 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and protein concentration was measured using Pierce 660 nm Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) and used for SDS-PAGE and subsequent Immuno-blotting analysis.</p>

<title>SDS-PAGE and Immuno-blot analysis</title>
<p>10% or 12% Tris-PAGE gel was prepared without SDS (0.375 M Tris, pH 8.8; 10-12% Bis-Acrylamide (40%, 29:1), 0.1% APS, TEMED) to separate proteins and for subsequent Western-blot assay. Proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane at 4°C over-night at 30 V. After transfer, the membrane was incubated in 1% BSA (Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, MO, USA) in TBS-T (with 0.1% Tween-20 from Fisher Scientific) or 5% milk (fat-free skim milk, SACO Foods, Middleton, WI, USA) in TBS-T. Custom RIN4 antibody was generated by AnaSpec (Fremont, CA, USA) and used at 1:5000 dilution in 5% Milk. Custom RIN4 phosphorylation-site specific peptide antibody, α-pS143 (GRD<sub>P</sub>SPQWEPKNSYD) were generated by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ, USA) and used at 1:4000 dilution in 1% BSA to detect proteins isolated from soybean root hair. Secondary rabbit HRP conjugated antibody was used in 1:10000 dilution and obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA, USA). HA-tagged RIN4a and RIN4b expressed in soybean transgenic roots were detected using monoclonal HA-antibody (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) with or without HRP-conjugate and used in 1:2500 dilution. 1:5000 dilution was applied to detect HA-tagged RIN4a/b expressed in protoplasts. In case of non-conjugated HA antibody, secondary rat antibody was used in 1:10000 dilution in 5% milk. Signal was visualized using 1:8 Femto:Pico Pierce SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). GFP expressed in transgenic roots was detected using anti-GFP antibody (Invitrogen, USA) at 1:5000 dilution in 5% milk. To detect RIN4(a/b) S143 phosphorylation in protoplasts, membrane(s) were blocked in a 2% BSA (dissolved in TBS-T) solution, and were incubated with α-pS143 at 1:3000 in 2% BSA solution with subsequent incubation with secondary rabbit HRP conjugated antibody at 1:15000 dilution. Pictures were taken using a UVP Camera (BioSpectrum 815 Imaging System; Upland, CA, USA) system, or x-ray film was exposed by the blot and photographically developed. Images were inverted and brightness and contrast were adjusted during figure preparation.</p>

<title>Targeted Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mass Spectrometry (MRM-MS)</title>
<p>Costume-made stable-isotope-labeled AQUA peptides carrying the S143 and T173 phosphorylation sites (RIN4a and RIN4b are identical, IS Appendix, <xref rid="tblS3" ref-type="table">Table S3</xref>) were generated by Sigma-Aldrich (The Woodlands, TX, USA). The peptides were resuspended in 50% Acetonitrile (ACN) to generate 10 pmol/µl stock solutions stored at −80°C. Working solutions of the peptides were diluted in 5% ACN with 0.1% formic acid (FA). After 30 min <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay (described above), the samples were spun down and a mixture of heavy-labeled S143, pS143 (phosphorylated version of S143 peptide), T173 and pT173 were added (100 fmol of S143 and 50 fmol of T173) to the samples in 20 µl reaction volume prior to digestion. In-solution trypsin digestion was performed over-night at 37°C as follows: 2.5 µl of reduction solution (100 mM Ammonium bicarbonate/ABC with 100 mM DTT) was added, and samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min; 2 µl alkylation solution (0.5 M Iodoacetamide dissolved in 100 mM ABC) was added to the samples and samples were incubated up to 1 hour at room temperature in the dark. Samples were neutralized by 80 ul 10 mM DTT in 10 mM ABC solution, before 10 µl sequencing grade modified Trypsin (100 ng/µl) from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) dissolved in 100 mM ABC was added. After over-night trypsin digestion, samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 13 000 rcf, frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. Samples were dissolved in 0.1% FA. To quantify phosphorylation, we used Thermo-Scientific Quantiva triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to an Eksigent 1D plus (SCIEX) Nano-LC (liquid chromatography) instrument. 20 cm long column of 75 µm in diameter filled with HxSIL-C18 (particle size 5 µm, Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA) was used for sample separation over a 25 min gradient run. 10 μl sample per injection was used in three technical replicates for each biological replicate. MS-MRM (in positive ion mode) was run over 25 min acquisition time at 3 mTorr CID gas pressure, defined collision energy (V) and cycle time (1 sec) for at least three transitions for each peptide (IS Appendix, <xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>). MS RAW data files were processed using Skyline software (MacCoss Laboratory Software, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://skyline.ms/project/home/begin.view">https://skyline.ms/project/home/begin.view</ext-link><underline>?</underline>) to obtain the area under curves for integrated LC-SRM peaks. Integrated peaks were manually inspected to ensure all quantified transitions had overlapping retention times. Native peptide abundance is expressed as the ratio of endogenous peptide to labeled standard peptide expressed in percentage. MS-SRM was performed at the Gehrke Proteomics Center of the University of Missouri.</p>

A full-length alignment of all putative RIN4s were made using the MAFFT server tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/">http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/</ext-link>) with iterative refinement methods (E-INS-i), multiple conserved domain alignment option, scoring matrix BLOSUM62, default gap opening penalty 1.53.</p>
<p>The alignments were used to generate phylogenetic trees. The phylogenetic tree in the <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> was generated using the Neighbor Joining (NJ) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) with the JTT substitution model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and 1000 bootstrap resampling value. The phylogenetic tree in the <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref> was generated using the Average linkage (UPGMA) method and the JTT substitution model.

<title>Composite plant generation and nodulation assay</title>
<p>In order to generate soybean composite plants expressing the respective constructs, Agrobacterium-mediated hairy root transformation was performed as described in Tóth <italic>et al</italic>, 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) with the following modifications. Hairy root induction was initiated by poking the plants with a needle tip (BD PrecisionGlide Needle, 23G x 1½ TW IM/0.6mmx40mm, sterile, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) carrying the respective agrobacterium. Before planting the composite plants into sterile potting mix (3:1 vermiculite: perlite mix; Hummert International, Earth City, MO, USA), Agrobacterium induced roots were subjected to fluorescence microscopy. The vectors used in this study contain a constitutive GFP marker in order to identify transgenic roots. Non-transgenic roots were removed before planting. 24-48 hours after planting, plants were inoculated with B. <italic>japonicum</italic> USDA 110 wild type at an OD<sub>600</sub> ∼ 0.05. Composite plants were grown in walk-in growth chamber (Conviron GR 64; non-controlled humidity; 16 h/light/26°C and 8 h/dark/24°C). The nodulation phenotype was observed 5 wpi. Leica M205 FA stereomicroscope was used to take pictures of the nodulated transgenic roots at 8.0 x magnification.</p>
<p>In order to determine the nodulation phenotype of <italic>rin4b</italic> mutant plants, seeds (M4) of <italic>rin4b</italic> homozygous CRISPR-Cas9 lines and non-edited Bert plants, with native <italic>RIN4b</italic> (originating from plants that went through transformation but segregated as non-transgenic and non-edited), were surface sterilized and seedlings transferred to perlite-vermiculite potting mix and were grown in controlled walk-in growth chamber (Conviron GR 64; non-controlled humidity non-controlled humidity; 16 h/light/23°C and 8 h/dark/21°C). Plants were inoculated with B. <italic>japonicum</italic> USDA 110 wild type at an OD<sub>600</sub> ∼ 0.05 and subjected to phenotyping 5 wpi.

<p>The transformation vector was constructed using a modified version of the <italic>Glycine max</italic> codon optimized Cas9 plasmid from Michno <italic>et al</italic>. (6, Addgene plasmid # 59184). The pBlu guide RNA shuttle vector used was identical to the one described in Michno et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>) (addgene #59188). <italic>RIN4b</italic> target was selected using Stupar lab’s CRISPR design tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stuparcrispr.cfans.umn.edu/CRISPR/">http://stuparcrispr.cfans.umn.edu/CRISPR/</ext-link>). Guide RNA target oligos were designed based on the program then synthesized and annealed in 10X PCR buffer at 50 °C for six hours. The pBlu/gRNA shuttle vector was digested using BbsI (New England Biolabs # R0539S) following manufacturer’s guidelines. Digested product was run on an agarose gel and extracted using Qiagen gel extraction kit. The target oligos and shuttle vector were ligated using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs # M0202S). The ligation product was transformed into DH5 alpha (Life technologies) competent cells. The pBlu vector containing the target oligos and the destination vector were both digested with EcoRI (New England Biolabs #R0101S). The gRNA cassette and digested destination vector were ligated using T4 ligase, and transformed into DH5 alpha competent cells. <italic>RIN4b</italic> CRISPR/Cas9 construct was delivered into Bert-MN-01 background using K599 Agrobacterium (disarmed strain 18rv12). Methods for delivery and growth of whole-plant transformants were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). T0 plants and subsequent progeny were tested for the presence of the CRISPR/Cas9 transgene using PCR with transgene-specific primers followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Mutations in transformed plants were screened as previously described using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>) and/or PCR heteroduplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) analysis. The mutated alleles in specific plants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons. Plants harboring deletions and no transgene were selected for further analyses.</p>

<p><italic>GmRIN4a</italic> (Glyma.03G084000.1) and <italic>GmRIN4b</italic> (Glyma.16G090700.1), GmSymRKß (Glyma.09G202300.1), GmNFR1α (Glyma.02G270800.1) CDS were cloned via Gateway BP reaction into pDONR/Zeo entry vector. Sequence accuracy was confirmed by Sanger sequencing performed by MU DNA Core facility. These entry clones were used to fuse the haemagglutinin (HA) epitope onto the N-terminus of RIN4a and RIN4b and to introduce point-mutations by site-directed mutagenesis. HA-epitope tagged entry clones were used for subsequent cloning into a modified, gateway compatible pCAMBIA vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) for ectopic expression in soybean composite plants. 120-150 bp of <italic>RIN4a</italic> and <italic>RIN4b</italic> transcripts in the 3’UTR regions were cloned into pDONR/Zeo entry vector. These clones were used for subsequent cloning into a modified gateway compatible pCAMBIA vector for RNAi-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Both modified pCambia vectors contain a GFP marker for transgenic root identification. pDONR/Zeo: RIN4a/b and pDONR/Zeo: SymRKß/NFR1α entry clones were used to create constructs for BiFC, Split-Luciferase, as well as protoplast (protein expression and phosphorylation) experiments.</p>

<p>Microscopy was performed 40-46 hours post infiltration. A LEICA SP8 confocal laser-scanning microscope with a tunable white light laser (WLL) was used to visualize YFP fluorescence generated upon interaction between the co-expressed proteins as a result of split YFP halves reconstitution. Plasma membrane (PM) was labeled with FM4-64 (Invitrogen, USA) PM dye. YFP was excited at 514 nm and the emission was detected at a 525-575 nm bandwidth. FM4-64 was excited at 510 nm and dye’s emission was detected using a 700-780 nm bandwidth. Images of two fluorescence channels were acquired sequentially with a 40x/1.1NA water immersion objective and an additional zoom factor 3. The pixel size of images was set to 95 nm. Brightness and contrast of the images was adjusted in PowerPoint. CLSM was done at the Molecular Cytology Core of the University of Missouri.</p>

<p>GmRIN4a, GmRIN4b, GmRIN4c (Glyma.18G166800.1) and GmRIN4d (Glyma.08G349500.1) were fused C-terminally with a His-epitope in the pET22b vector (Novagen). The intracellular, kinase domains of GmSymRKβ (537 aa −919 aa) and NFR1α (294 aa −599 aa) were N-terminally tagged with GST-epitope in the pGEX-5X-1 vector (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Rosetta<sup>TM</sup> (DE3) bacterial cells (Novagen/Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) carrying the respective constructs were grown in LB medium (with respective antibiotic) and cell cultures were induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) after reaching an OD<sub>600</sub> absorbance of 0.5 and incubated at 28°C for an additional 4 hours. Bacterial cells were collected at 4,000 rpm for 10 min and His and GST-tagged proteins were purified by TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech, Takara Bio, USA) and Glutathione Resin (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol, respectively. For the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay, 2 μg of purified GST tagged protein kinases were incubated with 2 μg His-tagged GmRIN4 proteins as substrate in a 20 μl reaction buffer containing 20 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, and w/wo 0.2 μl radioactive [γ-32P] ATP for 60 min at 30°C. In the case of radioactive detection, 5 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer was added to the reaction, and samples were boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 12% SDS-PAGE gels, followed by autoradiography for 12 h. The proteins were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) and auto-radiographed using a Typhoon FLA 9000 phosphorimager (GE Healthcare). Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) and GST were used as controls.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and qRT-PCR experiment</title>
<p>RNA was extracted from entire soybean roots, root hairs and stripped roots, and from transgenic roots using Trizol (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen, 1 ml-1.5 ml Trizol reagent was added to the mortar and samples were transferred into an Eppendorf tube as liquid. These extracts were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 13000 rcf for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred into a new tube and 200 μl chloroform was added per 1 ml supernatant, vortexed and centrifuged for 20 min at 4°C. The upper phase was carefully transferred into a new tube and the half volume of cold ethanol was added. From this step forward, the samples were transferred onto a Qiagen column, using Qiagen RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the RNA was checked by agarose-gel electrophoresis and samples were DNAse treated using Ambion Turbo DNAse (Invitrogen by Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) following the manufacturer’s recommendation. cDNA synthesis was performed using 2 μg RNA, oligo dT primer, and Promega MLV Reverse transcriptase (RT) kit (Madison, WI, USA), a negative control without RT was included in cDNA-synthesis. For qRT-PCR, cDNA was diluted five times and Applied Biosystems SYBR Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was used to perform quantitative RT-PCR. For data analysis, Rn values were extracted from ABI 7500 Real Time PCR machine and LinReg software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gene-quantification.de/LinRegPCR_help_manual_v11.0.pdf">https://www.gene-quantification.de/LinRegPCR_help_manual_v11.0.pdf</ext-link>) was used to determine baseline and Cq values. Data were extracted into Excel file and <italic>Cons6</italic> (F-box protein encoding gene) and/or <italic>Cons7</italic> (Insulin-degrading enzyme, Metalloprotease) was used as a reference gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) to normalize Cq values. ΔCt method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) was used to evaluate the data and determine relative expression. qPCR primers were designed using Primer3 PCR primer design tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Primers were designed based on Williams 82 reference genome. qRT-PCR analysis was performed on cDNA derived from Williams 82 root hairs and stripped roots, and cDNA derived from total root of Bert cultivar and <italic>rin4b</italic> mutant in Bert background.</p>

Myelin basic protein (MBP) was used as a positive control for SymRKβ and NFR1α kinase activity, and GST was used (left side) as a negative control. (B) Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS-MRM) was performed to identify the phosphorylation site triggered by the 2 kinases. S143 phosphorylation was phosphorylated only by SymRKß and quantified using heavy-labeled peptides generated against native peptides carrying S143. In both RIN4a and RIN4b S143 nodulation-related phosphorylation site is phosphorylated by SymRKβ whereas another phosphorylation site T173, used as negative control was not phosphorylated neither by SymRKß nor by NFR1α. MS run was performed in 2 biological and 3 technical replicates. Phosphorylation is expressed in percentage as mean of all replicates.</p></caption>

<caption><title>Calibration curves and correlation coefficients of RIN4a and RIN4b established for MS-SRM</title>
<p>(A, C, E, G) Calibration curves of S143 and T173 containing native peptides at different protein concentration of recombinantly expressed RIN4a and RIN4b proteins were established at fixed amount (100 fmol S143; 50 fmol T173) of heavy-labeled AQUA peptide. Both S143 and T173 carrying peptides are 100% identical between RIN4a and RIN4b, therefore the experiment was done in RIN4a and RIN4b recombinantly expressed protein background separately, resulting in similar values, therefore suggesting that the proteins behave in a similar way when LC-MS was run. Left panels show calibration curves expressing peak area ratio of native peptide normalized to heavy-labeled peptide. As expected, concentration gradient led to growth curve. (B, D, F, H) Scatter plots expressing relationship between protein concentrations loaded per injection and peak area ratio normalized to heavy obtained per concentration gradient. Correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup> was 0.99 in both RIN4a and RIN4b) values strongly support correlation between the protein concentration injected and the native peptide amount detected (normalized to heavy-labeled peptide).</p></caption>

<p>The authors set out to illuminate how legumes promote symbiosis with beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria while maintaining a general defensive posture towards the plethora of potentially pathogenic bacteria in their environment. Intriguingly, a protein involved in plant defence signalling, RIN4, is implicated as a type of 'gatekeeper' for symbiosis, connecting symbiosis signalling with defence signalling. Although questions remain about how exactly RIN4 enables symbiosis, the work opens an important door to new discoveries in this area.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study uses a multidisciplinary, state-of-the-art approach to implicate RIN4 in soybean nodulation and symbiosis development. The results support the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
No serious weaknesses, although the manuscript could be improved slightly from technical and communication standpoints.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study by Toth et al. investigates the role of RIN4, a key immune regulator, in the symbiotic nitrogen fixation process between soybean and rhizobium. The authors found that SymRK can interact with and phosphorylate GmRIN4. This phosphorylation occurs within a 15 amino acid motif that is highly conserved in N-fixation clades. Genetic studies indicate that GmRIN4a/b play a role in root nodule symbiosis. Based on their data, the authors suggest that RIN4 may function as a key regulator connecting symbiotic and immune signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Overall, the conclusions of this paper are well supported by the data, although there are a few areas that need clarification.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
• This study provides important insights by demonstrating that RIN4, a key immune regulator, is also required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation.</p>
<p>
• The findings suggest that GmRIN4a/b could mediate appropriate responses during infection, whether it is by friendly or hostile organisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
• The study did not explore the immune response in the rin4 mutant. Therefore, it remains unknown how GmRIN4a/b distinguishes between friend and foe.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript by Toth et al reveals a conserved phosphorylation site within the RIN4 (RPM1-interacting protein 4) R protein that is exclusive to two of the four nodulating clades, Fabales and Rosales. The authors present persuasive genetic and biochemical evidence that phosphorylation at the serine residue 143 of GmRIN4b, located within a 15-aa conserved motif with a core five amino acids 'GRDSP' region, by SymRK, is essential for optimal nodulation in soybean. While the experimental design and results are robust, the manuscript's discussion fails to clearly articulate the significance of these findings. Results described here are important to understand how the symbiosis signaling pathway prioritizes associations with beneficial rhizobia, while repressing immunity-related signals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript asks an important question in plant-microbe interaction studies with interesting findings.</p>
<p>Overall, the experiments are detailed, thorough, and very well-designed. The findings appear to be robust.</p>
<p>The authors provide results that are not overinterpreted and are instead measured and logical.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
No major weaknesses. However, a well-thought-out discussion integrating all the findings and interpreting them is lacking; in its current form, the discussion lacks 'boldness'. The primary question of the study - how plants differentiate between pathogens and symbionts - is not discussed in light of the findings. The concluding remark, &quot;Taken together, our results indicate that successful development of the root nodule symbiosis requires cross-talk between NF-triggered symbiotic signaling and plant immune signaling mediated by RIN4,&quot; though accurate, fails to capture the novelty or significance of the findings, and left me wondering how this adds to what is already known. A clear conclusion, for eg, the phosphorylation of RIN4 isoforms by SYMRK at S143 modulates immune responses during symbiotic interactions with rhizobia, or similar, is needed.</p>
