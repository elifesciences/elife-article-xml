<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Large transcellular pores elicited by bacterial mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (mART) exotoxins inhibiting the small RhoA GTPase compromise the endothelial barrier. Recent advances in biophysical modeling point towards membrane tension and bending rigidity as the minimal set of mechanical parameters determining the nucleation and maximal size of transendothelial cell macroaperture (TEM) tunnels induced by bacterial RhoA-targeting mART exotoxins. We report that cellular depletion of caveolin-1, the membrane-embedded building block of caveolae, and depletion of cavin-1, the master regulator of caveolae invaginations, increase the number of TEM per cell. The enhanced nucleation of TEM correlates with a reduction of cell height, due to the increase of cell spreading and decrease of cell volume, which, together with the disruption of RhoA-driven F-actin meshwork, favor membrane apposition for TEM nucleation. Strikingly, caveolin-1 specifically controls the opening speed of TEMs leading to their dramatic 5.4-fold larger widening. Consistent with the increase of TEM density and width in siCAV1 cells, we record a higher lethality in caveolin-1-deficient mice subjected to a catalytically active mART exotoxin targeting RhoA during staphylococcal bloodstream infection. Combined theoretical modeling with independent biophysical measurements of plasma membrane bending rigidity point toward a specific contribution of caveolin-1 to membrane stiffening in addition to the role of cavin-1/caveolin-1-dependent caveolae in the control of membrane tension homeostasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The endothelial cell monolayer lining the inner surface of the vascular tree forms an active semipermeable barrier that actively responds to hemodynamic forces to control blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Regulation of the endothelial barrier involves a bidirectional interplay between actomyosin cytoskeleton and plasma membrane mechanics, which together control paracellular exchanges at cell‒cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>), as well as transcellular exchanges through less-characterized transcellular openings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Defining how membrane mechanical parameters affect the dynamics of opening and widening of transendothelial pores will help to better define the role of these openings both physiological and pathophysiological processes.</p>
<p>Large transcellular pores in the endothelium can contribute to aqueous humor outflow in the eyes, can form during the diapedesis of leukocytes, or appear when endothelial cells are intoxicated by several bacterial toxins known to breach the endothelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Bacterial mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (mART) exotoxins, which catalyze the post-translational modification of the small GTPase RhoA for inhibition, induce the spontaneous formation of TEM tunnels up to 10 to 20 µm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). This group of mART includes the exotoxin C3 (ExoC3) from <italic>Clostridium botulinum</italic>, and the Epidermal Differentiation Inhibitors (EDIN) A, B, and C close homologues from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The intravenous injection of EDIN or ExoC3 triggers vascular leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Cumulative evidence also indicates that EDIN favors the translocation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> through vascular tissues for dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Although TEM tunnels have not yet been visualized <italic>in vivo</italic>, they form <italic>ex vivo</italic> in the endothelium lining the inner surface of rat aortas either infected with <italic>S. aureus</italic>-producing the RhoA-targeting EDIN mART or treated with EDIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Mechanistically, the inhibition of RhoA signaling by bacterial mART exotoxins disrupts contractile actomyosin stress fibers, which otherwise stiffen in response to shear forces exerted by the blood flow that tends to compress cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). In line with this, compressive mechanical forces applied to the apical region of endothelial cells bring into close contact the apical and basal plasma membranes to nucleate transcellular pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Although force-induced nucleation of TEMs can be triggered in the absence of inhibition of RhoA, the magnitude of the force required to mechanically open TEMs dramatically decreases when RhoA is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). This led to postulate that TEMs form because of a disruption of actomyosin stress fibers under the control of RhoA, which concur to reduce the height of cells as they spread out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The physical mechanisms that set both the nucleation of TEMs and their maximal width remain to be ascertained experimentally.</p>
<p>TEMs represent a remarkable model system to identify the molecular machinery that controls cell mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Our current view of the mechanical forces at play in the opening of TEMs largely arises from the phenomenological analogy drawn between TEM tunnel opening and the formation of dry patches in viscous liquid forced to spread on a solid surface, a physical phenomenon referred to as liquid dewetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Notably, the analogy drawn between liquid and cellular dewetting suggests that the increase of membrane tension in response to cell spreading is the driving force of TEM nucleation also contributing to define the initial speed of opening, i.e. before that membrane tension relaxation around TEM edges and build-up of an actomyosin bundle encircling TEMs counteract the opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Of note, the high curvature of the plasma membrane at the edge of TEMs also points toward a contribution of membrane bending rigidity in their dynamics. Experimental evidence is still required to ascertain roles of membrane tension and bending rigidity in the dynamics of TEM tunnel nucleation and enlargement.</p>
<p>Caveolae are mechano-regulators of the plasma membrane that spontaneously flatten to accommodate acute mechanical loads and thereby prevent membrane rupturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Caveolin oligomers are essential components of caveolae pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Caveolin-1 homo-oligomers form flat discoid complexes embedded into the inner leaflet of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). The process of invagination of caveolar pits of 50-100 nm diameter involves the association of caveolin-1 with cavin-1 cytosolic structural protein (also referred to as PTRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Caveolae pits are further stabilized at their neck by the assembly of a ring of dynamin-like EHD2 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). In endothelial cells, the crosstalk between caveolin-1 and RhoA during actomyosin contractility leads to critical mechano-sensing and adaptation to hemodynamic forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). For example, caveolin-1-deficient mice undergo an increase in the endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS) signaling that is critical to activate RhoA signaling via nitration-mediated inhibition of the GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity of p190RhoGAP-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Cell biology and epidemiological studies have started to establish the importance of caveolin-1 in host‒pathogen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Considering the protective function of caveolae membrane invaginations in ensuring membrane tension homeostasis in response to acute mechanical loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), caveolin-1 and cavin-1 represent potential mechano-regulators of transcellular pore dynamics.</p>
<p>Using cutting edge microscopy technics, we establish that endothelial cells treated with RhoA-targeting mART display caveolae pits at the ventral part of the plasma membrane and a loose F-actin meshwork that frame large cytosolic zones devoid of F-actin. We report that the disruption of caveolae and depletion of caveolin-1, using siRNA-targeting cavin-1 or caveolin-1, respectively increases the number of TEM per cell. We establish that the increase of TEM opening correlates with a decrease in cell volume concomitant with cell spreading, which concur to a decrease in cell height. Strikingly, we establish that caveolin-1, contrary to cavin-1, controls the widening of TEMs which rule out a role of caveolae membrane-invaginations. This increase in both the number and width of TEMs correlates with a higher susceptibility of caveolin-1-deficient mice to the lethal effect of EDIN-B mART activity during <italic>S. aureus</italic> septicemia. Finally, using an independent biophysical technique and theoretical modeling, we provide compelling evidence that caveolin-1 contributes, independently of cavin-1, to increasing plasma membrane bending rigidity. These data point for a role of cavin-1/caveolin-1 components of caveolae in the regulation of TEM nucleation through the modulation of membrane tension. Hence, we ascribe to caveolin-1 a function in stiffening the plasma membrane that is independent from cavin-1-dependent caveolae, which eventually modulates TEMs opening speed and width.</p>

<title>Caveolae control the density of TEM tunnels</title>
<p>Formation of large transendothelial cell macroaperture (TEM) tunnels is observed in endothelial cells intoxicated with EDIN-like factors from <italic>S. aureus</italic>, as well as with the prototypic exoenzyme C3 (ExoC3) from <italic>C. botulinum</italic>. Considering that RhoA inhibition increases endothelial cell spreading, we investigated the impact of ExoC3 treatment on the distribution and density of caveolae in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-C</xref>). We used a cell unroofing approach that allows direct visualization of membrane invaginations on a platinum replica via transmission electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). In both naïve and ExoC3-treated cells, we observed membrane-associated cytoskeleton filaments, the honeycomb structure of clathrin lattices, clathrin-coated pits, and rough aspects of pit-like caveolar invaginations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We verified that the treatment of cells with ExoC3 had no impact on caveolin-1 and cavin-1 expression (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Of note, the density of the cytoskeletal filaments was less pronounced in the ExoC3-treated cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, arrowhead). Cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding GFP-caveolin-1 to confirm by immunogold labelling the presence of caveolin-1-positive caveolae invaginations at the ventral side of the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). We quantified the density of caveolae in ExoC3-treated and control cells. In total, we analyzed an area <italic>A</italic><sub>area</sub> &gt; 175 µm<sup>2</sup> under each condition (<italic>n</italic> ≥ 16 membrane areas of independent cells per condition). We recorded a 1.6-fold decrease in the mean density of caveolae in the ExoC3-treated cells, which exhibited 3.4 ± 2.1 caveolae/µm<sup>2</sup> of membrane, as compared to 5.4 ± 3.1 caveolae/µm<sup>2</sup> of membrane in untreated cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The pool of plasma membrane-located caveolae remaining in ExoC3-treated cells are evenly distributed with no detectable accumulation around TEM tunnels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). ExoC3 treatment reduces the density of invaginated caveolae at the plasma membrane, pointing for the interest of studying the impact of caveolae depletion in TEM formation. Before functional analysis of the impact of caveolae components on TEM tunnel nucleation and growth, we analyzed the previously established stoichiometry of caveolin-1 and cavin-1 in response to siRNA treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). We observed that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of caveolin-1 (siCAV1) strongly reduces both caveolin-1 and the cellular pool of cavin-1/PTRF by approximately 80% (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). In contrast, about one half of the pool of caveolin-1 remained unaffected by the siRNA-targeted depletion of cavin-1/PTRF (siPRTF) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). We concluded that siPTRF leaves a cellular pool of caveolin-1 unaffected, contrary to siCAV1. Both siRNA treatments had no effect on the extent of mono-ADPribosylation of RhoA (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). We next quantified the efficiency of TEM tunnel formation in different conditions of siRNA treatment. HUVECs were treated with siCTRL, siCAV1 or siPTRF prior to ExoC3 treatment. Examples of cells treated in these conditions are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and in supplementary videos 1, 2 and 3. Quantitative measurements showed a higher percentage of cells displaying at least one TEM in the population of caveolin-1 or cavin-1-deficient cells (37.6 ± 1.3% siCAV1 and 36.4 ± 1.3% siPTRF versus 28.8 ± 1.2% siCTRL) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the density of TEM per cell in siCAV1 (N<sub>TEM_siCAV1</sub> = 1.96) and siPTRF (N<sub>TEM_siPTRF</sub> = 1.36) conditions, as compared to siCTRL (N<sub>siCTRL</sub> = 0.91) (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). We verified that such an increase of TEM density per cell and within the cell population was also induced by the ExoC3-like RhoA-targeting mART EDIN from <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B-C</xref>) or by siRNA-targeting EHD2 caveolae-stabilizing protein, a treatment that leaves caveolin-1 and cavin-1 unaffected (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Together, these data show that the efficiency of formation of TEMs is inversely correlated to the density and stability of caveolae at the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Caveolae buffer the decrease of cell height triggered by RhoA inhibition-driven spreading</title>
<p>Formation of TEMs due to the disruption of RhoA-driven F-actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction is facilitated by a reduction in cell height that promotes contact between the apical and basal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We first quantified the mesh size of F-actin network using 2D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) that integrates F-actin signals with a ∼30-nm resolution over the whole cell thickness which can be as thin as 50 nm at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). The siCTRL, siCAV1 and siPTRF-transfected HUVECs displayed a classical organization of actin cytoskeleton with actin stress fibers intertwined with a high-density meshwork of F-actin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, control). When siRNA-treated cells were next intoxicated with ExoC3, we observed the disruption of actin stress fibers together with a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton into a loosely intertwined and irregular F-actin meshwork defining large zones devoid of F-actin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, ExoC3). In all conditions of siRNA treatment, we have measured that ExoC3 treatment induces a significant increase of actin-mesh size of about 0.2 μm<sup>2</sup>, as compared to non-intoxicated cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). No significant difference of mesh size was recorded between siCTRL, siCAV1 or siPTRF conditions before and after treatment with ExoC3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We concluded that in addition to the well-establish impact of RhoA inhibition on actin stress fibers it generates a loose F-actin meshwork framing large cellular zones devoid of F-actin of same extent in all siRNA conditions.</p>

<p>We next investigated the role played by caveolin-1 and cavin-1 in the control of the cell height (<italic>h</italic>), an essential parameter in TEM nucleation. The mean value of this cell shape parameter is proportional to the ratio between the volume (<italic>V</italic>) and spreading area (<italic>A</italic>) of cells (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The spreading area was estimated from the measurement of cell contours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The volume of cells was quantified by fluorescent dye exclusion, as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, and as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Upon intoxication of siCTRL-treated cells, we recorded a significant increase of 36% of the spreading area together with 17% increase of the cell volume (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-3D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The dominant impact of cell area changes over the volume parameter accounts for the calculated decrease of cell height of 15% (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Hence, when siCAV1- and siPTRF-transfected cells were treated with ExoC3, we recorded a reduction of cell volume concomitant to the increase in their spreading area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-3D</xref> and <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The reinforced reduction in cell height recorded in siCAV1 or siPTRF-treated cells is in good agreement with our findings showing that these treatments increase the density of TEMs. Note that in the absence of ExoC3, we recorded that the effects of siPTRF on cell shape parameters were slightly stronger than those of siCAV1, thereby highlighting the key involvement of caveolae in the control of cell height (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-3D</xref>). The depletion of caveolae and the inhibition RhoA work together to reduce cell height that favors together with the loss of F-actin the nucleation of TEMs.</p>

<title>Caveolin-1 and cavin-1 have a different impact on TEM expansion dynamics</title>
<p>Since the TEM opening is transient, we next characterized the impact of caveolin-1 and cavin-1 in TEM dynamics that allow to define TEM maximal width. We implemented a pipeline of live-cell imaging and semi-automatic analysis that relies on the detection of Lifeact-GFP signal around TEMs to segment the opening area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> shows the projections of the first image recorded for each TEM that formed over 1-hour recording (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We see that TEM tunnels preferentially open at the cell periphery where the cell height is minimal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We then measured the maximal values of each TEM areas over 1 hour of video recording (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), as well as the speeds of opening and closure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Interestingly, we recorded 5.4-fold wider TEMs in siCAV1-treated cells, as compared to siPTRF- and siCTRL-treatments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Interestingly, the time for TEMs to reach their maximal diameter (t<sub>max</sub>) and the overall TEM cycles (t<sub>c</sub>) remain identical in all conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Thus, TEMs became wider in siCAV1 condition in absence of change in the time frame of opening, suggesting that caveolin-1 controls the speed of opening. To capture initial values of TEM opening speed (S<sub>o</sub>) we used a 15-fold higher temporal resolution, i.e. using a video recording of 1 image per second. Strikingly, we recorded a 2-fold higher opening speed in caveolin-1-depleted cells: S<sub>o_siCAV1</sub>=2.4 µm<sup>2</sup>/s versus S<sub>o_siCTRL</sub>=1.1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s in control cells, which contrasts with the lack of impact of siPTRF (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).

<title>Loss of caveolin-1 sensitizes mice to EDIN-B lethal effects during <italic>S. aureus</italic> sepsis</title>
<p>We reasoned that the increased density and width of TEMs triggered by the cellular depletion of caveolin-1 should result in higher susceptibility of caveolin-1 (Cav1)-deficient (CAV1<sup>-/-</sup>) mice to the inhibition of RhoA by EDIN-like mART exotoxins during bloodstream infection by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. This would establish caveolin-1 as a resistance factor in the pathogenicity triggered by EDIN-like factors from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. To address this question, we first established the susceptibility of CAV1<sup>-/-</sup> mice and wildtype littermates (CAV1<sup>+/+</sup>) to <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain LUG1799 (WT <italic>edinB</italic>) in a model of septicemia (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). LUG1799 belongs to the European lineage ST80 derived from community-acquired methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which expresses EDIN-B mART exotoxin (EDIN-B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). We first monitored over a period of 7 days the survival of CAV1<sup>-/-</sup> and CAV1<sup>+/+</sup> mice challenged with three increasing <italic>inocula</italic> of WT <italic>edinB</italic>. All the mice, except one CAV1<sup>-/-</sup> mouse, recovered from infection triggered with 5 ×10<sup>6</sup> CFU of bacteria/mouse (CFU/m), while all mice died 24 hours after intravenous injection of 5×10<sup>8</sup> CFU/m. In contrast, when mice were challenged with an intermediate dose of WT <italic>edinB</italic> of 5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/m, we recorded a higher lethality of CAV1<sup>-/-</sup> as compared to CAV1<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mantel‒Cox test). All the CAV1<sup>-/-</sup> mice died on day 1 post-challenge, whereas the death of CAV1<sup>+/+</sup> occurred with a delay of 1 to 2 days, with one CAV1<sup>+/+</sup> mouse surviving (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, 5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/m). The loss of caveolin-1 expression thus sensitizes mice to bloodstream infection triggered by <italic>S. aureus</italic>-produced EDIN-B. We then explored the pathogenic effect of EDIN-B mART activity of RhoA. In control experiments with CAV1<sup>+/+</sup> mice infected with either WT <italic>edinB</italic> or Δ<italic>edinB</italic> strains, we saw no difference of susceptibility between the strains and despite a broad range of 4 different <italic>inocula</italic> tested (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). In this set experiments, we identify the lethal dose 50 (LD<sub>50</sub>) at 2.5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/m with both strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. When we challenged CAV1<sup>-/-</sup> mice with this LD<sub>50</sub> of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (2.5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/m) we saw a lower survival with <italic>S. aureus</italic> WT <italic>edinB</italic> (<italic>n</italic>=11 death /18 mice), as compared to Δ<italic>edinB</italic> (<italic>n</italic>=4 death /17 mice) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0123, Mantel‒Cox test) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). To provide a causal link between the pathogenicity of EDIN-B recorded in CAV1<sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice and the inhibition of RhoA catalyzed by EDIN-B, we performed a similar experiment with <italic>S. aureus</italic> Δ<italic>edinB</italic> complemented with a plasmid expressing either WT EDIN-B (Δ<italic>edinB</italic> pEDIN-B) or the catalytically inactive mutant EDIN-B-RE (Δ<italic>edinB</italic> pEDIN-B-RE). We saw a significant decrease of survival in caveolin-1-deficient mice infected with Δ<italic>edinB</italic> pEDIN-B, as compared to mice infected with Δ<italic>edinB</italic> pEDIN-B-RE.

<title>Differential impacts of caveolin-1 and cavin-1 on membrane rigidity</title>
<p>Since we expect that S<sub>o</sub> depends on membrane mechanical parameters (see the physical model description in the Materials and Methods), this suggests that caveolin-1, but not cavin-1 modulates TEM opening speed by affecting membrane mechanics. We then inferred changes in membrane mechanical properties upon depletion of caveolin-1 or cavin-1, using a refined theoretical model of cellular dewetting. This model accounts for the presence of several TEMs opening simultaneously (see the physical model description in the Materials and Methods). Importantly, the model is based on the hypothesis that plasma membrane deformation, enabling TEM nucleation and tunnel growth, is a function of membrane tension and bending rigidity, assuming a limited contribution of membrane adhesion to cortical cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Indeed, consistent with this hypothesis of a minimal impact of cortical cytoskeleton elements on membrane mechanics, the 2D STORM images (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) established a massive disruption of the dense F-actin meshwork in ExoC3-treated cells, leaving large cellular zones devoid of F-actin. As explained in the Materials and Methods section in detail, the model predicts that the initial opening speed S<sub>o</sub> is proportional to the membrane tension, consistent with a critical role of membrane tension in TEM growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>).</p>
<p>From our measurements, we deduce that cells treated with siCAV1 have a significant 2-fold higher membrane tension than the controls, and no effect in siPTRF-treated cells (see Methods). Moreover, according to the model, the maximum TEM size <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> depends strongly on membrane bending rigidity but weakly on the initial membrane tension. Thus, from our <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> measurements, the model allows the estimation of the bending rigidities κ in the different conditions. Using the following values for the siCTRL-treated cells - an initial membrane tension σ<sub><italic>0</italic></sub>=2.5 10<sup>−5</sup> N/m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) and a bending rigidity κ<sub>siCTRL</sub>=23.4 k<sub>B</sub>T (direct measurement, see below) – the model predicts a 55% reduction of membrane rigidity from a loss of expression of caveolin-1 and a lower reduction of 15% upon a loss of cavin-1 expression as compared to caveolin-1.</p>
<p>To test these predictions, we used an independent approach to measure the membrane bending rigidity in different conditions of cell treatment. This quantitative method is based on pulling membrane tethers from cell-derived plasma membrane spheres (PMSs) that are devoid of F-actin cortex and preserve the lipid membrane (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). PMSs prepared from untreated siCTRL-, siCAV1- and siPTRF-treated HUVECs were aspirated into a micropipette, allowing to control membrane tension. Membrane tethers were pulled from PMSs using optical tweezers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). The force, <italic>f</italic>, exerted on the membrane tether can be measured as function of membrane tension (<italic>σ</italic>); it also depends on the bending rigidity (κ) following <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="509635v3_inline1a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Thus, the analysis of the slope of <italic>f</italic><sup>2</sup> versus <italic>σ</italic>provides a measurement of the membrane bending rigidity of a PMS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). We measured a significant decrease of 30% of the bending rigidity from κ<sub>siCTRL</sub>=23.4 ± 0.9k<sub>B</sub>T to κ<sub>siCAV1</sub>=17.0 ± 0.9 k<sub>B</sub>T. Moreover, we observed no significant difference in siPTRF conditions, as compared to siCTRL, with a κ<sub>siPTRF</sub>=23.4 ± 1.3 k<sub>B</sub>T (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). In good agreement with the theoretical predictions, these measurements establish that the expression of caveolin-1, but not of cavin-1, significantly stiffens the plasma membrane.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report that siRNA-mediated knockdown of key structural and regulatory components of caveolae sensitizes endothelial cells to the formation of TEM tunnels triggered by the inhibition of RhoA-driven actomyosin contractility. Hence, inhibition of RhoA reduces by 2-fold the pool of caveolae invaginations at the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, we report that targeted depletion of caveolin-1 and cavin-1 caveolae decreases cell volume and increases cell spreading, which concur to decrease the height of cells favoring membrane apposition for TEM nucleation. Strikingly, we establish a specific role for caveolin-1 in controlling the opening speed of TEMs that has a dramatic impact on TEM size. In good agreement with the recorded increase of TEM formation and width following caveolin-1 knockdown, we establish a higher susceptibility of Cav1-deficient mice to lethal effects triggered by EDIN-B mART during staphylococcal bloodstream infection. Finally, we provide theoretical and experimental evidence that in addition to the well-established role of caveolae in membrane tension homeostasis, caveolin-1 rigidifies plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Our biophysical measurements unravel that caveolin-1 depletion decreases membrane bending rigidity by 30%, while depletion of cavin-1 has no impact. This experimental value is of the same order of magnitude as the 55% decrease in bending rigidity inferred from the cell dewetting model. The difference recorded between these approaches can be attributed to several approximations in the theoretical model, notably the simplified treatment of the physical membrane tension variation, of the cytoskeletal contributions, and of the interactions between neighboring TEM tunnels. Note that the formation of the actin cables around the TEM before it reaches full size saturation may also limit the correct estimation of the bending rigidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). The mechanical role of caveolin-1 reported here is highly significant considering that previous studies showed that inclusion of integral proteins in membranes had no impact on bending rigidity, as shown in the bacteriorhodopsin experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), or even decreased membrane rigidity as reported for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase SERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Previous simulations have also confirmed the softening effect of protein inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Nevertheless, our observations can be explained by a high density of stiff inclusions in the plasma membrane (&gt;&gt;10%), which was generally not achievable with the reconstituted membranes described in the above-mentioned references. Caveolin-1 expression may also contribute to plasma membrane stiffening by interacting with membrane-associated components of the cortical cytoskeletal or by structuring ordered lipid domains. Nevertheless, it has been reported that the Young’s modulus of the cell cortex dramatically decreases in ExoC3-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>) suggesting a small additional contribution of caveolin-1 depletion to membrane softening. This is supported by 2D STORM data showing a dramatic reorganization of actin cytoskeleton in ExoC3-treated cells into a loose F-actin meshwork that is not significantly exacerbated by caveolin-1 depletion. Regarding the link between caveolin-1 and lipids it is well established that caveolae are enriched with cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipids, including gangliosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>), which are known to rigidify membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Thus, caveolin-1 might contribute to the enrichment of the plasma membrane with these lipid species. We did not establish experimental conditions allowing us to deplete cholesterol without compromising the shape of HUVECs, which prevented a proper analysis of TEM dynamics. Moreover, a previous attempt to increase TEMs width by softening the membrane through the incorporation of poly-unsaturated acyl chains into phospholipids failed, likely due to homeostatic adaptation of the membrane’s mechanical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Further studies are required to establish whether and how caveolin-1 oligomers control membrane mechanical parameters through modulation of lipids organization or content.</p>
<p>Our data establish a function to cavin-1-dependent caveolae in the regulation cell height. Indeed, we measured an increase in cell spreading and a decrease in cell volume upon depletion of caveolin-1 or cavin-1, which are essential components of caveolae. This is consistent with findings showing that cell homeostasis during spreading is achieved by decreasing cell volume. Such a coupling between variations in cell spreading area and cell volume is breached by disrupting cortical contractility, resulting in cell swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Consistently, we show that the ExoC3-triggered increase in endothelial cell spreading occurs concomitantly with a decrease in cell volume. This might be a consequence of the inhibition of RhoA signaling, which is permissive for the activity of volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Here, we show that the decrease in cell volume upon depletion of cavin-1, and to a lesser extent after depletion of caveolin-1, occurs independently of RhoA signaling, i.e. in ExoC3-treated cells. Thus, how caveolae control the cellular volume once RhoA signaling is inhibited awaits determination. Our findings also suggest that depletion of caveolae and RhoA inactivation, may release membrane-folding driven mechanical constraints that would limit cell spreading. Another hypothesis is that caveolae control indirectly the cellular geometry via a documented function of cavin-1 on cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>).</p>
<p>The molecular basis of interindividual variability in <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections is unclear, although the expression of caveolin-1 has recently been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Indeed, a human genetics study pinpointed the impact of haploinsufficiency of the OTULIN deubiquitinase in sensitizing host cells to lysis triggered by the highly prevalent α-haemolysin pore-forming toxin of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, a major determinant in staphylococcal pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). The defect in OTULIN activity led to an increase in caveolin-1 cellular protein levels in dermal cells, which in turn upregulates the expression of the ADAM10 receptor of alpha-haemolysin pore-forming toxin. Here, we report that caveolin-1 expression is not regulated by RhoA signaling. Furthermore, we establish that the loss of caveolin-1 expression sensitizes mice to the lethal effects triggered by EDIN-B mART activity on RhoA during <italic>S. aureus</italic> septicemia, thus ascribing a pathogenicity potential to this exotoxin that is counteracted by expression of caveolin-1. In line with this, a recent analysis of an observational cohort of patients with <italic>S. aureus</italic> community-acquired pneumonia indicated that EDIN-B, together with Panton–Valentin leukocidin, are positively associated with the etiology of hemoptysis, manifests by the presence of blood in sputum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). Whether TEMs are involved in the etiology of hemoptysis remains to be investigated. Although we cannot argue that there is a causal link between the lethal effect of EDIN-B in caveolin-1-deficient animals and the protective function of caveolin-1 against TEM tunnel formation in endothelial cells, these findings represent a first step towards establishing that endothelial cells regulate TEM tunnel formation and width <italic>in vivo</italic>. Such a hypothesis is supported by previous findings showing that RhoA inhibition reduces paracellular permeability while dramatically increasing transcellular permeability, and that ADP-ribosyltransferases targeting RhoA increase vascular permeability to the point of animal death when TEM enlargement is no longer controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Collectively, these findings ascribe to variations in caveolin-1 expression a bidirectional impact on host susceptibility to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, pointing for a possible role of TEM tunnels.</p>

Individual PMSs were aspirated using a casein-passivated micropipette connected to a piezo-stage (PI, Karlsruhe, Germany) for manipulation and to a hydrostatic aspiration control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>). Micropipettes were made in house with borosilicate capillaries pulled into fine cones using a laser pipette puller (P-2000, Sutter Instrument Co.) and microforged at the desired inner diameter (3-4 µm) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). For the extraction of tethers from PMSs, we used optical tweezers built in-house that consisted of a single fixed laser beam (infrared laser wavelength of 1070 nm) focused through a 60X water objective mounted on a confocal microscope (Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). To pull tethers from PMSs, we coated streptavidin beads (3 µm in diameter, Spherotech) with fibronectin, which allowed the beads to bind to PMSs. A membrane tether was generated by bringing the micropipette-held PMS into contact with a bead trapped by the optical tweezers, and then by moving the PMS away from the bead. After extraction, the tether was held at a constant length between 2 and 5 μm, and tether forces were measured during gradual increase in aspiration pressure and thus PMS tension. At a given membrane tension, the corresponding tether force was measured at least 30 s after the pressure change and when equilibration was established. Analysis was performed as described below.

<p>Considering the experimental results shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and using the estimate <italic>κ</italic> ∼ (<italic>N</italic>·<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>) <sup>-1</sup> based on <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Eq. 5</xref>, we deduced an effective bending rigidity after silencing cavin-1/PTRF. These approximate estimates can be refined using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. 4</xref> directly, which also considers variations in membrane tension. The following expression for the bending rigidity is thus obtained:</p>

The TEM maximum area, <italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub>, is the median not the average value because the median is a more robust estimator in the presence of a few extremely large values.

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical tests were performed using the R Software v4.2.1(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.R-project.org/">https://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>), along with packages lme4 (1.1-30) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>), lmerTest (v3.1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>), emmeans (v1.8.0), except for the F-actin mesh size where the Prism Software was used. All experiments were repeated at least three times to ensure reproducibility and corresponding variability was accounted for in statistical analyses using mixed-effect regressions, with a random intercept estimated for every technical replicate. In particular, Binomial outcomes (e.g. presence/absence) were analysed using mixed-effect logistic regression. Continuous measurements (e.g. TEM area) were investigated with a Gamma log-link function in a mixed-effect framework. Contrasts between multiple pairs of categorical predictors were calculated through estimated marginal means with Tukey’s correction. P-values were calculated as indicated in the respective figure legends. P-values were considered statistically significant at P ≤ 0.05. Significance levels are indicated as follows: ns: not significant if <italic>P</italic> &gt;0.05; * : <italic>P</italic> ≤0.05; **: P ≤0.01; ***: P ≤0.001; ****: ≤0.0001.</p>

Western blot shows the fraction of ADP-ribosylated RhoA in vitro as detected with streptavidin–peroxidase (IB: Biotin-ADPr) i.e. not modified during cell intoxication. Immunoblotting with an anti-RhoA antibody (IB: RhoA) revealed equal RhoA protein levels. Immunoblotting with an anti-GAPDH antibody revealed equal protein loading. Blots are representative of n=3 independent experiments. The graph shows the mean values of the blot signal intensities ± s.ds. from n=3 independent experiments. Values correspond to the signal intensities of biotin-tagged ADP-ribosylated RhoA (Biotin-ADPr) normalized to those of RhoA and GAPDH IB signals. Values are expressed as a percentage compared with the intensity of the siCTRL-transfected untreated cells, which was set to 100%.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Because of the role of membrane tension in the process, and that caveloae regulate membrane tension, the authors looked at the formation of TEMs in cells depleted of Caveolin1 and Cavin1 (PTRF): They found a higher propensity to form TEMs, spontaneously (a rare event) and after toxin treatment, in both Caveolin 1 and Cavin 1. They show that in both siRNA-Caveolin1 and siRNA-Cavin1 cells, the cytoplasm is thinner. They show that in siCaveolin1 only, the dynamics of opening are different, with notably much larger TEMs. From the dynamic model of opening, they predict that this should be due to a lower bending rigidity of the membrane. They measure the bending rigidity from Cell-generated Giant liposomes and find that the bending rigidity is reduced by approx. 50%.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They also nicely show that caveolin1 KO mice are more susceptible to death from infections with pathogens that create TEMs.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is well-conducted and nicely written. There are however a few details that should be addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Morel et al. aims to identify some potential mechano-regulators of transendothelial cell macro-aperture (TEM). Guided by the recognized role of caveolar invaginations in buffering the membrane tension of cells, the authors focused on caveolin-1 and associated regulator PTRF. They report a comprehensive in vitro work based on siRNA knockdown and optical imaging approach complemented with an in vivo work on mice, a biophysical assay allowing measurement of the mechanical properties of membranes, and a theoretical analysis inspired by soft matter physics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors should be complimented for this multi-faceted and rigorous work. The accumulation of pieces of evidence collected from each type of approach makes the conclusion drawn by the authors very convincing, regarding the new role of cavolin-1 as an individual protein instead of the main molecular component of caveolae. On a personal note, I was very impressed by the quality of STORM images (Fig. 2) which are very illuminating and useful, in particular for validating some hypotheses of the theoretical analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While this work pins down the key role of caveolin-, its mechanism remains to be further investigated. The hypotheses proposed by the authors in the discussions about the link between caveolin and lipids/cholesterol are very plausible though challenging. Even though we may feel slightly frustrated by the absence of data in this direction, the quality and merit of this paper remain.</p>
<p>- The analogy with dewetting processes drawn to derive the theoretical model is very attractive. However, although part of the model has already been published several times by the same group of authors, the definition of the effective membrane rigidity of a plasma membrane including the underlying actin cortex, was very vague and confusing. Here, for the first time, thanks to the STORM analysis, the authors show that HUVECs intoxicated by ExoC3 exhibit a loose and defective cortex with a significantly increased mesh size. This argues in favor of the validity of Helfrich formalism in this context. Nonetheless, there remains a puzzle. Experimentally, several TEMs are visible within one cell. Theoretically, the authors consider a simultaneous opening of several pores and treat them in an additive manner. However, when one pore opens, the tension relaxes and should prevent the opening of subsequent pores. Yet, experimentally, as seen from the beautiful supplementary videos, several pores open one after the other. This would suggest that the tension is not homogeneous within an intoxicated cell or that equilibration times are long. One possibility is that some undegraded actin pieces of the actin cortex may form a barrier that somehow isolates one TEM from a neighboring one. Could the authors look back at their STORM data and check whether intoxicated cells do not exhibit a bimodal population of mesh sizes and possibly provide a mapping of mesh size at the scale of a cell? In particular, it is quite striking that while bending rigidity of the lipid membrane is expected to set the maximal size of the aperture, most TEMs are well delimited with actin rings before closing. Is it because the surrounding loose actin is pushed back by the rim of the aperture? Could the authors better explain why they do not consider actin as a player in TEM opening?</p>
<p>- Instead of delegating to the discussion the possible link between caveolin and lipids as a mechanism for the enhanced bending rigidity provided by caveolin-1, it could be of interest for the readership to insert the attempted (and failed) experiments in the result section. For instance, did the authors try treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin that extracts cholesterol (and disrupts caveolar and clathrin pits) but supposedly keeps the majority of the pool of individual caveolins at the membrane?</p>
<p>- Tether pulling experiments on Plasma membrane spheres (PMS) are real tours de force and the results are quite convincing: a clear difference in bending rigidity is observed in controlled and caveolin knock-out PMS. However, one recurrent concern in these tether-pulling experiments is to be sure that the membrane pulled in the tether has the same composition as the one in the PMS body. The presence of the highly curved neck may impede or slow down membrane proteins from reaching the tether by convective or diffusive motion. Could the authors propose an experiment to demonstrate that caveolin-1 proteins are not restricted to the body of the PMS and can access to the nanometric tether?</p>

<p>We thank the Editors and the Reviewers for their comments on the importance of our work “showing a new role of caveolin-1 as an individual protein instead of the main molecular component of caveolae” in building membrane rigidity and also for constructive and thoughtful remarks that shall allow to improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>Indeed, we here establish the contributing role of caveolin-1 to membrane mechanics by a molecular mechanism that needs to be further addressed. To that respect, we thank the reviewers for suggesting avenues to improve the presentation and discussion of our hypotheses based on results of theoretical model and independent biophysical measurements in tube pulling from plasma membrane spheres, which concur to support the key role of caveolin-1 in building membrane rigidity.</p>
<p>To fulfill the recommendations of the reviewers we will amend the manuscript as discussed below.</p>

<p>In the current study, we did not find the technical conditions allowing us to properly address the role of cholesterol in the dynamics of TEM due to adverse effects of cholesterol depletion with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin on the morphology of HUVEC. To answer the Reviewer remark, we will mention our attempts to address a role of cholesterol in the dynamics of TEM in the results section. Moreover, we will thoroughly discuss in the section related to data of tube pulling experiments from PMS that caveolin-1 by controlling membrane lipid composition, may indirectly affect membrane rigidity (see comments below about the presence or absence of caveolin-1 in the tubes pulled from PMS and our hypotheses about a direct or indirect role of caveolin-1 in the control of membrane rigidity).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript, we will clearly define the membrane bending rigidity parameter, which was missing in the current version. The membrane bending rigidity is defined as the energy required to locally bend the membrane surface. In a liposome, a rigorous derivation leads to a relationship between the membrane tension relation and the variation of the projected area, which are related by the bending rigidity: this relationship is known as the Helfrich law. This statistical physics approach is only rigorously valid for a liposome, whereas its application to a cell is questionable due to the presence of cytoskeletal forces acting on the membrane. Nevertheless, application of the Helfrich law to cell membranes may be granted on short time scales, before active cell tension regulation takes place (Sens P and Plastino J, 2015 J Phys Condens Matter), especially in cases where cytoskeletal forces play a modest role, such as red blood cells (Helfrich W 1973 Z Naturforsch C). The fact that the cytoskeletal structure and actomyosin contraction are significantly disrupted upon cell intoxication-driven inhibition of the small GTPase RhoA supports the applicability of Helfrich law to describe TEM opening. Because of the presence of proteins, carbohydrates, and the adhesion of the remaining actin meshwork after toxin treatment, we expect the Helfrich relationship to somewhat differ from the case of a pure lipidic membrane. We account for these effects via an “effective bending rigidity”, a term used in the detailed discussion of the model hypotheses, which corresponds to an effective value describing the relationship between membrane tension and projected area variation in our cells. These considerations will be included in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Here, for the first time, thanks to the STORM analysis, the authors show that HUVECs intoxicated by ExoC3 exhibit a loose and defective cortex with a significantly increased mesh size.

Theoretically, the authors consider a simultaneous opening of several pores and treat them in an additive manner.

</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed by the Reviewer, we expect that membrane tension is neither a purely global nor a purely local parameter. Opening of a TEM will relax membrane tension over a certain distance, not over the whole cell. Moreover, once the TEM closes back, membrane tension will increase again. This spatial and temporal localization of membrane tension relaxation explains that the opening of a first TEM does not preclude the opening of a second one. On the other hand, membrane tension is not a purely local property. Indeed, we observe that when two TEMs enlarge next to each other, their shape becomes anisotropic, as their enlargement is mutually hampered in the region separating them. We account for this interaction by treating TEM membrane relaxation in an additive fashion. We emphasize that this simplified description is used to predict maximum TEM size, corresponding to the time at which TEM interaction is strongest. As the reviewer points out, it would be more questionable to use this additive treatment to predict the likelihood of nucleation of a new TEM, which is not done here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Could the authors look back at their STORM data and check whether intoxicated cells do not exhibit a bimodal population of mesh sizes and possibly provide a mapping of mesh size at the scale of a cell?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address the question raised by the Reviewer we decided to plot the whole distribution of mesh sizes in addition to the average value per cell. We did not observe a bimodal distribution but rather a very heterogeneous distribution of mesh size going up to a few microns square in all conditions of siRNA treatments.  Moreover, we did not observe a specific pattern in the distribution of mesh size at the scale of the cell, with very large mesh sizes being surrounded by small ones. We also did not observe any specific pattern for the localization of TEM opening, as described in the paper, making the correlation between mesh size and TEM opening difficult.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Actin ring assembly and stiffening is indeed a player in TEM opening, and it is included in our differential equation describing TEM opening dynamics (second term on the left-hand side of Eq. 3). In some cases, actin ring assembly is the dominant player, such as in TEM opening after laser ablation (ex novo TEM opening), as we previously reported (Stefani et al. 2017 Nat comm). In contrast, here we investigate de novo TEM opening, for which we expect that bending rigidity can be estimated without accounting for actin assembly, as we previously reported (Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al. 2012 Phys Rev Lett). Such a bending rigidity estimate (Eq. 5) is obtained by considering two different time scales: the time scale of membrane tension relaxation, governed by bending rigidity, and the time scale of cable assembly, governed by actin dynamics. We expect the first-time scale to be shorter, and thus the maximum size of de novo TEMs to be mainly constrained by membrane tension relaxation. The discussion of these two different time scales will be added to the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Tether pulling experiments on Plasma membrane spheres (PMS) are real tours de force and the results are quite convincing: a clear difference in bending rigidity is observed in controlled and caveolin knock-out PMS.

</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out by the reviewer, a concern with tube pulling experiments is related to the dynamics of equilibration of membrane composition between the nanotube and the rest of the membrane. In our experiments, we have waited about 30 seconds after tube pulling and after changing membrane tension. We have checked that after this time, the force remained constant, implying that we have performed experiments of tube pulling from PMS in technical conditions of equilibrium that ensure that lipids and membrane proteins had enough time to reach the tether by convective or diffusive motion. We will add a representative example of force vs time plot in our revision. In principle, this could be further checked using cells expressing GFP-caveolin-1 to generate PMS as done in Sinha et al., 2011: a steady protein signal in the tube will further confirm the equilibration, provided that caveolin is recruited in the nanotube due to mechanical reasons. Indeed, since caveolin-1 is inserted in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane, when a nanotube is pulled towards the exterior of the cell as in our experiments, we can expect 2 situations depending on the ability of caveolin-1 to deform membranes, which is not clear, in particular after the paper of Porta et al, Sci. Adv., 2022. i) If caveolin-1 (Cav1) does not bend membranes, it could be recruited in the nanotubes, at a density similar to the PMS body. The tube force measurement in this case would reflect the bending rigidity of the PMS membrane. Then, Cav1 could stiffen membrane either as a stiff inclusion at high density or/and by affecting lipid composition, as suggested in our text. ii) If Cav1 bends the membrane (i.e. it has a non-zero spontaneous curvature), it should create a positive curvature considering the geometry of the caveolae, opposite to the curvature of the nanotubes that we pull, and thus be excluded of the nanotubes. In this case, the force would reflect the bending rigidity of the membrane depleted of Cav1 and should be the same in both types of experiments (WT and Cav1 depleted conditions) if the lipid composition remains unchanged upon Cav1 depletion. Our measurements suggest again that Cav1 depletion affects the plasma membrane composition, probably by reducing the quantity of sphingomyelin and cholesterol. Note that the presence of a very reduced concentration of Cav1 as compared to the plasma membrane has been reported in tunneling nanotubes (TNT) connecting two neighboring cells (A. Li et al., Front. Cell Dev. Biol., 2022). These TNTs have typical diameters of similar scale than diameters of tubes pulled from PMS. Some of us have addressed these specific questions related to Cav-1 spontaneous curvature and its effect on the lipid composition of the plasma membrane in two separate manuscripts (in preparation). They represent comprehensive studies by themselves that clarify these points. We propose to add this discussion in the manuscript, with perspectives on future studies, but stressing the point that the presence of Cav1 stiffens plasma membranes, and that the exact origin of this effect must be further investigated.</p>
