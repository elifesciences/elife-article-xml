<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Why does a normal cell possibly harboring genetic mutations in oncogene or tumor suppressor genes becomes malignant and develops a tumor is a subject of intense debate. Various theories have been proposed but their experimental test has been hampered by the unpredictable and improbable malignant transformation of single cells. Here using an optogenetic approach we permanently turn on an oncogene (KRASG12V) in a single cell of a zebrafish brain that, only in synergy with the transient co-activation of a reprogramming factor (VENTX/NANOG/OCT4), undergoes a deterministic malignant transition and robustly and reproducibly develops within 6 days into a full-blown tumor. The controlled way in which a single cell can thus be manipulated to give rise to cancer lends support to the “ground state theory of cancer initiation” through “short-range dispersal” of the first malignant cells preceding tumor growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>How cancer arises from a single normal cell is still the subject of active debate, affecting intervention strategies. While many cells may harbor oncogenic mutations, only a few unpredictably end-up developing a full-blown tumor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Various theories have been proposed to explain that transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, but none has been tested <italic>in vivo</italic> at the single cell level. Cancer initiation is thus believed to be a <italic>rare</italic> event taking place at the level of <italic>individual cells</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> arising as a result of the accumulation of genetic mutations in so called Mut-driver genes (oncogenes such as KRAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, tumor suppressor genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> such as TP53 or life-span<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> genes such as TERT). Notably, mutant KRAS is the most frequent driver of several cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>: about 27% of all human cancers, 45% of colorectal and 90% of pancreatic cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been shown that genes involved in embryonic development, pluri/multipotency and cell reprogramming such as VENTX/NANOG and POU5/OCT4 are abnormally reactivated in late cancer stages, where acting as Epigenetic Drivers (Epi-Drivers) they empower cancer cells with Cancer Stem Cell (CSCs) features, resistance to anti-cancer therapies and potential for cancer recurrence/relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Although it is evident that such Epi-Drivers confer a selective advantage to CSCs in a full-blown cancer, whether they play a role during the early phases of malignant transformation is still unknown.</p>
<p>Current approaches to the study of cancer use constitutive or conditional expression of Mut-driver (or Epi-driver genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>) in specific tissues, i.e. in many cells, even though only a small subset of these cells eventually leads to the growth of tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, often observed when the tumor already consists of many thousands of heterogeneous abnormal cells. Hence, carcinogenetic processes observed among sibling organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> occur with variable latency period from the onset of induction, at different locations and develop asynchronously. As a result, the initial stages of tumorigenesis are difficult to study, the state of the cell(s) of origin difficult to assess and control while its cellular environment is perturbed by the induced expression of the Mut-or Epi-driver genes. Due to the rarity of the event <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, a statistically relevant single-cell tracking and characterization of the early stages of tumorigenesis has therefore never been done. This emphasises the need to predict or control the cell undergoing malignant transformation <italic>in vivo</italic> in order to pave the way for a study of the cellular and molecular events involved in the initial stages of tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>To address these issues, we have developed an optogenetic approach to control the expression of an oncogene in a single cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, with the goals of: (1) measuring the probability of the malignant transformation of a single cell in a live organism in various backgrounds and (2) tracking and characterising the development of a tumor from the original cell. In the following we show that the synergy between only two factors: the oncogene kRasG12V and a reprogramming factor (Ventx, Nanog or Oct4) increases the probability of carcinogenesis from a single cell by many orders of magnitude when compared to the expression of either of these genes (or none).</p>
<p>Optogenetics approaches allow for the photocontrol and monitoring of the activity of biomolecules <italic>in vivo</italic>. The approach we developed uses a photoactivable analog of tamoxifen (caged cyclofen, cCYC) to control the activity of proteins fused to the ERT-receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (a modified estrogen binding domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). These protein constructs are sequestered by cytoplasmic chaperones. Once cCYC is uncaged by light (with one-photon illumination at ∼375 nm or two-photon at ∼750 nm), cyclofen (CYC) is released<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. It binds to the ERT-receptor and releases the fused protein (e.g. a Cre-ERT recombinase) from its complex with cytoplasmic chaperones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We used this approach to photocontrol the activity of a Cre/loxP recombination system in a transgenic zebrafish line (Tg(<italic>actin</italic>:loxP-EOS-stop-loxP-KRASG12V-T2A-H2B-mTFP; <italic>ubi</italic>:Cre-ERT; <italic>myl7</italic>:EGFP) carrying a floxable (loxP flanked) EOS gene (coding for a green fluorescent protein) upstream from the oncogene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> (KRASG12V). In such a transgenic zebrafish line hereafter referred as KRASG12V line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig.S1B</xref>) the expression of EOS can be switched to KRASG12V and H2B-mTFP (nuclear blue fluorescence) upon 1h incubation in cCYC, followed by washing and UV (365 nm) cCYC uncaging which triggers CRE-ERT activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>); mTFP fluorescence can be observed about 30min post-illumination (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>) and is stably maintained in zebrafish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>). Consistent with an acquired refractory cell state and a loss of oncogenic competence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, whole body expression of the oncogene at 1dpf did not result in tumorigenesis. Notice that consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, where cCYC stability has been validated both <italic>in vitro</italic> (by chemical analyses), and <italic>in vivo</italic> (with fluorescent reporters of uncaging), in absence of illumination no spontaneous uncaging of cCYC and thus activation of the oncogene (i.e. blue fluorescent cells) is observed. Notice also that once cCYC is uncaged embryos are maintained in E3 medium with no cyclofen and thus no activation of the oncogene.</p>
<p>To test for the possible impact of a reprogramming factor on the malignant transition, embryos from this transgenic line were injected at the one-cell stage with the mRNA of a construct consisting of a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) fused with a reprogramming factor (Ventx, Nanog or Oct4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig.S2</xref>). The resulting protein (e.g. Ventx-GR) is sequestered by cytoplasmic chaperones and transiently activated upon incubation of zebrafish in Dexamethasone (DEX) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). Activation of the oncogene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> at 1dpf, if and only if followed by transient activation of Ventx (or Nanog or Oct4) did yield reproductible hyperplasic outgrowths in many different tissues (including brain, intestine, pancreas and liver; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B-E</xref>). Immuno-histo-chemistry detection of phospho-ERK activity (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>), Hematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>) and RT-qPCR of selected genes (Figs. S5; S6A,B) all display features associated with tumorigenesis. None of the controls (activation of kRasG12V only, Ventx-GR only, incubation in cyclofen or dexamethasone, etc.) developed hyperplasia, but rather grew into normal zebrafish (Figs. S1B,C; S3A). These controls imply that the observed tumor is only a result of the joint activation of kRasG12V (permanently) and a reprogramming factor (transiently).</p>
<p>Since both kRasG12V and Ventx have been reported to play a role in brain cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, we decided to activate the oncogene kRasG12V at 1dpf in a single normal cell of the brain of a transgenic zebrafish (injected with the mRNA of Ventx-GR at 1 cell stage). Activation of the oncogene in a single cell was achieved by 1h incubation in cCYC, followed by washing and illumination at 405nm to uncage cCyc in a small area (diameter ∼80 μm) of the brain (in the vicinity of the otic vesicle) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Notice that following uncaging the embryos are maintained in a cyclofen free E3 medium.</p>
<p>Subsequent to cCYC uncaging, with probability ∼50% the oncogene is activated in a single cell of the illuminated area (activation statistics is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>), identified within ∼1h by the blue fluorescence of its nuclear marker (H2B-mTFP), see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref>, S7. H2B-mTFP positive cells are only observed at the site of illumination (i.e. brain), attesting to the precision of our optogenetic method (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This observation specifies whether one, two or more cells were activated (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>) within ∼1h post-illumination. Notice that activation of the oncogene alone does not give rise to cancer (the activated cell usually disappears within a few days, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10A</xref>), which implies that the proliferation of kRasG12V positive (mTFP<sup>+</sup>, blue fluorescent) cells - reported next - is not due to late activation of the oncogene (and its fluorescent marker).</p>

<p>Indeed, if and only if following the local expression of the oncogene, Ventx-GR is transiently activated (by 24h incubation in dexamethasone) does the cell divide and proliferate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B-C</xref>, S8, S9). We observed that at 1-day post induction (dpi) ∼50% of the induced cells had divided and expanded clonally by a factor ∼3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).

<p>In parallel with tumor mass formation in the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), we observed that some cells of the progeny re-localized to new loci far from the brain, such as the heart (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, the digestive tract (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6D</xref>) and the trunk (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6C</xref>, <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig.S8B</xref>). We therefore deduce that the transient activation of Ventx alters the state of a cell expressing a mutated oncogene (i.e. KRASG12V) and induces its malignant transformation <italic>in vivo</italic>, with tumorigenic potential and the capacity to generate invasive progeny. Notice that metastatic cells must be the progeny of the initial (blue fluorescent) cell as the larvae are incubated in embryo medium with no cCYC. Furthermore, <bold>absent VentX activation we do not observe proliferation</bold> and metastatic behaviour, rather the initially induced cell disappears, see <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig.S10A</xref>.</p>
<p>Of the larvae in which a few (1-6) cells were expressing the oncogene and in which Ventx was transiently activated (KR+VX cell), all (N = 30) developed tumors within 5 dpi. The frequency of tumor development is therefore F<sub>1</sub>=1. Conversely the probability for such a cell to not develop a tumor is F<sub>0</sub>=0. Due to the finite size of the sample, we estimate the probability of tumor development from a single cell to be: P<sub>1</sub> &gt; 80% (χ<sup>2</sup> = 3,75; df=1).</p>
<p>To definitely confirm the carcinogenic nature of the KR+VX induced cells we isolated and injected a single cell from a hyperplasic tissue (identified by the blue fluorescence of its nucleus) into a naïve host zebrafish larva. This led to integration, migration and colonization of the host tissues by the progeny of the transplanted cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>), with strong pERK activity detected in tumor masses of the host (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Out of 52 transplanted host zebrafish, 31 developed tumors, a probability of tumor development (60%) consistent with previously reported efficiency of tumor cells transplantation in zebrafish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. The capacity of the progeny of the induced cells to metastasize and develop a tumor mass when transplanted in a naïve zebrafish is - to the best of our knowledge - the <bold>operational definition of a malignant tumor</bold>. This result definitely confirms the cancerous nature of cells expressing a mutated oncogene and exposed to the transient activation of Ventx, with subsequent alteration of the homeostasis. Notice that injection into a naïve larva of an oncogene expressing cell (identified by its nuclear blue fluorescence) which <bold>did not</bold> experience the transient activation of a reprogramming factor <bold>does not</bold> yield a tumor and disappears within a few days (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The surprising frequency of somatic mutations occurring in physiologically normal tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> raises the question of what combinations of events are sufficient for the malignant transformation of a single cell and the rise of the cell of origin of cancer. The robust deterministic process of single-cell cancer induction that we uncovered suggests that the aberrant reactivation of Epi-Driver genes involved in reprogramming/pluripotency (such as VENTX/NANOG, POU5/OCT4) might be relevant to the irreversible malignant transformation of a cell. Reprogramming Epi-Drivers are important regulators of cell viability, survival and proliferation in several cellular contexts, from embryonic stem cells to cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Due to their capacity to modulate epigenetic memory and cell plasticity, these reprogramming factors may drive the early stages of malignant transformation <italic>in vivo</italic> once (re)activated aberrantly. They likely share some mechanism(s) with processes such as induced nuclear-reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, pluripotency maintenance and/or endogenous cell reprogramming during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, consistent with our results, the reactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> of the Neural Crest (NC) Progenitor program (possibly via the stochastic expression of VENTX/NANOG and/or POU5/OCT4) has been shown in BRAF/p53 double mutant cells to yield NC-related tumors <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.We surmise that activation of Epi-Driver genes in NC-related tumors might confer predictable tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Since cells carrying cancer-causing mutations do not deterministically developed cancers <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, we suggest that the probability of a mutated cell to enter into malignant transformation, or to maintain its physiological functions despite mutations, correlates with the probability of the reactivation of reprogramming factors. Our results support a “Vogelgram”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> two-step model (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">FIG. 5</xref>) for irreversible single-cell malignant transformation <italic>in vivo</italic>, mirroring the two hits hypothesis proposed by Berenblum and Shubik<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>

<caption><title>A two-steps “Vogelgram” model of deterministic and irreversible single-cell malignant transformation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</title>
<p>Within a healthy tissue, a normal cell (in light grey) acquires (step 1) genetic mutation(s) in driver oncogene(s) (Mut-Drivers such as kRASG12V). Such a mutant cell (in blue, referred as a preprocancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> cell) can (step 2) aberrantly activate the expression of Epi-Drivers involved in pluripotency/reprogramming (e.g. VENTX/NANOG, POU5/OCT4) thus undergoing deterministic and irreversible malignant cell transformation (red cell, the Cell of Origin of Cancer); (step 3) <italic>in situ</italic> short-range dispersal of the early malignant cells and (step 4) further progression to cancer mass and to the appearance of metastatic cells. Inversely, the mutant (preprocancer) cell (in blue) can maintain its physiological functions and be eventually eliminated from the healthy tissue.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="577941v3_fig5.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Thus, the appearance of Mut-Drivers in a normal (preprocancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>) cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> within healthy tissue would act as a permissive but insufficient initiator for malignant cell transformation. Despite the frequency of mutational insults, which are often caused by external cues (chemical carcinogens, UV, etc…) or senescence/ageing, it is known that surveillance mechanisms like cell competition between wild-type and mutated cells safeguard tissue homeostasis and results in active elimination of mutant cells from the tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Our data imply that the aberrant reactivation of Epi-Driver genes involved in reprogramming/pluripotency may promote the irreversible and deterministic malignant transformation in the cell of origin of cancer leading to carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is further strengthened by the observation that the variation in cancer risk among tissues can be related to the number of stem cell divisions and tissue renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. The aberrant reactivation (or maintenance) of Epi-Driver genes in these regenerative events, in cooperation with incident mutations, might be the key deterministic factor in the switching of a normal/healthy cell into the first cell of origin of cancer.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the results reported here are compatible with the recently proposed “ground state theory of cancer initiation7”. According to that theory a malignant transformation may occur in a cell harboring an oncogenic mutation upon a change of its functional state (its “ground state”). Here the transient activation of a reprogramming factor (i.e. Ventx, Nanog or Oct4) possibly synergizes with the oncogene to alter the epigenetic and functional state of the cell allowing its transformation into a tumorigenic cell.</p>
<p>This may also explain the apparent discrepancy between the present deterministic and rapid tumor development upon activation in a single cell of both kRasG12V and a reprogramming factor and the reports of stochastic and random tumor development over weeks following activation of kRasG12V in a whole tissue (brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, pancreas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> or intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>). In the latter case, transformed cells may have been triggered to undergo a malignant transformation by the stochastic activation of a reprogramming factor/Epi-Driver, which is consistent with the recent finding that cancer initiation might occurs by transient perturbations of epigenetic regulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Importantly, our observation that the progeny of the cell(s) of origin of cancer display a short-range dispersal within the tissue during the earliest phases of tumorigenesis and prior to the effective appearance of tumor mass corroborates a recent theoretical model predicting such an early dispersal during carcinogenesis to explain heterogeneity, therapeutic resistance and tumor relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Being the first experiments to predictably and non-invasively control the malignant transformation of a single cell in an unaltered microenvironment our approach opens a new vista on the study of “the cell of origin of cancer”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, an acknowledged enigma of cancer research. As such our results raise many questions: what mechanisms are at work in the transition from the preprocancer state to a tumorigenic state? Is the aberrant reactivation of reprogramming factors a key step in the initiation of carcinogenesis, independent of age, tissue or oncogenic mutation? Do drugs against reprogramming factors reduce the probability of carcinogenesis? Conversely, do some carcinogens (e.g. environmental pollutants, pesticides, endocrine disruptors etc…) act by reactivating those factors?</p>
<p>By allowing for specific and reproductible single cell malignant transformation <italic>in vivo</italic>, our optogenetic approach opens the way for a quantitative study of the initial stages of cancer at the single cell level (e.g. tracking and characterization), that will allow one to address many of these questions.</p>

<title>Caged Cyclofen (cCYC) treatment and UV uncaging</title>
<p>To induce kRASG12V expression, 24hpf embryos were incubated in 6μM caged cyclofen (cCYC) for 1 hour (in the dark), rinsed in E3 medium followed by 5 min. photo-activation with a ∼365 nm UV lamp (measured intensity: 4mW/cm<sup>2</sup>). They were then transferred back to E3 medium (with no cCYC) + 10 µM DEX (to release Ventx-GR from its complex with cytoplasmic chaperones). The embryos at 1 dpi were washed 3x in E3 medium to remove DEX. From thereon embryos are exposed neither to cCYC, nor to DEX. For this experiment, we used a benchtop UV lamp (Fisher VL-6-L) which emits a peak wavelength at 365 nm with a FWHM (full width at half maximum) of 40 nm and delivers on the illuminated sample a typical photon flux of ∼1,25 10<sup>-4</sup> Einstein/(s·m<sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the work by Scerbo et al, the authors aim to better understand the open question of what factors constrain cells that are genetically predisposed to form cancer (e.g. those with a potentially cancer-causing mutation like activated Ras) to only infrequently undergo this malignant transformation, with a focus on the influence of embryonic or pluripotency factors (e.g. VENTX/NANOG). Using genetically defined zebrafish models, the authors can inducibly express the KRASG12V oncogene using a combination of Cre/Lox transgenes further controlled by optogenetically inducible Cre-activated (CreER fusion that becomes active with light-induced uncaging of a tamoxifen-analogue in a targeted region of the zebrafish embryo). They further show that transient expression and activation of a pluripotency factor (e.g. Ventx fused to a GR receptor that is activated with addition of dexamethasone) must occur in the model in order for overgrowth of cells to occur. This paper describes a genetically tractable and modifiable system for studying the requirements for inducing cellular hyperplasia in a whole organism by combining overexpression of canonical genetic drivers of cancer (like Ras) with epigenetic modifiers (like specific transcription factors), which could be used to study an array of combinations and temporal relationships of these cancer drivers/modifiers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The combination of Cre/lox inducible gene expression with potentially localized optogenetic induction (CreER and uncaging of tamoxifen analogues) of recombination as well as inducible activation of a transcription factor expressed via mRNA injection (GR-fusion to the TF and dex induction) offers a flexible system for manipulating cell growth, identity, and transcriptional programs. With this system, the authors establish that Ras activation and at least transient Ventx overexpression are together required to induce a hyperproliferative phenotype in zebrafish tissues.</p>
<p>The ability to live image embryos over the course of days with inducible fluorophores indicating recombination events and transgene overexpression offers a tractable in vivo system for studying hyperplastic cells in the context of a whole organism.</p>
<p>The transplant experiments demonstrate the ability of the induced hyperplastic cells to grow upon transfer to new host.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is minimal quantitation of key aspects of the system, most critically in the efficiency of activation of the Ras-TFP fusion (Fig 1) in, purportedly, a single cell. The authors note &quot;On average the oncogene is then activated in a single cell, identified within ~1h by the blue fluorescence of its nuclear marker) but no additional quantitative information is provided. For a system that is aimed at &quot;a statistically relevant single-cell</p>
<p>
tracking and characterization of the early stages of tumorigenesis&quot;, such information seems essential.</p>
<p>The authors indicate that a single cell is &quot;initiated&quot; (Fig 2) using the laser optogenetic technique, but without definitive genetic lineage tracing, it is not possible to conclude that cells expressing TFP distant from the target site near the ear are daughter cells of the claimed single &quot;initiated&quot; cell. A plausible alternative explanation is 1) that the optogenetic targeting is more diffuse (i.e. some of the light of the appropriate wavelength hits other cells nearby due to reflection/diffraction), so these adjacent cells are additional independent &quot;initiated&quot; cells or 2) that the uncaged tamoxifen analogue can diffuse to nearby cells and allow for CreER activation and recombination. In Fig 2B, the claim is made that &quot;the activated cell has divided, giving rise to two cells&quot; - unless continuously imaged or genetically traced, this is unproven. In addition, it appears that Figures S3 and S4 are showing that hyperplasica can arise in many different tissues (including intestine, pancreas, and liver, S4C) with broad Ras + Ventx activation (while unclear from the text, it appears these embryos were broadly activated and were not &quot;single cell activated using the set-up in Fig 1E? This should be clarified in the manuscript). In Fig S7 where single cell activation and potential metastasis is discussed, similar gut tissues have TFP+ cells that are called metastatic, but this seems consistent with the possibility that multiple independent sites of initiation are occurring even when focal activation is attempted.</p>
<p>Although the hyperplastic cells are transplantable (Fig 4), the use of the term &quot;cells of origin of cancer&quot; or metastatic cells should be viewed with care in the experiments showing TFP+ cells (Fig 1, 2, 3) in embryos with targeted activation for the reasons noted above.</p>
<p>Comments on latest version:</p>
<p>The authors have clarified and strengthened a number of important conclusions/claims.</p>
<p>In Figure 4, the requirement for both kRas and VentX activation for successful transplant and survival of transplanted activated cells does indeed support the need for both MAPK activation and the reprogramming factor. A limitation remains that, as in a tail vein injection in a mouse model, this may be a better measure of the ability of disbursed cells to survive in the embryo, and not &quot;native&quot; metastatic behavior as cells may just lodge in ectopic sites, and survive, but not exhibit complete metastatic potential. Still, these are interesting and important results about the combination effects of an oncogene and a reprogramming factor.</p>
<p>Further, the addition of Fig 2A and additional explanation in the text on the specificity of the light-induced activation of the Ras and/or VentX supports that transgene induction is indeed limited to one or a few cells. We agree that visual tracking of daughter cells over days is technically challenging and will be a revealing and exciting potential addition in the future.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study employs an optogenetics approach aimed at activating oncogene (KRASG12V) expression in a single somatic cell, with a focus on following the progression of activated cell to examine tumourigenesis probabilities under altered tissue environments. The research explores the role of stemness factors (VENTX/NANOG/OCT4) in facilitating oncogenic RAS (KRASG12V)-driven malignant transformations. Although the evidence provided is incomplete, the authors propose an important mechanism whereby reactivation of re-programming factors correlates with the increased likelihood of a mutant cell undergoing malignant transformation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>· Innovative Use of Optogenetics: The application of optogenetics for precise activation of KRAS in a single cell is valuable to the field of cancer biology, offering an opportunity to uncover insight into cellular responses to oncogenic mutations.</p>
<p>
· Important Observations: The findings concerning stemness factors' role in promoting oncogenic transformation are important, contributing data to the field of cancer biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Lack of Methodological Clarity: The manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of methodologies, making it difficult to fully evaluate the experimental design and reproducibility, rendering incomplete evidence to support the conclusion. Improving methodological transparency and data presentation will crucially strengthen the paper's contributions to understanding the complex processes of tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Sub-optimal Data Presentation and Quality:</p>
<p>
The resolution of images through-out the manuscript are too low. Images presented in Figure 2 and Figure 4 are of very low resolution. It is very hard to distinguish individual cells and in which tissue they might reside.</p>
<p>
Lack of quantitative data and control condition data obtained from images of higher magnification limits the ability to robustly support the conclusions.</p>
<p>Here are some details:</p>
<p>
· Tissue specificity of the cells express KRASG12V oncogene: In this study, the ubiquitin promoter was used to drive oncogenic KRASG12V expression. Despite this, the authors claim to activate KRAS in a single brain cell based on their localized photo-activation strategy. However, upon reviewing the methods section, the description was provided that 'Localized uncaging was performed by illumination for 7 minutes on a Nikon Ti microscope equipped with a light source peaking at 405 nm, Figure 1. The size of the uncaging region was controlled by an iris that defines a circular illumination with a diameter of approximately 80 μm.' It is surprising that an epi-fluorescent microscope with an illumination diameter of around 80μm can induce activation in a single brain cell beneath skin tissue. Additionally, given that the half-life for mTFP maturation is around 60 minutes, it is likely that more cells from a variety of different lineages could be activated, but the fluorescence would not be visible until more than 1-hour post-illumination. Authors might want to provide more evidence to support their claim on the single cell KRAS activation.</p>
<p>
· Stability of cCYC: The manuscript does not provide information on the half-life and stability of cCYC. Understanding these properties is crucial for evaluating the system's reliability and the likelihood of leakiness, which could significantly influence the study's outcomes.</p>
<p>
· Metastatic Dissemination claim: Typically, metastatic cancer cells migrate to and proliferate within specific niches that are conducive to outgrowth, such as the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) or liver. In Figure 3 A, an image showing the presence of mTFP expressing cells in both the head and tail regions of the larva, with additional positive dots located at the fin fold. This is interpreted as &quot;metastasis&quot; by the authors. However, the absence of supportive cellular compartment within the fin-fold tissue makes the presence of mTFP-positive metastatic cells there particularly puzzling. This distribution raises concerns about the spatial specificity of the optogenetic activation protocol.</p>
<p>
The unexpected locations of these signals suggest potential ectopic activation of the KRAS oncogene, which could be occurring alongside or instead of targeted activation. This issue is critical as it could affect the interpretation of whether the observed mTFP signal expansion over time is due to actual cell proliferation and infiltration, or merely a result of ectopic RAS transgene activation.</p>
<p>
· Image Resolution Concerns: The cells depicted in Figure 3C β, which appear to be near the surface of the yolk sac and not within the digestive system as suggested in the MS, underscore the necessity for higher-resolution imaging. Without clearer images, it is challenging to ascertain the exact locations and states of these cells, thus complicating the assessment of experimental results.</p>
<p>
· The cell transplantation experiment is lacking protocol details: The manuscript does not adequately describe the experimental protocols used for cell transplantation, particularly concerning the origin and selection of cells used for injection into individual larvae. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of the results. Such as the source of transplanted cells:</p>
<p>
• If the cells are derived from hyperplastic growths in larvae where RAS and VX (presumably VENTX) were locally activated, the manuscript fails to mention any use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to enrich mTFP-positive cells. Such a method would be crucial for ensuring the specificity of the cells being studied and the validity of the results.</p>
<p>
• If the cells are obtained from whole larvae with induced RAS + VX expression, it is notable and somewhat surprising that the larvae survived up to six days post-induction (6dpi) before cells were harvested for transplantation. This survival rate and the subsequent ability to obtain single cell suspensions raise questions about the heterogeneity of the RAS + VX expressing cells that transplanted.</p>
<p>
· Unclear Experimental Conditions in Figure S3B: The images in Figure S3B lack crucial details about the experimental conditions. It is not specified whether the activation of KRAS was targeted to specific cells or involved whole-body exposure. This information is essential for interpreting the scope and implications of the results accurately.</p>
<p>
· Contrasting Data in Figure S3C compared to literatures: The graph in Figure S3C indicates that KRAS or KRAS + DEX induction did not result in any form of hyperplastic growth. This observation starkly contrasts with previous literature where oncogenic KRAS expression in zebrafish led to significant hyper-proliferation and abnormal growth, as evidenced by studies such as those published in and Neoplasia (2018), DOI: 10.1016/j.neo.2018.10.002; Molecular Cancer (2015), DOI: 10.1186/s12943-015-0288-2; Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms (2014) DOI: 10.1242/dmm.007831. The lack of expected hyperplasia raises questions about the experimental setup or the specific conditions under which KRAS was expressed. The authors should provide detailed descriptions of the conditions under which the experiments were conducted in Figure S3B and clarifying the reasons for the discrepancies observed in Figure S3C are crucial. The authors should discuss potential reasons for the deviation from previous reports.</p>
<p>
Further comments:</p>
<p>
Throughout the study, KRAS-activated cell expansion and metastasis are two key phenotypes discussed that Ventx is promoting. However, the authors did not perform any experiments to directly show that KRAS+ cells proliferate only in Ventx-activated conditions. The authors also did not show any morphological features or time-lapse videos demonstrating that KRAS+ cells are motile, even though zebrafish is an excellent model for in vivo live imaging. This seems to be a missed opportunity for providing convincing evidence to support the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>
There were minimal experimental details provided for the qPCR data presented in the supplementary figures S5 and S6, therefore, it is hard to evaluate results obtained.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>First, we thank the reviewers for a thorough reading of our paper and some useful comments. A recurrent remark of the reviewers concerns the appearance of kRas-expressing cells (labelled by a nuclear blue fluorescent marker) which we attribute to the progeny of the initially induced cell. The reviewers suggest that these cells may have been obtained through activation of the Cre-recombinase in other cells by cyclofen released from light scattering, via diffusion, leakiness, etc. These remarks are perfectly reasonable from people not familiar with the cyclofen uncaging approach that we are using, but are unwarranted as we shall show below.</p>
<p>We have been using cyclofen uncaging with subsequent activation of a Cre-recombinase (or some other proteins) since 2010 (see ref.34, Sinha et al., Zebrafish 7, 199-204 (2010) and our 2018 review (ref.35, Zhang et al., ChemBioChem 19,1-8 (2018)). In our experiments, the embryos are incubated in the dark in 6µM caged cyclofen (cCyc) and washed in E3 medium (and transferred to a new medium with no cCyc). In these conditions, over many years we never observed activation of the recombinase, i.e. the appearance of the associated fluorescent label in cells of embryos grown in E3 medium. Hence leakiness can be ruled out (in presence of cCyc or in its absence).</p>
<p>Following transfer of the embryos to new E3 medium we illuminate the embryos locally with light at 405nm. In these conditions, cCyc is only partially uncaged and results in activation of Cre-recombinase in only a few cells (1,2, 3, …) within the illuminated region only, namely in the appearance of the kRas-associated nuclear blue fluorescent label in usually one cell (and sometimes in a few more). Data and statistics are now incorporated in the revised manuscript, see Fig.2A and S7. In absence of activation of a reprogramming factor these fluorescently labelled cells disappear within a few days (either via shut-down of their promotor, apoptosis or some other mechanism). The crucial point here is that we see less and not more kRas expressing cells (i.e. with nuclear blue fluorescence) in absence of VentX activation. This observation rules out activation of Cre-recombinase in other cells days after illumination due to leakiness, cyclofen released by light or diffusing from the illumination spot.</p>
<p>To observe many more fluorescent cells days after activation of the initial cell, one needs to transiently activate VentX-GR by overnight incubation in dexamethasone (DEX). Injecting the embryos at 1-cell stage with VentX-GR only or incubating them in DEX (without injection of VentX-GR) does not result in the appearance of more blue fluorescent cells.  Following activation of VentX-GR, the fluorescent cells observed a couple of days after initiation are visualized in E3 medium (i.e. in absence of cyclofen) and are localized to the vicinity of the otic vesicle (the region where the initial cell was activated). In the revised manuscript we show images of these fluorescent cells taken a few days apart in the same embryo in which a single cell was initially activated (Fig.S8). Hence, we attribute these cells to the progeny of the activated cell. Obviously, single cell tracking via time-lapse microscopy would definitely nail down this issue and provide fascinating insight into the initial stages of tumor growth. Unfortunately, immobilization of embryos in the usual medium (e.g. MS222, tricaine) over 5-6 days to track the division and motion of single cells is not possible. We are considering some other possibilities (immobilization in bungarotoxin or via photo-activation of anionic channels), but these challenging experiments are for a future paper.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors then performed allotransplantations of allegedly single fluorescent TICs in recipient larvae and found a large number of fluorescent cells in distant locations, claiming that these cells have all originated from the single transplanted TIC and migrated away. The number of fluorescent cells showed in the recipient larve just after two days is not compatible with a normal cell cycle length and more likely represents the progeny of more than one transplanted cell.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned in the manuscript, we measure the density of cells/nl and inject in the yolk of 2dpf Nacre embryos a volume equivalent to about 1 cell, following published protocols (S.Nicoli and M.Presta, Nat.Prot. 2,2918 (2007)). We further image the injected cell(s) by fluorescence microscopy immediately following injection, as shown in Fig.4A and Fig.S8B. We might miss a few cells but not many. With a typical cell cycle of ~10h the images of tumors in larvae at 3dpt (and not 2dpt) correspond to  ~100 cells. In any case the purpose of this experiment was to show that the progeny of the initial induced cell is capable of developing into a tumor in a naïve fish, which is the operational definition of cancer that we adopted here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The ability to migrate from the injection site should be documented by time-lapse microscopy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated above our purpose here is not to study tumor formation from transplanted cell(s)  but to use that assay as an operational test of cancer. Besides as mentioned earlier single cell tracking in larvea over 3-4dpt is not a trivial task.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Then, the authors conclude that &quot;By allowing for specific and reproducible single cell malignant transformation in vivo, their optogenetic approach opens the way for a quantitative study of the initial stages of cancer at the single cell level&quot;. However, the evidence for these claims are weak and further characterization should be performed to:</p>
<p>(1) Show that they are actually activating the oncogene in a single cell (the magnification is too low and it is difficult to distinguish a single nucleus, labelling of the cell membrane may help to demonstrate that they are effectively activating the oncogene in, or transplanting, a single cell)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript we provide larger magnification of the initial induced cell and show examples of oncogene activation in more than one cell.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The expression of the genes used as markers of tumorigenesis is performed in whole larvae, with only a few transformed cells in them. Changes should be confirmed in FACS sorted fluorescent cells</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When the oncogene is activated in a whole larvae all cells are fluorescent and thus FACS  is of no use for cell sorting. Sorting could be done in larvae where single cells are activated , but then the efficiency of FACS is not good enough to isolate the few fluorescent cells among the many more non-fluorescent ones. We agree that the expression change of the genes used as markers of tumorigenesis is an underestimate of their true change, but our goal at this time is not to precisely measure the change in expression level, but to show that the pattern of change was different from the controls and corresponded to what is expected in tumorigenesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The histology of the so called &quot;tumor masses&quot; is not showing malignant transformation, but at the most just hyperplasia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The histology of the hyperplasic tissues show cellular proliferation with a higher density of nuclear material which is characteristic of tumors, Fig.S4C. Besides the increased expression of pERK in these tissues, Fig.S4A,B is also a hallmark of cancer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the brain, the sections are not perfectly symmetrical and the increase of cellularity on one side of the optic tectum is compatible with this asymmetry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The expected T-shape formed by the sections of the tegmentum and hypothalamus are compatible with the symmetric sections shown in Fg.2D. The asymmetry in the optic tectum is a result of the hyperplasic growth.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The number of fluorescent cells found dispersed in the larvae transplanted with one single TIC after 48 hours will require a very fast cell cycle to generate over 50 cells. Do we have an idea of the cell cycle features of the transplanted TICs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As answered above, the transplanted larvae are shown at 3dpt. With a cell cycle of about 10h, a single cell can give rise to about 100 cells in that time lapse.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper describes a genetically tractable and modifiable system …which could be used to study an array of combinations and temporal relationships of these cancer drivers/modifiers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this referee for its positive comments. We would also like to point out that our approach provides for the first quantitative means to estimate the probability of tumorigenesis from a single cell, an estimate which is crucial in any assessment of cancer malignancy and the effectiveness of prophylactics.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is minimal quantitation of … the efficiency of activation of the Ras-TFP fusion (Fig 1) in, purportedly, a single cell. …, such information seems essential.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added more images of induction of a single (or a few cells) and a plot where the probability of RAS activation in one or a few cells is specified.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors indicate that a single cell is &quot;initiated&quot; (Fig 2) using the laser optogenetic technique, but without definitive genetic lineage tracing, it is not possible to conclude that cells expressing TFP distant from the target site near the ear are daughter cells of the claimed single &quot;initiated&quot; cell. A plausible alternative explanation is 1) that the optogenetic targeting is more diffuse (i.e. some of the light of the appropriate wavelength hits other cells nearby due to reflection/diffraction), so these adjacent cells are additional independent &quot;initiated&quot; cells or 2) that the uncaged tamoxifen analogue can diffuse to nearby cells and allow for CreER activation and recombination.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have addressed this point in our general comments to the reviewers’ remarks. The possibilities mentioned by this reviewer would result in cells expressing TFP in absence of VentX activation, which is NOT the case. Cells expressing TFP away from the initial site are observed DAYS after activation of the oncogene (and TFP) in a single cell and ONLY upon activation of VentX.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Fig 2B, the claim is made that &quot;the activated cell has divided, giving rise to two cells&quot; - unless continuously imaged or genetically traced, this is unproven.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have addressed this remark previously. Tracking of larvae over many days is not possible with the usual protocol using tricaine to immobilize the larvae. Nonetheless, in the revised version we present images of an embryo imaged at various times post activation (1hpi, 3dpi, 7dpi) where proliferation and metastasis of the cells can be observed. We are pursuing other alternatives for time-lapse microscopy over many days, since besides convincing the sceptics, a single cell tracking experiment (possibly coupled with in-situ spatial transcriptomics) will shed a new and fascinating light on the initial stages of tumor growth.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, it appears that Figures S3 and S4 are showing that hyperplasia can arise in many different tissues (including intestine, pancreas, and liver, S4C) with broad Ras + Ventx activation …. This should be clarified in the manuscript).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is true and has been clarified in the new version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Fig S7 where single cell activation and potential metastasis is discussed, similar gut tissues have TFP+ cells that are called metastatic, but this seems consistent with the possibility that multiple independent sites of initiation are occurring even when focal activation is attempted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As mentioned previously this is ruled out by the fact that these cells are observed days after cyclofen uncaging (and TFP activation) and IF AND ONLY IF VentX was activated during the first dpi.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although the hyperplastic cells are transplantable (Fig 4), the use of the term &quot;cells of origin of cancer&quot; or metastatic cells should be viewed with care in the experiments showing TFP+ cells (Fig 1, 2, 3) in embryos with targeted activation for the reasons noted above.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The purpose of this transplantation experiment was to show that cell in which both kRas and VentX have been activated possess the capacity to metastasize and develop a tumor mass when transplanted in a naïve zebrafish. This -  to the best of our knowledge  - is the operational definition of a malignant tumor. Notice also that transplantation of kRAS only activated cells (i.e. without subsequent activation of VentX) does NOT yield tumors, rather the transplanted cell disappears after a few days, see Fig.S10.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study employs an optogenetics approach … to examine tumorigenesis probabilities under altered tissue environments.</p>

<p>We thank this reviewer for this remark, since we believe that the probability to assess the probability of tumorigenesis from a single cell is probably the most significant contribution of this work.</p>

<p>We have been using the cCyc system for about 14 years. We refer the reader to our previous papers and reviews on this methodology. Briefly, cCyc is stable when not illuminated with light around 375nm. Typically, we incubate our embryos in the dark for about 1h before washing, transferring them into E3 medium and illuminating them. Assessing the leakiness of the system is easy as expression of a fluorescent marker is permanently turned on. We have observed none in the conditions of our experiment or in previous works.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have addressed this remark in the introduction and above. Specifically, metastatic and proliferative mTFP-positive cells are observed IF AND ONLY IF VentX is also activated concomitant with activation of kRAS in a single cell. No proliferative cells are observed in absence of VentX activation, or in presence of VentX or Dex alone, or if kRAS has not been activated by cyclofen uncaging.</p>

<p>This discrepancy is discussed in the revised version. First the previous reports consider the development of tumors within 3-4 weeks which we have not studied in detail.

<p>There are reports of kRASG12V tumors in zebrafish brain (doi: 10.1186/s12943-015-0288-2)</p>

<p>It is not clear what is the mechanism of Ventx -driven oncogenesis? What changes in gene expression, cell function etc are induced by Ventx in the cells that express KRASv12? The qPCR analysis performed is done on whole larvae and an analysis on single TICs and their progeny should be done following FACS sorting of fluorescent cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>FACS sorting of a single TIC (and its progeny) among many thousand cells in the embryo is not possible. The analysis on whole larvae provides an underestimate of the changes in gene expression following activation of kRAS and VentX.  We are looking for spatial transcriptomics as a better approach of the changes in gene expression induced in single TICs and their progeny, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.</p>

<p>Nuclear staining is necessary to make sure that only 1 cell was transplanted. How is it possible that we get more than 50 cells from a single transplanted cell in less than 48 hours? What is the length of the cell cycle of these transformed cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Nuclear staining is not necessary as the transplanted cell is fluorescent. Thus we can see how many cells are transplanted. With a cell-cycle of about 10h in 3dpt, a single cell will have generated as many as 100 cells.</p>
