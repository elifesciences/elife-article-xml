<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Recent advances in electron microscopy (EM) and automated image segmentation have produced synaptic wiring diagrams of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system. A limitation of existing fly connectome datasets is that most sensory neurons are excised during sample preparation, creating a gap between the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we bridge this gap by reconstructing wing sensory axons from the Female Adult Nerve Cord (FANC) EM dataset and mapping them to peripheral sensory structures using genetic tools and light microscopy. We confirm the location and identity of known wing mechanosensory neurons and identify previously uncharacterized axons, including a novel population of putative proprioceptors that make monosynaptic connections onto wing steering motor neurons. We also find that proprioceptors of adjacent campaniform sensilla on the wing have distinct axon morphologies and postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of specialization in axon pathfinding and synaptic partner matching. The peripheral location and central projections of wing sensory neurons are stereotyped across flies, allowing this wing proprioceptor atlas and genetic toolkit to guide analysis of other fly connectome datasets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fly wings are exquisite, versatile biological actuators. During flight, they sweep back and forth through the air hundreds of times per second to keep the fly aloft. On the ground, flies extend their wings to groom and males vibrate a wing to attract females during courtship. To accomplish these myriad functions, wing motor control relies on temporally and spatially precise feedback from diverse sensory neurons distributed throughout the wing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Proprioceptive mechanosensory neurons play a particularly important role in flight control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Pringle, 1957</xref>), as mechanosensory feedback has a shorter latency than visual signals and can therefore be used to rapidly adjust wing motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dickerson, 2020</xref>). Wings experience dynamic forces during flight, and proprioceptors encode features of these forces such as wing bending, twisting, and load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dickerson et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> typically beat their wings at 200-250 Hz and can adjust wing kinematics from one stroke to the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dickinson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heide and Götz, 1996</xref>). Thus, muscle contraction must be temporally precise enough to act at these short time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dickinson and Tu, 1997</xref>). Consistent with the need for rapid feedback, some motor neurons that control wing steering muscles receive monosynaptic input from wing sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fayyazuddin and Dickinson, 1999</xref>). However, the peripheral location and identity of the wing sensory neurons that provide feedback to the wing motor system remain largely unknown.</p>

<caption><title>Proprioceptive neurons on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> The cell bodies and dendrites of sensory neurons are in the periphery, on the wing and wing hinge, and their axons project to the ventral nerve cord (VNC). Before entering the VNC, the sensory axons fasciculate together and enter through the Anterior Dorsomedial Nerve (ADMN). (<bold>B</bold>) Proprioceptors on the wing include campaniform sensilla (CS), chordotonal organs (CO), and a hair plate (HP). Each campaniform sensillum dome is innervated by a single sensory neuron, as is each hair in a hair plate. A chordotonal organ is made up of a group of sensory neurons with supporting cells that fix them to the underside of the cuticle (shown in blue). Blue asterisks (bottom right) indicates a single external hair in the hair plate. Images show the membrane-bound fluorescent label mCD8::GFP to highlight each proprioceptor type. See <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> for details on which proprioceptors are labeled by which driver lines. Scale bars are 10 <italic>μ</italic>m. (<bold>C</bold>) Location of sensory neurons on the wing and wing hinge. The location of sensory neurons and the number of campaniform sensilla in each field are based on confocal images and a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dinges et al., 2021</xref>). A subset of sclerites and other structures that make up the wing hinge are included as landmarks: pterale C (ptC), the anterior nodal wing process (ANWP, which also features three CS), the parascutal shelf (ps), and the second axillary (ax ii). (<bold>D</bold>) We reconstructed each sensory axon in the ADMN wing nerve to visualize its full morphology and analyze downstream connectivity in the VNC. More information on each of these steps in Methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azevedo et al., 2024</xref>. In the nerve cross-section, the motor domain and margin bristle domains are highlighted by outlined gray masks.</p></caption>

<p>Sensory neurons on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing can be grouped into different classes based on their end organ morphology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The most numerous are the bristles along the wing margin, which include both mechanosensory and chemosensory sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hartenstein and Posakony, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palka et al., 1979</xref>). Wing chemosensory neurons can detect external odors and pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Stocker, 1994</xref>), while mechanosensory bristles can detect the presence of dust particles or mites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Bristles also line the tegula, a cuticular protuberance at the proximal edge of the wing. Apart from the tactile and chemosensory bristles, other sensory neuron classes are presumed to be proprioceptive, in that they monitor the movement and strain of the wing itself. These include campaniform sensilla (CS) and chordotonal organs (CO), and the hair plates (HP), all of which can also be at other locations across the adult fly body, including the legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dinges et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Field and Matheson, 1998</xref>). CS consist of a single neuron with a dendrite that contacts a cuticular cap, or dome, on the surface of the wing; the CS neuron fires action potentials when the dome deforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chapman et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moran et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pringle, 1938a</xref>). CS can be found as single CS or in fields of domes that have similar size and orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cole and Palka, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dinges et al., 2021</xref>). COs are clusters of neurons with cap cells that anchor them to an internal structure, such as a tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Field and Matheson, 1998</xref>). In the wing, they are anchored to inner extensions of the cuticles; for example, the wall of the tegula and the inner wall of the radius (sometimes called the radial vein). Hair plates are small tightly packed clusters of sensory hairs, each of which is innervated by a single mechanosensory neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Pringle, 1938b</xref>). Proprioceptive neurons (CS, CO, and HP) are concentrated proximally, especially along the radius and the tegula (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The axons of wing sensory neurons project into the fly’s ventral nerve cord (VNC), the invertebrate analog of the spinal cord. Previous work has described the activity of fly leg proprioceptors during walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dallmann et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pratt et al., 2025</xref>), but it has been prohibitively challenging to record activity of wing sensory neurons during flight.</p>
<p>Much of what we know about wing sensory neurons comes from developmental studies that used the fly wing as a model to investigate whether axonal morphology is intrinsically determined or extrinsically directed. Some studies used mosaic mutant flies with hindwings in place of halteres to test whether sensory axons would follow haltere-like morphologies or wing-like morphologies once they entered the developing central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ghysen, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palka et al., 1979</xref>). These studies measured morphological similarities between wild-type and mutant axons to uncover their intrinsic developmental programs. Their findings showed that the degree of intrinsic programming was different for single CS and field CS, in that axons from field CS on the mutant hindwings followed similar paths in the VNC to the field CS on wild type halteres, while the axons of single CS on mutant hindwings retained the morphological characteristics of the wild type forewing single CS axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palka et al., 1979</xref>). This difference suggests that the field and single CS are endowed with different axon guidance instructions, connect to different postsynaptic partners, and thus may serve distinct functions.</p>
<p>Understanding how central circuits integrate information from wing sensory neurons is key to understanding their function. Connectomics, or dense reconstruction of neurons and synapses from electron microscopy, offers new opportunities for mapping peripheral sensory feedback to the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Galili et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we bridge the gap between the VNC connectome and the wing by mapping central axon morphologies to the peripheral structures from which they originate. We reconstructed all 490 afferents in the left wing nerve (anterior dorsomedial nerve, ADMN) in the FANC electron microscopy dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azevedo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Phelps et al., 2021</xref>). Many axon morphologies and their corresponding peripheral end organs were previously undescribed. We identified genetic driver lines for a subset of these unknown wing sensory neurons and elucidated their peripheral location and anatomy. For example, we identified novel classes of peripheral sensory neurons near the wing hinge and found that campaniform sensilla on the tegula synapse directly onto the tonic wing b1 motor neuron, suggesting a specialized role in feedback control of flight steering. We also confirmed a long-standing prediction that individual campaniform sensilla from the same field can have distinct axon morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Palka et al., 1986</xref>). A companion paper that reconstructed haltere campaniform sensilla axons in the connectome identified a similar organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dhawan et al., 2025</xref>). Overall, knowing the relationships between peripheral neuroanatomy, axon morphology, and downstream connectivity to wing motor neurons provides a foundation for investigating proprioceptive sensing and motor control of the fly wing.</p>

<title>Comprehensive reconstruction of wing axons in the FANC connectome</title>
<p>We reconstructed all axons in the left ADMN using an EM dataset of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of a female adult fly (FANC; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; also see Methods; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azevedo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Phelps et al., 2021</xref>)). For each automatically segmented neuron, we used the software interface Neuroglancer to manually proofread (Methods) the major branches, as well as all branches that could be reliably attached. In the left ADMN, we identified 490 sensory axons and 14 motor axons. Axons were identified as sensory if they did not attach to a cell body in the VNC (Methods). The total number of axons is slightly higher than previously reported counts from cross sections of the wing nerve (455-465 axons, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Edwards et al., 1978</xref>)). Of these afferents, we classified 364 as wing margin bristle axons, based on their ventral projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palka et al., 1979</xref>). Of the 126 non-bristle afferents, we identified 64 axon morphologies from published images of dye-fills (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Burt and Palka, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ghysen, 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kays et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Koh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Palka et al., 1986</xref>, <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">Palka et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Whitlock and Palka, 1995</xref>)). Of the 62 remaining axons previously unidentified in the literature, we identified sparse GAL4 lines in the FlyLight collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>) that labeled axon morphologies that resembled the reconstructed axons from FANC, crossed these lines to a fluorescent reporter, and then imaged the wing and wing hinge to visualize expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1S</xref>). Using this strategy, we successfully identified 50 of the 62 previously unidentified morphologies.</p>

<p>We reconstructed postsynaptic partners of sensory neurons until at least 70% of the output synapses from each sensory neuron were attached to proofread neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Sensory axons make direct synapses onto motor neurons, other sensory neurons, VNC intrinsic neurons, and interneurons that ascend to the brain. To identify clusters of sensory axons with similar postsynaptic connectivity, we used a pairwise measure of cosine similarity, where a score of one indicates that the two neurons contact the same partners with the same proportion of synapses. We then ordered the neurons via agglomerative clustering, which revealed clusters of neurons with similar morphologies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, many of the axons do not form crisp cluster boundaries, suggesting that multi-modal sensory information is integrated at early stages of sensory processing. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-E</xref> show the axon morphology of each cluster, organized by peripheral class. In the remainder of the paper, we focus on identifying the novel sensory neuron classes in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>.</p>

<p>Proximal CS axons are characterized by three branches: one short branch projects to the tectulum and two long branches project anteriorly to the brain and posteriorly to the haltere neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ghysen, 1980</xref>). There are ∼36 proximal campaniform sensilla on the wing, and we found 38 axons in the EM dataset that followed this pattern. Previous dye fills of distal campaniform sensilla revealed axons that do not ascend to the brain, and instead send two processes to the posterior VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ghysen, 1980</xref>). There are ∼17 distal campaniform sensilla on the wing, and we found 15 axons that match this pattern. We also identified five ascending axons that resemble the small CS morphology although they are missing a posterior branch. Overall, our comprehensive reconstruction revealed many morphological subgroups with overlapping postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of integration within wing sensorimotor circuits.</p>

<title>Connectivity reveals a potential role for the tegula in flight control</title>
<p>Due to the need for rapid sensory feedback necessary for flight control, we were especially interested in identifying axons with monosynaptic connections onto wing motor neurons. We found that 34 (of 62) previously uncharacterized axons synapse directly onto wing steering motor neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). Of these, one group of axons synapses directly onto the well-characterized b1 motor neuron, which innervates the b1 muscle to help stabilize pitch during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Whitehead et al., 2022</xref>). The b1 motor neuron fires on nearly every wingstroke and input from wing afferents sets the phase of its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fayyazuddin and Dickinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heide and Götz, 1996</xref>). Notably, the input to the b1 motor neuron from ipsilateral wing and haltere axons is clustered around the putative spike initiation zone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), as has previously been reported based on axonal spatial overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chan and Dickinson, 1996</xref>). This synaptic organization may be a structural mechanism for facilitating rapid modulation of b1 activity based on sensory feedback.</p>

<p>The wing sensory axons that synapse directly onto the b1 motor neuron have not been previously characterized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). They terminate shortly after entering the VNC and do not branch more extensively. We observed an unexpected ultrastructural feature in these axons: their terminals contain very densely packed mitochondria compared to other cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This feature is also present in interneurons with putative electrical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Trimarchi and Murphey, 1997</xref>) to the b1 motor neuron (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Based on their high mitochondrial density, we speculate that these interneurons also connect to the b1 motor neuron through mixed chemical-electrical synapses, perhaps to optimize for rapid neural communication. Electrical connections between the wing nerve and b1 have previously been demonstrated with electrophysiology in the blowfly, <italic>Calliphora</italic>, although the exact sensory inputs were not determined, as the entire wing nerve was stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fayyazuddin and Dickinson, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the peripheral identity of these axons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>), we found a driver line that labeled this population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>)) and crossed it to a fluorescent reporter. Imaging the wing revealed that the population of short axons that directly synapse onto a subset of wing steering motor neurons originate from a field of CS on the tegula (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). This finding suggests that the tegula may play a previously underappreciated role in flight control, particularly in regulating the tonically firing muscle b1 and a tonically firing muscle from another motor module, i2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).</p>

<title>Thorax sensor near the wing hinge</title>
<p>A population of five axons extends single processes through the dorsal tectulum, and two of the axons cross the midline (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). These axons originate from a cluster of five neurons in the thorax beneath the wing hinge near the parascutal shelf, just medial to the anterior nodal wing process (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B-C</xref>).

<title>Adjacent campaniform sensilla axons are morphologically distinct</title>
<p>Previous work uncovered morphological diversity across CS axons, where subsets of CS axons follow different tracts and some ascend to the brain while others do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palka et al., 1979</xref>). It was unclear, however, whether there is morphological diversity of axons that originate from the same CS field. A field of CS are defined as having the same size, circularity, orientation, and general location on the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cole and Palka, 1982</xref>). Single CS can be either rapidly or slowly adapting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dickinson and Palka, 1987</xref>), but whether all CS within a field have the same firing properties remains unknown. It is also not known whether all CS within a field connect to the same postsynaptic partners. Answering this question could provide insight into the function of spatially clustered CS, for example whether they underlie a population code or transmit signals in parallel to distinct downstream circuits.</p>
<p>To determine the morphological similarity of axons that innervate CS in the same field, we identified GAL4 driver lines that sparsely expressed in the wing nerve (less than five ADMN axons) and imaged their expression in the wing. We found many lines that label subsets of CS across multiple fields (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and fortuitously found three driver lines that label one to two separate CS in the ventral radius C field (v.Rad.C, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). For these three lines, we compared VNC expression of axons from the ADMN using the FlyLight MCFO collection (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B-D</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Meissner et al., 2023</xref>)). In a driver line that expresses in two v.Rad.C neurons (CS 2 and 4), the VNC contains two distinct axon morphologies originating from the ADMN nerve (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D, row 1</xref>). Both axons possess a process that ascends to the brain, but one also projects down to the haltere neuropil. In a second driver line that also labels the second CS in v.Rad.C, we observed the same axon morphology that ascends to the brain but does not reach the haltere neuropil (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D, row 2</xref>). A third driver line, that expresses in the third CS in v.Rad.C, contains a non-ascending wing axon with two posterior projections (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D, row 3</xref>). These results show that neurons that innervate adjacent campaniform sensilla within the same field can have different axon morphologies. Each of the three v.Rad.C axons falls into a cluster of morphologically similar axons that connect to similar postsynaptic neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E</xref>, clusters 2, 15, and 21, respectively, from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). The additional axons in each cluster likely originate from CS in other fields, on different parts of the wing. Overall, our results suggest that adjacent CS neurons in the same field connect to different target neurons in the VNC, and that the CS from different fields can connect to common postsynaptic targets.</p>

<p>In this project, we reconstructed each sensory axon in the left ADMN wing nerve, as well as their postsynaptic partners, from an EM dataset of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> VNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azevedo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Phelps et al., 2021</xref>). We identified their postsynaptic partners in the EM volume and matched previously unidentified axon morphologies to their sensory structures on the wing by imaging the expression of genetic driver lines. To make this information accessible to the community, we provide a library of confocal Z-stacks and an annotation table linked to the FANC connectome dataset (see Methods). We also include a reference (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to match peripheral sensory structures identified here to neuron nomenclature established in the male VNC connectome (MANC), in which wing sensory axons are proofread but few are annotated by peripheral identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Marin et al., 2024</xref>).</p>

<title>Integrating connectomics with previous research</title>
<p>Sensory neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing have been a useful model system for investigating the relative contributions of intrinsic regulation vs. extrinsic signaling in the determination of axon morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ghysen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palka et al., 1979</xref>). Past work identified the axonal morphologies of wing CS and differences in the genetic programs guiding axon development for CS in fields and single CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ghysen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palka et al., 1979</xref>). Here, we build on this knowledge using cell-type specific genetic tools and connectomics to create a more complete map of the wing sensory apparatus and central sensory circuits. By reconstructing axons from an electron microscopy volume, we found novel wing sensory axon morphologies, many of which originated from internal sensory structures that were inaccessible with previous dye-fill techniques, such as the previously uncharacterized chordotonal organ axons.</p>
<p>Most wing CS are organized into fields, in which domes of roughly the same size and shape cluster together. By finding sparse driver lines that label only one or two campaniform sensilla in the ventral radius C field (v.Rad.C), we found that CS in the same field can have distinct axon morphologies. This finding is consistent with our unsuccessful attempts to build split-GAL4 driver lines that specifically label CS from a single field by intersecting lines which label the same axon morphology. This organization may offer a functional advantage by sending similar signals to multiple regions of the CNS in parallel; viewed from a different perspective, postsynaptic neurons may rapidly integrate information across different CS fields. One possibility is that CS axon morphology is more closely linked to neuronal intrinsic properties (e.g., slowly vs. rapidly adapting). We hypothesize that the morphological clusters we identified (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D-E</xref>) are similarly tuned CS neurons distributed throughout different fields across the wing. A concurrent project that focused on the central and peripheral organization of haltere mechanosensory neurons found that common central axon morphologies map across multiple campaniform sensilla fields on the haltere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dhawan et al., 2025</xref>), consistent with our prediction for the wing.</p>
<p>One advantage of the dye-fill technique is that it is sometimes feasible to repeatedly label the same exact neuron across individuals. By comparing axon morphologies across individuals, researchers have found differences in small branches that extend from the primary neurite of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kays et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Palka et al., 1986</xref>). As more connectomic datasets become available, we will be able to ascertain if this morphological variation is also reflected by variation in downstream connectivity. Understanding relationships between morphology and connectivity across individuals, and even across species, will provide a framework for deciphering the developmental logic that governs the formation of sensorimotor circuits.</p>

<title>Direct sensory input to wing motor neurons</title>
<p>Many wing sensory neurons, such as those originating from the tegula and near the wing hinge, synapse directly onto wing motor neurons, providing a mechanism for rapid feedback-driven motor control. Four steering wing motor neurons receive over 10% of their synaptic input from sensory neurons, including haltere input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lesser et al., 2024</xref>). Each of these four motor neurons also fires tonically during flight, whereas other steering MNs burst during maneuvers such as turning (Lindsay et al., 2017). Integrating direct sensory input provides a mechanism for low latency motor control, which is important given the short timescales required for Dipteran flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dickerson, 2020</xref>). We found that the campaniform sensilla on the tegula provide the most direct feedback onto wing steering motor neurons. Future work is needed to understand what these sensory neurons encode, but based on their direct connections and thick axons, we speculate that they set the firing phase of tonically active muscles such as b1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fayyazuddin and Dickinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Heide, 1983</xref>).</p>

<title>The tegula as a major sensory structure</title>
<p>Though the tegula has been studied for its role in locust flight control, it has largely been neglected in Dipteran literature. In both locusts and Diptera, the tegula features campaniform sensilla, a chordotonal organ, and mechanosensory hairs (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">Fudalewicz-Niemczyk, Władysława, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wolf, 1993</xref>). Feedback from the locust tegula resets the phase of wing elevation– the forewing tegulae are only necessary to maintain the flight rhythm if the hindwing tegulae are compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Büschges et al., 1992</xref>). Unlike in locusts, Dipteran flight muscles are asynchronous, where wing elevation and depression during each wingstroke are biomechanically rather than neurally controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Deora et al., 2015</xref>). Despite the different feedback demands between asynchronous and synchronous flight, all flying insects share an evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gau et al., 2023</xref>) and wings experience similar forces, which are optimally sensed from particular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Weber et al., 2021</xref>).

This hypothesis was based on spikes recorded from a sharp electrode placed at the base of pterale C in response to wing vibration. We found no cells labeled by a pan-sensory neuron driver (<italic>ChAT</italic>-GAL4) at the base of, or innervating, sclerite pterale C. We did, however, observe that the entire nerve of sensory axons from the radius passes through the base of pterale C (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>), and thus speculate that action potentials traveling along this nerve are likely what was being recorded in that prior study.

<title>A potential metabolic specialization for flight circuitry</title>

Notably, some of the terminals with dense mitochondria were at sites of known gap-junction coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Trimarchi and Murphey, 1997</xref>). In the fly VNC, electrical synapses are often accompanied by chemical synapses, which may cooperate to ensure low latency signal transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fayyazuddin and Dickinson, 1996</xref>). It is possible that these low-latency mixed chemical-electrical synapses enable the rapid feedback necessary for wing control during flight, and therefore have a higher metabolic demand, requiring a greater density of mitochondria. In the adult fly brain, however, sites of gap junction coupling, such as the lobula plate tangential cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ammer et al., 2022</xref>), do not exhibit particularly high concentrations of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sager et al., 2024</xref>).

Further, some of the uncharacterized axon morphologies likely belong to the tegula and radius COs, both of which had more cell bodies than axons. These gaps highlight the need for complementary approaches, such as combining small-scale experimental approaches with large-scale comprehensive datasets, to fully characterize the wing’s sensory landscape.</p>

Information on synapse location predictions and error can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azevedo et al., 2024</xref>.</p>

<title>Samples</title>
<p>We used <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> raised on standard cornmeal and molasses medium at 25 °C in a 14:10 hour light:dark cycle. We used female flies 2-7 days post-eclosion for imaging.</p>

<title>Wing images</title>
<p>Wings were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (PFA) PBS solution for 20-60 minutes followed by rinsing in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBT) four times over the course of 75 minutes. For most samples, native fluorescence was imaged, so the wings were then mounted onto slides in Vectashield without DAPI. For preparations requiring immunohistochemistry, after rinsing, wings were incubated in 1:50 Alexa Fluor 635-nm Phalloidin (Thermofisher A34054) in a PBS solution with the following reagents to improve tissue penetrance: 1% triton X-100, 0.5% DMSO, 0.05 mg/ml Escin (Sigma-Aldrich, E1378) and 3% normal goat serum. Wings were then incubated for ten days at 4 °C with occasional gentle nutating. Following incubation, a second rinsing procedure was performed before mounting the wings on slides with Vectashield.</p>

<sec id="s5f2">
<title>Wing hinge images</title>
<p>For wing hinge images, a full adult fly was hemisected. First, flies were killed by freezing flies briefly on ice, then dipping in 95% ethanol. Next they were frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound on dry ice for ∼3 minutes. Flies were then sliced along the anterior-posterior axis with a razor blade and transferred to a series of wells of ∼3mL 4% paraformaldehyde PBS solution until the O.C.T. melted away. Half-flies were then transferred to a 0.6 mL tube with fresh fixative for 45 minutes before following the same washing procedure detailed above. Instead of Vectashield, half-flies were mounted using the FocusClear-MountClear system (CelExplorer FC-101 and MC-301).</p>

<title>Confocal Imaging and image post-processing</title>
<p>Mounted wings and wing hinges were imaged on a Confocal Olympus FV1000. Images were processed in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s5g1">
<title>FlyLight confocal stacks</title>
<p>Confocal stacks were downloaded from the gen1 GAL4 and MCFO GAL4 collections on FlyLight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Meissner et al., 2023</xref>) and displayed as max projections using FIJI. For <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, VNC expression patterns from the full GAL4 lines were aligned using the Computational Morphometry Toolkit (CMTK) to a female VNC template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bogovic et al., 2020</xref>) in FIJI. For <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, MCFO images were used because the full expression patterns were too broad in the whole VNC to visualize the wing sensory neurons in a max projection.</p>
<p>The depth-colored FlyLight MCFO images in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> were adjusted to visually highlight single neurons. First, we duplicated the max-projection z-stack and increased the contrast on one copy. Next, we traced the relevant neuron in the original and used this shape to mask the high contrast copy. We then overlaid this masked image onto the original. This method allowed us to highlight single neurons visually in busy MCFO images. Full z-stacks are available through FlyLight.</p>

<title>Peripheral Identification</title>
<p>See <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for a list of helpful references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cole and Palka, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dinges et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fudalewicz-Niemczyk, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hartenstein and Posakony, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hertweck, 1931</xref>). Sensory structures were identified from confocal image stacks by closely scrutinizing the images to see exactly where GFP-labeled neurons were in relation to wing veins and other landmarks. Campaniform sensilla were the most straightforward sensory structures to identify thanks to a comprehensive atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dinges et al., 2021</xref>). The chordotonal organs were identified by their actin-rich attachment cells labeled by phalloidin. The structure on the tegula was identified as a hair plate due to the appearance of the hairs.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lesser et al provide a comprehensive description of Drosophila wing proprioceptive sensory neurons at the electron microscopy resolution. This &quot;tour-de-force&quot; provides a strong foundation for future structural and functional research aimed at understanding wing motor control in Drosophila with implications for understanding wing control across other insects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The authors leverage previous research that described many of the fly wing proprioceptors, and combine this knowledge with EM connectome data such that they now provide a near-complete morphological description of all wing proprioceptors.</p>
<p>(2) The authors cleverly leverage genetic tools and EM connectome data to tie the location of proprioceptors on the wings with axonal projections in the connectome. This enables them to both align with previous literature as well as make some novel claims.</p>
<p>1. In addition to providing a full description of wing proprioceptors, the authors also identified a novel population of sensors on the wing tegula that make direct connections with the B1 wing motor neurons, implicating the role of the tegula in wing movements that was previously underappreciated.</p>
<p>(4) Despite being the most comprehensive description so far, it is reassuring that the authors clearly state the missing elements in the discussion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors do their main analysis on data from the FANC connectome but provide corresponding IDs for sensory neurons in the MANC connectome. I wonder how the connectivity matrix compares across FANC and MANC if the authors perform a similar analysis to the one they have done in Figure 2. This could be a valuable addition and potentially also pick up any sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p>(2) The authors speculate about the presence of gap junctions based on the density of mitochondria. I'm not convinced about this, given that mitochondrial densities could reflect other things that correlate with energy demands in sub-compartments.</p>
<p>(3) I'm intrigued by how the tegula CO is negative for iav. I wonder if authors tried other CO labeling genes like nompc. And what does this mean for the nature of this CO. Some more discussion on this anomaly would be helpful.</p>
<p>(4) The authors conclude there are no proprioceptive neurons in sclerite pterale C based on Chat-Gal4 expression analysis. It would be much more rigorous if authors also tried a pan-neuronal driver like nsyb/elav or other neurotransmitter drivers (Vglut, GAD, etc) to really rule this out. (I hope I didn't miss this somewhere.)</p>
<p>Overall, I consider this an exceptional analysis that will be extremely valuable to the community.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Lesser et al. present an atlas of Drosophila wing sensory neurons. They proofread the axons of all sensory neurons in the wing nerve of an existing electron microscopy dataset, the female adult fly nerve cord (FANC) connectome. These reconstructed sensory axons were linked with light microscopy images of full-scale morphology to identify their origin in the periphery of the wing and encoded sensory modalities. The authors described the morphology and postsynaptic targets of proprioceptive neurons as well as previously unknown sensory neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present a valuable catalogue of wing sensory neurons, including previously undescribed sensory axons in the Drosophila wing. By providing both connectivity information with linked genetic drive lines, this research facilitates future work on the wing motor-sensory network and applications relating to Drosophila flight. The findings were linked to previous research as well as their putative role in the proprioceptive and nerve cord circuitry, providing testable hypotheses for future studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) With future use as an atlas, it should be noted that the evidence is based on sensory neurons on only one side of the nerve cord. Fruit flies have stereotyped left/right hemispheres in the brain and left/right hemisegments in the nerve cord. The comparison of left and right neurons of the nervous system can give a sense of how robust the morphological and connectivity findings are. Here, the authors have not compared the left and right side sensory axons from the wing nerve, leaving potential for developmental variability across samples and left/right hemisegments.</p>
<p>(2) Not all links between the EM reconstructions and driver lines are convincing. To strengthen these, for all EM-LM matches in Figures 3-7, rotated views of the driver line (matching the rotated EM views) should be shown to provide a clearer comparison of the data. In particular, Figure 3G and Figure 7B are not very convincing based on the images shown. MCFO imaging of the driver lines in Figure 3G and 7B would make this position stronger if a clone that matches the EM reconstruction could be identified.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 7B looks like the driver line might have stochastic expression in the sensory neuron, which further reduces confidence in the result shown in Figure 7C. Is this expression pattern in the wing consistently seen? Many split-GAL4s have stochastic expressions. The evidence would be strengthened if the authors presented multiple examples (~4-5) of each driver line's expression pattern in the supplement.</p>
<p>(4) Certain claims in this work lack quantitative evidence. On line 128, for instance, &quot;Overall, our comprehensive reconstruction revealed many morphological subgroups with overlapping postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of integration within wing sensorimotor circuits.&quot; If a claim of subgroups having shared postsynaptic partners is being made, there should have been quantitative evidence. For example, cosine similar amongst members of each group compared to the cosine similarity of shuffled/randomised sets of axons from different groups. The heat map of cosine similarity in Figure 2B alone is not sufficient.</p>
<p>(5) Similarly, claims about putative electrical connections to b1 motor neurons are very speculative. The authors state that &quot;their terminals contain very densely packed mitochondria compared to other cells&quot;, without providing a quantitative comparison to other sensory axons. There is also no quantitative comparison to the one example of another putative electrical connection from the literature. Further, it should be noted that this connection from Trimarchi and Murphey, 1997, is also stated as putative on line 167, which further weakens this evidence. Quantification would strongly strengthen this position. Identification of an example of high mitochondrial density at a confirmed electrical connection would be even better. In the related discussion section &quot;A potential metabolic specialization for flight circuitry&quot;, it should be more clearly noted that the dense mitochondria could be unrelated to a putative electrical connection. If the authors have an alternative hypothesis about the mitochondria density, this should be stated as well.</p>
<p>(6) It would be appropriate to cite previous work using a similar strategy to match sensory axons to their cell bodies/dendrites at the periphery using driver lines and connectomics (see Figure 5 for example in the following paper: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40247">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40247</ext-link> ).</p>
<p>The methods section is very sparse. For the sake of replicability, all sections should be expanded upon.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to identify the peripheral end-organ origin in the fly's wing of all sensory neurons in the anterior dorsomedial nerve. They reconstruct the neurons and their downstream partners in an electron microscopy volume of a female ventral nerve cord, analyse the resulting connectome, and identify their origin with a review of the literature and imaging of genetic driver lines. While some of the neurons were already known through previous work, the authors expand on the identification and create a near-complete map of the wing mechanosensory neurons at synapse resolution.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors elegantly combine electron microscopy, neuron morphology, connectomics, and light microscopy methods to bridge the gap between fly wing sensory neuron anatomy and ventral nerve cord morphology. Further, they use EM ultrastructural observations to make predictions on the signaling modality of some of the sensory neurons and thus their function in flight.</p>
<p>The work is as comprehensive as state-of-the-art methods allow to create a near-complete map of the wing mechanosensory neurons. This work will be of importance to the field of fly connectomics and modelling of fly behavior, as well as a useful resource to the Drosophila research community.</p>
<p>Through this comprehensive mapping of neurons to the connectome, the authors create a lot of hypotheses on neuronal function, partially already confirmed with the literature and partially to be tested in the future. The authors achieved their aim of mapping the periphery of the fly's wing to axonal projections in the ventral nerve cord, beautifully laying out their results to support their mapping.</p>
<p>The authors identify the neurons in a previously published connectome of a male fly ventral nerve cord to enable cross-individual analysis of connections. Further, together with their companion paper, Dhawan et al. 2025, describing the haltere sensory neurons in the same EM dataset, they cover the entire mechanosensory space involved in Drosophila flight.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The connectomic data are only available upon request; the inclusion of a connectivity table of the reconstructed neurons would aid analysis reproducibility and cross-dataset comparisons.</p>
