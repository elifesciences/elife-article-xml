<title>Abstract</title><p>Hepatic factors secreted by the liver promote homeostasis and are pivotal for maintaining the liver-gut axis. Bile acid metabolism is one such example wherein, bile acid synthesis occurs in the liver and its biotransformation happens in the intestine. Dysfunctional interactions between the liver and the intestine stimulate varied pathological outcomes through its bidirectional portal communication. Indeed, aberrant bile acid metabolism has been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these crosstalks that perpetuate intestinal permeability and inflammation remain obscure. Here, we identify a novel hepatic gene program regulated by Rela and Stat3 that accentuates the inflammation in an acute experimental colitis model. Hepatocyte-specific ablation of Rela and Stat3 reduces the levels of primary bile acids in both the liver and the gut and shows a restricted colitogenic phenotype. On supplementation of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), knock-out mice exhibit enhanced colitis-induced alterations. This study provides persuasive evidence for the development of multi-organ strategies for treating IBD and identifies a hepatocyte-specific <italic>rela-stat3</italic> network as a promising therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Under physiological conditions, the liver is continuously exposed to gut-derived antigens, which are either derived from the food we consume or are the product of microbial metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The continuous interaction of extraneous antigens with the liver tissue makes it a tolerogenic organ, thereby justifying its unique anatomical location <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, during intestinal inflammation or dysbiosis, as seen in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), there is an unregulated exchange of molecules across the gut vascular barrier, this potentially rewires the local as well as hepatic immunological and metabolic milieu <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Over the last decade, several studies have focussed on analyzing the mechanistic aspects of gut-liver crosstalk, which intend to develop successful multi-organ therapies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Clinically, IBD overlaps with hepatobiliary conditions, it has been reported that 30% of IBD cases have abnormal liver function tests and around 5% of them even develop chronic hepatobiliary diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. During colitis, the first responders to extraneous agents incoming from the leaky gut are the Kupffer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. These cells have been shown to switch from a pro to an anti-inflammatory state in response to signals received from the colitogenic gut <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Besides kuffer cells, the parenchymal cells, hepatocytes which occupy ∼80% of the liver, also respond to these varied danger signals. Hepatocytes have a robust secretary machinery and are known to secrete a variety of factors like the complement proteins, clotting factors, hepatokines, bile acids etc. which regulate local as well as distant organ functions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Among the secreted factors, albumin is the most abundantly produced serum protein, which is implicated in the maintenance of redox balance and is known to attenuate DSS-induced colitis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Highlighting the importance of liver secretome, a recent study suggests that FNDC4 has the potential to reduce colonic inflammation by acting on the colonic macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Similarly, bile acids are also known to play a pivotal role in regulating mucosal immune responses. Primary bile acids produced by the liver are often related to an enhanced proinflammatory state and its turnover to secondary bile acids is considered to be a critical step in the maintenance of homeostasis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. The primary bile acids have been reported to accumulate in the inflamed colon, suggesting some intriguing crosstalk between the gut and liver <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, it is obscure, how the liver perceives signals due to the disease-mediated impaired gut barrier to rewire secretory machinery and tackle the enhanced endotoxins influx.</p>
<p>Through this study, we propose Rela and Stat3 as key responders of inflammatory signaling in the liver tissue in response to intestinal aberrations. We further define a colitis resistance model based on the liver-specific knockout animals and propose a Rela/Stat3-CYP enzyme-mediated elevation of primary bile acid leading to immune-mediated damage to the gut. Briefly, this study establishes the functional significance of hepatic Rela and Stat3 in intestinal inflammation and emphasises the therapeutic importance of targeting multiorgan crosstalk in inflammatory diseases.</p>

<title>Engagement of hepatic Rela and/or Stat3 pathways in murine colitis model</title>
<p>Several studies have shown that the gut-liver bidirectional communication is critical in both the establishment and progression of IBD. Towards identifying liver pathways that affect intestinal impairment during IBD, we firstly examined whether 2% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced acute experimental colitis results in changes in liver pathophysiology. Analysis of biochemical parameters on day 6 of DSS treatment showed no significant alterations in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and bilirubin (Figure S1a). Further, histological studies of these treated liver tissues from C57BL/6 mice showed neither morphological differences nor any hepatocellular fibrosis (Figure S1b). Thus, in general, the liver functionalities are maintained and no major damage in the liver tissue occurs in the colitogenic mice model. We then performed global transcriptomic studies of the liver tissue from day 6 colitogenic mice. Unsupervised clustering of the transcriptome data by principal component analysis (PCA) segregated the treated and control samples on PC1 with a variance of 53% (Figure S1c). Immunological and metabolic pathways appeared to be enriched in the list of regulated pathways. LPS-mediated signaling in the liver was identified as among the key differentially expressed systems (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). It is proposed that microbial components, including LPS from the gut, can reach the liver through portal blood, activating the hepatic immune response during colitis-mediated barrier impairment. Interestingly, Rela and Stat3 are two important transcription factors activated by the microbial LPS and these two pathways frequently converge to elicit protective responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Further analysis of transcript abundance of Rela, Stat3, and other downstream genes reflected higher transcript abundance in the DSS-treated group as compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Functional activation of Rela and Stat3 pathways requires phosphorylation of key residues, which we investigated in the liver sections of DSS-treated mice. Immunostaining studies showed an enhanced signal intensity of p-Rela (Ser536), p-Stat3 (Ser727) and p-Stat3 (Tyr705) in the treated liver sections, as compared to untreated samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>We then examined time-dependent phosphorylation status of the two proteins of the liver post 0, 2, 4, and 6 days of DSS treatment. The RelA phosphorylation at Ser536 peaks at day 2 (about eight fold increase) following which a two to three fold increase was sustained till day 6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The Stat3 phosphorylation at Ser727 increases gradually from day 2 (eight-fold) to day 6 (seventeen-fold). Tyrosine phosphorylation on the other hand, is transient and can be detected at day 4 (nine-fold) post-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>).</p>
<p>Antibiotic-induced gut microbiome depletion has been frequently used to study gut microbiome roles in pathological conditions. Altered microbiota is also likely to modulate endotoxin influx. We therefore examined hepatic Rela/Stat3 activation after subjecting mice to oral administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail (Amplicin, Neomycin, Metronidazole and Vancomycin) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Substantial decrease in bacterial load after four weeks was confirmed microbiologically. We induced colitis in mice with 2% DSS treatment along with antibiotic administration (Figure S1d and Supplementary methods). Previous data indicates that pStat3 (Ser727) is the most prominent marker that gets highly activated 6 days post DSS-treatment. Time course activation studies had indicated pStat3 (Ser727) as the most prominent marker to be activated six days post DSS-treatment; we examined the levels through western blotting. A marked reduction in pStat3 (Ser727) levels post-antibiotic treatment in the colitogenic wild type mice (Figure S1e) could be noted, suggesting that optimal endotoxin flux may be a major driver of hepatic Rela/Stat3 signalling. Although it is important to note that antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion alters metabolic homeostasis by affecting gut signaling and colonic metabolism, in turn altering hepatic physiology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Hepatocyte-specific functions of Rela and Stat3 exacerbate experimental colitis</title>
<p>In order to discern the importance of transcriptional networks regulated by Rela and Stat3 we utilized a hepatocyte-specific knockout model. The Cre recombinase under albumin promoter drives the deletion of Rela and/or Stat3 in a tissue-specific manner (Figure S2a and S2b). To address the question, if ablation of Rela and Stat3 functioning in hepatocytes could modulate colonic inflammation, we subjected <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup></italic>, <italic>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic>, <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> and wild type littermates mice to acute DSS treatment. Previous studies suggest development of colitis in acute models is accompanied by shortening of the colon length, diarrhea and rectal bleeding which is measured as the disease activity index (DAI) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Time course measurement of DAI in the wild type showed expected increase from day three (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). While the DAI in <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice was parallel to that observed in wild type mice, <italic>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice displayed a subtle decrease in the DAI score, particularly on day five. Surprisingly, <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice were almost resistant to induction of colitis, and only a minor increase in the DAI could be seen on day 6 post-onset of DSS treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Concurrently, DSS treatment for six days showed substantial shortening of the colon length in wild type, <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup></italic>, and <italic>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice, but not in <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and S2c). Further, we estimated the intestinal barrier permeability by measuring serum concentrations of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran which was gavaged orally to these mice. A twelve fold increase in FITC-dextran in the serum of the wild type animals was seen, while the <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice showed substantially lower, five-fold increase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We also examined <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice for the epithelial architecture and mucin expression in colon by following histological features and expression of colitogenic markers. DSS treatment led to extensive disruption of the intestinal crypts and depletion of the mucin layer in wild type mice, accompanied by submucosal leukocyte infiltration. In contrast, <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic>mice showed substantially attenuated epithelial changes along with minimal erosion of mucin layers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and S2d). RT-qPCR analysis revealed that DSS treatment of wild type mice triggered a two and a half-fold and two-fold reduction in the colonic abundance of enterocyte markers, tight junction 1 (tjp1) and occludin (ocln), respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, we noticed a four-fold and two-fold decrease in the colonic abundance of goblet cell markers, mucins-2 and trefoil factor 3 (tff3), respectively, in wild type mice upon DSS treatment. Except for a moderate decrease in the Tjp1 mRNA level, none of these mRNAs were downregulated upon DSS treatment in <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice. Taken together these studies reveal intriguing observations wherein the absence of Rela and Stat3 in hepatocytes protects mice from DSS-induced colitis.</p>

<title>Induced hepatic expression of Rela and Stat3 stimulates primary bile acid synthesis pathway genes</title>
<p>To understand the role of the liver in imparting protective phenotype, exhibited by <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> strain, we performed an in-depth pathophysiological and molecular studies of the liver tissue of colitogenic knockout animals. Towards this, we evaluated the serum-based liver damage markers and histological features of the <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice. On day 4 and day 6 post DSS-treatment, ALT, AST, GGT and bilirubin levels were within the physiological range, indicating no apparent damage to the liver (Figure S3a). Similarly, the histological studies also suggested no morphological differences in the DSS-treated <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice (Figure S3b). In conclusion, the above data indicates that the liver functions are maintained in the colitogenic <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice, similar to that observed in the wild type animals. Further, to dissect the mechanism underlying the resistant phenotype displayed by hepatocyte-specific <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic>mice, we performed global transcriptome studies from liver tissues of treated/untreated <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> strain and their wild type littermates.

<p>BAs are synthesized in hepatocytes through the classical and alternate pathways catalyzed by a set of P450 enzymes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) are primary bile acids and are conjugated to either glycine (predominantly in humans) or taurine (mainly in mice). Transcriptomics data strikingly showed downregulation of Cyp7b1 in the <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice and the other biosynthesis enzymes also follow a similar trend (Figure S3c-e). Our RT-qPCR analyses substantiated that in comparison to DSS-treated wild type mice, DSS-treated <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic>mice expressed a reduced level of mRNAs encoding primary bile acid synthesis pathway enzymes Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, Cyp27a1 and Cyp7b1 in the liver (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, our data propose a new hypothesis that hepatic Rela and Stat3 instruct a gene program in the liver of colitogenic mice that supports the expression of mRNAs encoding primary BA metabolism enzymes.</p>

<title>Supplementing chenodeoxycholic acid restores colitogenic sensitivity of <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>Recent studies have highlighted the role of CA in potentiating intestinal damage by impairing Lgr5<sup>+</sup> intestinal stem cells. However, the role of CDCA in regulating intestinal inflammation in colitogenic mice remains unclear. Therefore we supplemented CDCA intraperitoneally daily for six days during DSS treatment in the wild type or <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice and scored the DAI (Figure S5a). The optimum concentration of CDCA was determined by performing a dose-response curve. Mere daily supplementation of CDCA at the concentration of 10 mg/kg of body weight, elevated the levels of CDCA in colon (Figure S5b) without inducing any colitogenic phenotype in either wild type or <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic>mice even after six days (Fig S5 c-e). Moreover, the DAI of wild type mice treated with both DSS and CDCA showed no change (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). On the other hand, CDCA supplementation of the DSS-treated <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic> mice showed DAI equivalent to wild type DSS-treated mice with concomitant supplementation of colon length shortening (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Histological analyses of DSS-treated colon sections further substantiated that CDCA supplementation together with DSS treatment was sufficient for imparting damage to the colonic crypts of the colitis-resistant <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic>mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>IBD are a heterogeneous group of chronic inflammatory intestinal disorders that are influenced by environmental cues, intestinal dysbiosis and the local immune responses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Chronic intestinal inflammation remodels the permeability barrier resulting in leakage of microbial components, including LPS, through the portal circulation thereby engaging extraintestinal organs such as the liver. The conventional treatment regimen for IBD involves aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and anti-TNF agents to counter bowel inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Systemic effects are only addressed upon worsening of symptoms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. To improve the clinical management of IBD, there is a need to identify targets and mechanisms that can concurrently address other associated causes. In this study, we reveal the surprising role of hepatic rela-stat3 in regulating the biosynthesis of primary bile acids, whose activation augments intestinal inflammation.</p>
<p>Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), one of the key components of microbial products, is known to induce inflammasome assembly by NF-κB/Lipocalin2-dependent axis in macrophages of colitogenic mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Similarly, LPS-mediated non-canonical Stat3 activation through TLR4 ligand reprograms metabolic and inflammatory pathways in macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In the acute DSS-induced colitis model, the release of LPS and other endotoxins would first activate kupffer cells of the liver, which then progressively triggers a response in relatively quiescent hepatocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. We argued that Stat3-NF-κB signalling may be of specific significance since these pathways in hepatocytes are known to control the secretion of hepatic factors. We indeed observed activation of the canonical arm of the NF-κB signalling pathway with RelA phosphorylation at Ser536 residue following DSS treatment. Interestingly, non-canonical Stat3 activation was detected with Ser727 phosphorylation preceding the phosphorylation of canonical Tyr705 residue. To understand the significance of these signalling pathways of hepatocytes in the context of disease outcomes and its functional consequence in disease management, we subjected the single and double hepatocyte-specific knockout mice to DSS treatment. Surprisingly, the <italic>rela<sup>Δhep</sup>stat3<sup>Δhep</sup></italic>mice had attenuated disease activity index as well as diminished inflammatory response in the gut. Previous studies wherein attenuation of colitogenic phenotype has been reported are for the gut-resident cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. This study is amongst the first such, where ablation of genes in a distal organ - the liver - ameliorates colitis.</p>
<p>We then investigated the mechanisms underlying signalling networks in the liver that promote the colitis phenotype. Previously, hepatic Rela and Stat3 have been reported to act cooperatively to render protection against pulmonary infection, by eliciting an acute phase response, which enhances the pulmonary immune response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. We observe similar hepatic functions of Rela and Stat3 that amplify the immune response during experimental colitis, aggravating intestinal pathologies. Our unbiased transcriptome analysis of the liver genes revealed several metabolic and immune pathways to be altered in colitogenic mice. Amongst these, the biosynthesis of primary BAs prompted our immediate attention. The primary bile acids are known to have inflammatory activity and the cardinal paradigm in IBD is the decreased levels of secondary bile acid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. This has been attributed to the altered gut microflora that are known to convert primary BAs into secondary BAs. It is important to note that most of these studies are carried out with fecal samples and a recent study that profiled the human intestinal environment under physiological conditions concluded that stool-based measurements do not reflect the true composition of BAs along the intestinal tracts. Intestinal samples were dominated by primary BAs, whereas stool samples were dominated by secondary BAs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We therefore measured the intestinal BAs in IBD subjects by using mucosal biopsies and observed elevated levels of primary BAs in the IBD subjects as compared to non-IBD subjects.</p>
<p>Analysis of colitogenic mice intestinal samples also revealed enhanced primary BAs using mass spectrometry-based measurements. We observe both CDCA and CA accumulate in the intestine and liver of colitogenic wild type mice when compared to knockout littermates. This accumulation of primary BA in both the intestine and liver is likely to be a consequence of increased biosynthesis in the liver and subsequent transport to the gut. Indeed, multiple primary bile synthesis pathway genes namely cyp7a1, cyp27a1, cyp7b1, and cyp8b1 were substantially upregulated in the liver. Our observation is contradictory to the recently published work by Gui et al which suggests that during IBD there is a downregulation of the biosynthesis machinery leading to reduced bile levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Currently, we assume that these differences may arise due to the dose of DSS, the time course of the experiment and the mice strain adapted for different studies leading to the difference in the transcriptional and metabolic landscape during IBD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> <sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Conventionally the cyp450 enzymes involved in the bile acid biosynthesis pathway are known to be regulated by the FXR signaling cascade <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Our data suggest that RelA and Stat3 transcriptionally control these pathways under stress conditions. These two transcription factors have been known to collaborate in a variety of physiological and disease settings. Further studies would elucidate a mechanistic understanding of how these hepatocyte-specific transcriptional regulatory circuitry drives hepatic bile synthesis during gastrointestinal abnormalities. Mutant mice showed refractory behavior towards colitogensis, where mere supplementation of CDCA resulted in exacerbated colitis phenotype in the gut. Previous studies of increased CA have been attributed to colitis and CA was shown to limit the self-renewal capacity of intestinal stem cells leading to impaired intestinal restitution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. We now propose that increased synthesis and secretion of the primary bile acids orchestrates intestinal inflammation. It is increasingly important to understand how bile acid signaling networks are affected in distinct organs where the bile acid composition differs, and how these networks impact intestinal diseases. Our studies identify a new, important Rela-Stat3 network system of hepatocytes that could enable the development of therapeutics that targets BA imbalance by suppressing host-specific stress-induced pathways.</p>
<p>Until now, only immunosuppressive agents and immunomodulators have been conventionally considered as therapeutic measures to manage IBD. However, with increasing research on the role of hepatic bile acid metabolism during experimental colitis, its potential cannot be undermined in the clinical setting. The potential of bile acids as a therapeutic target has been harnessed in the past; bile acid sequestrants have been utilized as a treatment for hyperlipidemia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Remedies like fecal microbial transplantation, which serve to normalize the bile acid ratios in the gut, are emerging as potential therapeutics in the last decade for IBD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. However, the potential of altering hepatic bile metabolism has remained unexplored for IBD, possibly due to a lack of mechanistic insight. Towards this, our work demonstrates the pro-inflammatory potential of CDCA during colitis following the activation of the Rela/Stat3 pathway. The suppression of Rela/Stat3-induced CDCA could provide beneficial effects in IBD patients while protecting the basal bile acid levels (through FXR signaling). Thus our studies identify a hepatocyte-specific rela/stat3 network as a potential therapeutic target for intestinal diseases. Another approach could be the use of bile acid sequestrants, which will temporarily decrease the levels of primary bile acids in the colon until the proinflammatory pathways are dampened as a combinatorial therapy alongside existing treatments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Singh and colleagues employ a methodic approach to reveal the function of the transcription factors Rela and Stat3 in the regulation of the inflammatory response in the intestine.</p>
<p>Strengths of the manuscript include the focus on the function of these transcription factors in hepatocytes and the discovery of their role in the systemic response to experimental colitis. While the systemic response to induce colitis is appreciated, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive such systemic response, especially those involving other organs beyond the intestine are an active area of research. As such, this study contributes to this conceptual advance. Additional strengths are the complementary biochemical and metabolomics approaches to describe the activation of these transcription factors in the liver and their requirement - specifically in hepatocytes - for the production of bile acids in response to colitis.</p>
<p>In this revised version, the authors have addressed previously raised questions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors try to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the intra-organ crosstalks that perpetuate intestinal permeability and inflammation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study identifies a hepatocyte-specific rela/stat3 network as a potential therapeutic target for intestinal diseases via the gut liver axis using both murine models and human samples.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The mechanism by which DSS administration induces the activation of the Rela and Stat3 pathways and subsequent modification of the bile acid pathway remains clear. As the authors state, intestinal bacteria are one candidate, and this needs to be clarified. I recommend the authors investigate whether gut sterilization by administration of antibiotics or germ free condition affects 1. the activation of the Rela and Stat3 pathway in the liver by DSS-treated WT mice and 2. the reduction of colitis in DSS-treated relaΔhepstat3Δhep mice.</p>
<p>(2) It has not been shown whether DSS administration causes an increase in primary bile acids, represented by CDCA, in the colon of WT mice following activation of the Rela and Stat3 pathways, as demonstrated in Figure 6.</p>
<p>(3) The implications of these results for IBD treatment, especially in what ways they may lead to therapeutic intervention, need to be discussed.</p>
<p>The above weakness points have been resolved by the revision and additional experiments.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This important study reveals the RelA/Stat3-dependent gene program in the liver influences intestinal homeostasis. The evidence supporting the conclusions is compelling, although some additional experiments will strengthen the study. The work will be of interest to scientists in gastrointestinal research fields.</p>
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors showed that activation of RelA and Stat3 in hepatocytes of DSS-treated mice induced CYPs and thereby produced primary bile acids, particularly CDCA, which exacerbated intestinal inflammation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study reveals the RelA/Stat3-dependent gene program in the liver influences intestinal homeostasis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: We thank the reviewer for the positive feedback and for appreciating the strength of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional evidence will strengthen the conclusion.</p>
<p>(1) In Fig. 1C, photos show that phosphorylation of RelA and Stat3 was induced in only a few hepatocytes. The authors conclude that activation of both RelA and Stat3 induces inflammatory pathways. Therefore, the authors should show that phosphorylation of RelA and Stat3 is induced in the same hepatocytes during DSS treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: The reviewers have raised a pertinent issue in Figure 1, as later on in our study we suggest that the combined activation of Rela and Stat3 is critical for aggravating the colitogenic phenotype in the murine model.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we have co-stained the fixed liver tissue of untreated and DSS-treated wild type mice with p-RelA (Ser536) and p-Stat3(Ser727) antibodies. Author response image 1 below shows the single staining for p-Rela (Ser536), pStat3 (Ser727), DAPI (to demarcate the nuclei) and merged image (p-Rela + pStat3).</p>
<fig id="sa3fig1">
<label>Author response image 1.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-93273-sa3-fig1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Further, the signal intensity of p-RelA (Ser536) and p-Stat3(Ser727) per nuclei was calculated and plotted as a box plot. It is evident that the median of p-Rela and p-Stat3 signal intensity in DSS-treated samples is more than that of the control samples, suggesting that the majority of the treated hepatocytes have the presence of both p-Rela and p-Stat3 in the nuclei.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig2">
<label>Author response image 2.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-93273-sa3-fig2.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Further, we calculate the number of nuclei in the DSS-treated samples which are above the 90th percentile of the control samples (data has been provided in Author response table 1 below). We also calculate the percentage overlap of p-Rela to p-Stat3 and vice versa in Author response table 1 below.</p>
<table-wrap id="sa3table1">
<label>Author response table 1.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-93273-sa3-table1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>Together our analysis concludes that indeed there is an activation of Rela and Stat3 in the same hepatocytes to generate the downstream effect that we observe in our study post-DSS treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In Fig. 5, the authors treated mice with CDCA intraperitoneally. In this experiment, the concentration of CDCA in the colon of CDCA-treated mice should be shown.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: We have experimentally examined if the CDCA supplemented intraperitoneally at the experimental dose used in our study, is reaching the colon or not. To quantify colonic CDCA we have performed targeted mass spectrometric studies and the data has been provided as a bar plot below.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig3">
<label>Author response image 3.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-93273-sa3-fig3.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>It is evident from the plot that the CDCA levels are significantly higher in mice supplemented with CDCA as compared to their corresponding control (where only the vehicle was supplemented). The data has been added to the supplementary section S5b and the main text has been modified accordingly.</p>

<p>Our reply: We express our gratitude to the reviewer for recognizing and appreciating the mechanistic insight provided by our work, and for considering it valuable in advancing conceptual understanding in the relevant field.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some weaknesses are noted in the presentation of the data, including a comprehensive representation of findings in all conditions and genotypes tested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: We thank the reviewer for the query and we have suitably modified the figures for a comprehensive representation of the findings, as described below:</p>
<p>● In Figure 2C, we have added the control alcian blue stained samples to clarify that there were no qualitative differences in the mucin levels observed in the <italic>relaΔhepstat3Δhep</italic> as compared to the wild type mice.</p>
<p>● We have also modified the figure 2D for a better presentation of the data.</p>
<p>● We have included histopathological analysis for the <italic>relaΔhepstat3Δhep</italic> mice in Figures S3a and S3b, following a format similar to the wild-type data previously provided as Figure S1a and S1b.</p>
<p>● For Figure 5C, the corresponding untreated samples with and without CDCA supplementation have been provided in the supplementary section Figure S5e.</p>
<p>● For Figure 2E, 3E, and 4C - the RT-qPCR data of the DSS-treated samples is plotted relative to their corresponding control samples, hence we only display two conditions in the bar plot. We have accordingly modified the figure legend for better clarity.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: We thank the reviewer for bringing up the aspect of gut microbiota in imparting colitis in our mice model. In accordance with reviewer's recommendation, we have sterilized the gut by administration of antibiotics, to evaluate if the intestinal bacteria are an important component leading to the activation of Rela and Stat3 pathway in the liver of DSS-treated WT mice or not.</p>
<p>(a) A brief schematic representation of the experimental design has been provided below and the detailed description of the methods has been described in supplementary methods.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig4">
<label>Author response image 4.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-93273-sa3-fig4.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Extract of liver tissues from mice treated with DSS for 6 days with/without prior antibiotic treatment were probed with p-Stat3 (Ser727) to examine the activation status of the hepatic Stat3 pathway. We observe that the signals for p-Stat3 (Ser727) are comparatively reduced post antibiotic treatment as evident from the blot below. p-Stat3 (Ser727) was a prominent activation signal at Day 6 DSS treatment that we have observed in Figure 1D,E.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig5">
<label>Author response image 5.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-93273-sa3-fig5.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>These studies suggest that the activation status of Stat3 activation is hampered by antibiotic treatment and considering that Rela and Stat3 have to coordinate activity, presumably the downstream activation will be modulated upon gut sterilization. However, it should be appreciated that a sterilized gut is not likely to be physiologically relevant and intestinal bacteria along with bile acid levels would modulate Rela/Stat3 pathways.</p>
<p>b) It is likely that the hepatic deficiency of Rela and Stat3 may have modified the gut microbiome in <italic>relaΔhepstat3Δhep</italic> mice because of the altered bile composition. Moreover, the gut microbiota is a key component that guides the outcome of colitis. Hence, future studies are important to examine the role of the gut microbiome in imparting resistance in <italic>relaΔhepstat3Δhep</italic> mice, to colitogenic insults.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) It has not been shown whether DSS administration causes an increase in primary bile acids, represented by CDCA, in the colon of WT mice following activation of the Rela and Stat3 pathways, as demonstrated in Figure 6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: In order to address the query, we would kindly like to request the reviewers to look at figure 4B where we show an increase in the CDCA levels of the colonic tissue, which is corresponding to our CDCA levels in the liver tissue (figure 4A) thus indicating that it may be driven by the hepatic Rela and Stat3 pathways.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The implications of these results for IBD treatment, especially in what ways they may lead to therapeutic intervention, need to be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: We are grateful to the reviewer for bringing this topic for discussion.</p>
<p>Until now, only immunosuppressive agents and immunomodulators have been conventionally considered as therapeutic measures to manage IBD. However, with increasing research on the role of hepatic bile acid metabolism during experimental colitis, its potential cannot be undermined in the clinical setting. The potential of bile acids as a therapeutic target has been harnessed in the past; bile acid sequestrants have been utilized as a treatment for hyperlipidemia <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/vvNFBD/Mzk0">46</ext-link>. Remedies like fecal microbial transplantation, which serve to normalize the bile acid ratios in the gut, are emerging as potential therapeutics in the last decade for IBD <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/vvNFBD/YYBj">47</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/vvNFBD/A25ai">40</ext-link>. However, the potential of altering hepatic bile metabolism has remained unexplored for IBD, possibly due to a lack of mechanistic insight. Towards this, our work demonstrates the pro-inflammatory potential of CDCA during colitis following the activation of the Rela/Stat3 pathway. The suppression of Rela/Stat3-induced CDCA could provide beneficial effects in IBD patients while protecting the basal bile acid levels (through FXR signaling). Thus our studies identify a hepatocyte-specific rela/stat3 network as a potential therapeutic target for intestinal diseases. Another approach could be the use of bile acid sequestrants, which will temporarily decrease the levels of primary bile acids in the colon until the proinflammatory pathways are dampened as a combinatorial therapy alongside existing treatments.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Minor:</p>

<p>Our reply: We have swapped Fig. 4C and Fig. 4D and corresponding changes have been incorporated in the main text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Please make note of the following specific comments</p>
<p>The immunostainings for phosphorylated p-Rela and STAT3 are unclear. Is there nuclear translocation of these phosphorylated transcription factors? Can the authors enumerate the percentage of cells in which nuclear translocation (presumably in hepatocytes) is detected?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: We apologize that immunostainings for phosphorylated p-Rela and STAT3 are unclear to the reviewers. Here we have tried our best to make the data clear by analyzing the stained section and plotting them.</p>
<p>To start with, we have co-stained the fixed liver tissue of untreated and DSS-treated wild type mice with p-RelA (Ser536) and p-Stat3(Ser727) antibodies, below we have provided a representative image used for analysis. To demarcate the nuclear boundary of the hepatocytes DAPI was used and the signal intensity for p-RelA (Ser536) and p-Stat3(Ser727) was quantified using ZenBlue software.</p>
<fig id="sa3fig6">
<label>Author response image 6.</label>

<p>Below we have provided the box plot for the calculated nuclear intensities in the control (untreated) and DSS-treated samples for p-Rela and p-Stat3. We can clearly see that the median of p-Rela and p-Stat3 signal intensity in DSS-treated samples is more than that of the control samples, suggesting that the majority of the treated hepatocytes have the translocation of p-Rela and p-Stat3 in their nuclei.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For Figure 3C, can the authors indicate in the figure itself which bile acid is being represented (not only in the Figure legend)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: Thank you for the suggestion we have indicated the respective bile acid in Figure 3C for better understanding.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As these data are from untargeted metabolomics, were other bile acids detected?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: This is a part of a separate study conducted by our collaborator, and will form a part of a new manuscript which will be focussed on human studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can the authors validate the downregulation of key enzymes shown in Figure 3D, E at the protein level?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: We agree with the reviewer’s comment, that mRNA levels are not critical determinants of activation of any pathway, rather an indicator of probable activation. In that scenario, the estimation of protein levels is more determinative. But taking into consideration that we have the metabolomic data in subsequent figures (as in Figure 4 A, B) supporting our findings in Figure 3D, E, this makes RT-qPCR data a more robust indicator of an activated hepatic bile acid biosynthesis machinery.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The figure legends for Figures 4C and D are flipped. Please correct.</p>

<p>Figure S4 includes a dataset (qPCR for Mmp3) that is not described. Neither Figure S4 nor S5 are described in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: Thank you for the query, firstly we have already added Figure S4 and S5 to the text, our apologies that it has not been properly highlighted.</p>
<p>Secondly, the data for RT-qPCR for Mmp3 has been removed from supplementary figures as it may not be very relevant to the study.</p>

<p>Overall, the manuscript should be edited to ensure the correct use of English. Please also note that the last name of the first author seems to be missing in the main text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: Thank you for the suggestion we have re-checked the manuscript for the probable errors and rectified them. The first author has a single name (with no surname) and we would like to correct that during the final print of the manuscript.</p>

<p>(1) The authors need to show if DSS treatment affects the serological or histological changes in the liver of relaΔhepstat3Δhep mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: To address that, we have analyzed key serological markers of liver damage as well as looked into tissue histology.</p>
<p>The pathophysiological parameters of the liver of DSS treated <italic>relaΔhepstat3Δhep</italic> mice has been added to the revised manuscript as figure S3a and S3b. Here we show that the serological parameters are within the physiological range upon DSS treatment (Author response image 9a). Besides, the histological parameters remain unaltered as compared to the control tissue (Author response image 9b).</p>
<p>Cumulatively, both at the tissue level and functional level, there is not much effect of DSS</p>
<p>treatment on liver of <italic>relaΔhepstat3Δhep</italic> mice.</p>

<p>(2) It is recommended to use a second model to verify if this phenomenon is applicable to colitic status in general.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our reply: We appreciate the query put forward, this is an ongoing study and we hope to examine further the role of hepatic RelA and Stat3 in TNBS-induced colitis model and in T cell transfer model of colitis.</p>
